now global. The time you spend now in gaining 
a good degree, in nurturing your talents and 
building a distinctive personal profile, can make 
the difference in how far you  
achieve the life you want.
Shaping your future
•• What would ‘success’ look like for you – as a student, in life and in your future career?
•• What skills, experience and personal qualities would you need in order to achieve such success?
•• Why do personal development and forward planning matter for your career prospects?

Introduction

Getting started: initial steps
Step in the process
Rationale
Read Getting started: the 
foundations (page 3)
This provides you with some general tips for getting the most 
from personal development planning (PDP) and from this book.
▼
▼
Find out what is meant by 
personal development planning 
(pages 4–6)
This looks at why personal development planning is considered 
so important in higher education, and its relevance to your own 
life.
▼
▼
Consider the challenges
(pages 8–9)
PDP doesn’t tend to happen spontaneously, as we can see from 
the students’ experiences on pages 8–9. Give thought to where 
the challenges would lie for you – so you can address them.
▼
▼
Identify the benefits
(pages 10–11)
Typically, we tend to put off PDP and need to motivate 
ourselves to give it the time it deserves. This can be helped by 
identifying the personal benefits.
▼
▼
Do I need personal development 
planning? (page 12)
Complete the self-evaluation on page 12 as a means of 
beginning to identify your development needs.
▼
▼
Identify your priorities
(pages 13–15)
Complete the self-evaluation on pages 13–15, to tease out in 
more detail your PDP priorities.
▼
▼
Make use of opportunities
(pages 16–17)
Give active consideration to what opportunities are available to 
you, which you can make use of, and what you could create for 
yourself.
▼
▼
Develop a sense of how it all fits 
together
(pages 18–23)
Read pages 18–23 to develop your understanding of how the 
different aspects of personal development planning fit together, 
the skills you will need, and what you can gain from the 
different chapters in this book.
▼
▼
Select, reflect and list
Choose one or more key priorities for yourself. Decide what the 
first steps are for taking these forward. Make a detailed ‘To do’ 
list of these.
▼
▼
Plan into a diary
Use your diary, calendar or planner to map out when, exactly, 
you will undertake the first few actions.

Skills for Success

1	 Give it time
Be prepared to give yourself the time you 
need to investigate, reflect upon and evaluate 
yourself, your studies and your future.
2	 Engage
Bring the right mindset: be prepared to think, 
plan and act now for outcomes that might be 
many years away. In practice this means such 
things as:
•• Taking responsibility for your future: it is 
up to you to think things through and take 
action
•• Engaging with the seven aspects of the 
process listed on page 1
•• Finding out as much as you can about your 
options
•• Making decisions to give a focus to your 
planning and actions
•• Using the tools available, such as the self-
evaluation questionnaires, reflections and 
other activities in this book
•• Monitoring your progress and keeping 
yourself on track
•• Keeping updated records to demonstrate 
your skills and experience.
3	 Experiment
Bring thought and self-awareness to the 
process:
•• Have a go at using resources, strategies, 
models and activities that are available in the 
book and through your college or workplace.
•• Combine and adapt these to suit you.
•• Find out what works best for your 
circumstances and ways of thinking.
4	 Select and personalise
•• Identify chapters and sections relevant to you.
•• Use these in the order that best suits you.
•• Notice whether you resist undertaking 
particular activities. Such resistance can be a 
good indicator that you need those most.
5	 Reflect
Find a light notebook or set up a file or folder on a 
portable device, for use as a ‘reflective journal’. If you 
prefer, use a diary, log, blog, ‘ideas book’ or portfolio, 
or use the e-resource bank that accompanies this text.
Use your reflective journal to:
•• complete reflective activities from the book
•• capture your insights and inspiration
•• develop your initial thoughts in more detail
•• consider your attitudes, feelings and behaviours, 
and the implications of these for you and others
•• identify helpful and unhelpful responses to events
•• look back over earlier entries and consider how your 
perspective changes over time
•• generally think things through.
Giving attention to your experiences in such 
ways helps to clarify your thinking and 
understanding. Put time aside regularly to make 
entries in your journal and to look back over 
previous entries.

Introduction

Personal development planning: what is it?
About you
Above all else, personal development planning (PDP) is about you. It 
is about your studies, your life, values, career and future. It is about 
thinking ahead so that you take the most appropriate steps now in 
order to give yourself the best range of choices in the future.
A reflective process
We change as we go through a course of study and gain new 
experiences, so reflection needs to be a continual process rather than 
a one-off event.
The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for higher education in Britain 
advocated that PDP be made available for all students at every level. 
It described PDP as:
Structured and supported processes to develop the capacity of 
individuals to reflect upon their learning and achievement, and to 
plan for their own personal education and development. (QAA, 
2000)
A creative process …
PDP is a creative process, requiring time, curiosity, enquiry, toying 
with ideas, looking for inspiration, taking risks, learning new skills, 
building strengths, trial and error, discussion, false starts, rethinking, 
and even soul searching. The more you put in, the more you get 
out.
Developing self-awareness
Self-knowledge is invaluable. It may seem rather self-indulgent, 
and even unnecessary, to put time aside to think about ourselves. 
However, our happiness, contentment and sense of fulfilment is 
often dependent upon such introspection. To plan ahead effectively, 
it makes sense to give thought to some of the bigger questions that 
affect our lives, especially those that we might take for granted, such 
as:
•• what kind of life we are leading now
•• where we are heading
•• how we became the person we are today – and how far that 
reflects the person we are becoming or would want to be.
Self-awareness can help us in myriad ways, such as making decisions 
about:
•• study and work
•• how to use our time now
•• which opportunities to pursue
•• finding ways of coping with stress or organising everyday life
•• managing relationships in life and at work.
A journey of 
exploration and 
discovery
PDP involves finding 
out about …
•• yourself, your likes, dislikes, 
ambitions, goals, values, 
motivations and uncertainties
•• what you thought you might 
want from life – and where 
your interests might be 
changing
•• the range of jobs and life 
options open to you
•• what these are really like and 
would entail
•• what you need to do to 
achieve these opportunities
•• what others have 
experienced and would 
advise.
It also involves:
•• drawing useful lessons as you 
go along
•• unexpected self-discoveries.

Skills for Success

Personal development planning: what is it?
Being open to  
possibilities
•• Recognising possibilities
•• Seizing opportunities that arise
•• Creating opportunities for yourself
•• Trying out new things
•• Taking the trouble to ask
•• Thinking short, medium and longer term
•• Being flexible, adaptable and resilient in the face of 
changing circumstances.
Decision-making and risk management
Whatever decisions we make, day by day as well as 
longer term, have consequences. Ideally, we will be 
pleased with the decisions we make, but inevitably we 
will make mistakes, miss chances, make life harder than 
it need be. The full impact of our decisions won’t be 
evident for many years.
Although we can’t avoid mistakes completely, we can 
take steps to reduce these. That is a key function of the 
process of PDP. It gives us space to:
•• pause to evaluate past choices and their 
outcomes
•• use more structured approaches to 
thinking things through
•• weigh up costs and benefits in the light of 
experience and valid criteria
•• estimate the value of opportunities that 
arise, and choose between these
•• manage the risks sensibly.
Mindfulness and just ‘being’
Most of us spend 
the majority of our 
time distracted 
by such things as 
work, social life, 
entertainment and 
almost anything 
else apart from just 
sitting quietly with 
ourselves.
Whilst PDP involves 
an active process of 
reflection, it also benefits 
from quiet time where we don’t chase after 
answers and information. Being still and 
quiet creates a space where different kinds 
of thoughts can emerge. These can give us 
unexpected insights into ourselves and our 
situation.
Taking charge of your own 
destiny
Nobody is going to be as interested in what 
happens to you as yourself. Ultimately, it is 
down to you to make things happen. That 
can seem daunting, so it is useful to have a 
process that helps you to think through the 
issues. PDP can help to:
•• structure your thinking
•• understand the terrain better
•• generate information relevant to you, upon 
which you can draw to make decisions and 
take action
•• help you find direction.

Introduction

Personal development: what students say
My promotion – and my att itude!
I thought ‘personal development 
planning’ was a bit of a mouthful, so 
I just ignored it. That is a bit of a 
habit with me. Then, when I went 
for promotion at work, they asked 
me about my ‘commitment’ to my 
personal and professional development. I couldn’t 
think of what to say. I even forgot to mention I was 
doing a qualification at university. I hadn’t thought 
about how I was already using what I learnt at Uni in 
my job. My careers adviser has helped me to think 
about how to plan and prepare for promotion. He 
asked me whether my general attitude to things 
that sound complicated or difficult was helpful – 
which it obviously isn’t … so I’m working on it!
Start early – or miss the chance
My tutor said: ‘It really is up to 
you. Plan now for your future.’ I 
thought ‘OK – soon’ and did nothing 
about it. Now I am in my final year, 
applying for jobs like everyone else 
… and I see why I should have 
started preparing earlier. I feel I have wasted a lot 
of time so I am trying to catch up quickly. The jobs 
I am most interested in are overseas. If I had 
realised this earlier, I would have started to learn 
another language. I could have done that using my 
electives for three years …
On the right course?
I wasn’t sure what ‘PDP’ was and 
it seemed a bit of a distraction 
from my study. Anyway, we had 
to do some careers sessions as 
part of a skills module in the 
first term. I went to talk to a 
careers adviser and found out that I was doing the 
wrong course for the jobs I want. So that was a bit 
of a wake-up call … Luckily, I was able to negotiate a 
change of study units. It was hard work catching up 
but if I pass these units, I can transfer next year 
to the course I need. It was scary how close I came 
to wasting three years of study.
A return on my investment
I have a huge loan for my 
study so I want a good job, a 
well paid job … I told my 
personal tutor and she told 
me to make sure my CV looks 
outstanding and to put in 
more study hours so I get a good degree – 
both count. Basically, you have to think how 
you will look well-rounded and interesting to 
employers many years from now. So, I have 
really gone for it, like it is a full time job. One 
thing is ... I do a lot of organising of events 
and entertainment for senior citizens, and 
fund-raising for it as well. It takes up a lot of 
time but actually is quite a lot of fun and you 
learn a lot about managing events, marketing, 
and persuading people to get involved – I 
found out so much I wouldn’t have picked up 
just by studying. I am more confident about 
getting on with people. I have also changed a 
lot. I do think I will have a lot of good 
experience to talk about when I apply for 
jobs.
It’s study fi rst for me
To be honest, I only wanted a 
degree so I could get a 
better job. I picked up very 
quickly that you have to build 
your personal profile from 
day 1. I did this by getting 
involved with the student union. I became a 
course ‘rep’ and got a lot of training for this. I 
do rowing, I do ‘Global Studies’ so I can talk 
about more than just my course (psychology). 
I competed in an enterprise prize … I helped a 
project on science for school kids … I can 
pretty much tick every box. The career I 
want, it is hard to get in without a really good 
degree. I am not all that strong academically 
so I am trying to pick up as much as I can 
about good study skills so I get better grades.

Making the right choices: what graduates say
Least wanted, most valued
The last thing I ever really wanted to do was 
open the PDP file (which I had labelled ‘Me’). I 
didn’t want to think about my career or waste 
time ‘navel gazing’. I didn’t want to think about 
‘work’. I didn’t want to ‘reflect’ either. If my 
tutors hadn’t made this a compulsory part of 
the course so I couldn’t escape it, I am sure I 
would never have bothered.
Looking back, I think this was because, even 
though I was studying a professional course 
in petrology, I didn’t have any idea what I 
really wanted to do after Uni. But then one 
day (maybe I had been reflecting!) it struck me 
that it was ridiculous to feel it wasn’t worth 
spending time thinking about myself and my 
life so I started to take it more seriously.
The careers and PDP sessions got me doing 
things to put into my CV, and just looking at life 
differently. They were probably the most useful 
part of the course because without them, I 
doubt I would have got a place on the graduate 
programme that led to my first job.
Rahan, Operations Manager, SME.
Gaining breadth of skills and 
knowledge
I was lucky because the year I started my 
engineering degree in the States, they gave 
us the option of combining this with business 
and professional studies. I took that option and 
it was the best decision. It was exactly what 
this company was looking for so it landed me 
my first job and then, eventually, this line of 
work. I think it’s great when graduates can 
think beyond just one subject and can converse 
intelligently with colleagues from all fields.
Brett, Senior Recruitment Officer,  
large international company.
Checking out the ‘dream’ …
All the way through school, I thought I was 
going to do a medical degree. I had a rather 
exalted view of what I thought that meant. 
When I found out more about the job, I 
couldn’t see me living that kind of life. I am 
not good without sleep; when I realised that 
I would have to live for many years on 100-
hour working weeks and constantly interrupted 
sleep, that put me off. I could see myself as a 
consultant, but not as a junior doctor. I didn’t 
know then what I would do – but I was glad I 
found out early in my degree and could change 
my career path. I didn’t at that point think that 
the volunteering work I did as a student would 
lead to a good career in the Voluntary sector.
Henry, CEO, voluntary sector.
Challenge fixed career views
I already had a job working as a children’s 
care assistant. I thought, as I was a mother, 
and knew about children and had experience 
in that line of work, that was my life planned 
out. That was why I didn’t go to any careers 
sessions in the first two years – I was sure it 
would be pointless. Then we studied juvenile 
offending and I started to become interested 
in that, especially the legal aspects. I gradually 
became interested in being a lawyer. This 
spurred me to study harder so I could get onto 
a post-graduate course. Now that I am a lawyer, 
professional development is an essential part of 
my job.
Sofia, family lawyer.

Introduction

The challenges of personal development planning
Focusing on your own development should be of evident value and interest, but it is all too easy to put 
it to one side and hope that it will take care of itself. There are lots of good reasons why that is the case, 
some of which are listed below. Take a look through the following approaches and decide which are true 
of you 
.
■ 1	 I am not clear what it is 
Personal development planning, or PDP, can 
sound rather vague or abstract. Like many 
things, it gets easier with practice and 
familiarity. It is worth noting that for many 
job applications, you will be asked to 
demonstrate commitment to ongoing personal 
development. This also forms part of your 
annual appraisal in most jobs.
■ 3	 I am too busy 
There can be many demands on our time which 
appear more urgent to deal with right now. 
Even with good intentions, it is easy to keep 
putting off the moment for thinking about 
your future. If this is true of you, schedule 
time into your planner at least once a month 
where you focus just on you, and your future.
■ 2	 It’s too early for me to think  
about it 
It can seem as if the end of college is a long 
way off, and that career planning can wait 
until your final year, or even until after you 
have finished your course. It may feel very 
difficult to imagine what you would want to do 
in several years’ time. The more true this is of 
you, the more you are likely to benefit from a 
few visits to the Careers Service as soon as 
possible.
■ 4	 I don’t’ need it 
If you are already in a 
profession or on a particular 
career route, it may feel 
unnecessary to think about 
planning how to advance on 
your chosen career path, or 
to consider other possible careers. However, 
be wary of focusing too much on a single 
career route without investigating other 
options. You might find there is something 
that suits you much better.
The future can wait
No time just now!
I already know exactly 
what I want to do …
What on earth 
is it?

The challenges of personal development planning
■ 5	 Why bother 
before I make 
my mind up? 
If we don’t have a clear direction, it can 
seem pointless, or even difficult, to think 
about the future. However, personal planning 
is about much more than simply heading 
down a single career path. It is more of a 
journey of discovery and about opening up 
possibilities for yourself. See page 4.
■ 6	 I can rush through it at some point 
Personal planning can sound like the easy 
option that can be put aside whilst you focus 
on your ‘real’ work. However, personal 
planning is about making time to think about 
you and your likely journey through life. It 
merits time. The more that people put into 
the process, the more they tend to value it.
■ 7	 I don’t know where to start – so I don’t 
It can feel hard to get started. Generally, people find that 
once they engage with the process, it gets easier. However, if 
you put off thinking about your future because you don’t have 
an obvious starting point, rest assured that you are not alone. 
There doesn’t have to be a ‘right place’ to start. Working 
through this chapter gives you some options.
Reflection: 
Attitude to 
personal planning
•• How, if at all, do these 
scenarios match your own 
ways of thinking about 
personal planning?
•• Where do the challenges lie 
for you in doing this well?
I have no idea what I want 
to do in the future
It’s all basic stuff. Don’t need to 
worry about that now.
Where do I begin?

Personal development planning (PDP) as a student
More than just a degree 
When students complete their qualification, they usually 
have a good understanding of their subject discipline 
and have developed skills associated with their course of 
academic study. This is good, but is only part of the story.
Being at university or college provides opportunities to 
mix with a wide range of people, to take part in new 
activities, to manage positions of responsibility and to 
broaden your outlook. Most of these opportunities lie 
outside of the taught curriculum although, increasingly, 
programmes are being designed to include personal 
and professional development. Students are being 
encouraged to adopt a broad-based approach to their 
time as a student and to use their time and the curriculum 
imaginatively. 
Why is PDP actively encouraged for 
students? 
The kinds of jobs that most graduates want to enter 
require a range of qualities and skills that take time, 
support and good planning to develop. These include 
people skills, problem-solving, project work and self-
management. Such skills cannot be suddenly acquired 
in isolation or at the last minute. In the past, many 
graduates felt disappointed that they were not better 
prepared for when they left university. It has now been 
recognised that students need structured opportunities 
to think about, and plan 
towards, their future.
Can you really plan 
for the future?
Whist you can’t control the 
future – the unexpected will 
happen – you can prepare for 
likely eventualities and plan 
for your own development. 
This enables you to be more 
in charge of your own life 
and to create opportunities.
Preparing for graduate jobs
Typically, students regard their degree 
and other qualifications as a passport to a 
better job – especially to a graduate job, for 
which a degree is essential. For some, this 
means obtaining the best possible salary 
or opportunities for a first job. For others, 
it means gaining promotions or other 
advancement in their current professions 
or workplace, even whilst they are still 
studying. Some students create their own 
jobs, setting up their own businesses.
Whichever route applies to you, PDP 
is about preparing now towards the 
employment you will want in the future. 
That covers a range of preparatory thinking, 
planning, decision-making, practice and 
record-keeping.
Achieving well academically
Usually, students want to gain the best 
possible academic outcomes for their 
time as a student. This is for their own 
satisfaction, and because employers often 
require a particular degree classification.
The process of personal development 
helps you to understand 
more about what hinders or 
enhances your performance. 
This is relevant to academic 
performance as well as 
to performance in the 
workplace or other spheres 
of life. Some of the benefits 
of PDP for academic study 
are listed opposite.

The benefits of PDP
When undertaken in supported and structured 
ways, PDP gives you a much deeper 
understanding of your performance. You 
develop abilities in evaluating this for yourself. 
Instead of being locked into a routine 
learning cycle, you enter into an 
upwards learning spiral. PDP puts you 
in charge. 
Read through the potential 
benefits of PDP listed below. 
 Tick any of these that you 
consider would be of relevance to you.
1	 Benefits of PDP to academic performance
The potential benefits of PDP for my studies are:
■
■a clearer focus for my academic work
■
■more control over personal motivation – and 
the ability to direct this to achieve my goals
■
■skills in self-management
■
■greater independence and confidence 
through gaining a better understanding of 
how to improve my performance
■
■more enjoyment and less stress from my 
academic studies as I become consciously 
skilled
■
■greater awareness of how to apply what I 
have learnt to new problems and contexts 
■
■reflective, strategic, analytical and creative 
thinking skills that strengthen academic 
performance.
PDP can have a positive impact on your 
academic achievement, especially when 
combined with attention to study skills relevant 
to higher education. These are addressed in 
detail in companion volumes such as The Study 
Skills Handbook, 4th edn (2013) and Critical 
Thinking Skills (2011).
2	 Benefits of PDP to professional life

■a better sense of the life and work I want
■
■more confidence in the choices I make
■
■confidence in the skills, qualities and attributes I 
bring to the career of my choice
■
■being in a better position to compete for jobs 
and to discuss my skills with employers
■
■the positive attitudes, creative thinking, and 
problem-solving approaches associated with 
successful professional life. 
3	 Benefits of PDP to personal life
The potential benefits of PDP for personal life are:
■
■gaining a better understanding of myself and 
how I ‘tick’
■
■being in a better position to make appropriate 
choices to meet my aspirations
■
■gaining a better sense of myself as an individual
■
■greater awareness of my needs and how to 
meet these

Add up your score out of 100. Total score ____
Although this is only a rough guide, you now have a personal development ‘needs’ score. If this is less 
than 100, then you would benefit from some personal development. The lower your score, the more 
likely it is that you need to undertake personal development. Even if you do not need any personal 
development today, this is likely to change within a few months or even weeks, as your circumstances 
change.

How it fits together: skills for success
Academic and career skills
Typically, universities and colleges identify specific sets of 
skills and attributes that they expect students to develop 
throughout their course. Employers also tend to provide 
lists of skills and attributes as part of their job descriptions 
and person specifications. Higher education institutions 
(HEIs) generally look for ways of building into their 
courses the means of developing skills that are relevant to 
employment as well as to study.
Once drawn together, the skills, qualities, attributes and 
experiences required of students and graduates can 
appear to be a long and rather daunting list. As different 
vocabulary is used on different lists, it can also be confusing.
The APT-S framework
Specialist and technical skills aside, skills can generally 
be conceptualised more simply and clearly into just four 
organising categories. The APT-S Framework (Cottrell, 
2013) organises skills into 4 categories which are relatively 
easy to manage and remember:
Academic  People  Task  Self
Academic skills such as critical 
thinking and problem-solving and task 
management, skills such as undertaking 
research projects are more readily 
recognisable as necessary for students. 
However, in recent years, the people skills 
required for working with others have 
also become recognised as important 
to student success. It is increasingly 
recognised that skills in self-management 
are essential and underpin most other 
skills.
Together these four sets of skills enable 
you to manage the various complexities 
and challenges of:
•• the learning environment, whether at 
college, university, the workplace or in 
other learning contexts
•• your past experience and its impact on 
your current thinking and skills
•• your future aims, and what this means 
for where you need to focus now.

How it fits together: skills for success
The categories of skills used for the APT-S 
framework are also applicable to work and most 
other areas of life.
The four categories in the framework are those 
most relevant to the academic world of the 
student. If you have been a student, it is likely that 
you will continue to bring an academic dimension 
to the way you approach tasks and situations in 
the future.
Although the skills you use in the workplace may 
be very similar, the language used to describe 
these may vary outside of academia. For example, 
you could also come across the following terms:
•• Academic: Intellectual; cognitive; metacognitive
•• People: Interpersonal; social
•• Task: Operational; organisational
•• Self: Intrapersonal.
Most students will need skills in each of the four 
categories both as a student and in employment 
– although the specific skills required for each 
category may vary depending on your chosen field 
of study or work. This means that:
•• there is value in developing all four skills areas
•• it is a good idea to find out more about the 
kinds of academic, people, task-management 
and self-management skills relevant to your field 
and intended career path.
Skills are mutually reinforcing
You will find that, in developing skills in any one 
category, you usually draw upon or develop 
skills in one or more of the other categories. It is 
important to note the range of skills that you are 
developing across the various activities that you 
undertake. Sometimes, it is less evident than at 
other times, just how many skills you are honing 
on a given task.

Introduction

How it fits together: self-management skills
Overall structure
The book is divided into four main sections or 
Parts, with additional introductory and closing 
sections and a Resource Bank. Parts 1–3 organise 
material into the 4 skills areas identified within the 
APT-S framework.
•• Self-management
•• Managing People and Tasks
•• Thinking skills (Academic skills).
The final section draws these skills together and 
applies them to the particular task of career 
planning.
Below, there is a synopsis of each section and 
chapter, to guide you through the book and to 
help you to select where to focus.
Self-management
We are the key to our own successes – and we are 
often our own greatest enemies. If we can take 
charge of our own mental processes, behaviours 
and emotions, we can accomplish a great deal. 
To do so, though, we usually need to become 
much more self-aware. That means drilling down 
to find out more about what really goes on in 
our own minds, why we hold the beliefs that 
we do, why we value certain things over others, 
why we sometimes sabotage our own goals. The 
first four chapters look at different aspects of self-
management.
Understanding ‘success’
Chapter 1 takes as its starting place 
the notion that all students want to 
experience success – even if they have 
different notions of what success might 
look like. Most make sacrifices to put 
themselves through college or university, 
and expect a better future as a result. 
However, many students are very vague 
about what they want and how to plan 
for the future. It is not the end of the 
world to leave university and still not 
know what you want from life. You may 
never answer that question fully.
However, it is useful to start to clarify your thinking 
so that you bring more control to the choices 
that you make, and keep a wide range of relevant 
opportunities open to you. Chapter 1 helps you 
consider questions such as:
•• What does success mean to you?
•• What motivates you?
•• What are your ambitions, goals, values?
•• Who or what inspires you?
•• What kind of life do you want to find yourself 
living 10 or 20 years from now – and what 
would be your worst nightmare?
Making sense of experience
Chapter 2 encourages you to look in detail at you 
– and what helps you to achieve. Use Chapter 2 to 
gain different perspectives on:
•• Your life story so far and the role you play in 
your own story
•• How you may be perceived by others
•• How you respond to opportunity and adversity
•• The impact of your learning history on your 
current performance
•• Where your expertise lies – and how that could 
be applied to new contexts.
I know people see me as intimidating but I am 
about more than pest control.  My real strength 
is working with textiles.

Skills for Success

How it fits together: managing people and tasks
Understanding personal performance
We are each distinct in what helps or hinders us 
to perform at our best. In Chapter 3, you have the 
opportunity to:
•• analyse in depth the conditions that have most 
impact on your performance
•• identify your ‘personal performance formula’
•• identify the optimum conditions for you when 
undertaking different kinds of task.
Taking charge
Success begins with knowing and managing 
yourself. Whilst the first three chapters focus on 
knowing yourself, Chapter 4 looks at successful 
‘self-management’. Use this chapter to increase 
chances of personal success by improving:
•• your emotional self-management
•• your time management
•• your ‘emotional intelligence’
•• your attitudes
•• how you manage change and uncertainty.
Managing people and tasks
Interpersonal and organisational skills can make 
study more interesting, more enjoyable, and less 
stressful. These skills are also very much in demand 
from employers – and they will be essential if you 
intend to take on a leadership and management 
role or to become an employer in your own right. 
The two chapters in Part 2 focus on these skills and 
provide tools for developing them.
People skills
How good are your ‘people skills’? Good people 
skills mean that teams work better, and that 
individuals gain the consideration and support 
that they need. People skills create more effective 
and manageable work environments, which is why 
employers place such a high value upon them. Use 
Chapter 5 to consider ways of developing your 
people skills. It addresses such issues as:
•• developing rapport
•• listening skills
•• team work
•• assertiveness and negotiation skills
•• leadership
•• giving and receiving constructive criticism.
Managing tasks
Good problem-solving strategies will enable 
you to take on almost any task and will greatly 
increase personal confidence when you enter new 
situations. Use Chapter 6 to:
•• organise time and tasks effectively
•• learn basic problem-solving strategies
•• select and apply problem-
solving strategies to 
more complex tasks and 
problems
•• develop planning skills, 
such as identifying 
priorities, setting targets 
and finding good 
solutions
•• learn skills useful to 
project management
•• gain familiarity with 
concepts such as 
performance indicators 
and benchmarking
•• audit your personal 
‘competitiveness’.
How do I manage people? Usually my 
presence is enough but sometimes I 
roar and if all else fails … I eat them.

Introduction

How it fits together: thinking skills; employability
Extend your thinking
Part 3 looks at two sets of thinking skills, 
creative and reflective, that are becoming ever 
more valued both for academic study and for 
employment. These are also skills with which 
many students and employees struggle.
Creative thinking
Many people doubt their own creativity, thinking 
that this is just for artists and performers. 
Creativity is essential to problem-solving and 
task completion: it is the ‘spark of creativity’ that 
brings the right idea to mind at the right time. 
Chapter 7, ‘Thinking outside of the box’, looks 
at ways of nurturing creative thinking skills. Use 
Chapter 7 to:
•• develop confidence in your creative abilities
•• harness a basic knowledge of how the mind 
works so that you can develop your thinking 
skills further
•• try out a range of activities to hone your 
creative thinking.
Reflection
Many professions now require their employees 
to adopt a reflective practitioner approach. Your 
course tutors may also require you to reflect upon 
your performance. But what is ‘reflection’? How 
do you go about it? How do you write about it?
As you work through the book, you will find 
many opportunities for structured reflection. 
Chapter 8, ‘The art of reflection’, outlines 
different methods and approaches, along with 
guidance on the kinds of structured reflection 
typically required for marked assignments in 
higher education. Browse these and select those 
methods that suit you and your course.
Enhancing your career prospects
Surveys of students show that their main 
objectives for pursuing higher education are 
associated with finding a graduate job or 
improving their work prospects. This may 
include:
•• enhancing their career through promotion at 
work
•• gaining greater job satisfaction and expertise in 
their existing employment
•• moving to a better job elsewhere
•• embarking on their first substantial job – as a first 
step on the career ladder
•• gaining more experience of employment through 
internships or a graduate scheme.
The skills developed throughout the book are 
those especially associated with graduate careers. 
The following chapters consider the issue of 
‘employability’ from the perspective of both 
employers and students.
Employability
The process of gaining a job can seem rather 
mysterious. When there is a lot of competition for 
work, as is usually the case for good graduate jobs 
and placements, it can be hard to find a job without 
experience, and hard to find a job to gain such 
experience. Even if you have been in employment 
for some time, it is not always obvious how to go 
about getting a better job.
Chapter 9 looks at what is meant by ‘employability’ 
from the perspective of employers, and what they 
are looking for when they take on new employees. 
The chapter provides an introduction to the labour 
market and provides suggestions of activities that 
can help you to make sense of segments of the 
labour market relevant to you. It looks at differences 
between large employers and SMEs, and at changes 
in skills needs over time. It also looks at self-
employment as a potential option.
But I am a really  
good swimmer!
22
Skills for Success

How it fits together: getting that job!
Get that job!
Chapter 10 considers employability from the 
perspective of you as the potential employee 
going through the process of applying for 
jobs. It looks at such issues as:
•• identifying what you want from your first, 
or next, job
•• making good choices and finding the right 
job for you
•• using the personal development planning 
process to enhance your career prospects
•• making strong and successful job 
applications
•• understanding the role of job descriptions, 
person specifications, competences, CVs, 
and assessment centres
•• preparing well for interviews and 
assessment centres, so you can approach 
these with confidence
•• using work placements or other 
employment opportunities to best effect, 
taking a structured, critical approach to 
observing and reflecting on what is going 
on around you, in order to develop your 
awareness and understanding of the world 
of work.
Maintain up-to-date personal 
records
Chapter 11 outlines the rationale for keeping 
personal records. It is linked to the Resource 
Bank referred to below. Together, these make 
it easy for you to reflect and record in a 
structured and purposeful way about:
•• what you have learnt to date from your 
course and experiences, and
•• how these are relevant to jobs that interest 
you.
Accurate record-keeping is essential for 
completing application forms for jobs. 
Building a bank of information about your 
experiences and skills provides you with 
an invaluable resource for making good 
applications and preparing for interviews. 
You are likely to draw upon it for many years 
to come.
Raise your game
In Chapter 12, you draw together what you have learnt 
so far and consider how you can build on this further. 
The chapter encourages you to:
•• recognise personal change and to review your values 
and goals in the light of this
•• build connections between your skills and expertise 
so that you can more easily transfer your skills from 
one context to another
•• identify your next set  
of personal  
challenges and  
‘working edge’  
for personal  
development.
Resource Bank
A resource bank is provided at the end of the book 
for recording and collating key personal information, 
evaluations and reflections. You can use these resources 
to devise personal strategies, models, planning tools 
and prompts.
You can also use them more than once so as to 
compare how your responses change over time and 
with more experience. You can monitor your progress 
and see how you develop in your thinking and 
confidence. These can be photocopied for updating by 
hand or are available electronically, for your personal 
use, at www.palgrave.com/studyskills/pdp.

Introduction

Closing comments
This introduction opened with seven sets of 
actions that run through the introduction and 
the book as a whole. Working through these will 
help you in planning towards success, whether 
academic or professional.
Aspire. Be prepared to be ambitious, setting 
yourself high goals towards which you can work 
over the longer term. Although you may be 
keen to complete your qualification or gain a 
better job, keep an eye on the distant future too. 
It is likely that you will have many jobs, each 
building on previous expertise. Avoid taking 
steps that narrow your options too early. Be 
flexible and open to a range of possibilities. Take 
opportunities that help you to build towards 
leadership roles should you wish to apply for 
them.
Investigate. Put in the time to find out as much 
as you can about the wide range of career and 
life options that could be open to you. Develop 
a clear understanding of what you would need 
to do in order to access these for yourself.
Reflect. Don’t fool yourself – give thought to 
what you really want and why. Increase your 
self-awareness so that you understand the basis 
of your motivations and behaviours. Develop 
good habits of introspection, self-evaluation 
and self-questioning, so that you become, and 
remain, attuned to your changing interests, 
motivations and ambitions.
Decide. Decision-making is important, even if 
you don’t know exactly what you want to do 
next. Making decisions gives your planning and 
development greater focus. Put time aside to 
think through what is likely to be really right for 
you – or at least the most likely best direction 
of travel for you. Think through, in depth, the 
potential implications of your choices, so that 
you don’t close down your options, either 
through making the wrong choices – or through 
inaction.
Plan. Map out what you will do to put yourself 
in the best possible position to achieve the kind 
of life, career and academic success you want.
Personalise. Adapt your approaches and 
strategies to suit your personal skills, strengths, 
needs, interests, experiences, preferences and 
style. Be your own person and true to what is 
right for you.
Achieve. Follow through on your plans, 
adapting these to suit changes in circumstances 
and opportunities, as well as changes in your 
own interests and ambitions.
Enjoy this book!

Skills for Success

Part 1
Self-management
Knowing yourself
It is easier to adapt to the changing requirements 
of study, work, new contexts and new people if 
you are building on a solid base. This comes from 
gaining a deep understanding of yourself- not just 
the superficial, obvious things that strike you on a 
first consideration, but the more profound insights 
that come from recurrent and structured self-
reflection, self-questioning and challenge.
Without such self-awareness, it is likely that, at 
some point, you will experience a disconnection 
between what you think matters to you and what 
does in reality. It is difficult to maintain high levels 
of motivation, energy, confidence, time on task 
and focus when there is such a disconnection.
Conversely, it is easier to be successful in working 
towards your goals when these really excite you, 
when they match your ambitions, values and 
interests, when you are being true to yourself.
Personal Performance
We are also more likely to succeed in our 
endeavours when we know what impacts on our 
performance. That puts us in a good position to 
identify ways to fine-tune the ways we work and 
study, removing potential barriers and distractions, 
so we can perform at our best. Sometimes, quite 
small alterations to the way we approach our 
work, study, tasks or situations can reduce negative 
feelings such as boredom, stress and anxiety, and 
incite greater interest, enjoyment and desire to 
engage.
This section provides a wide range of activities, 
reflections and resources to help you to:
•• delve beneath the surface and examine what 
matters to you, what inspires you, what will get 
you through your course and help you achieve 
your longer term ambitions
•• pinpoint key contextual factors that are most 
conducive to your performing well
•• consider the skills, habits, attitudes, preferences, 
experiences and strategies that impact on your 
current learning and performance
•• think through how you might adapt your 
approaches and study conditions to improve 
your future performance
•• manage your time, resources and energies to 
best effect to achieve the kind of success that 
matters to you.

Introduction
Everybody wants to be successful – but in their 
own way. We each have our own versions or 
definitions of what ‘success’ means, for ourselves 
and for others. The kinds of success characterised 
by Barack Obama, Angelina Jolie, Beyoncé, J. 
K. Rowling, Lionel Messi, Aung San Suu Kyi or 
Shah Rukh Khan, are all very different, but no less 
valuable to the people concerned.
Our concepts of success can be rather vague and 
open to change. This is especially the case for 
students – even if some objectives appear clear cut. 
Embarking on a programme in higher education 
is, typically, a time of transition – a time for leaving 
behind the worlds of school and family, or barriers 
to progression at work, or perceived gaps in 
knowledge. It is an exciting time, full of potential. 
As a student, you are exposed to new ideas, 
new perspectives on the world, new people and 
opportunities. It is likely that your horizons will be 
stretched, your values challenged, your ambitions 
changed. Anything might be possible, all kinds of 
paths may open up to you. 
Students today expect their time in higher 
education to be a passport to many kinds of 
success apart from simply gaining a qualification: 
to good grades, to the specialist skills and 
knowledge required for particular professional 
pathways, a graduate-level job, a rewarding 
career, leadership and management roles, financial 
security, new possibilities, a better lifestyle.
Competition for such opportunities is generally 
high – and a degree alone is unlikely to make 
you stand out. As a student, you will be making 
decisions that will have an impact on your future 
opportunities, such as in:
•• the options you select 
•• the way you approach your studies
•• the projects you undertake
•• the way you apply your learning in work settings 
if you are already employed
•• the skills and qualities you develop through 
activities you undertake outside the curriculum
•• and the chances you don’t use too.
The activities in this chapter aim to sharpen your 
thinking about your aims, ambitions and the 
versions of success you most value. That, in turn, 
should assist you in making sound decisions that 
affect your future as well as motivating you to do 
what is needed to achieve success.
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• reflect upon the nature of success
•• understand the importance of personal vision to successful outcomes
•• formulate a personal definition of success 
•• gain insight into personal motivation, inspiration and values, and see how these assist current study
•• refine your vision of the future and consider how current study contributes towards that vision.
Chapter 1
The vision: what does success 
mean to you?
27
The vision

Activity
Successful people
•• Jot down, as quickly as you can, the first ten people 
you think of as ‘successful’. 
•• Do these have anything in common?
•• What makes you think of them as ‘successful’?
•• How do you think your list might differ from 
somebody else’s? You could compare your list with 
that of a friend. 
Activity
Symbols of success
•• Jot down quickly the first ten things (or symbols) 
you associate with success. 
•• How important is each of those symbols to you 
personally? Are these things that you want very 
much from life?
•• How do you think your list would differ from 
somebody else’s? Compare your list with a friend’s.
Activity
Spectrums of success – or knowing what you want
Below are pairs of statements, each of which relates to different points on a spectrum of opinion about 
success. For each statement, mark on the spectrum where you would wish your own success to lie. 
For example,
 
Being immensely rich
 
Having enough to survive
Having high expectations
 
Being content with little
Being a world expert
 
Knowing enough to survive
Gaining higher degrees
 
Passing part of one degree
World fame
 
Recognition by colleagues and peers
Achieving high goals
 
Achieving something
Seizing big opportunities
 
Being aware of some opportunities
Winning on a world stage
 
Taking part in any activity
A very high profile job
 
Having some work, paid or unpaid
Being very popular
 
Having some good friends
Being a world leader
 
Living a quiet life
Being important on a world 
stage
 
Being recognised for personal 
achievements 
Having a close family life
 
Escaping the family 
Outstanding physical 
appearance and physique
 
Minimum interest in personal 
appearance
Material wealth
 
A strong spiritual life
•• Is there another aspect of success which is more important to you than any of those listed above? If 
so, what is that?
•• If you could be successful in only one area, what would that be? Why is this so important to you? 
What would it mean not to have this in your life?
•• What do your responses tell you about your own concept of ‘success’?
✘
Defining success 
There are many ways of looking at ‘success’. 
Some people define success in terms of 
objective material criteria. (How much 
money, how high a position in a company, 
how big a house?)
However, successful athletes may win world 
records, even fame, without earning a 
great deal of money. Successful artists may 
measure their success by how true they are 
to their artistic endeavour. Others judge 
success by the integrity they brought to 
a task: the confidence that they did their 
best in honest ways and can live with their 
conscience. It used to be a sign of success to 
still have your own teeth at an advanced age!
In other words, ‘success’ is a very subjective 
matter. It depends on what is meaningful to 
you and the people around you.

Personal ambitions
Sometimes we come up with different answers 
if we frame the question differently. This activity 
invites you to give some initial thought to your 
ambitions for different areas of your life. Later 
activities explore this in more detail.

Personal influences 
Some of the definitions of success that you use 
were probably adopted originally to please other 
people – or are those you have inherited, or 
picked up from peers and the media. This is not 
necessarily a bad thing: these may be influences 
that you respect or that matter to you. External 
influences can be very valuable and help us to 
form our sense of who we are. 
However, sometimes, we live out ideas of success 
that we pick up from other people, without 
thinking through what they really mean for us. 
It can be easy to lose ourselves in the values and 
interests presented by others, especially if we are 
surrounded by these for much of the time. We 
can ‘forget’ that there may be alternatives that 
are better suited to our personal circumstances, 
character and beliefs. 
As so much personal investment is likely to be 
involved in working towards your concept of 
success, it is worth considering how your own view 
of success has been influenced by others – and 
how far you can say ‘This is really me.’
Reflection: Spending life your way
There is only one success – to be able to spend 
your life in your own way. 
Christopher Morley
•• What would it mean for you to ‘live your life 
in your own way’? What would this involve?
•• What, if anything, stops you from doing this?
Activity
A personal definition of 
success
Complete the sentence below. In doing so, 
consider what personal success would be in 
your own case. Don’t worry if you find this 
much more difficult than you imagined. You 
will be asked to return to this statement later in 
the chapter, when you may wish to change or 
refine it.
For me, being successful means …
Reflection: Personal influences
Who do you consider to be the greatest 
influence on your life? How far do your ideas of 
‘success’ reflect the influences of that person or 
group?
•• Look again at your responses to the above 
activities about success. 
•• What values and beliefs are associated with 
your responses?
•• Are these influences still valuable to you or do 
you need to develop more independence?
29
The vision
© Stella Cottrell (2003, 2010, 2015), Skills for Success, Palgrave

Owning the influence
Your goals may have been strongly influenced 
by others but ultimately, when you decide to act 
upon them, you have made those goals your own. 
The important thing is to be clear that your action 
is a personal choice no matter who influenced it. 
This means recognising your own role in the action 
you take, rather than saying later, ‘Well, I only did 
that because my parents/teacher/friend/children/
boss, etc., wanted me to.’ 
Inspiration
Sometimes influences act as positive inspiration, 
moving us to achieve things we value. Many 
people have used a role model from their personal 
life, history or public life to inspire them. 
Reflection: Inspiring people
Look back to the list of successful people you 
jotted down in activity 1. Do any of these 
inspire you? If you answered ‘No’, think of at 
least one person who does inspire you. If you 
answered ‘Yes’, which person from your list do 
you find most inspiring? 
Consider the person that you selected as 
inspiring. What is it about them that most 
inspires you: 
•• What they achieved?
•• Hurdles they overcame?
•• Their level of skill or ability?
•• Their personal qualities?
•• Their effect on the lives of other people?
•• Something very individual they bring to life?
In what way has that person already inspired 
you? In what other ways could you use that 
person as an inspiration towards achieving your 
goals?
Other sources of inspiration
Anything may be a source of inspiration. For 
some people, a piece of music, a rap, a poem, a 
painting, a postcard, a view of the sea, an episode 
in history, a personal event, can be inspiring. 
Alternatively, doing something for a cause or to 
bring about change can be a source of inspiration. 
Traditionally, artists and thinkers used to write, 
paint or compose for a ‘muse’ – a real or a 
mythological person to whom they dedicated their 
lives or their work. 
Thinking about your sources of inspiration can be 
like receiving a burst of energy – it can boot you 
back into action when your spirits are flagging, 
and keep you focused. Inspiration, in other words, 
is another tool you can use to achieve your 
objectives.  
Reflection: Sources of personal 
inspiration
Consider:
•• Apart from people, what has inspired you 
most in life? This could be a book, music, etc. 
What was it about this that inspired you?
•• What things inspire you to feel good about 
life?
•• What things inspire you to go beyond 
yourself, to do more than you thought you 
were capable of? 
•• What else would you consider to be a source 
of inspiration to you?
Reflection: Inspiration to succeed 
on your course
•• What, if anything, inspired you to come on 
this course or to return to study?
•• What inspiration can you draw upon to 
increase your motivation to succeed?
Values
You will probably already have noticed that 
thinking about personal success raises questions 
about values, beliefs and ethics. It is not always 
easy to square our desires with our values and 
beliefs. It can also be hard to identify what we 
really value – sometimes this is not possible until 
we are faced with a life-or-death challenge. 
However, if we work against our values, we 
are likely to experience self-conflict, which can 
undermine our chances of success. The following 
activities aim to help you identify what things you 
hold important relative to other things.
30
Self-management

Layers of the onion 
Knowing what we ‘really’ want is not easy. There 
are many layers to our ‘wanting’ and ‘needing’ 
and ‘valuing’, like skins on an onion. It is worth 
taking time to reflect on the things we value, 
asking why we value them, following each answer 
with ‘And what is it about this that I value?’ For 
example, do you value celebrity because you are 
excited by the lifestyle that it represents? What is it 
about that lifestyle that you value? Is it being in the 
public eye? In which case, how many other ways 
are there of being in the public eye? Is it about the 
money celebrities earn? If so, what other ways are 
there of earning that money? Is it because famous 
people seem to gain recognition? If so, are there 
other ways of gaining recognition that you would 
value as much or more? Is it really popularity that 
you are seeking? Keep going until you run out of 
questions.
Sometimes it is easier to aim for the surface of 
things (money, power, celebrity) rather than 
looking at what is creating 
a need for such things. 
Whether those things are 
good or bad in their own 
right is a value judgement 
– and may depend on the 
circumstances. It is worth 
remembering that we 
need very little in order to 
survive.
Activity
The Zed box (1)
Imagine that you are given a ‘smart’ or  
magical box, known as the Zed box.  
If you open the Zed box, you may  
be given the thing that you want  
or value most in life. (The box  
cannot change the past.) You have  
five seconds to jot down the one  
thing you would most want the box  
to give you. 
The thing I would want most is:
Activity
The Zed box (2)
Reflection: Core values
•• What is at the ‘core of the onion’ for you? 
What is really driving you towards the things 
that you want?
•• How far are your values being shaped by your 
wants and needs (for yourself, others or the 
world)?
However, the Zed box is ‘smart’ and 
magical: it can read your most secret 
wishes. It may give you what you 
wish in your heart, even if you are 
not aware yet that this is something 
you want. For example, you may 
think you want to be a football 
champion but deep down wish to be 
an artist, travel the world, or take up a 
caring role. The Zed box would know that 
and would give you that opportunity rather 
than making you a football star. The choice the 
Zed box makes may come as a shock to you. 
You have one minute to jot down an answer to 
the following questions:
1	 What would you most fear that the Zed 
box decided you really wanted?
2	 What do you most fear the Zed box would 
take away from you, thinking it knew 
best? 
You may have found this activity difficult if you 
have not spent time thinking about what you 
feel you ought to do with your life as well as 
what you want to do with your life. You may 
find it useful to reflect upon this over some time 
or on a long walk. Consider:
•• What do I want to do with my life?
•• What do I feel I ought to do with my life?
•• What are the key characteristics of the lives of 
people who inspire me?

Consider the top ten items that you valued. What 
themes can you identify? For example, do your 
choices suggest you place a high value on any of 
the following:
•• personal qualities (character)
•• control over something
•• people
•• material objects
•• power and influence
•• mind and body
•• personal recognition.
Are you comfortable with your responses or do you 
feel you ‘ought to’ value other things? If so, what 
does this response tell you about yourself? 
Reflection: Put to the test?
Identify a time when your values were put to 
the test. In your reflective journal, jot down:
•• What happened? 
•• What did you find out about yourself on that 
occasion?
•• What did you learn about your personal 
values from that occasion?
Life qualities
The following quotation refers to a number of 
qualities that one person, Gordon H. Taggart, 
wished to develop in his life. 
I wish I were honest enough to admit all my 
shortcomings:
•• brilliant enough to accept flattery without it 
making me arrogant
•• tall enough to tower above deceit
•• strong enough to reassure love
•• brave enough to welcome criticism
•• compassionate enough to understand 
human frailties
•• wise enough to recognise my mistakes
•• humble enough to appreciate greatness
•• staunch enough to stand by my friends
•• human enough to be thankful of my 
neighbour.

Vision
It helps to get to the top of a mountain if we have 
seen the pinnacle and know where we are headed. 
This does not necessarily mean that we should 
have very clear life goals, with every detail planned 
out. Successful people seem to be characterised 
by not having very rigid life plans (Taylor and 
Humphrey, 2002). 
However, it is important to have a vision of the 
general direction in which we are going, the kind 
of life we want to lead, and the levels of personal 
investment we want to make in different kinds of 
activity. It is this vision that keeps us going when 
the inevitable unexpected setbacks occur. If we are 
assembling a bookcase or doing a jigsaw puzzle, 
it helps to have the picture before us of what we 
want to achieve, so that we can see the end goal 
as a realistic possibility. A vision of what we want 
to achieve is even more important when we are 
undertaking a project that lasts for several years, 
such as working towards a degree or a career. 
Ambitions
An obvious starting place is to clarify your current 
sense of what your ambitions might be. Some 
people have very clearly formed ambitions and 
goals by the time they enter university. However, 
many students have given little thought to what 
they want after university. It is not necessary to 
have clearly defined goals, but it is useful to start 
clarifying personal ambitions, so that you can 
check both how important these really are to 
you – and how far you are working towards what 
matters to you. 
The dream
Dream lofty dreams, and as you dream so shall 
you become. Your vision is the promise of what you 
shall at last unveil.
John Ruskin
When we are young, we are often told to stop 
day-dreaming. However, many great inventors and 
scientists attribute success to the combination of 
their analytical work with the inspiration that came 
through dreams or day-dreams. 
Clarifying the dream
To gain a clearer view of the ‘dream’, come back 
to the ‘Dream’ activity and repeat it from the 
beginning once you have undertaken the ‘Vision’ 
exercise below. 
You may find that the more analytical nature of 
the ‘Vision’ activity focuses the mind. Let go of 
particular details when you return to the ‘Dream’ 
activity. 
Your mind will automatically play with the ideas 
you had and feed them back, either straight 
away or at some time in the future. However, as 
our relaxed brain likes to play with images and 
metaphors, it may return the ideas to you in a way 
that is hard to recognise at first. 
Whatever images come to mind on this second 
occasion, however unexpected, hold them in mind 
for a few days, and see what emerges. 
Activity
The dream
This activity is linked to the activity, ‘The Long-
Term Vision’, page 35. 
First, undertake an activity that uses up any 
surplus energy and leaves you alert and awake. 
Taking a walk or doing housework is ideal, but 
any moderately strenuous activity will do. This 
will get the blood flowing to your brain (so 
you think better) but work off excess adrenalin 
(so you are open to being creative rather than 
defensive). 
Then, find a comfortable seat where you will 
not be disturbed. Read the quotation by Ruskin 
(above) a few times and let your mind wander 
over what this means for you. 
•• What dreams have other people had for you 
(if any)?
•• What are the dreams and ambitions of people 
you know well?
•• How are your dreams different from those of 
people around you?
Your ‘dream’ does not have to be the same 
as anyone else’s, and it does not need to be 
well defined. It may be something as simple as 
‘happiness’.

The long-term vision 
For the activity on pp. 35–6, imagine yourself 
travelling forward into the future, to a time 
approximately 10 or 20 years from now. This 
activity is not about laying down a rigid plan 
for your future but, rather, is to help you form a 
general idea of what you would like to experience, 
as far as you can tell now. The aim is to gain a 
sense of the type of life you want, so that you can 
make the right kinds of choices to achieve it.

Draw on your vision
Look again at the third column of 
the activity, How important is this 
aspect to me? (pp. 35–6). Consider 
what this tells you about the kind of 
lifestyle and career that you are likely 
to enjoy? 
If you found it difficult to answer 
many of the questions on pages 
35–6, this suggests either that you 
are very flexible or that you need to 
spend more time thinking through 
what sort of things you want from 
life. This will help you to make 
certain decisions about programme 
options, work experience, 
extracurricular activities and early 
job applications. 
Rethinking the dream
•• Be open to ‘rethinking the dream’ 
– you can change your mind!
•• Create opportunities to reconsider 
your life journey in the light of 
your experience and reflections.
Return now to p. 34 and complete 
‘The Dream’ again.
Reflection: Using the 
vision and the dream
•• In what ways can you make 
use of the ‘Vision’ or ‘Dream’ 
that emerged through these 
activities to motivate you 
further?
•• In what ways do your current 
study and extracurricular 
activities help take you forward 
towards your ‘Vision’?
Goals
The long-term vision gives us a sense of how well we know 
ourselves and a goal at which we can aim. To help identify 
the goals you wish to achieve from your time as a student, 
complete the table on page 38, ‘What do I want to gain from 
my time at university/college?’
Deferred gratification
Some people are very good at ‘deferring gratification’: that is, 
at making personal sacrifices in order to achieve a goal many 
years down the line. They usually have a very clear vision of 
what they want to achieve.
However, it is not easy to ‘defer gratification’ unless there are 
lots of small successes along the route. It is difficult to put effort 
and energy into study, work, research or exercise if we do not 
have mini-goals, or milestones towards which we are working. 
Success at these spurs us on to greater triumphs. If we are not 
successful, this can also be valuable, providing time to take 
stock and re-evaluate how important something really is to us. 
Create milestones
Smaller goals or targets enable us to experience success along 
the way and test us in the short term. For example, we can:
•• perform in concerts whilst training to become a professional 
musician
•• put on exhibitions if we wish to be an artist
•• publish material if we want to be a writer
•• make a speech at a wedding if we are likely  
to work in the public eye
•• take on voluntary work to develop skills in preparation for 
paid employment.
Assessed coursework and exams offer the experience of ‘being 
tested’ and can develop a range of qualities that go with such 
‘testing’.
Set short-term goals
Once you have given thought to what you wish to gain from 
your studies, use the activity on page 39, ‘Short-term goals’, 
to set some interim milestones for yourself. These will help to 
provide a focus in the weeks and months ahead. They will also 
help you to monitor whether you are on track to achieve your 
longer-term goals.

Putting in the time
The most likely route to success is putting in the 
hours required to achieve it. There is a wealth of 
research that indicates that what separates high 
achievers from others is the amount of time they 
spend in becoming expert at what they do.
This is true even of apparent ‘geniuses’ or 
protégés; it has been claimed that the most 
successful, from Mozart to the Beatles, tend to 
devote around 10,000 hours to fine-tuning their 
craft. You may not have 10,000 hours as a student, 
but the general principle holds true. Even those 
who are successful at social and emotional skills 
tend to put in much more time in practising, 
reflecting upon and discussing these.
High achievers and time
High achievers tend to put more time into such 
activities as:
•• elaboration: working out the precise nature of a 
problem, task or issue
•• preparation: making sure that they are set up for 
the task, with suitable space, materials, mental 
preparation
•• perseverance: sticking with difficult problems and 
going over them time and time again, looking 
for clues about where they are going wrong, 
until they find a way of resolving the issue
•• practice and rehearsal, going over and over their 
work until they are fluent in the skills.
What if I don’t have the time?
There are many demands on students’ time so, 
inevitably, choices have to be made. That is why 
it is important to look at your decision-making in 
the round, weighing up the diverse aspects of your 
life, your values and aims, and how much time 
you can give, realistically, to each. It helps if you 
can be clear in your own mind about the reasons 
underpinning your choices, and then be able to 
make peace with the consequences of difficult 
decisions.
As well as the total amount of time spent, there is 
also the consideration of how well you spend your 
time. Chapters 4 and 6 can help you deploy time 
more effectively.
Maintaining motivation
Success is associated with high levels of 
motivation. For this reason, it is useful to be clear 
about what is likely to motivate you the most. Each 
of us is motivated by different things. Below are 
some techniques people use to keep themselves 
motivated. 
Setting high expectations 
Success is linked to high expectations. These 
may take the form of very specific things which 
you wish to achieve, or a more general vision or 
ambition. If you set low expectations, you will 
probably achieve very little. Once you set high 
expectations, you need to plan accordingly, 
making sure you create the right opportunities for 
yourself. If your expectations are low, you are likely 
to be unprepared for opportunities that arise.
Being realistic
Little is achieved without setbacks, effort and 
hard work, and even moments when you feel like 
giving up. Although positive thinking is an asset, 
unrealistic thinking sets you up for failure as you 
will be unprepared to meet hurdles that are set in 
your way. Think through what setbacks you may 
face and make plans to deal with these. Take them 
in your stride as part of the natural process, rather 
than as disasters which mean you will fail.  
Setting realistic milestones
The section above, on goals, refers to the 
importance of setting milestones so that you can 
chart your progress. The more challenging the 
overall goal, or the longer it takes to achieve, the 
more important it is to set yourself intermediate 
targets to check you are moving in the right 
direction. 
Rewarding achievement 
Promise yourself a reward for reaching your 
intermediate targets – something you would really 
appreciate but which is appropriate to the size of 
the task – and then make sure you really do take 
that reward when you reach the target. You can 
set rewards such as a break, a coffee, a special 
meal, a phone call to a friend, for small targets on 
a single day. 
40
Self-management

Harnessing support
If you feel it will be difficult to keep yourself on 
track, ask a friend or mentor to check at set, 
regular intervals that you are keeping to plan. You 
may work better if you set up a support group to 
encourage you to keep going. These can work best 
if you set clear targets and your support team is 
given a specific date on which to check whether 
targets have been met. 
Recording success
It is easier to monitor and reward your successes 
if you keep a record. This can be useful for the 
task in hand and also in retrospect when you 
reflect back upon what you achieved. A record of 
past successes can be very motivating for future 
enterprises. 
Hunting out the interest
It is much easier to succeed at a task if we find it 
engaging. We often react towards things we find 
difficult as if they were inherently boring. However, 
we can make something appear interesting even if, 
at first, we do not think it is. For example, we can 
make it a personal challenge to complete the task, 
or set up challenging time targets for each stage. 
Perhaps paradoxically, if we find out more than we 
need to know about something, we are more likely 
to find it interesting: feeling we have expertise can 
increase our interest.
The important thing is to know what kinds of 
motivational spurs work for you.
Personal investment: benefits, costs 
and commitments
Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul into 
even your smallest acts. This is the secret of 
success. 

Reflection: Commitment
•• Do you agree with the comments quoted 
above?
•• What, if anything, are you willing to commit 
to in such dedicated ways?
•• What phrase would you find more motivating 
than those in the quotations?
For some people, success is measured by the 
achievement of a goal at any cost. For others, 
success is measured by overall outcomes. For 
example, the building of a new dam may be 
regarded as a successful outcome (it got built). 
On the other hand, some may view the event as a 
limited success or even a failure (it was built but at 
too great a cost financially, or to local inhabitants, 
or to the environment).

Success to some people (those who benefit from 
the dam) may be a loss to others. This is an 
extreme example, but it illustrates the point that 
each act is accompanied by benefits and loss. Each 
of us has to weigh up, for ourselves, what ‘costs’ 
we are willing to bear in order to achieve what 
kind of outcome. Often, we proceed without even 
considering the full picture – without considering 
what we already have, really want and value.
In planning for success, it helps to know certain 
things about yourself, such as:
•• What you really want – ‘no matter what!’
•• Your assets: what you bring to the task in hand, 
that you are willing to ‘invest’ or risk. This 
includes such things as time, effort, money and 
material resources, friends and family, practice, 
endurance, willingness to wait or try again.
•• Your limits: what sacrifices you are really 
prepared to make and where your limits lie. In 
this respect, the cost to others, the opinion of 
others, your values and your sense of self may all 
be relevant.
Ingredients of success
Taylor and Humphrey (2002) analysed interviews 
made with 80 UK and US business leaders, drawn 
from a wide range of businesses. They identified 
the skills and attributes which were most common 
amongst those who had been successful at chief 
executive level. Although most (91 per cent) had 
a degree and relevant technical skills, success was 
not closely linked to a level or type of knowledge: 
few had business degrees or outstanding technical 
ability. 
Characteristics of successful chief executives
The Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) worked very 
long hours – but loved their work. They enjoyed 
leadership and recognition. They were noticeably 
self-confident, good at communicating with others 
and putting the interviewers at their ease. Their 
excellent inter-personal skills included patience 
and tolerance, often learned through the job itself. 
They were energetic, but took care to manage 
stress levels and stay healthy. Male directors were 
more sensitive to variations in their emotional 
lives and needed emotional stability in order to 
succeed. Most had a wide range of interests and 
part of what they brought to a company was 
‘breadth of vision developed from a wide range of 
experience’. Most of these are self-management 
and people skills rather than unusual abilities or 
technical skills. 
Attributes associated with success
The surprising outcome of Taylor and Humphrey’s 
survey was that the range of personal skills and 
qualities associated with success were ones that 
most people could nurture. The researchers 
wrote: ‘Board directors are not a race apart … we 
found ourselves in the presence of bright, hard-
working people, but not creatures from another 
planet. They had a variety of IQs, expertise, and 
backgrounds. In other words, directors are just 
like the rest of us – and their positions are up for 
grabs.’ The skills and attitudes of successful people 
can be developed by others. 
The main skills valued by the CEOs included: 
•• self-knowledge and self-awareness – this was 
especially noticeable, and the directors were 
frank about their skills and their shortcomings
•• inter-personal skills, especially the ability to work 
with, and lead, teams
•• problem-solving ability, using creative 
approaches and positive attitudes
•• a desire to win, especially on behalf of the 
company or team
•• a willingness to work very long hours and to ‘do 
what it takes’
•• emotional intelligence, especially when relating 
to others
•• the ability to manage stress and to take care of 
their health
•• a love of change
•• confidence
•• a broad range of personal interests
•• readiness to seize opportunities rather than 
making rigid personal plans.
Many of these skills have long been recognised 
as essential in the caring professions. It may be 
surprising to find this list associated with business 
success. However, similar skills are likely to be 
required across a very wide range of professions. 
Increasingly, employers expect employees to 
be able to work in project teams on complex 
problems. This requires many of the other skills 
listed: good people skills, emotional intelligence, 
self-knowledge, a positive attitude, a willingness 
to put the team’s interests first. Negative-thinking, 
selfish people who lack confidence, who get easily

High levels of success in any field tend to require 
long hours, hard work, practice, and a willingness 
to keep going towards achieving the goal even 
when you do not feel like it, or when you are tired 
or want to give up. There are few areas of life 
where an individual is unlikely to benefit from the 
characteristics associated with chief executives, as 
listed above.

how they are coping with their own emotions, are 
unlikely to be a great asset to a team. 
However, the qualities needed for different 
kinds of success may vary from the above list. 
Academic success requires a willingness to refine 
analytical thinking skills. Successful relationships 
may require a willingness not to work very long 
hours outside of the home, but are still likely 
to require a willingness to ‘do what it takes’ to

Where are you now? Self-evaluation of 
personal qualities associated with success
On the chart above (p. 45), identify whether each 
of the personal qualities associated with success are 
ones that you already possess, or wish to develop 
or are not relevant. The final column of the activity 
indicates where in the book you can find out more 
about this skill or aspect.
Skills and qualities needed to achieve your 
goals
It is worth comparing the list of the attributes 
associated with successful outcomes at chief 
executive level with the attributes you regard as 
necessary to achieving your goals and ambitions. 
You may find that your personal goals call for a 
very particular set of skills and qualities. However, 
it is important to think through all the kinds of 
situations and problems that you may have to 
address in order to achieve your goals. What 
qualities would help you in those circumstances?
Is there a good skills ‘match’?
At this point, it is useful to compare the attributes 
that you identified as necessary for achieving a 
successful outcome of your goal (p. 44) with the 
attributes you ascribed yourself in the activity on 
p. 45. Is there a good match? If not, which skills 
and qualities will require further development? 
What will you do to develop these? 
If you added further skills, goals and attributes to 
your list, which of these would benefit from being 
further developed whilst at university? What will 
you do to develop these? 
Breadth of vision and experience
In the section on successful CEOs above, Taylor 
and Humphrey (2002) identified ‘breadth of vision 
developed from a wide range of experience’ as an 
important characteristic of successful people. It is 
easy to see why this would be the case. Experience 
gained from many different settings brings you 
into contact with a more diverse range of people. 
This provides opportunities for learning about 
people, developing inter-personal skills and net-
working. Each context provides knowledge, skills, 
opportunities to develop personal qualities, as well 
as new perspectives and information. 
Reflection: Extending experience
In your reflective journal, jot some thoughts on 
the following questions.
•• In what ways do you already have a breadth 
of experience drawn from different contexts? 
•• In relation to your current goals and career 
aspirations, what opportunities are open 
to you for extending your breadth of 
experience? Consider, for example, your job, 
work experience, travel, taking on a position 
of responsibility, joining a student society, 
community or voluntary work, sporting 
activity, mentoring schemes, etc.
•• What opportunities are offered through 
the curriculum for designing a personal 
programme that extends your range of skills 
and experience?
Congruence
‘Congruence’ refers to consistency in our thoughts, 
actions, behaviours and beliefs. It is about all our 
energies flowing in the same direction. It takes 
less effort to achieve goals if there is a high level 
of congruence between the different factors that 
influence, inspire and support those goals. If you 
are struggling to see the way towards success, it 
is worth checking whether there is a high level 
of congruence (or a ‘good fit’) amongst the 
following:
•• your vision
•• your motivation
•• the ‘influences’ you value
•• your sources of inspiration
•• your short-term goals, targets or milestones
•• your values and beliefs
•• the attitudes of the people around you
•• your means and resources
•• your current situation.
In particular, it is worth checking that your ‘vision’ 
is still relevant to you. New experiences can 
change your vision, either reinforcing it, modifying 
it, or making it irrelevant.

Activity
Does it all add up? Checking for congruence
Are your vision, ambitions, values and inspiration in alignment? Where might there be sources of 
internal conflict that could be undermining your efforts? On the chart below, jot down a response to 
the questions, using the space boxes.
Goal (e.g. what I want to achieve 
from my time at university)?
What is my vision of success in 
relation to this goal? What would 
success look like?
How does this goal fit into a bigger 
‘vision’ for my life and my longer-
term ambitions?
What motivates me to pursue this 
goal – what do I want to gain from 
achieving this goal?
What has influenced me, perhaps 
over many years, in forming this 
goal?
What inspiration can I call upon to 
help me achieve this goal?
What are my short-term goals? How 
do these support my main goal?
How does this goal fit with my 
beliefs and values?
How do the attitudes of people 
around me support me in working 
towards my current goal?
What resources do I have, to 
support me towards my current 
goal?
What else in my current situation 
supports or undermines me in 
working towards my goals?
Conclusions
47
The vision
© Stella Cottrell (2003, 2010, 2015), Skills for Success, Palgrave

‘Goal inertia’
If you have ‘vision inertia’ or ‘goal inertia’, you 
continue to work towards a vision that may seem 
appealing but, in reality, no longer inspires or 
motivates you – there is no longer congruence 
between what you are doing and what you really 
want to do. This is especially true if your values 
change in the light of your experience. If this 
happens, tasks can seem to be more difficult 
or tiring. You may feel it more of a struggle to 
complete tasks, that you are looking for excuses 
to put tasks off, or even that you don’t want to 
do anything at all. If you experience goal inertia 
it is time to recoup, to reconnect with your initial 
ambitions in at least some way, or else to change 
direction. 
The preceding activity, ‘Does it all add up?’ can 
help identify the congruence of your own position.
Opportunities
Forks in the road
If you know what you want, either generally 
or in fine detail, are you taking and making 
opportunities that advance your aims? Are you 
somebody who looks for the opportunities in 
whatever comes your way or are you more likely to 
wait, hoping for the perfect moment to arrive? In 
every moment of the day, we make decisions that 
create a ‘fork’ in the path of our life. By acting one 
way or another, or by not acting at all, we make a 
choice to move in one direction and not another. 
In the example shown on the flowchart below, at 
15, Paulette decided to leave her part-time job at 
a local shop and work part-time in an electronics 
company. At the time, she just wanted a ‘change 
of scene’ that allowed her more flexible hours. 
From that decision, she met new people, overcame 
a fear of ‘technical things’, and travelled to China. 
These changes affected her choice of subject and 
friends at university.
What if I … ?
What ideas emerge if you keep asking yourself 
the same question and have to give a different 
answer each time? The obvious answers tend to 
get used up after a while so that you draw more 
on your imagination to find new responses. Some 
of your responses may become rather far-fetched. 
However, sometimes, unexpected and useful 
responses can emerge. For the ‘What if I …?’ 
activity on p. 49, let your mind range broadly. 
Avoid censoring your thoughts, even if an idea 
seems unlikely. Be imaginative. See what emerges.

Self-management

Activity
The road walked
Take approximately three minutes to jot down 
choices you have made that you look back on 
and feel good about. This may include significant 
friendships, work, how you dealt with difficult 
situations, saying or doing the right thing, 
presents given, offers that you accepted or turned 
down, your dedication to your learning or to 
resolving a problem, the benefits from learning 
a new skill, acts of kindness, and good decisions 
you made. Focus on your role – what you did or 
did not do – rather than on what others did to 
you.
Read through your list and select your best use 
of an opportunity. It may appear small, such as 
giving somebody a card and seeing their face 
light up, or it may have been a major event such 
as saving a life. 
Take a piece of paper and write the example at 
the top of the paper, as in the example above 
under ‘Paulette’s decision’. Spend a few minutes 
jotting down the various impacts of that one 
occasion on other aspects of your life. What 
opportunities, large or small, arose for you from 
seizing that first opportunity?
Activity
The road unwalked
Now take approximately five minutes 
to brainstorm all the decisions you look 
back on and feel less good about. This 
may include opportunities that were 
present that you did not recognise at the 
time. For example, as well as the items 
on the above list, you may consider the 
things you did not do, say or learn. Focus 
on your role – what you did or did not 
do – rather than on what others did to 
you. 
Read through your list and select the one 
opportunity that you feel you missed that 
has had the greatest impact upon your 
life.  
Take a piece of paper and write down 
this decision as in the example above 
under ‘Paulette’s decision’ (see p. 48). 
Spend a few minutes brainstorming all 
the ways that that one occasion has 
had an impact upon your life since. 
What other choices could you have 
made then? What might have been the 
consequences of making each of those 
other choices?
Activity
What if I … ?   
(from p. 48) 
In your reflective journal, jot down at least thirty 
times: 
‘What if I … ?’ 
‘What if I … ?’ 
‘What if I … ?’    etc.
Take about five minutes to write responses to 
the whole set of ‘What if I … ?’ statements. For 
example:
‘What if I … spoke Japanese?’ (I’d apply for a job 
in Japan)
‘What if I invented a toy?’ (I could set up a 
business)
‘What if I rode a pogo stick?’ (I would be fitter)
Make rapid replies so that you do not have time to 
check how sensible your responses are. 
Look through your responses. 
•• Which ones surprise you?
•• Which ones provide useful information?
•• Which one would be the most interesting to put 
into action? 
•• Consider what the answer to some of these 
questions might be? Where does that line of 
thinking take you?
49
The vision

Closing comments
When engaged upon a long-term project such 
as gaining a degree or developing a career path, 
it is important to stay focused on what you want 
to achieve. This may be very different for each 
person. It is for you to decide what ‘success’ 
means for you, what you would consider to be 
an ‘achievement’, and what you want to gain 
from the experience. For some, the ‘travelling’ is 
as important as arriving: the journey may be the 
goal. 
This chapter has encouraged you to think deeply 
about the future and the things that influence, 
motivate, inspire and guide you. Long-term 
goals such as gaining a degree and working 
towards a career require commitment. Though it 
would be lovely if everything ran smoothly, this 
is unlikely always to be the case over a period 
of several years. When things feel difficult, it is 
quite common to feel like giving up. It is then 
important to find ways to keep going until the 
path gets easier and to keep yourself motivated. 
Motivation is the key to success. It provides the 
energy and the drive. That is why the goal or 
‘vision’ must contain something within it that 
really motivates you.
It is also important that you are true to what you 
really believe. The obvious reasons for personal 
goals are not always those that motivate us the 
most. This chapter has encouraged you to look 
more deeply below the surface and examine 
what is really important to you. You should now 
have a much clearer idea of your visions for your 
life, your goals, your targets, values, motivation 
and skills.
In the next chapter, you will have a chance to 
look more closely at further aspects of what 
makes you unique. Chapter 2 provides an 
opportunity to look back over your life journey 
and the events that have most significance for 
who you are now and how you make decisions. 
It will also enable you to consider how you 
construct your personal narrative and perception 
of yourself, and the impact this may have on the 
choices you make. By identifying expertise you 
may have hidden in your repertoire, you can 
consider how you do things now – and how you 
might do things differently in the future.

Introduction 
This chapter focuses on how your life story so far, 
and the narratives that you construct to make 
sense of your experience, contribute to your 
uniqueness. It encourages you to investigate how 
your personal history, attitudes and beliefs about 
your ability might be influencing the way you do 
things now and your current achievement.
If you undertake the activities in this chapter 
with different goals in mind, you are likely to 
gain different sets of responses. If you find that a 
particular type of task is proving especially difficult 
for you, go through some of these activities again 
but with only that task in mind. You may uncover 
unexpected hindrances that you can then address. 
Your life narrative
Personal narrative is used more and more in 
professional fields as a way of helping practitioners 
to understand the way they operate in the 
workplace. It is one of a number of tools that help 
individuals, by gaining a deeper understanding of 
themselves, to: 
•• make sense of their current reactions and 
responses in specific contexts
•• understand why their responses might be 
different from those of colleagues
•• reconnect with the feelings of significant events, 
so as to enable greater empathy with others
•• value their own experiences and those of others
•• identify where issues from the past might be 
having a negative effect now, so that these can 
be addressed.
It does take time to work on personal narratives, 
but the experience can be rewarding.
The ‘true story’?
Each time you review your life story, it changes. 
The events may be the same, but different aspects 
become significant. If you write out your story 
every few years and look back at past versions, 
you may be surprised at how much your attitudes, 
responses and the themes of your story change 
over time. 
In this chapter, you can consider your life story 
from different angles so as to gain different 
perspectives on yourself – rather than assuming 
there is one fixed version or interpretation.
The life metaphor
Before you launch into your story, it is helpful to 
stand back from it and take a snapshot of how you 
view it overall. One way of doing this is to consider 
the metaphors that you use – that is, the ways you 
describe your life, or events within it, in relation to 
other things. Some people regard life as a journey, 
or as a mission or a battle. Others think of it as a 
burden, a gift, an adventure, a lesson to be learnt, 
Chapter 2
Know yourself
Learning outcomes
This chapter gives you the opportunity to:
•• consider the impact of your own life story upon your current life and performance
•• analyse how you construct your personal narrative and perceptions of yourself
•• analyse your learning journey and the impact of this upon your current approaches to study
•• identify areas of personal expertise that can be applied to new tasks and areas of learning 
•• make use of your experience.

Know yourself

Significant components in the plot
To produce the narrative for your life story, the first 
step is to work out key components of the plot. 
Use the list opposite to identify key events and 
people in your story.
a trial, a treasure trove, a bottomless pit, a walk in 
the dark. These are their personal metaphors for 
their own lives. 
Maybe you catch yourself using expressions such 
as: ‘My life is a disaster waiting to happen …’ or 
‘it’s all part of life’s rich tapestry …’. If so, these 
may indicate your metaphor for your life. By 
identifying and analysing the metaphors you use 
currently, you can gain insights that you might not 
have noticed before about how you view life – and 
how this might come across to other people.
Activity
Life metaphor
•• What is your personal metaphor for your life? 
You may need to give some thought to this. 
If you do not think there is one metaphor, just 
select one for this exercise.
•• What words do you use, if any, to express 
that metaphor in daily life?
•• How does it help you to make sense of your 
life?
•• In what ways, if any, does this metaphor offer 
a constructive way of approaching your life?
Activity
A new life metaphor
After the previous activity, you may feel that you 
would like to create a new metaphor for your 
life, to inspire you for the future. If so:
•• Choose an item that inspires a positive 
reaction in you.
•• Jot down the words: My life is a … (or My life 
is like a …).
•• List as many points of comparison as you can 
between the item and your life. 
•• Continue with different items until you find 
one that is satisfying. Pin this up for a while as 
a reminder.
Activity
Components in the plot
Take five minutes to make a list of the people 
and events that you regard as most significant 
in your life. For example: 
The most significant events
•• ‘first times’ you did something
•• successes
•• crises
•• challenges
•• opportunities that arose
•• important events in the family that were 
significant in their impact upon you
•• happy memories
•• school memories
•• holidays that were important in some way
•• friendships and relationships
•• work experience
•• other things (state which).
People who had the most influence or 
impact
•• parents, carers, guardians, relatives
•• siblings and cousins
•• teachers, school staff, pupils, students
•• friends
•• romances
•• people you met on holiday, at social events, 
etc.
•• professionals such as nurses, doctors and 
dentists
•• neighbours; people who lived locally
•• employers or work colleagues
•• people who acted kindly or unkindly
•• chance encounters who made a difference
•• someone you didn’t know well but who said, 
did or experienced something that affected 
you.
Your lists will be used for further activities in this 
chapter.

Self-management

Life Chart: Plotting the journey
Now that you have identified the main 
components of your story, the next stage is 
to lay these out in such a way that you can 
work with them, plot out your life journey and 
draw connections between events. The visual 
and motor/kinaesthetic aspects of this task are 
important.
Activity
Life Chart: Plotting the 
journey
Using the items on your lists for ‘Components in 
the plot’ (p. 52):
•• Use a large sheet of paper or card.
•• Separate out each event and person on your 
list (such as by cutting up the list).
•• Organise these into the order in which they 
occurred. 
Arrange these so that you can ‘see’ the events in 
the order they occurred, leaving space to write 
and draw around them. Alternatively, work 
directly onto the card. 
•• Fix these lightly so you can change them 
round later or add new material if you 
choose.
•• Add in the people where they played most 
significant roles.
•• Build the visual aspect, using drawings, 
photographs or symbols to represent an 
occasion (such as a symbol of an ice-cream 
for a holiday, a dark cloud for a significant 
argument, etc.).
Find the links
Once you have plotted out the key events and 
players in your story, the next stage is to draw out 
the connections between these. You may already 
have had to do this at a superficial level in order to 
work out the sequence in the plot.
Now, consider more deeply, if someone was 
significant in your life, what was their influence? 
How did that influence affect particular events? 
This may generate new material to add to your 
chart. Which events involved you meeting or 
losing someone who was significant in your life? 
In effect, you are looking for broad areas of ‘cause 
and effect’. 
Create the narrative
You have gathered and ordered the raw material 
of your story. Now all you have to do is to write 
it out – or tell your story aloud and record it. It is 
tempting to cut out this step – but it is important 
to let the narrative develop. This will not only draw 
together your thinking, it will develop it.
Activity
Find the links 
On the chart you made for ‘Life Chart: Plotting 
the journey’:
•• Give the date of each event (an approximate 
date will suffice).
•• Using different colours, indicate whether 
each event or person was, overall, positive, 
negative or neutral for you. 
•• Write a brief commentary next to each item: 
a few details of each event and person, what 
you felt about them then, and what you feel 
now. 
•• Use arrows or other signs to draw 
connections between the events, and 
between people and events. Who or what 
influenced later stages in your journey? 
•• Circle just a few people and events that have 
the most significant impact on your life and 
performance now.
53
Know yourself

Themes in the tale
We noted above that each telling of a story, 
and especially our personal narrative, is likely 
to be different in some respects. There may be 
differences in terms of detail, the links made 
between events, interpretations, emphasis, and 
so forth. To this extent, our story is always a 
construction. By analysing what we choose to 
include and exclude, what we emphasise or brush 
over, the themes that run through our story of 
events, and changes in our interpretations from 
one telling to another, we can gain clues about 
ourselves that we might otherwise miss. 
Activity
Create the narrative
Write out your story. Make sure you include 
how you feel about your experiences. Be 
honest. This copy is just for you – so you 
don’t need to worry about writing a good 
introduction or about your writing style. Just tell 
it.
Once you have completed your story, leave 
it for a few days and then go on to the next 
activity.
Activity
The Hero
Consider the roles you have given yourself in your narrative: what part do you play in the plot? Are you 
active, taking the lead, and making things happen? Do you sit back and wait for things to happen? 
Are you the passive recipient of other people’s actions? Maybe you sound like you are forever in battle, 
holding your ground? Overall, have you written the narrative so that you sound mainly like:
•• the Warrior stepping into battle and fighting your own or others’ wars
•• the Saint who is always doing good and in the right
•• the Martyr who has to suffer so others can benefit
•• the Adventurer, looking for new experiences
•• the Scapegoat, carrying the blame for others
•• the Ruler, commanding the troops or the people

•• a different kind of hero? (Identify what type)
Reflection: Themes in the tale
Read through your ‘narrative’ or ‘story’ 
considering the following points:
•• Have you included more positive or more 
negative experiences and events for your 
story? Could you have included more positive 
items? Are you avoiding negative or difficult 
issues that throw light on your experiences?
•• What themes or patterns emerge from 
the story? For example, is the story full of 
adventures? Disasters? Effort and reward? 
Disappointment? Seizing and creating 
opportunities? Meeting and losing people? 
Solitary achievement or collaboration with 
others? 
•• What is the general tone of your story? Is it a 
sad or a happy story? Does it contain either 
much praise or much blame? 
•• What do the themes in your narrative tell 
you about the way you view your life? Is this 
the most helpful view you can take? Does 
this view further the ‘vision’ you identified in 
Chapter 1?

Caricature
Self-recognition is notoriously difficult to achieve. 
However, one way of gaining perspective on the 
self is through use of a ‘caricature’ technique. 
A good caricaturist helps us to recognise a 
character by exaggerating particular features. 
These are often the characteristics that make 
the person more individual and distinctive. 
By exaggerating our own personality traits, 
behaviours, speech patterns, or events that seem 
to recur in our lives, we can stand back and take 
a look at these with a fresh eye. This may bring 
home certain aspects of ourselves more clearly. We 
gain a great deal from such insights – although 
self-recognition can involve a certain degree of 
embarrassment or discomfort. 
The activity below allows you to stand back for 
a moment from your main narrative and work 
with some emerging themes. This is intended as a 
light-hearted activity that can, nonetheless, enable 
useful personal insights to emerge.
Yourself as Hero
You are the key player in your story, its ‘hero’. One 
way to make sense of your life is to analyse the 
role you give yourself within your life story. This 
can give you insights not only into your character, 
but also into how other people may perceive you. 
For this to be helpful, you need to be honest with 
yourself and about what kind of character comes 
across.
Reflection: You as ‘hero’
•• Do you feel comfortable about the kind of 
hero that comes across in your story?	
•• How far does the hero you have chosen 
represent the way you really think, feel and 
act? 
•• What does this choice tell you about the way 
you view your life or yourself as an active 
agent in your own story?
•• Do you play very different roles depending on 
who you are with, where you are or what you 
are doing?
Activity
Create a personal caricature
If you feel you are up to the task, jot down your narrative again – or selected sections from it. This 
time, deviate from your memory of actual events in order to exaggerate certain key themes. Select 
personal traits, mannerisms, behaviours, speech, and/or themes in your life that you think are typical 
of you. If you are not sure about what these might be, ask a friend. For example: 
•• If the first draft of your story (or your life in general) contains many examples of ‘beginning’ and 
‘starting’ activities, exaggerate this theme, adding in many more things that you ‘started’ (real or 
imaginary). 
•• If it contains many examples of meeting people, 
then flood your next draft with meetings, 
inventing meetings that never happened. 
•• If there are a number of accidents or disasters in 
your story, invent a whole lot more. 
•• If you think a particular comment is very 
typical of you, write it out seven times 
each time you introduce it:
Next:
•• Read through your story, aloud. What does it tell you about yourself?
•• Are you comfortable with your personal caricature – or do you want to change it? 
•• Were you able to laugh at your caricature?
•• What do you think is the value of using this ‘caricature’ or ‘exaggeration’ technique for personal 
development?
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.
I was just about to do that.

Choices
Sometimes, it can feel that other people, 
events, history or ‘destiny’ rule the plot of 
our lives. Whilst it is true that we are all 
only part of a much bigger story, and that 
there are many influences on our lives over 
which we do not exercise control, it is also 
the case that we are agents in our own 
tale. There are choices that we make every 
day, some of which turn out to be more 
significant than others. 
Evaluating the opportunities
All experiences offer opportunities to learn and to develop 
strengths – no matter how wonderful or awful they may 
have been. Your story will contain examples of where 
there were experiences, welcome or not, that have given 
you opportunities to develop as a person. The way in 
which you responded to these may have had a significant 
impact on your personality and the way you view the 
world now. This may be apparent from your personal 
narrative. 
Activity
Evaluating opportunities
Look again at your story.
•• What things happened to you that would not be 
typical of everyone’s experience? Identify at least 
one way that these provided some advantage (such 
as the people you can communicate with easily 
as a result, the realism they bring to your life, the 
different range of skills they developed, etc.).
•• What were the most difficult things you had to face? 
What lessons did you learn from those events that 
can be of advantage to you either in completing 
your current programme or in achieving the ‘vision’ 
you identified in Chapter 1?
•• How easy or difficult do you find it to regard 
experiences and challenges as ‘opportunities’?
The ‘next chapter’
Having written the narrative of your story to date and 
analysed it from various perspectives, it is time now to 
think about what the next chapter in your story might be.
Activity
The ‘next chapter’
Consider now:
•• How do you want the plot of your life to unravel 
over the next 10–20 years? What kind of story do 
you want to be telling in 20 years’ time? 
•• What kind of role do you wish to play in this next 
chapter of your life? 
•• What would need to change in your life now in 
order for you to play that role successfully?
Activity
The choices made
Look again at your life chart and mark 
in all the occasions when you made a 
choice that had an impact upon your 
life. You may need to add new material 
to your chart as as result. Then consider,
•• What kinds of choices have you 
faced?
•• What opportunities have you taken or 
not taken? 
•• What were the effects of the choices 
you made on later events? 
Visualise at least two different scenarios 
of how your life might be different now 
if you had made different choices. If 
possible, select one choice that you 
consider to have been a bad choice, and 
one that is a good choice.
Reflection: Re-evaluating 
choices
•• In retrospect, were all the outcomes 
of the ‘choice’ good ones you would 
still welcome? 
•• In what ways did the ‘bad choice’ 
provide different opportunities for 
you that, in retrospect, could be 
regarded as positive in some way? 
The examples on p. 49 (‘The road 
unwalked’) may serve as a useful 
prompt.
•• What do you think characterises a 
‘good choice’?

Self-management

Your top forty 
Look again at your life story. Count how many examples of personal success you included. Was there at 
least one for every year of your life? If not, consider writing in some more.
Our personal success is rather like breathing: we rarely notice it on an everyday basis. However, it is hard 
to ignore ‘hiccups’ – the things that go wrong. Beaver (1998) argues that we do not spend enough time 
thinking of all the things we can do and spend too long focusing on what we cannot do. She encourages 
us to draw up very long lists of what we can do – and much shorter ones of things we cannot! 
Activity
Top forty strong points
Make a list of your strong points, successes, qualities, attitudes and attributes. List at least forty things. 
If that sounds like too many, you are underestimating yourself. Draw stars by the ten that are your 
greatest assets. Draw circles around the seven of which you are most proud.

Your learning history
In writing out your life story, you may already have 
included some events that had an impact upon 
the way you approach learning. Our early learning 
experiences are amongst the most profound 
influences upon our attainment and current levels 
of performance. They shape our approaches to 
learning itself, shaping our belief in ourselves and 
our ability to see opportunities for improving our 
performance. 
This aspect of our story is a particularly important 
one, and this section provides a focus for 
considering its impact on you.
Reflection: Value your strengths
In your reflective journal, jot down your 
thoughts on the following questions.
•• What is the ONE thing that you do best?
•• What is it like to recognise so many strong 
points in yourself now? How often do you 
stop to value them? 
•• Are these strengths appreciated by the people 
around you? If not, how do you account 
for this? Is it, for example, because you are 
embarrassed about showing your strengths? 
•• Do you surround yourself with people who 
do not appreciate you? If you want to gain 
realistic recognition for your attributes, it is 
up to you to make that happen. What could 
you do to change the situation?

•• Who or what can help you to manage better 
in these areas?
Activity
Learning history
•• List the incidents that have had the most 
significant positive impact on the way you 
now approach study and learn new things. 
This may be anything from times you were 
happy at school, unexpected success in 
a subject, support provided over a long 
period of time, or even just a few words that 
appeared insignificant at the time but left a 
lasting impression on you. 
•• List the incidents that have had a significant 
negative impact on the way you now 
approach study and learn new things. In what 
ways do these affect you now? Now you have 
identified these, what could you do to reduce 
their effect on you?
Activity
Positive learning experiences
Think back to your time at school. Call to mind 
occasions when your learning seemed to flow, 
when it was fun, when you enjoyed learning 
and felt a sense of accomplishment. Make a list, 
now, before reading on, of all the conditions 
that gave rise to such positive learning 
experiences for you. 
If you find this hard, keep returning to the 
sentences:

Common responses
Below is a list of common responses to the activity above. The list is typical of responses drawn from 
diverse groups of people within educational contexts. Check your list against it. You can add items to 
your own list if you think they are true of your experience. 
Reflection: How typical are your experiences
In your reflective journal, jot down responses to the following questions.
•• Is the list you completed about positive learning experiences, on p. 58, similar to or very different 
from the general trend outlined on this page? If your list is considerably different from that given 
here, what reasons might there be for that? 
•• At school, you may have been dependent upon other people to create the right conditions for your

The impact of educational experience 
upon performance
Reflection: The impact of your 
educational experiences
In your reflective journal, jot down responses to 
the following questions.
•• In what ways do you consider your 
educational experiences have had an impact 
upon your performance generally? 
•• What positive things did the educational 
experience give you that you carry through 
life (this may not be classroom learning)?
•• Look again at the items you identified as 
beneficial to your learning in the activity 
‘Positive learning experiences’ (p. 58). Which 
of these could you bring into other situations, 
such as work or personal life, in order to 
enhance your performance, enjoyment or 
sense of satisfaction there?
Responding to setbacks 
In your narrative (page 54) and in your 
consideration of your learning journey, you may 
have identified certain setbacks on your path. 
Setbacks can produce feelings of disappointment, 
discouragement or even ‘denial’ – a pretence that 
nothing went wrong. Whilst we would all rather 
that everything flowed well and without problems, 
when that doesn’t happen, there are still benefits 
to be gained even from disastrous experiences – 
though such benefits may require some rooting 
out or take time to become apparent.
Setbacks and difficulties contain the seeds of 
our future success. As they hold the secret to 
‘what went wrong’, they also contain valuable 
information about what could be done differently. 
Indeed, successful people often claim that they 
learnt more from their failures than from their 
successes, or that they are ‘better people’ because 
of them.  
Apparent failure often brings us face to face with 
realities that we otherwise try to avoid. Setbacks 
can make us stop and take stock, follow new 
paths, meet new people, learn new skills, try things 
out that we wouldn’t have done. In particular, they 
tend to build personal qualities such as resilience, 
coping skills and empathy.
Turn it to advantage
Many people ascribe their success, relative or 
actual, to the way they responded to bad news or 
to adversity. We can make the decision to use our 
experience:
•• as an excuse for not doing something
•• to ‘prove’ something
•• to keep going as before
•• to learn and move forward.
Reflection: The ‘best failure
In your reflective journal, jot down responses to 
at least five of the following questions:
•• What, on the surface of it, was the best 
‘mistake’ of your life?
•• What happened? What was your role in the 
event? 
•• What characterised this event as a failure?
•• What bad choices did you make? 
•• When did you first realise you had made a 
mistake? How did you find out?
•• What lessons did you learn?
•• What benefits resulted from learning those 
lessons?
•• What opportunities arose out of this event?
•• How did the event spur you to action that 
you might not otherwise have taken?
•• What does this event tell you about the 
nature of success and failure?
It is noticeable that the stories of many successful 
people include a critical experience when they 
were dismissed, belittled, ignored, suffered 
discrimination, or suffered a serious setback. 
Paradoxically, dealing with such events, whether 
at the time or later in life, can become the driving 
force that leads to unexpected successes. 
This is very noticeable amongst students who 
face the most extreme difficulties or complex 
circumstances. Students with serious disabilities or 
mature students with multiple responsibilities find 
ways of completing their degrees and developing 
careers when those with fewer difficulties turned

Read through the examples below, looking 
at the ways that each of these three students 
made effective use of their current expertise in 
addressing apparently very different problems they 
had had with their studies. As you read, consider 
how you might draw on their general approach in 
order to make use of your own expertise.
Examples of expertise transfer 
Victor and car maintenance
Victor’s challenge was in producing academic 
writing. He had little writing experience because 
he entered university from a foundation 
programme that did not use formal written 
assignments. He was very reluctant to write 
and was convinced that he lacked the logical, 
sequential skills needed for continuous prose. On 
the other hand, Victor identified a strong interest 
and practical experience in car engines – which he 
used as his ‘expertise metaphor’.
Victor listed all the processes and skills he used 
when working with car engines, and those he used 
to write an essay. He then looked for significant 
points of comparison between the two sets of lists. 
He analysed the ways car mechanics use skills in:
•• finding out information (about the engine)
•• sequencing the order of tasks
•• planning time to meet deadlines
•• weighing up options
•• forming a theory about what is wrong
•• testing out ideas (about how to fix it)
•• selecting between options using the appropriate 
methods for the job
•• prioritising tasks
•• testing out results 
•• re-evaluating the work done
•• reflecting on performance. 
Victor found that the most helpful approach for 
him was to compare the factors that make an 
engine run with those needed for writing an essay. 
He wrote these out as a list of key points which he 
could look at whenever he found academic writing 
difficult. His list is reproduced below. 
This may not be how other people view an essay: 
the important point is that the metaphor worked 
for Victor. It released his potential, not simply to 
write essays, but to write good essays. This was 
because the process of writing now made sense in 
terms of things he really knew about.
back at lesser hurdles. Typically, they learn to 
use the apparent disadvantage as an advantage 
– developing skills in managing time, applying 
technologies, negotiating, multi-tasking or 
prioritising. Anybody can make use of difficulty 
in order to emerge stronger – but not everybody 
does.
Reflection: Make setbacks work for 
your goals
In your reflective journal, consider:
•• What are the potential setbacks that you are 
likely to face in achieving your current goals? 
•• What things might make it difficult for you to 
achieve these goals?
•• What kinds of things might be preventing 
you from achieving the ‘vision’ you identified 
in Chapter 1?
•• Consider how you can turn these setbacks ‘on 
their heads’, so that they become sources of 
strength, inventiveness, motivation or contact 
with others. 
Copy this and attach it where you are likely to 
see it on a regular basis.
Expertise metaphor
When confronted with new tasks, people often say 
things such as: 
•• I don’t know where to start.
•• I can’t cope with this.
•• I am no good at things like this.
•• I am not good enough. 
Sometimes, the gap between previous experience 
and the current task can make the task difficult to 
achieve. Sufficient time and support may make it 
more achievable. 
However, we can take on challenges more easily 
if we can recognise, value and draw upon an area 
of personal expertise. This can happen even if the 
area of expertise seems to bear little relation to 
the task in hand, as the examples below illustrate. 
Conversely, failing to recognise the similarity 
between problems with which we are faced and 
those that we can solve already, is a key obstacle to 
performance.

Roger and aircraft assembly
Roger consistently failed to produce written work. 
He wrote well but was too much of a perfectionist. 
He evolved his ideas well during the process of 
writing and this also meant that, in practice, he 
would need to produce more than one draft. 
However, he always approached each draft as if 
it were the last, starting the whole of his work 
‘in neat’ and editing beautifully as if this were 
the draft he would hand in. This meant he never 
reached the end; for all his hard work, he never 
had anything to hand in. In effect he was fine-
tuning his work too early in the process.
Roger’s area of expertise was assembling light 
aircraft that arrived from overseas as ‘flatpacks’. 
He analysed the process of assembling a plane 
and how this might be similar to or different from 
assembling an essay. At this point, he recognised 
that if he tried to build a plane as he did an essay, 
it would also be impossible. If he tightened all the 
nuts and bolts, sanded it down, painted it and 
so forth on one part of the plane before going 
on to the next part, it would be impossible to 
manoeuvre the pieces into place. Nuts and bolts 
should be tightened, and the final touches added, 
only when the whole plane is in place. Roger could 
easily see the comparison with fine-tuning an essay 
too early. 
Once he had drawn the initial parallel, Roger saw 
many comparisons between aircraft assembly 
and academic problems. He used his previous 
expertise to address these. When introduced to 
new information, for example, he felt he should 
play around with it, like pieces of the flat pack, 
observing roughly how to structure these: ‘As you 
bring them closer together, you are working quite 
globally – with an eye on how it all fits together. Then 
you can home in and complete sections.’ Similarly, 
he could see how good planning and structure 
was like ‘glue’ that held writing together: ‘Keep an 
eye on how the sections will link. Aircraft glue is like a 
linking sentence, or a logical sequence that dovetails 
into the next item.’ 
Example
Victor – My Engine 
When I first started university, I had not worked at the academic level required by university before. 
When I visited the learning development unit … [it was] suggested that I treat an essay like a car 
engine. When I  broke the metaphor (analogy) down, this is what I came up with:
1	 Fuel – this supplies the necessary stored kinetic energy to power the engine – research at the 
library, lectures, seminars.
2	 Battery – this stores the electrical energy – research notes, essay outline.
3	 Oil – this lets the engine run smoothly – spelling and grammar.
4	 The alternator – supplies electrical energy necessary for the engine to run – the essay question, unit 
guide, using aims etc.
5	 Engine ignition system – supplies the spark to ignite the fuel, and the sequence in which the 
cylinders fire. Paragraphs.
6	 Introduction – where this essay is going.
7	 Main body – critical discussion of main points.
8	 Conclusion – insights gained and mileage from essay, i.e.: ‘What I have learned’.
9	 Tool box – this is where the necessary tools are bought, borrowed or acquired, and stored – 
dyslexia workshops, English workshops, Accelerated Learning seminars, etc.
This can be broken down even more … When all the elements of the essay are integrated successfully 
then it should flow like a smoothly running engine.

Self-management

Make it ‘make sense’
Just as Donaldson (1978) showed that young 
children are capable of performing tasks well 
above their supposed developmental level if the 
task is presented in a way that ‘makes sense’ to 
them, so Victor, Roger and Luzia were able to 
demonstrate that this is also true of adult expertise. 
They were able to use their own areas of relative 
expertise to address tasks that they had previously 
considered too difficult for them. They used 
extended metaphors – or an analogical thinking 
process – to accomplish this. If they can do this, so 
can anybody else. 
It is very common for students to resist the idea 
that they are an ‘expert’ in anything. The first task, 
therefore, is to identify an area of expertise. This 
won’t make you ‘arrogant’, as some people fear. 
Rather, it will provide you with a useful problem-
solving tool. There will be one, or many, things that 
have several different stages or aspects to them 
and that you:
•• perform with relative ease
•• can complete without supervision
•• feel comfortable doing – and may even enjoy.
Applying the Expertise Metaphor 
Important aspects of working with the Expertise 
Metaphor are:
•• Don’t worry too much about the apparent 
difference between your area of expertise and 
the problem you are addressing.
•• You don’t need to be Olympic standard to 
consider yourself an ‘expert’ for this exercise.
•• Expertise in everyday or mundane tasks can also 
work.
•• Find out whether it works better for you to use 
features or component parts (as Victor did), 
processes (like Roger) or skills (Luzia).
•• Where possible, aim to find points of similarity 
in the underlying structure of the tasks in which 
you are expert and those you are learning.
•• Don’t rush this – the obvious links can emerge if 
you allow yourself time to mull over the points 
of similarity.
•• If the match in the points of comparison isn’t 
exact, but still helps you understand what you 
need to do, that is the most important thing. 
This is a personal problem-solving approach not 
a literary exercise! 
Luzia and dressmaking
Luzia also had difficulties with essay writing. She 
had extremely low self-esteem and was very 
reluctant to identify any area of expertise. Finally, 
she settled on dressmaking skills. She brainstormed 
all the processes that go into dressmaking, and 
drew parallels between these and essay writing. 
For example, she saw that both dressmaking and 
essay writing required a clear vision of the final 
product. She couldn’t set 
about choosing a pattern or 
buying materials until she 
had a sense of what she 
was trying to achieve. 
She compared this to 
interpreting the 
assignment title 
and having 
a strong 
argument: 
‘Your vision is 
your interest in it – 
without this, you just 
wouldn’t get it done.’ 
Similarly, both newly 
made clothes and essays 
need structure. Before she 
began to make a new item, 
she would decide whether it 
was to have a collar, cuffs or 
pleats and use this to guide her choice of pattern 
and material. For Luzia, laying out a pattern was 
like drawing up an essay plan: ‘the pieces of a 
dressmaking pattern have to be laid out in a precise 
way so that the cloth falls properly’. Similarly, in a 
well planned essay, all the pieces of the argument 
fall logically into place. 
She made further comparisons between tacking 
a dress together before the final sewing and 
writing drafts before a final write-up. Trying a 
dress on to check for ‘final flaws’ was compared 
to proofreading. For Luzia, the most important 
element of dressmaking was having ‘equal seams’. 
She compared this to treating different schools of 
thought equally when writing an essay: ‘you must 
ask the same questions of each’. The dressmaking 
analogy enabled Luzia to make sense of essay 
writing, calling upon her own expertise.

Apply your expertise
Now, use the table below to draw parallels between your area of expertise and the area for 
improvement. Extend the metaphor as far as you can, so that you are really using your area of chosen 
expertise to assist you in the area for improvement. Think of all the ways that the second activity can 
be compared with the first. 
For example, if your area of expertise was ‘playing computer games’ and your area for improvement 
was ‘speaking in public’, keep completing the following sentence: ‘Speaking in public is like playing 
computer games because …’. When you run out of ideas, take a break to do something different. Then 
come back and complete the sentence a few more times.
(c) Applying expertise
List below all the points of comparison between your area of expertise and the task you want to 
address

Closing comments
This chapter has provided structured 
opportunities to reflect upon the way your 
experiences contribute to who you are now, 
the way you respond to challenge, and your 
approach to learning. It invited you to engage 
in a wide range of activities to explore personal 
experiences, choices, strengths and expertise. 
In this chapter, you commenced with a broad 
metaphor of your life and the sweep of your 
personal history. 
You then analysed aspects of that narrative, and 
looked more specifically at your learning history. 
Finally, you narrowed your focus to an area of 
personal expertise and considered how you 
could use this, and your approach to adversity, 
to enhance future performance. Chapter 3 
looks in more detail at the theme of managing 
personal performance.
When we write and explain our life story with 
integrity, it may seem as though there could 
only be one possible way to tell it and that 
we have been true to the ‘facts’. However, if 
you work through activities that explore your 
experiences from diverse angles and at different 
times, you are very likely to find that your 
responses change. The main events may remain 
similar, but the way you write about them, the 
details you choose to emphasise, the way you 
interpret them over time, will change as your 
experience, attitudes and perspectives change.
It is because our personal narratives and their 
interpretation are open to change that we 
can take our story at any one time and look 
to see what it tells us about our approach to 
life. Some people have very extreme sets of life 
experiences, yet when they tell their stories, 
they emphasise the unexpected benefits or 
the people they met or the characteristics they 
developed as a result. Another person may have 
less challenging experiences and yet respond as 
if one of these has the power to control their life 
for ever. 
We are the writers of our own story, we shape 
its narrative, we provide the interpretations. 
The interpretations we make can be a source of 
energy and motivation that carries us towards 
our vision of success.

Introduction
In the previous chapter you considered your own 
life journey and how you characterised yourself 
within this by using metaphors such as ‘the hero’ 
or by exaggerating elements of your story to form 
caricatures. 
This chapter is about deepening your 
understanding of what you need in order to 
‘get things done’ – that is, to perform at all, to 
perform well and in ways that best suit you. It 
encourages you to take a personalised approach to 
learning and performance and provides a toolbox 
of resources to help you identify your personal 
preferences.
The activities enable you to consider the key 
factors that help and hinder you in achieving 
your best. From these, you will be able to derive 
your own personal formula for success and put 
this to the test. Activities also encourage you to 
consider how to work with your preferences – or, if 
necessary, how to work around them. 
Chapter 3
Understanding your personal 
performance
Learning or performance?
Anything we do depends partly on what we have 
learnt and partly on how we put that learning into 
action. Broadly speaking:
1	 Learning is about finding out ‘how to ... ’ 
– whether through accident, experience, 
instruction, developing theoretical instruction, 
practice, or other means.
2	 Performance includes learning, but involves 
putting learning, knowledge, skills, personal 
qualities and experience into practice.
We may be better at one of these than the other, 
at either learning or performance. We may, for 
example, have learnt a speech well but not be 
able to deliver it in a public setting, or find it hard 
to learn a speech yet be good at public speaking 
once the pressure is on. In general, people judge 
us by how well we perform – not by what we 
think we have learnt. This means that it is well 
worth considering the conditions that enable us to 
perform at our best.
Learning outcomes
This chapter gives you opportunities to:
•• identify how your learning and performance are affected by your current skills, habits, attitudes, 
performance, experience and strategies (SHAPES)
•• identify conditions that most suit your learning and performance
•• gain an understanding of personalised approaches to learning and performance
•• identify your personal formula for easier and more successful performance
•• apply your personal performance formula to different contexts.

Understanding your personal performance

Types of learner
In recent decades, there has been 
much consideration of types of learner 
and styles of doing things – such 
as visual or auditory or kinaesthetic 
learning styles. There is a chance to 
have a go at this for yourself later in the 
chapter.
As performance includes learning, the 
information gained from such exercises 
is relevant to understanding your 
overall personal performance. You will 
probably find that what you discover 
about your performance preferences 
can also inform your approach to study. 
Unique individuals 
Although there are trends in 
preferences, which suggest ‘types’ of 
person or learner, this book takes the 
position that we are each unique in the 
particulars of:
•• how we learn
•• what we bring to our learning
•• how we respond to new tasks, 
circumstances, people and challenge
•• what we need in order to perform at 
our best.
Those particular details can be what 
really counts – if not all the time, then 
at least for specific activities or for 
significant tasks and occasions. 
We all have preferences in the way 
we work and study. One of countless 
things may have a profound effect 
upon your performance. Dunn and 
Dunn, for example, isolated 21 
different factors that affect learning. 
They found that some people are very 
sensitive to particular conditions, and 
they can under-achieve if these are 
not in place. Sometimes, changing 
something as small as your seating 
position, the light, or the way you 
study can have a dramatic effect (Dunn 
et al., 1995). 
This chapter enables you to study your 
own learning preferences in detail. 
Achieving peak performance
More than just getting by
Much of the time, we can ‘get by’ doing things in broadly 
the same way as other people or using strategies that have 
worked in the past. However, if we wish, we can take action 
that enables us to achieve more than just doing ‘OK’. 
We can benefit from considering what really works for us as 
individuals, from gaining an in-depth knowledge of ourselves 
and the conditions that enable us to perform well with 
maximum ease. The importance of attention to detail, even 
details that appear to be superficial, is recognised by those for 
whom success is important. 
The example of top athletes
Top athletes look at how making fine adjustments to their 
training, equipment, and technique can give them an 
advantage, sometimes even of just a fraction of a second or 
point.  They and the teams that support them look at every 
angle – the weather, features in the physical environment, 
diet, clothing, and so forth, both during training (whilst 
learning) and for the day of the competition. What is 
needed for training may be different from what is needed for 
competing. 
This approach to shaping your mindset and behaviours in 
order to achieve ‘peak performance’ can be adapted and 
applied to academic and work performance 
too. The various activities in this chapter 
are designed to support you
in considering the details of your 
performance.
Select the occasion
We do not need to pay minute 
attention to each aspect of every 
activity we undertake unless the 
stakes are very high. However, it is 
useful to be aware of what impacts 
upon our performance so that we 
can call on that self-knowledge on 
those occasions when we want to 
do well, have a competitive edge or 
conserve time and energy.
68
Self-management

SHAPES stands for Skills, Habits, Attitudes, 
Preferences, Experience and Strategies. 
Combined, these make us distinctive in how 
we learn and perform. Understanding our own 
SHAPES for diverse activities can assist us in 
achieving our ‘peak’, or optimal, performance.
Skills
Skills, here, refers to abilities and techniques 
that help you to perform effectively at study or 
work – such as: Academic, People, Task and Self-
management skills, mentioned on pages 18–23.
•• In what ways is your own performance affected 
by your current skills?
Habits
When one set of actions or behaviours has served 
us well in the past, it is tempting just to repeat 
them in new situations – even if they don’t work 
well any more. It is generally easier to do what 
is familiar rather than risk trying out new ways 
of doing things. Sometimes our habits were not 
very helpful in the first place. Consider:
•• Are you attached to any study habits or 
patterns of behaviour that are not really 
helping your current study/work? If so, what 
needs to change?
Attitudes
Whether we are conscious of it or not, our 
learning and performance are affected by the 
attitudes and beliefs that we bring to them. These 
have a powerful effect on our behaviours and 
emotions, as well as on how others perceive us 
and react to us. That is true of academic contexts 
just as in everyday life.
•• Do you bring a constructive, ‘can-do’, self-
motivating attitude to your study?
•• Do you feel comfortable about academic 
success? If not, do you let yourself 
underperform?
•• How could you flex your attitude to your 
studies to help improve your overall 
performance?
a
Preferences
We all have preferred ways of doing things. Some 
believe there are inherent, immutable ‘learning 
styles’; others consider such ‘styles’ to be deeply 
seated preferences that simply indicate our ‘comfort 
zones’. Either way, it is useful to be aware of our 
styles or preferences, so that we can evaluate how 
well these are working for us.
Following our preferences can make tasks more 
enjoyable, less of an effort, more intuitive, and 
make it easier to stay on task for longer. However, 
we can become over-attached to one set of 
approaches: what worked last year or last week 
for a different assignment or with different people 
is not working effectively for us any more. It is 
useful to be able to recognise when that happens. 
Be ready to experiment afresh. If you find you are 
becoming bored or disengaged, try something 
new.
•• How well do you draw upon your learning styles 
or preferences to shape your approach to study 
(or work)?
•• Which, if any, have downsides that prevent you 
achieving at your best? What needs to change?
Experience
Our past experience shapes our readiness and 
confidence to take on new tasks, and the way we 
make sense of what is required. Pages 58–60 looked 
at the impact of experiences upon your learning.
•• How are your past experiences shaping the way 
you approach your current study?
Strategies
If you have a good understanding of what has an 
impact on your performance, you are in a good 
position to devise strategies that help you perform 
at your best.
•• Do you put time aside to devise study strategies 
that take account of the diverse factors that affect 
your performance?
•• Do you reconsider and adapt your study 
strategies from time to time to meet changing 
circumstances and fit new study tasks?
Personal performance and learning SHAPES
69
Understanding your personal performance

As with other kinds of critical self-evaluation, SHAPES can help you make sense of personal performance 
at a given moment and over time. You can capture your evaluation visually and see at a glance how your 
judgements change over time.
This is illustrated below for two students, Noleen and Idris. Their self-ratings changed a great deal in the 
first eight weeks of their course, as they gained more experience both of study and in making balanced 
self-evaluations. The criteria they used are available on pages 72–5 for you to use yourself.
Changing SHAPES
Noleen
In week 1, Noleen gave herself the lowest ratings for almost everything. By week 8, she has both a 
more balanced appreciation of herself and more experience of study.
Noleen had had very little recent experience of study, so that, even in week 8, her study skills and 
habits are still relatively weak. On the other hand, she recognises that, in life and at work, she 
is self-motivating, well used to dealing with challenges constructively and sticking with difficult 
tasks until they are completed. These are useful attributes to bring to her studies. Her preferred 
ways of approaching tasks serve her well at work so she is monitoring them to see whether they 
prove effective for study too. This is reflected in her improved ratings for attitude, preferences and 
experience.

Changing SHAPES
Idris
Idris did very well at school and expected to find university easy. In week 1, all of his self-ratings were 
high. 
By week 8, he finds study harder than expected and his SHAPES evaluation is more realistic – and 
looks very different.
Idris is aware that he has become over-distracted by his social life and doesn’t put in the study hours 
that he should. He thinks his grades are likely to suffer as a result, and is starting to feel discouraged 
and demotivated.
Although school prepared Idris well for many aspects of his course, he didn’t learn how to cope when 
things don’t go well. He realises this, so his rating for ‘Experience’ has dropped. He still rates ‘Skills’ 
highly, but feedback from his tutors and friends has persuaded him that his study habits are not as 
good as he thought and that his attitude is holding him back.
Idris is honest in admitting that he tends to study in ways that suit his preferences for socialising 
rather than what might work best for his grades. He recognises that he needs to change his study 
strategy in order to achieve well on his course.

Once you have derived your SHAPES profile, how can you make use of this to help you achieve success? 
Below are some suggestions.
1  ‘Honesty’ Check
Look back over your self-ratings. Consider 
whether you might have made an inaccurate 
rating for whatever reason. Be frank and 
honest with yourself.
Amend your ratings if necessary so that they 
are a true reflection that you can rely upon 
if you want to compare your self-ratings at a 
later date.
2  Validity Check
Share your SHAPES profile with a friend, 
mentor, peer or tutor whose opinion you 
trust. Ask them whether it appears to them to 
be an accurate reflection of what they know 
of you as a student or colleague.
Although you do not need to agree with what 
they say, be open to their feedback. Consider 
what this tells you about yourself. If relevant, 
amend your SHAPES profile accordingly.
3  Evaluate your ‘Snap’ SHAPES 
profile
Compare the snap SHAPES profile you made 
initially with the one based on your detailed 
self-ratings. Reflect on the accuracy of your 
snap judgement. Where were you most, or 
least, accurate? How might that be significant 
for you in understanding your attitudes 
towards your learning and performance?
4  Provide your analysis
Look again at the brief analyses of Noreen’s 
and Idris’s SHAPES on pp. 70–1. Provide a 
similar brief analysis of your own SHAPES 
profile. In doing so, consider the interaction 
of the different factors with each other.
You may be able to identify where 
improvements or changes in one or two 
factors could lead to improvements across 
several others aspects of your profile and 
performance.
Personal performance factors 
The activities on pages 78–88 are designed to help 
you analyse the impact of different influences and 
conditions upon your personal performance. For 
those activities that use scored ratings, a high score 
in one area does not necessarily mean that you are a 
certain ‘type’ of learner or person; it suggests that you 
have habits, styles or preferences that may influence 
successful performance.
5  Use your performance preferences
Our preferences for approaching a task can exert a 
strong influence over our ability to perform well. When 
studying and working independently, as is typical in 
higher education, we have much leeway to work in 
accordance with our own preferences. We can choose 
which preferences to use, adapt, or work around. In 
doing this, the following steps can help.
1	 Identify your options. Think through the myriad 
options open to you for adapting the conditions 
under which you study or work. (See pages 77–8.)
2	 Identify your preferences. Identify, in a systematic 
way, the options you prefer. Do this for your 
preferences generally and/or for your preferences 
for a particular type of task or assignment.
3	 Identify the strengths of such preferences. 
Consider which of your preferences if any appear to 
exert a profound effect on your performance. These 
are likely to be those items with high self-evaluation 
ratings.
4	 Consider impact. For such strong preferences (or 
aversions), consider when and how these affect 
the way you approach your study (or other tasks, if 
relevant).
5	 Take action. Think of ways that you can adapt your 
study to take on board your preferences, to enhance 
your learning experience and achievement.
Use the following pages to identify and adapt your 
Personal Performance Formula.

Personal Performance Factors
1  Structure 
The following activity looks at how far you prefer to work in structured or unstructured ways. Rate each 
pair of statements only once. Rating: select from a scale where 3 = ‘very strong preference’ and 0 would 
mean ‘no preference’.

Score for less structure ___________
Score for more structure ___________
Total score:
Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you are flexible  
for this factor. 
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form 
a particular pattern. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘Less structure’ 
column suggests you have a strong preference 
for working or studying in your own way at 
your own time. This can be a very creative 
and independent way of working. It is worth 
considering whether a more organised and 
structured approach would help. Danger points 
to watch for are missing deadlines and not 
fulfilling the requirements for an assignment. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘More structure’ 
column suggests you have a strong preference 
for working or studying in an organised and 
systematic way. This can be a very productive 
way of working, and you are likely to be 
someone who gets things done and in an 
organised and timely fashion. It is worth 
considering whether more flexibility and 
openness to new ideas would benefit your 
performance. Danger points to watch for are 
over-rigid ways of thinking and working.
•• Scores of 10–20 for either column suggest 
moderate over-dependence on your personal 
preferences. It may be useful to experiment with 
features of the opposite column.

Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you are flexible for  
this factor. 
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form a 
particular pattern. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘Less external direction’ 
column suggests you have a strong preference 
for taking control over how you work. This can 
be very useful in developing as an independent, 
autonomous learner, capable of taking on new 
projects and setting targets for yourself. It is worth 
considering whether you need to be more open 
to ideas from others. Danger points to watch for 
are possible weaknesses in team working and not 
fulfilling the requirements for an assignment. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘More external direction’ 
column suggests you are very open to direction 
and leadership from others. This can be useful in 
ensuring that you are going in the right direction, 
for using time economically and for team working. 
It is worth considering whether you need to take 
more control over your own learning and be 
more open to exploration and risk-taking. Danger 
points to watch for are reliance on others to do 
your thinking and planning, and underdeveloped 
personal independence and leadership.
•• Scores of 10–20 for either column suggest 
moderate over-dependence on your personal 
preferences for study. It may be useful to 
experiment with features of the opposite column.

3  Working with others 
The following set of questions looks at how far you prefer to work with or without other people. Rate 
each pair of statements only once. Rating: select from a scale where 3 = ‘very strong preference’ and  
0 would mean ‘no preference’.  
Preference for working with 
others
Preference for working alone
1	 I prefer group work 
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I prefer to work on my own 
2	 In a library, I prefer to sit near 
others 
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
In a library, I prefer to sit on my own 
3	 I like to go through lecture 
notes with a friend

private
4	 I value hearing other people’s 
ideas
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I prefer to develop my own ideas 
5	 I enjoy the interaction in group 
work
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I enjoy thinking through an idea in 
quiet reflection
6	 I learn more through discussion 
than reading
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I learn more from reading than 
discussion
7	 I find groups come up with 
more ideas
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I come up with more ideas on my 
own 
8	 For me, team working is really 
useful
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
For me, team working is a waste of 
time
9	 I like to discuss study 
assignments with others
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I prefer working alone on study 
assignments
10	 I would find a study support 
group helpful
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I work best if left to myself 
Score for working with others ___________
Score for working alone ___________
Total score:
Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you are flexible for  
this factor. 
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form a 
particular pattern. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘working with others’ 
column suggests a strong social preference 
when working or studying. This can be very 
useful for gaining a wide set of perspectives 
and ideas, for developing social skills, for team 
working and for developing mutual support. 
It is worth considering how far you would 
benefit from more time studying independently. 
Danger points are possible over-reliance on 
others and not developing your own ideas in an 
independent way. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘working alone’ column 
suggests a strong preference for solitary working. 
This can be useful for avoiding distractions, for 
achieving goals, and developing independence. 
It is worth considering in more depth what can 
be gained from working with others and the skills 
that emerge from reconciling different sets of 
opinions and personalities. You may lose out by 
not gaining access to a wide set of perspectives, 
especially in real-life or ‘applied’ settings. Danger 
points may be failure to appreciate the work of 
others and under-developed inter-personal skills.
•• Scores of 10–20 for either column suggest 
moderate over-dependence on your personal 
preferences. It may be useful to experiment with 
features of the opposite column.

4  Level of physical stimulus 
The following set of questions looks at how far physical factors may affect the way you work. Rate each 
pair of statements only once. Rating: select from a scale where 3 = ‘very strong preference’ and 0 would 
mean ‘no preference’.  
High stimulus
Low stimulus
1	 I need to work in a very bright 
room  
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I need to work in a very dim light
2	 I need music or TV in the 
background  
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I need absolute quiet to work
3	 I work well when there is a lot 
going on in the background
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
My attention is very easily distracted
4	 I always eat when I am studying  
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I can’t think about food when I am 
studying
5	 I need to drink a lot when 
studying  
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I never drink whilst studying 
6	 I work best when it is either very 
hot or cold
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I prefer a moderate room temperature
7	 I tend to fiddle with things as I 
work
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I am quite still when I settle down to 
work
8	 It helps me to think if I walk 
about  
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I can’t think if I am moving about 
9	 Doodling helps me to listen in 
meetings and lectures
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I focus on listening and making notes 
in meetings and lectures
10	 I prefer to work on several things 
at once
3    2    1    0    1    2    3
I need to finish one thing before 
starting another
Score for working with others ___________
Score for working alone ___________
Total score:
Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you have a high 
tolerance for working in most conditions.
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form a 
particular pattern. 
•• Scores of 0–1 for any item suggests that you 
have a reasonable tolerance for working without 
that stimulus being present. 
•• Scores of 2 for any item suggests that your 
performance might be affected if that stimulus is 
not present.
•• Scores of 3 for any item suggests your 
performance might be seriously affected if that 
stimulus is not present. You may need to think 
creatively about how you can make it possible to 
provide that stimulus for most study contexts (for 
example, if you are light sensitive, by using bright 
lamps to increase the lighting or by wearing hats 
or sunglasses to dim light).
•• A score of 20–30 for either column suggests a 
very strong overall preference for working either 
with or without stimulus. Given this preference, 
it is possible that if these stimuli were not present 
when you were being taught in childhood, 
learning may have felt difficult for you. High 
scores may also indicate a high level of stress. It 
may be helpful to speak to a counsellor or adviser 
about this. 
Experiment 
It is worth experimenting with studying with different kinds of stimuli present or absent. Monitor how far 
these do affect your performance. For example, many people have been surprised at how far they follow 
a pattern set down when they were at school as if that were the only ‘right’ way to study or work when 
alone. You will find that you learn more easily if you find the stimulus combination that suits you best.

Score for global styles ___________
Score for serialist styles ___________
Total score:
Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you are flexible for this 
factor. 
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form a 
particular pattern. 
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘Global style’ column 
suggests you have a strong preference for taking 
a holistic approach to work or study. This can 
be very useful for synthesising information, and 
making creative links. It is worth considering 
whether you need to bring more order and 
system to your activities. Look for possible 
weaknesses in managing clarity, detail, order and 
sequence in your work or writing.
•• A score of 20–30 for the ‘Serialist styles’ 
column suggests you take a logical, analytical 
approach to study. This can be very useful in 
ensuring clarity and structure in your work. It is 
worth considering whether you need to create 
opportunities for developing your imagination 
and intuition. It may help to experiment with 
searching out links and connections between 
ideas. Possible weaknesses may be in drawing 
together your ideas into a strong whole and 
in making connections between what you are 
studying and the bigger picture.
•• Scores of 10–20 for either column suggest 
moderate strengths for that style of working. It 
may be useful to experiment with features of the 
opposite column.

enough’
Score for high pressure ___________
Score for low pressure ___________
Total score:
Interpreting your score
•• Total score: 0–10 suggests you are flexible for 
this factor. 
•• Total score: 20–30 suggests you have very 
strong preferences, though these may not form 
a particular pattern. 
•• Scores of 20–30 for ‘high pressure’ suggest 
that you are likely to respond well to exams, 
competition and targets. You need to take care 
to manage stress levels and check carefully that 
they are not adversely affecting performance, 
behaviour and health without your realising. You 
may need to set your own targets for activities 
that you find boring or of low importance.
•• Scores of 20–30 for ‘low pressure’ suggest that 
you may be good at protecting your health and 
well-being, and at producing good work even 
when there isn’t external pressure to do so. You 
need to beware of over-sensitivity to stress and 
to external requirements and conditions. 
•• Scores of 10–20 for either high or low pressure 
suggest moderate preferences for that way of 
working. It may be helpful to experiment with 
features of the opposite column.

8  Honey and Mumford learning styles
Honey and Mumford (1992) developed a questionnaire that divided people into four main types. A broad 
outline of their learning types is given below. Which of the following are generally true of you (there may 
be more than one)? Which is the most true?
■
■‘Activist’ learning style. I prefer to work in intuitive, flexible and spontaneous ways, generating ideas 
and trying out new things. I usually have a lot to say and contribute. I like to learn from experience, 
such as through problem-solving, group work, workshops, discussion, or team work. 
■
■‘Reflector’ learning style. I like to watch and reflect, gathering data and taking time to consider all 
options and alternatives before making a decision. Lectures, project work and working alone suit me.
■
■’Theorist’ learning style. I like to learn by going through things thoroughly and logically, step by 
step, with clear guidelines, and to feel I have learnt solidly before I have to apply what I know. I prefer 
to learn from books, problem-solving and discussion. 
■
■‘Pragmatist’ learning style. I like to learn by ‘trying things out’ to see if they work, just getting on 
with it, getting to the point. I like to be practical and realistic. I prefer to learn on work-based projects 
and practical applications.
•• Do you think you might benefit from choosing certain types of study module or programme in order 
to ensure the teaching and assessment match your preferred learning type?

Scoring
Each statement that you rated above indicates a preference for either a visual, auditory or kinaesthetic 
way of learning and performing. 
•• Visual learners find it easier to learn if information is presented so they can see it, and where they use 
their eyes or visual imagination to learn.
•• Auditory learners learn best by hearing and recalling sound cues.
•• Kinaesthetic learners tend to learn best where there is a physical sensation, such as movement, touch 
or a feeling. 
Write down your scores for each statement and then add up your totals.

Interpreting your score
No strong preference: If your scores for all three areas are similar, then you may not have a strong sensory 
preference for learning. If your scores are high (40–48 for each area), then you use all of your senses 
well to assist your learning. If scores are low (between 0 and 24), you may need to use your senses more 
consciously to assist your learning and experiment more with your learning.
A strong preference: The more marked the preference for one sense, the more you may need to ensure 
that you find ways of making good use of it, in order to make learning easier. Consider how you could 
incorporate into your study all the items listed above for that sense. Be creative. You might also like to 
consider whether you would gain from using the other senses more.

Personal Performance Profile 
If you have worked through some or all of the activities in this and the previous chapter, it is likely that 
you have generated a great deal of information about what you need in order to get things done. The 
following activities enable you to pare that down to find the key factors in your performance profile. 
Personal Profile: Chart
The chart below enables you to draw together your scores and ratings for the activities on pages (78–86) 
so that your preferences for each aspect stand out clearly. 
If you notice that you feel energised when it comes to writing out some items, that already provides a 
clue as to your performance needs. However, if you feel your energy wanes when it comes to writing out 
certain items, this could indicate EITHER items you can omit as not significant to your performance OR 
items you know you should include as they work or are ‘good for you’ but which you don’t actually like. If 
you need it, include it.

Use your responses on  the Personal Performance Profile Chart above to analyse your profile. Consider 
what this tells you about your preferences. In particular:
•• Note the aspect for which you gave the highest rating(s).
•• Note the aspect for which you gave the lowest rating(s).
•• Note whether you tend to have all high, or all low, or all moderate ratings, or whether you have no 
preferences at all. 
What do these trends suggest to you about what you need in order to perform at your best?

Select key factors  
The Personal Performance Profile Chart above 
enabled you to gain one perspective on your 
performance profile. 
However, you may have noticed that you have 
strong preferences for particular factors listed in 
the activities on pages 78–86 but not for every 
factor as a whole. For example, you may have 
a strong preference for one or two items listed 
for ‘Less Structure’ (page 78) but all your other 
preferences might have been for ‘More structure’. 
You may have had an even number of strong 
preferences on each list so that this balanced out 
as no overall pattern of preference. 
The profiling activity below enables you to draw 
together specific information from each activity, so 
that you can see your key information more clearly. 
Look back over your responses to the activities on 
pages (78–86). Consider what each tells you about 
your preferences for getting things done. Select 
those items that you feel stand out strongly for 
you and list these below. An example of how you 
might approach this is given in italics on the chart 
below.

Personal Performance Formula   
The two previous activities enabled you to summarise a wide range of information about your personal 
performance. In the next activity, you can distil this information further in order to identify your Personal 
Performance Formula (PPF). This isn’t a ‘scientific’ formula – it is your personal formula as identified 
through your own structured reflection, your analysis of how you do things, and your own selection of 
factors that are important to you.
Activity
Personal Performance Factors
From the factors you identified in the two previous activities (pages 87–8), select and list up to 10 that 
are the most significant for you. It is up to you how many you list, where you select these factors from, 
and how you word them so that they are meaningful to you.

Name it! 
It is likely that you have identified 
a unique combination of factors – 
which is why this is referred to as your 
Personal Performance Formula (PPF). 
As such, that unique combination, or 
formula, won’t yet have a name. It is a 
good idea to give it one. 
Naming your performance formula 
helps:
•• to summarise the list of relevant 
performance factors
•• to make the formula your own
•• to remember it when needed. 
That name will, of course, be personal 
to you – so the more individual it is, 
the better. It can:
•• be as long or as short as you like 
•• summon up a sound, image or 
feeling that means something to 
you 
•• rhyme if you want it too
•• include your name – or not
•• hint at your performance 
preferences 
•• be based around a famous person 
or fictitious character
•• be humorous – or not
•• something entirely different!
Activity
Name your PPF
•• Read through the factors 
you listed for your Personal 
Performance Formula (PPF). 
•• Decide on a name that you 
feel sums up your personal 
performance preferences.
•• Write it below – in a style that 
suits you!
Task-specific performance factors
When does the PPF work?
So far, you have identified a generalised performance formula. 
For some people, one broad set of factors, their Personal 
Performance Formula (PPF), is applicable to almost everything 
they do; for others, factors that influence performance vary 
greatly from one task to another. Indeed, one reason why 
people underachieve is that they cling to factors that were 
successful in the past or to a specific context, and apply them 
to tasks or contexts where they do not have the same effect. 
Now that you have identified your Personal Performance 
Formula, it is worth considering when and how this applies in 
practice, using the following activities. 
Activity
Test your PPF on different tasks
Test out your Personal Performance Formula (PPF) for 
constancy.
•• Select two distinct tasks or activities that vary in scale, 
character, or both. Write brief details of these in the two 
tables provided below (pages 91–2).
•• On the tables below, write out the list of up to 10 
factors that you identified for your PPF (page 89). If you 
wrote down many details against each factor, then just 
summarise the information you gave.
•• Jot down how each factor applies to the task or activity 
you identified.
•• Decide whether, overall, the PPF does apply to the task or 
activity (circle YES or NO).
Don’t worry! Hold out your hand to it. Cats 
like to sniff you first to make sure you’re friendly

Did it apply? 
If at least half of your PPF factors applied 
to both tasks, then you have identified a 
PPF with general applicability. The higher 
the number of factors that applied to 
each task, the stronger your formula 
is likely to be. This makes life relatively 
easy! It is worth noting your PPF and 
considering how you can apply it to 
tasks where you feel it will be helpful. 
Could you have a stronger task-
specific PPF?
Even though you have identified a 
personal performance formula that will 
work for you for different tasks, it is still 
worth checking whether a different 
formula might be even more successful 
for specific kinds of task.
You can do this by:
•• evaluating the relative significance 
of each factor for particular tasks or 
contexts
•• considering whether other factors 
could make a difference for specific 
tasks or contexts.
If you do note such differences, then you 
have identified a task-specific PPF which 
may serve you better. Note it down. 
Consider a way of ensuring that you will recall this 
when it would be helpful, such as by giving it a 
name of its own. 
If the PPF didn’t apply
It is not unusual for people to identify different sets 
of factors that impact upon their performance in 
distinct tasks. For example, the factors that apply 
to successful study when working on a piece of 
coursework are very likely to be different from 
those that apply in the exam room or a work-
based project.
If few of the factors you had identified applied to 
the tasks you selected for testing the PPF, then you 
haven’t identified a generally applicable Personal 
Performance Formula; you have identified that 
your PPF would be specific to certain types of 
activity. 
You are also likely to be more sensitive to context. 
Success for you may depend on how well you 
think through your performance needs in relation 
to particular tasks and situations. If you are not 
achieving the outcomes you want, then it is 
especially important for you to plan significant 
tasks carefully, identifying what you need and how 
you will put that into place so as to maximise your 
chances of success. 
You may benefit from identifying a Personal 
Performance Formula for each type of significant 
task or context. If you think this is so:
•• list the key factors (in summary)
•• devise a name for each PPF
•• consider a way of ensuring that you will recall 
this PPF when you need it – and the kinds of task 
or activity to which it applies.

Understanding your personal performance

Applying your Personal Performance 
Formula 
Playing to your strengths 
In the activities above, you identified how you 
prefer to do things and the conditions under which 
you prefer to take action. There is a lot of sense 
in working to your preferences as you are likely to 
be operating in ways that are most comfortable 
and familiar for you. If you are feeling at ease and 
happy with your conditions then, in general, you 
are more likely to:
•• be ‘playing to your strengths’
•• be willing to engage with the task
•• be able to focus on the task in hand
•• avoid needless pressure and stress
•• avoid emotional states that detract from your 
performance
•• be less distracted by your surroundings.
If you have identified a PPF, then it makes sense to 
use it.
Making it work
Your performance preferences will sometimes be 
easy to accommodate where you work or study. 
Inevitably, on other occasions, there will not be 
an exact match between the way you want to 
work and study and the way that others teach or 
manage, or in terms of what is expected in the 
particular circumstances.
It is up to you to identify:
•• what factors are essential to enable you to 
perform at your best
•• whether there is some way that these could be 
accommodated
•• how you can adapt either your needs or the task 
in order to work to your preferences
•• how you will work around the ‘gaps’ if your PPF 
cannot be accommodated.
In the next chapters, you will find further ideas 
and resources that can help you to manage your 
performance.
Finding a way
Although there will be times when you have to 
work in conditions that are not ideal, consider 
whether you could negotiate with your employer 
or tutor for more flexibility so you can better apply 
your Personal Performance Formula. It might be 
possible, for example, to: 
•• complete part of a task at home where you can 
adapt the conditions to suit you
•• work in a quieter room for tasks where you need 
to concentrate
•• defer the task until a time that suits your ways of 
working
•• have longer to perform one task if you can take 
less time on another
•• work with a colleague on parts of the task that 
play to mutual strengths
•• negotiate the deadlines on an aspect of the task
•• swap that task for another.
Reflection: Find a way
Consider one task that you are finding difficult 
at the moment. Which aspects of the task or 
your work/study conditions could you negotiate 
in order to be able to work on this more easily 
in line with your personal performance formula?
‘What I like’ versus ‘what actually works?’
Check whether your preferences are helping or 
hindering! Although it can be beneficial to work to 
your preferences, it may be that you have selected 
a range of factors that:
•• narrow your overall range of choices
•• make life more comfortable but offer too little 
challenge
•• reduce pressure but don’t get the job done
•• reduce your chances of gaining something that 
matters to you
•• put too much pressure on other people to 
accommodate your needs. 
This requires you to be very frank with yourself. 
You are likely to know whether you are fooling 
yourself that your preferences are working if they 
are not. If your work, marks or feedback from 
others are not improving, then it is likely that you 
need to reconsider – and identify the formula that 
really will work!
94
Self-management

Closing comments
In this chapter, you have analysed in depth 
many features of your own learning and 
performance. You had a chance to evaluate 
the relative impact of your skills, habits, 
attitudes, preferences, experience and 
strategies on your current performance. 
Your SHAPES profile can be used to reflect 
upon changes that you recognise in your 
approach to your studies over time. You 
may find it instructive to compare your 
own judgements with those made of you 
by friends or your tutors.
The activities enabled you to take stock 
of the conditions that you consider to be 
important if you are to perform at your 
best. You have been able to apply this self-
knowledge in order to identify your own 
personal performance formula (PPF) and 
then considered how that formula might 
need to be adapted for specific tasks and 
situations.
Whilst you are encouraged to use your 
preferences and to identify ways of 
making these work to your advantage, 
you also need to be honest with yourself 
in identifying where personal preferences 
might be a hindrance. 
As adult learners, we can adapt conditions 
to suit our personal needs. We can find 
ways of making effective use of our 
physical senses in order to better absorb 
and remember information. We can give 
thought to the assumptions we make 
about our learning and the restrictions we 
place upon ourselves. Whilst we cannot 
control all the circumstances that affect 
us, we do have the power to shape our 
thinking so that we learn more from our 
experiences. We can choose to have more 
power over our minds and to take control 
over our learning and performance. 
Attention to the fine details of learning and 
performance in this way is akin to the work 
of athletes in attending to the multiple 
variables that enable them to achieve ‘peak 
performance’. Applying such knowledge 
at the right time may give you the edge 
you need to achieve well in your studies 
or, indeed, in other contexts. If you find 
this approach interesting, you may also 
be interested in its application to tests and 
exams in Cottrell (2012).

Self-management

Chapter 4
Successful self-management
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• identify tools and resources for successful self-management
•• understand the importance of constructive attitudes to success in any field
•• evaluate and develop your emotional intelligence
•• identify factors that prevent you from achieving excellence.
Introduction
Self-management encompasses a very broad range 
of skills, qualities, attitudes and experience. It can 
include some or all of the following:
•• being able to analyse your situation, identifying 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats 
(SWOT analysis)
•• identifying resources and sources of support
•• managing your time
•• adopting attitudes that support your aims
•• taking a solution-focused approach to managing 
problems
•• managing your own emotions
•• coping when in distress
•• managing change, uncertainty and  
confusion.
These are usually demanded of students whilst at 
university or in their first jobs, and are addressed  
in this chapter. There are associated skills and 
strategies covered in other chapters. For  
example:
•• being a self-starter (Chapter 6)
•• being able to motivate yourself to finish what 
you start (Chapter 6)
•• taking steps to improve your own performance 
(all chapters)
•• being assertive (Chapter 5).
Intra-personal skills
‘Intra-personal’ refers to your own inner world, in 
contrast to ‘inter-personal’, which refers to how 
you relate to other people. Intra-personal skills 
help us to manage our feelings, responses and 
actions, so that we are able to function at our 
best. Some branches of psychology have long 
recognised the importance of our emotional well-
being to our capacity to perform well. You may 
have noticed this on occasions such as exams, if 
anxiety or personal matters prevented you from 
concentrating or remembering. 
The world of emotions
The ‘intra-personal’ world has the most profound 
effect upon our responses, our thinking, our 
behaviour, our views of ourselves, our feelings and 
our achievement. It touches upon what is closest 
to our hearts and being. It is, especially, the arena 
of the emotions. When we work with emotions, 
we can expect to feel emotional at times. Most of 
us can find this quite challenging, and so there is 
a temptation to shy away from developing intra-
personal skills. If we try to avoid any issue where 
emotions may be involved, it can mean we do 
not get to the heart of the issue, and so do not 
achieve all we could. On the other hand, when we 
understand more about ourselves, know our own 
triggers, and develop our emotional intelligence, 
we are more able to manage every situation we 
enter.
97
Successful self-management

This chapter forms a brief introduction to a very 
wide-ranging subject. It does not go into detail 
about sensitive subjects but, given the differences 
in our life stories, it is to be expected that 
some activities may be emotionally sensitive for 
individuals. 
If you feel you need to talk something through 
as a result of any activities, it is worth noting that 
student counselling services were set up to deal 
with all kinds of matters, small issues as well as 
major ones. You do not need to be in a crisis to 
see them. Services are confidential and they may 
also be able to find support for you away from the 
university if you prefer.
Activity
Focus
For this chapter, identify a personal goal or a 
situation that you wish to think about more 
deeply, in order to give focus to your responses.
SWOT analysis
A SWOT analysis is a useful, quick tool for 
taking stock of your situation. It is a simple way 
of analysing your level of readiness for a new 
task. It can take you to the core of an issue very 
quickly. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, 
Opportunities, Threats.
Activity
SWOT Analysis
•• For the focus you selected in the previous 
activity, use the resource sheet on p. 99 to 
jot down as many examples of strengths and 
weaknesses as you can under each heading. 
Include personal qualities, skills, experiences, 
knowledge, resources and support.
•• Under ‘Opportunities’, jot down any 
opportunities that could arise from achieving 
this goal. Include short- and long-term

Personal resources
Very few of us have the ideal resources, but none of us is without any. This is especially true for students. 
A wide range of services is offered through the university, college or community, and listed in various 
leaflets, books and directories.
Activity
Finding information
•• Make a list of all the sources of support available through the Student Union and Student Services 
that are likely to be useful to you. 
•• Follow this up by making appointments – put these in your diary. Before appointments, read the 
literature provided so as to check the documentation or details you need to bring. Always take your 
student identity card or number.

Identify solutions
If you answered ‘sometimes true’ or 
‘never true’ to any of the above time 
management factors, identify at least 
three you could improve.
•• Some strategies for managing these 
time factors are given below. Which 
could you use to improve your time 
management?
•• In your reflective journal, re-write these 
as positive ‘I will…’ statements. For 
example, ‘I will keep an effective diary’
•• Add specific details that make it more 
likely you will take action. For example, 
’I will buy a diary today at the Student 
Shop after my Design lecture. I will carry 
it in my blue bag. I will check it every 
evening after dinner so that I can plan 
ahead for the next day.’
Managing time effectively
For each of the time management statements in the 
activity ‘Factors in time management’ (above), there are 
suggestions below about how to address that aspect. 
1  Use small pockets of time in the day to sort out 
minor tasks
This is a key strategy for effective time management. Use 
time waiting in queues, on a bus or even waiting for the 
kettle to boil to recap on your learning, formulate 
lists, work out a problem, etc. 
Keep a pencil and small 
notebook with detachable 
pages nearby to jot down 
your ideas. Make a 
mental note of the times 
in the day when you 
could multi-task in this 
way. This strategy 
also reduces the 
stress associated with 
queuing and tedious 
tasks.

2  Motivation to ‘get going’
We saw in Chapter 1 how important motivation 
is to success. If you do not feel motivated, then 
be active in finding a source of motivation or 
inspiration. Focus on your long-term goals: check 
these are still important to you. Remind yourself 
of the benefits you expect. Write these where you 
can see them. Set short-term targets that you can 
manage, so that you get frequent tastes of success.
3  Time tasks 
Time management requires you to know how long 
something takes. This is easier if you break a larger 
project down into smaller tasks. Often, one or two 
of these will take longer than you expect. It may 
be aspects of starting and finishing tasks that take 
longer than expected. Plan for all stages, and find 
out how much time you need to allocate for each 
stage.
4  Cost your time
Work out whether the amount of time you spend 
on each aspect of a task is ‘cost-effective’. Usually 
the return (such as extra marks) decreases after 
a certain point. Academic work is hard to get 
perfect, as there isn’t usually a single right answer. 
If you gain satisfaction from the additional study 
time, that is fine, as long as you have calculated 
what you are giving up in exchange.
5  Say ‘no’
Identify what lies behind your difficulty in saying 
‘no’. It may be your beliefs, such as that ‘a nice 
person’ always helps out. If so, think what it means 
to be kind to yourself. Also, what are 
the negative consequences 
of always saying ‘yes’? For 
example, does this give 
other people a chance 
to be kind or to take 
full responsibility? 
Alternatively, this 
might be a question 
of assertiveness or 
negotiation (see Chapter 
5). There may be very 
long-standing or domestic 
issues which contribute to 
your difficulty in saying ‘no’. 
If so, you should speak to a 
student counsellor. 
a
6  Delegate to others 
Identify what lies beneath a reluctance to delegate. 
For example, do you distrust others to do the job 
well? If so, what are the effects of this on your 
own time management, stress levels and personal 
efficiency? What would be the benefits to you and 
to others if you delegated more? How will others 
learn to do a job well if you do not delegate? 
Could you find a compromise where you share 
some tasks in the shorter term? 
7  Ask for help
Recognise your own limits. Support services are 
set up because it is expected that people will need 
help. This is especially true for students. Asking 
friends and colleagues for help can contribute to 
their own personal development too. It can build 
their self-esteem and problem-solving skills. It gives 
them an opportunity to be helpful, which they 
may value. 
8 and 9  Starting strategies 
Use a basic starting strategy such as brainstorming 
or writing a list. Start with what you can do – and 
work from there. Often, a problem arises when we 
focus too much on what the end product should 
be rather than building from what we already 
know. Start small. Branch out. The ideas will come. 
If not, look for ideas in Chapters 6, 7 or 8. 
10 and 11  Use a diary
A diary is an essential life tool. Some people prefer 
electronic organisers. Choose one that is light 
enough to carry around at all times. Check it at 
least three times a day. 
Develop the habit of 
writing everything 
in it to avoid 
double-booking. 
Enter all targets. 
Enter deadlines 
on the date of 
the deadline 
and the day you 
want to start 
work on that 
assignment.

12  Plan activities out in a logical order
Write a list of all the tasks you need to undertake 
during the day. Re-write the list, grouping the 
activities by place. Allow sufficient time to move 
from one place to another. Write the locations in 
your diary. 
Student Day Planner 
The Student Day Planner (shown on p. 104) 
divides time into sections most commonly used 
by students. Block in all your lectures, seminars, 
tutorials, workshops, lab-sessions, and assignment 
deadlines for each term or semester and then copy 
it. This saves writing it out several times. Indicate 
the room, the lecturer, and any materials you have 
to bring with you, so the information is easy to 
find. 
Things that get forgotten
•• The time it takes to travel between 
appointments – mark that in.
•• The time when work for a deadline should begin 
– rather than just the deadline itself.
•• New locations. These may be hard to find. Plan 
to leave time for getting lost.
•• Queuing time.
•• Transport delays. These are not usually accepted 
as excuses unless they are very rare with unusual 
circumstances. 
•• Information technology going wrong; waiting to 
use a shared printer, etc. 
Time management for academic work is covered in 
more detail in The Study Skills Handbook (Cottrell, 
(2013).
Attitudes
Up to a point, every man is what he thinks he is.
F. H. Bradley
What’s in a thought?
No two people respond in the same way to 
the same event. One person may be angry and 
determined to take action if something goes 
wrong; a second may shrug and forget it; a third 
may feel it is ‘yet another example of why there 
is no point trying’. Our thinking about an event 
influences our response to it and the outcome. Our 
thoughts shape our experience, affecting what we 
feel physically and emotionally, how we interpret 
events, how we respond in a crisis and how we 
direct our lives.
Taking responsibility 
One of the first steps in managing a situation 
is taking responsibility for oneself as an active, 
thinking, creative agent within the process. It 
may well be the case that ‘someone’ should have 
acted better, or may even be to blame for what 
happened. Taking responsibility does not mean 
excusing or taking the blame for somebody else’s 
actions. It means moving beyond the ‘blame’ to 
find the most constructive outcome possible. The 
responsibility here is to yourself. 
Often, the internal story that we create around 
events focuses on what went wrong and whose 
fault it was rather than on finding the best 
outcome. We run ‘pre-recorded messages’ about 
‘they’ or ‘it ’, such as: 
The Big Bad ‘they’
•• they make me …
•• they should take the first step …
•• they shouldn’t put me in this position …
•• they shouldn’t set these deadlines …
•• they should help me more …
•• they started it …
•• they design these so badly …
The Big Bad ‘it’
•• it is too difficult …
•• it is too soon …
•• it is too complex …
•• it overwhelms me …
•• ‘it’s doing my head in’ …
•• it won’t work …
•• it’s a waste of time …
•• it keeps doing this wrong …
Reflection: The pre-recorded 
message
•• Which ‘it’ do you tend to blame (if any)?
•• Which ‘they’ do you tend to blame (if any)?
•• What other responses do you make when 
things go wrong that avoid taking personal 
responsibility for a constructive outcome?
105
Successful self-management

Constructive messages 
We can create alternative messages that lead to more 
productive outcomes. For example:
•• I can do this …
•• It’s OK. There is a way of dealing with this.
•• We can find a solution.
•• In the circumstances, the best step is …
•• The first step is …
•• I take responsibility for my part in this.
•• I’ll have a go. 
If we repeat these often enough, these become new 
‘pre-recorded messages’ that will kick in automatically.
Activity
Change the message
•• Write down five constructive responses you could 
use when things go wrong.  
•• Check that these enable you to take responsibility 
for yourself. 
•• Choose the one you like the most and write it 
where you will see it this week. Try it out and 
record what happens.
Self-belief
Belief in oneself and one’s own capabilities is essential. 
Low self-esteem creates stress, which makes the brain 
less efficient. It is also more likely to encourage a sense 
of defeat and a belief that there is ‘no point’. 
Self-confidence, a belief that one has the right to 
be and think and do what one wants, subject to 
reasonable limits and concern for others, enhances 
performance. It motivates and drives you forward. 
Reflection: Self-belief critical incident
In your reflective journal, jot down a list of things 
you have done, no matter how small, that you are 
pleased about or proud of. Then, choose one to 
think about in more detail. Jot down:
•• What happened? What did you do or say? 
•• What were the consequences? How did you or 
others benefit from this situation?
•• What personal characteristics are demonstrated 
in this incident?
•• What can you find in this incident that should 
ma ke you feel good about yourself?
It is also attractive to other people. This can 
bring more interest, resources and support, 
increasing the likelihood of success.
Self-permission
Sometimes, we are unable to move forward 
because we refuse to give ourselves 
‘permission’. It is as if we hear a pre-recorded 
message saying:
•• ‘I’m not allowed’
•• ‘I’m not good enough’
•• ‘I’m not worthy of the risk’
•• ‘I’m not deserving of the consequences’
•• ‘I’m not made for this sort of thing’
•• ‘I’m not strong enough to cope with failure’
•• ‘It’s not me’.
Activity
Self-descriptions
•• Brainstorm a list of 30 things that you like 
about yourself.
•• Go through your list, and underline all 
those that contain a positive description: 
‘I’m a reliable person’, ‘I am kind’, ‘I am 
helpful’, etc.
•• If there are fewer than 30 such positive 
phrases, add more to your list until there 
are 30. Don’t underestimate yourself. If 
any phrases contain the words ‘I try to …’ 
or ‘I am quite …’, reword these so they 
are more definite and positive.
Which three descriptions of yourself do 
you like the best? What reasons have you 
for believing that these descriptions are 
accurate?
106
Self-management

This can be true of anybody, but it 
is especially the case if there were 
strong messages at school or in 
the family that encouraged low 
expectations. 
From this activity, you may recognise messages from a long time 
ago that are still echoing in the present. Many of the ‘permissions’ 
we refuse ourselves today began a long time ago. These do not have 
to remain as barriers to achievement. Take a look at your list and 
identify those on the ‘I am not allowed’ list that you could transfer to 
the ‘I am allowed’ list. Write these down. 
Taking a solution-focused approach
Whenever you are asked if you can do a job, tell ’em,
Certainly I can! – and get busy and find out how to do it.
Theodore Roosevelt
Solution-focused versus difficulty-focused thinking
Difficulty-focused thinking
Focusing on the difficulty usually produces negative responses: the 
problem can seem insoluble. It depletes your own and other people’s 
emotional and physical energy, creating a sense of weariness, 
hopelessness or helplessness. The dominant message is that the 
problem is difficult, it will be hard work to find a solution, and 
solutions are unlikely. The difficulty-focused approach uses words and 
phrases such as:
•• ‘but …’
•• ‘I can’t see how …’
•• ‘oh no!’, ‘not again!’
•• ‘it’s hard to believe …’
•• ‘that won’t work’
•• ‘I doubt it’.
At worst, difficulty-focused people tend to pick fault with every 
proposal, draw attention to flaws in the best possible solution, and 
discourage others from believing that there could be a sensible 
solution.
Activity
Permission
Take three minutes each to 
complete the following two 
lists. Write quickly, without 
analysing your responses as 
you write. 
List 1
I am allowed to …  
(write as many things as you 
can think of).
List 2
I am not allowed to … 
(write as many things as you 
can think of).
Check back over your two 
lists and see if you can spot 
any themes. 
•• What sorts of things are 
you ‘allowed’ to do?
•• What sorts of things are 
you ‘not allowed’ to do?
•• Which list is longer? What 
might be the reason for 
that?
•• Who says ‘you are not 
allowed to …’? Is it really 
true that you do not have 
permission to achieve in 
these areas?
Consider whether you could 
give yourself more permission 
to try out some of these 
things.
107
Successful self-management

A solution-focused approach
A solution-focused approach describes the 
situation, identifies the points of difficulty, and 
moves quickly to a search for the best possible 
resolution. It uses words and phrases such as:
•• ‘yes, and we could also …’
•• ‘what if we …?’
•• ‘are there other ways of looking at this?’
•• ‘let’s brainstorm ideas …’
•• ‘let’s look again at our options …’
•• ‘let’s see if we have missed any options …’
•• ‘let’s check whether we can make this work …’
•• ‘what could we adapt?’
•• ‘who else would know about this … ?’
The dominant message is that a solution of one 
kind or another will have to be found eventually, 
even if it is an interim one, so it is better to 
focus energies on finding the solution sooner 
rather than later. A solution-focused approach 
is often expected of those in managerial roles. 
As most graduates enter jobs with managerial 
responsibilities, it is worth developing this 
approach. If you have been surrounded by people 
who take a difficulty-focused approach, you might 
find this a useful challenge. 
Reflection: Solution focus
•• Do you tend to use the words and phrases 
associated with a ‘difficulty-focused’ approach 
or a ‘solution-focused’ approach?
•• Which words and phrases are typical of you 
when faced with a complex situation?
•• Do you tend to employ a solution-focused 
approach? 
•• What could you do to develop a more 
solution-focused attitude?
Ways of addressing a new challenge
Lazarus (1999) identifies two main strategies for 
approaching a difficulty: ‘problem-focused coping’ 
and ‘emotion-focused’ coping: 
•• problem-focused: looking outwards to 
the external, concrete problem and its 
circumstances
•• emotion-focused: looking inwards at personal 
attitudes and emotions that impact upon your 
individual reaction to the situation.
A solution-focused approach can use either 
approach, adopting a constructive and positive 
attitude for either. The solution-focused approach 
takes the position that there is a solution to every 
problem and that we have that solution within us. 
Sometimes, we arrive at the solution more easily if 
we talk to others or use a particular strategy. The 
‘solution’ is the best constructive outcome that can 
be found for the situation in the circumstances. 
This may not be everything that we would like, but 
it directs energy in a positive way so that the best 
outcome possible is achieved.
A solution-focused approach requires very little, 
beyond an attitude of mind. 
Changing your environment
A negative, blaming, ‘can’t be bothered’ 
environment is not inspiring. A few people with 
such approaches can spread negativity very easily. 
They can even create a culture which is self-
defeating. You can probably think of the people 
around you who create an aura of negativity. 
(Maybe you are that person?) 
As adults, we can monitor the impact of our 
environment on our responses, taking note of 
what leaves us feeling encouraged and what does 
not. We can take action to create an environment 
around us that supports what we want to achieve. 
Identify positive inputs
•• Identify the people around you who leave you 
feeling positive about your goals, direction or 
programme of study.
•• What is it about them that seems to increase 
positive responses?
108
Self-management

•• What other things in the environment support 
your goal? Competition and constructive 
criticism can be included as positive inputs.
Jot down these factors, starting with ‘I …’, and 
identifying how you could increase the positive 
aspects of your environment. For example:
I appreciate the way Busola makes a point of 
saying she enjoys good seminars. I could identify 
the things I find positive about each seminar.
I find it useful that the library is open until  
8:00 p.m. I could use it more in the evening.
Identify negative inputs
•• Which people leave you feeling dejected, 
anxious, tired, despondent?
•• What do you feel or do when you are in the 
presence of negative attitudes?
•• What factors in your current environment could 
undermine or sabotage your goals? 
•• What can you do to reduce the impact of such 
factors upon you?
Emotional intelligence 
Evaluating your emotional intelligence
The following activity enables you to evaluate 
your emotional intelligence. This is not a scientific 
test: emotions do not lend themselves easily to 
such testing. However, it gives you an opportunity 
to reflect upon your emotional life through a 
structured activity.

What is emotional intelligence? 
‘Emotional intelligence’ is a term made current by 
Goleman (1995). It is slowly becoming recognised 
that it isn’t simply what we do and what we 
think that affects our ability to cope, manage and 
succeed, but also how we manage our feelings.
Emotional intelligence involves:
•• knowing the appropriate feelings for the 
circumstances
•• experiencing the appropriate feelings for the 
circumstances
•• expressing feelings appropriate to the 
circumstances
•• making opportunities to express feelings 
that cannot be expressed fully in the original 
circumstances.
This may sound easy. However, your reflections 
above may have indicated to you that emotions 
often get in the way of a rational interpretation of 
a situation. They tend to prevent us from working 
towards the best or most constructive solution to 
the issues. In general, people tend to over-express 
their feelings (excessive anger, passivity, distress 
and so forth) or to bottle up their feelings in order 
to cope. Different circumstances permit a different 
level of expression. We need to consider such 
matters as:
•• What response will lead to the most constructive 
outcome?
•• How will other people respond?
•• What are other people’s needs?
Activity: Evaluating your emotional intelligence (continued)
Interpreting your scores
150–200  If your answers are accurate, this 
suggests that you have a sophisticated 
approach to emotional life. You seem capable 
of managing your own emotions as well as 
coping with the emotions of other people. 
You seem able to make the kinds of responses 
that accompany emotional intelligence. Your 
emotional intelligence should provide you with 
an asset in almost any situation. 
100–149  This is a good score. If your evaluations 
are accurate, you have a very good foundation 
for developing your emotional intelligence 
further. Emotional intelligence is an asset in 
most situations so this is very much worth 
nurturing. Look at the responses which have 
high scores: what do these tell you about 
your strengths? Are there any themes evident 
in the questions that received lower scores? 
It is worth noting whether one of the three 
sections had a lower score than the others. 
Identify which of these is your priority for 
further self-development.
50–99  This is a reasonable score, especially if 
you entered university straight from school. 
However, it suggests that you have lots of 
room to develop your emotional management 
skills. If your evaluation is accurate, you 
would benefit from making emotional self-
management a priority area. Identify which 
areas are your strengths. These are the assets 
you take into most situations. Look for themes 
in the lower scores. Which types of issues are 
most relevant to the achievement of your 
goals? Identify which of these is your priority 
for further self-development.
0–49  If your evaluation is accurate, you may have 
a real challenge on your hands. Remember 
that this is not a scientific test. There may be 
many areas of emotional intelligence in which 
you excel that are not covered by this activity. 
For example, some people are exceptional in 
crises – but there is only one question related 
to managing a crisis above. Other people 
are emotionally sophisticated with particular 
types of people, such as children, the elderly, 
sick people, etc. In addition, your evaluation 
may have been harsh. On the other hand, 
you may really feel that the emotional world 
is rather a tricky one. You may feel that 
people misunderstand you or your motives 
much of the time. You are not alone if you 
feel that. However, it is not necessarily a very 
comfortable position to be in. The good news 
is that emotional intelligence is an asset that 
can be developed. The student counselling 
service at the university will probably be able 
to give you confidential advice if you are at all 
concerned.
113
Successful self-management

people are not aware of what they are feeling, yet 
their feelings may be all too evident to the people 
around them. 
Activity
Examples of emotional 
responses
Think of three situations where you had a 
strong emotional response. Choose three 
different types of communication (in a group, 
individually, face to face, telephone, email) 
or three types of situation (work, study, with 
friends, with strangers). For each situation, jot 
down thoughts in your reflective journal in 
response to the following questions.
•• What happened?
•• What did you feel?
•• Which feelings did you express?
•• What did you do at the time?
•• What were the consequences? 
•• What did you do or feel within the next 48 
hours? 
•• Did your responses enable you to gain the 
most constructive outcome possible from the 
situations? 
Consider whether your responses seem to be 
different depending on the circumstances or 
people involved.
Where do the unexpressed feelings go?
Whilst it is important to know what we feel and to 
acknowledge our feelings, there are times when 
it is not appropriate to express all of what we 
feel. In the activity above, you will probably have 
identified some feelings you did not express at the 
time. Often, such feelings go unexpressed for a 
long time. Unfortunately, they do not usually just 
disappear. Where do they go? 
There are numerous ways that unexpressed 
emotions make themselves felt. A few of these are 
given here. As you read through them, identify 
which responses seem to be most typical of your 
own. You would be a very remarkable person if 
you made none of the following responses. 
Displacement
The emotion is ignored and sneaks out when not 
expected, usually when you experience a similar 
emotion later. For example, you say nothing 
when you are irritated several times during a 
morning, and then snap or shout at somebody for 
something very minor later on in the day. Many 
Disproportion
This often goes hand in hand with displacement. 
When you express an emotion it should be 
proportionate to the situation. Disproportionate 
responses are noticeable when quite small things 
that do not seem to affect other people provoke a 
strong reaction in you. A small event may lead to 
tears, shouting, anger, violence, insults, or extreme 
distress.
If something has been building, unexpressed, for 
a long time, it is usually advisable to speak to a 
counsellor. They can help you release the emotion 
in a manageable way. 
Reflection: Displacing emotions
Think of a situation when your emotional 
reaction was very strong for the situation. 
•• What happened? What did you do or say?
•• Which emotion was being displaced?
•• What had originally provoked the emotion – 
was it something recent? Was it the result of a 
long build-up of emotion? 
•• What could you have done to prevent 
displacing the emotion onto the later 
situation?
114
Self-management

Distorted thinking
Unexpressed emotions can eat away at people, 
leading to distorted thinking such as: 
•• Believing there is no solution or way out of a 
problem.
•• Exaggerating how bad things are.
•• Over-generalising: judging everything from one 
or few examples. For example: ‘My first essay 
was bad so I know I shouldn’t be at university.’
•• Exaggerating one’s own role in events, so as to 
see oneself as very incompetent, bad, unkind or 
completely to blame for everything that went 
wrong. This is often a way of refusing to admit 
one’s actual role (as it invites people to reassure 
you that you are not wholly to blame).
•• ‘All or nothing’ thinking: ‘If I can’t have this then 
I don’t want anything.’
•• ‘Magical thinking’: believing that one is jinxed, 
doomed, specially chosen, fated.
•• Mistaking feelings for facts: ‘I feel it is all terrible, 
so it must be.’
•• Focusing on the negatives: seeing only what 
went wrong, and judging a situation only by 
what was not perfect.
•• Rationalising: finding a reason for doing what 
you want to do or for not doing what needs to 
be done.
Reflection: Distorted thinking
We are all capable of distorted thinking from 
time to time. 
•• Which of the above methods do you use 
when you are not feeling good about yourself 
or your work?
•• What kinds of situations prompt you to 
distorted thinking?
•• What benefit does the distorted thinking give 
you in the short term? Bear in mind that if 
you didn’t feel it was giving you something, 
you wouldn’t do it.
•• How does the distorted thinking stand in the 
way of achieving your goals? (It does!)
Managing personal distress
The ABC model for dealing with distress
Ellis (1994) and Dryden and Gordon (1993) 
outline the ‘ABC model’ for managing situations 
that cause distress. The ABC model helps to 
analyse the source of the distress. It separates the 
core of the issue from the beliefs and attitudes that 
then amplify the problem. This makes it easier to 
find a solution or way of coping, keeping the core 
issues in perspective. ABC stands for:
A =	Activating event: What happened that led to 
the emotional distress?
B =	Beliefs: What beliefs contribute to the 
emotional distress? 
C =	Consequences: e.g. anger, illness, inability 
to work, difficulty getting down to work or 
concentrating
The example below (p. 116) also adds a ‘D’:
D =	Dealing with it: What action will you take to 
manage the situation?
Activity
Would the ‘ABC model’ work 
for you?
•• Read through the ABC model outline above 
and the worked example on the next page. 
Consider whether this is one that could be 
helpful to you. 
•• If possible, identify either a current or a past 
situation which created undue stress, pressure 
or distress to you or someone you know.
•• Work through each of the stages of the 
model, applying them to the situation you 
identified. 
•• If doing this generated any ideas about 
dealing with such a situation, consider when 
and how you might apply these in the future.
•• If this model wasn’t useful, how would you 
adapt it so that it worked better for you?

Successful self-management

Example
ABC model for dealing with distress 
A  Activating event    The ‘activating event’ 
might be that a student, Gareth, has not 
read the course handbook. As a result, he 
did not realise that two essay deadlines fell 
on the same day. He asked for an extension, 
but was refused as it was not possible in the 
circumstances. Gareth must complete both 
essays in five days. If not, he will need to 
retake a module. The situation is not easy.
B  Beliefs    Gareth can make a decision to 
work flat out to produce two essays, possibly 
accepting lower marks, or he can defer one 
of the modules and increase the possibility 
of higher marks for both in the long term. 
This would take a few months longer, but is 
feasible. However, Gareth argues that he is 
‘totally stupid’ to have got into this situation 
and that this is typical of the mess he makes of 
his ‘whole life’. He links the current problem 
with difficulties he experiences elsewhere so 
that the issue is no longer a missed deadline 
(which can be managed) but everything 
about his life. He does not believe he can write 
the essays as he has convinced himself that 
nothing he does will work. 
C  Consequences    The consequences are that 
Gareth’s beliefs lock him into inaction. All of 
his energies are diverted into self-blame and 
hopelessness. He feels very small and is too 
embarrassed to talk to his friends. Instead of 
using his time to write the essays, he wastes 
time worrying or drinking, trying to push the 
problem away. Because he is stressed, he finds 
it difficult to concentrate. He can’t study or 
make sense of what he reads. He misses his 
shift for his part-time job, making his overall 
situation even worse – convincing him further 
that his ‘life’ is a problem. 
D  Dealing with it    What could you do if you 
found yourself in a similar situation? In this 
case, it is beliefs that are fuelling the distress 
and leading to unhelpful consequences. You 
could either focus on the problem so as to 
divert yourself from the beliefs, or change the 
beliefs.
If you focus on the problem, you can:
•• Describe the activating event, reducing it to 
the basics. Acknowledge what went wrong and 
what has been learnt. Yes, Gareth should have 
read the handbook. However, he is unlikely to 
make this mistake again, and this could be a 
critical lesson from which he learns and gains in 
the longer term. He is far from being the only 
student to get into such a position. 
•• Consider what has to be done. List all your 
options. Find out what these are and write 
them down. Write the advantages of each 
option. Then consider the feasibility and 
consequences of each.
•• Move as quickly as possible into ‘problem-
solving mode’, using a problem-solving strategy 
(see Chapter 6). Brainstorm options for solving 
the core problem. Evaluate these and choose 
one.
•• Make a decision – and then stick to it and 
accept the consequences. The consequences 
might not be ideal, but they can be the ‘best 
possible’ for the situation. They are not life-
threatening or catastrophic in the larger picture.
•• Develop an action plan and follow it. 
To challenge unhelpful beliefs:
•• Write down words that motivate you, such as: 
‘there is a solution’ or ‘I can do this’.
•• List your negative thoughts (beliefs). Go 
through the list, undertaking a ‘reality check’. 
Ask ‘Is this belief going to help me find a 
solution?’ 
•• Challenge all beliefs that start with ‘I should 
have …’ or ‘I always …’.
•• Challenge all beliefs that refer to any other 
situation except the current problem. 
•• Cross out, with a thick line, all beliefs that 
do not help achieve a solution to the current 
situation. 
•• Brainstorm constructive phrases or messages 
until you find at least one that seems both 
helpful and true to you. Underline that belief 
or idea three times. Put a line through all the 
others.
•• Speak to a friend or counsellor to put the 
situation into perspective.

Dealing with uncertainty
The ‘right answer’
University life and study can be very challenging 
to our way of seeing the world. Many would argue 
that it should be, and that a university education 
should stretch students and make them re-evaluate 
their core beliefs and ways of thinking. The 
challenge can be difficult to manage at first. 
In the 1970s, Perry undertook research with 
students at Harvard and Ratcliffe in the USA. 
He found that even outstanding students often 
expected to be given, or led towards, the ‘right 
answers’ by their tutors. How far is this true 
of you? Check your own responses using the 
following activity.
The changing context
Technology and changes in the workplace have 
revolutionised the way we work and study. For 
most of history, people knew from childhood what 
kind of job they would have, their station in life, 
their relative income, the tools they would use. 
Lives were mapped out often before a person was 
born, depending on their family circumstances. 
Today, things move quickly and change is 
the dominant pattern. More people have a 
chance to study for a degree and opt for almost 
any profession, at any age and, increasingly, 
anywhere. It is expected that we will continue 
training in new skills throughout our lives and 
it is likely that most of us will have several jobs, 
probably in diverse locations. The technical skills 
learnt today will become out of date very  
quickly; even factual information has a short  
shelf life.
Change inevitably brings uncertainty and, 
depending on what else is going on in our lives, 
we each manage this differently. There may be 
some kinds of change that you always welcome, 
and others that cause distress. 
Activity
Is there a right answer?
This activity is likely to take at least half an hour and maybe much longer. There are three parts. 
Part 1  Issues
On a piece of paper, jot down quickly your ideas about three of the following issues:
(a)	 It is ethical to clone human life.
(b)	Students should be trained to develop their thinking skills as part of every programme.
(c)	 All adults should be required to contribute 50 hours a year to community or environmental work. 
(d)	To protect the environment, each person should have a restricted number of travel miles for 
holidays over their lifetime.
(e)	 Emotional intelligence should be part of the school curriculum.
(f)	 There should be a curfew on all people with a criminal record.
(g)	Science requires creative thinking rather than logic. 
(continued)
118
Self-management

Activity: Is there a right answer? (continued)
Part 2  Approaches
Below is a list of approaches that students take when considering new problems or challenging 
issues (adapted from Perry, 1970). For each of the issues you chose to consider, decide which of the 
following positions best describes where you stand on the issue. 
1	 Absolute answer 
I think this is a question of right and wrong or that the right answer to this issue is obvious. I know 
where I stand, I know my own opinion, and I don’t think an alternative answer is acceptable. 
Recognised authorities such as my tutor, a book, the law or a professional body will be able to tell me 
what the right answer is on this.
2	 Temporary unacceptable uncertainty 
The right answer hasn’t been found yet but needs to be. Professionals, academics or other authorities 
need to clarify what the right answer is in order to avoid confusion.
3	 Acceptable uncertainty
Everyone has a right to his or her own opinion. All answers are equally acceptable. My answer is as 
good as anyone else’s. Lecturers and experts do not have all the answers.
4	 Relativism
It’s all relative. The ‘right answer’ would depend upon the circumstances. Another person may think 
differently from me and still be right, if their situation and experiences are different. There are no right 
answers. There is no real way of deciding what is right for all situations.  
5	 Commitment to a considered viewpoint, taking responsibility for the decision
I understand and can appreciate other viewpoints on this issue, but I believe some answers or 
perspectives are better than others and that I need to make a personal decision on where I stand 
amongst conflicting opinions.  
I realise that making this choice of an answer may carry responsibilities and have implications for how I 
think, speak, and the choices I make.
6	 On-going development
I am committed to this viewpoint, appreciate other viewpoints and realise that my decision carries 
personal responsibility. However, I also feel that this is something that I need to keep returning to, even 
if it means some uncertainty.  The answer I have committed to is of great importance to who I am, to 
my values, and the kind of person I want to be.
Part 3  Interpreting your position
Perry explained the thinking that underlies each position. He ordered them into a hierarchy of 
responses (given below). 
•• Which position on his hierarchy is occupied by your answers? Are your answers generally in position 
1, 2 or 3? 
•• In general, which of the nine stages described below do you think is most true of you?
Position 1: ‘Right-answer positions’ (Approaches 1 and 2 on the above activity)
1	 Absolutist stage: there are right answers available. Things are either right or wrong.  It is the 
teacher’s job to provide the right answers. 
2	 Bad authority versus good authority: there are right answers but uncertainty is created 
unnecessarily by poor teachers or leaders. It is acceptable for right answers to be withheld when 
teachers want students to find the ‘right’ answer themselves.
3	 Temporary uncertainty: there are right answers but it isn’t clear what these are yet. 
(continued)
119
Successful self-management

Activity: Is there a right answer? (continued)
Reflection: Managing uncertainty
•• What are your expectations of your lecturers? 
Do you expect them to provide, or lead you 
towards, a ‘right answer’?
•• How comfortable do you feel with the idea 
that there may not be ‘right answers’ to 
questions that are important to you?
•• How open are you to hearing opinions that 
contradict your own?
If this subject interests you, ask your tutors for 
literature that discusses the nature of ‘truth’ or 
‘fact’ or ‘right answers’ in your subject area.
Changing position
Perry found that it can take years for students to 
feel comfortable at stages 7–9 of this hierarchy. 
You may find you are in very different positions on 
the hierarchy depending on the issue.
You do not have to agree that Perry’s hierarchy 
applies to every question. However, the hierarchy 
can be a useful tool for evaluating the nature of 
your own responses to issues, and your readiness 
to accept uncertainty on an issue. You will know 
how comfortable or uncomfortable you feel about 
applying any particular stage to your own ideas. 
You may need a greater knowledge of all the 
issues and the consequences of taking a particular 
position in a wide range of circumstances in order 
to change position on the hierarchy. 
It can be hard to feel comfortable at levels 4–9 on 
some issues unless your sense of self, your beliefs 
or your values also change. There isn’t a ‘quick fix’ 
to changing the way we think. However, being 
aware of how we are thinking and responding can 
help the process of development.
You can also use Perry’s hierarchy to help you 
understand where other people are in their 
thinking. It is important to be sensitive to where 
people are situated: you cannot force people into a 
different set of beliefs. 
Transitional learning and ‘disequilibrium’
Issues discussed in higher education may not have 
‘right’ answers. There may be several answers 
or it may depend on how particular evidence is 
assessed, or there may be insufficient evidence to 
come to a firm conclusion. Some issues discussed 
at this level will directly challenge what you have 
learnt before, or seem to contradict views that you 
or people close to you hold as valuable. This can 
be unsettling or confusing.
Reflection: Confusion
•• Do you feel that you are finding it harder to 
learn since starting university level study? 
•• Do you ever feel that you are more confused 
about what an issue involves when you find 
out more about it? 
•• Do you feel you are going backwards the 
more you learn?
•• How does this make you feel? Do you think 
you are really ‘going backwards’?
Position 2:  Relativism stages (Approaches 3 and 4 on the activity above)
4	 Acceptable uncertainty: ‘Everyone has a right to their own opinion’, despite what teachers or 
leaders might think. For assignments, it is important to find out the lecturers’ opinions. 
5	 ‘All knowledge and value are contextual and relative.’ For assignments, students should enquire: 
‘What is required of me in this context?’
Position 3:  Commitment stages (Approaches 5 and 6 on the activity above)
6	 Personal orientation: you feel it is necessary to make a commitment to certain viewpoints (out of a 
range of possibilities) with an understanding of, and tolerance for, other viewpoints.
7	 You have made a commitment to certain viewpoints.
8	 The implications of your commitment have been experienced and you realise the responsibilities 
this brings.
9	 You regard your commitment to your views as ‘an on-going, unfolding activity’ through which 
your lifestyle and identity are expressed.

‘Equilibration’
Saven-Baden (2000) uses the term ‘transitional 
learning’ to refer to ‘shifts’ that occur when 
students’ frames of reference, or ‘life world’ are 
challenged by their learning, especially as the 
result of critical reflection. You may feel this at 
certain times when you move onto a higher level 
of learning. Saven-Baden decribes this state as: 
‘characterised by frustration and confusion, and a 
loss of sense of self’. 
This suggests that we can interpret some confusion 
as a healthy sign. It indicates that we are pushing 
ourselves, our learning, our knowledge, our 
skills beyond their former level. In other words, 
we are not stagnating. Piaget (1975) regarded 
this process of ‘equilibration’ as essential to our 
development. Equilibration occurs in three stages:
Siegler (1991) cites the example of a child who 
thinks that only animals are living things. When 
she hears plants referred to as being ‘alive’, she 
becomes uncertain of what ‘alive’ means. This 
uncertainty, although temporarily uncomfortable, 
is a necessary stage in opening up to a new 
understanding of the world. Dissatisfaction begins 
an internal questioning which then opens us up to 
exploring new options. 
For students to progress to more sophisticated 
ways of thinking, they need to be receptive 
to disequilibrium and to be able to manage 
or ‘contain’ short-term confusion. Otherwise, 
they may cling to the ‘security’ of their former 
equilibrium. 
Reflection: Coping with 
disequilibrium
•• Think back to a time when you felt you would 
never learn something – but did. What was it 
that was difficult to learn? 
•• How did you manage to work through the 
‘confusion’ or disheartened stage to the stage 
where you had achieved your goal?
•• What was it like to be successful in the end?
•• How well do you feel you can manage the 
‘disequilibrium stage’ as a student? What kind 
of support would help?
Holding the uncertainty
When we feel uncertain or confused, we lose our 
sense of equilibrium. Naturally, this makes us want 
to find our ‘balance’ again. The temptation is to 
act too quickly, rushing in to find a solution so that 
we feel better. Often, this leads to hasty action 
which limits our possibilities.
Although it may feel uncomfortable, it is important 
to learn to experience the feelings of discomfort 
and to ‘sit with them’ for a while, whilst we find 
out more about the situation. We need to:
•• acknowledge the feeling of discomfort or 
anxiety
•• allow ourselves to wait before rushing into 
action
•• find help and support if we need it – talking to 
somebody can help
1	 Equilibrium: first 
there is a state of 
satisfaction with 
our current ways of 
thinking and doing.
2	 Disequilibrium: 
then we gain a 
sense of growing 
dissatisfaction and 
an awareness of the 
limitations of our 
existing ways of 
thinking and doing. 
This is the stage 
where confusion 
and worry can set 
in.
3	 A more stable 
equilibrium: finally, 
if we persist in our 
enquiries, we can 
move to a more 
sophisticated way 
of thinking that 
overcomes the 
limitations of our 
previous thinking 
and performance.

Using motivators and inhibitors to 
manage personal performance
We are all subject to influences that either enhance 
our performance, or else inhibit our progress. You 
have already had the chance to identify a number 
of such factors in Chapter 3, ‘Understanding 
your personal performance’. Here, you have an 
opportunity to build upon that understanding by 
applying a framework for analysing a broader set 
of influences. This can provide further insights that 
you can use to help manage aspects of personal 
performance. 
Dilts et al. (1990) offered a six-level framework 
for exploring factors that can inhibit or promote 
learning. The framework below adapts Dilts’s 
model, using eight levels to analyse performance. 
The ‘Eight Levels’ framework 
The Eight Levels framework enables us to look at 
performance from different perspectives. Items 
nearer to the core, such as ‘higher purpose’ and 
‘identity’, are considered to have greatest impact 
and are referred to as ‘higher level’. If positively 
engaged, these higher level motivators can go a 
long way towards overriding negative impacts, 
or ‘inhibitors’, at lower levels. It is as though 
the ‘core’ has a greater gravitational pull on our 
energies. 
•• find out more about the idea or situation that 
challenges us
•• aim to understand what it is that we find 
so challenging – and look for potential 
opportunities
•• consider our options, preferably within a 
problem-solving strategy
•• act when we have weighed up the options.
Reflection: Managing 
uncertainty
In your reflective journal, jot down your 
responses to the following questions.
•• What kinds of uncertainty have you 
been faced with recently?
•• What was your response?
•• In retrospect, do you think you 
could have managed this uncertainty 
differently or more constructively?
•• Did you look for any support in 
managing this uncertainty? If not, what 
stopped you?
•• What could you do to improve the way 
you manage uncertainty?
By analysing your experience in this way, you can 
identify for any task (or in general):
•• at which level you feel the ‘inhibitors’ lie for you
•• at which level the ‘motivators’ lie for you
•• ways of managing inhibitors so as that 
your experience is better and/or personal 
performance improved. 
122
Self-management

1  Environmental (where? when? with whom?)
As we saw in Chapter 3, ‘Understanding your 
personal performance’, the context in which we 
learn and take action can have a profound effect. 
‘Environment’ here can refer to the wider social, 
cultural or ideological context or the immediate 
physical environment such as the lighting or 
background distractions. 
If you are strongly motivated or inhibited on a task 
at the environmental level, this may be evident 
in what you emphasise when speaking (as in the 
italics below): 
‘I love doing this/I can’t do it in this room, with 
this light, with people like these, at an institution like 
this.’’
Managing performance at the environmental 
level
If this sounds like you, consider what you can do 
to change the environment to suit your needs. 
Your responses to the activities in Chapter 3 may 
be useful in considering this issue. Environmental 
sensitivity can be caused by past trauma or current 
stress, so investigating those issues could also help.
Reflection: Environmental 
motivators and inhibitors
•• How relevant do you think environmental 
factors are to your own performance in a 
particular area, either in motivating you or in 
preventing excellent performance?
•• In what ways do these affect your 
performance?
•• How can you better manage any negative 
impact or make more use of positive impacts?
2  The ‘nature of the task’ or ‘content’ (what?)
If you find you can usually perform in a given 
environment, but that you don’t seem able to 
learn a particular subject or perform a specific task 
there, the difficulty would appear to lie with the 
content of what you are learning or the nature of 
the task rather than at the environmental level. If 
so, this is likely to be evident in comments such as:
‘I can’t learn that’; ‘what’s this supposed to be 
about?’; ‘this is what I call nonsense’.
Managing performance at the ‘task’ level 
If you aren’t able to change the overall task or 
subject, look for ways to change the way it is 
framed or worded. For example:
•• look for a different way of thinking about the 
task
•• break the task into manageable sections
•• rephrase instructions
•• put things into your own words
•• imagine you are explaining the issue to someone 
much younger
•• look for real-life examples that are similar
•• sketch the problem as a chart, diagram or 
picture. 
Reflection: Task-related motivators 
and inhibitors
•• How relevant do you think the nature of the 
task is in the way it affects your performance 
in a particular area, either in motivating you 
or preventing excellent performance?
•• Is it a motivator or inhibitor for your own 
performance?
•• In what ways does it affect your performance?
•• How can you better manage any negative 
impact?
123
Successful self-management

a behavioural approach doesn’t work, it is worth 
looking for solutions at one of the other levels. For 
example, it could be that the key inhibitor is at 
the environment level; tackling that directly might 
lead to a change in behaviour. Alternatively, the 
solution might lie in increased attention to one of 
the higher levels as outlined below.
Reflection: Behaviour as a 
motivator or inhibitor
•• How relevant do you think your behaviour 
is in the way it affects your performance in 
a particular area, either in motivating you or 
preventing excellent performance?
•• In what ways does if affect your performance?
•• How could you change your behaviours in 
order to improve your performance?
4  Capability (how can I?) 
If your prime difficulty in accomplishing a task lies 
at the capability level, you are likely to put the 
emphasis on words and phrases expressing ability:
  ‘I’m not able to learn that’; ‘I don’t know how to 
learn that’; ‘How can I do that!’
If you are motivated at the capability level, you 
are likely to place emphasis on your ability to do 
something- or at least to have a go.
‘I can!’ ‘I’m able to do all sorts of things!’ ‘Let me!’ 
‘I’ve done this before …’
Managing performance at the capability level 
If you feel you are having difficulties because of 
lack of knowledge, ability, skills or experience, 
consider why you are not able to do what you 
wish:
•• it could be lack of practice
•• it could be because you have not spent long 
enough building up a good foundation of 
knowledge and appropriate thinking skills: see 
Chapter 7 on the way the brain develops to 
support new learning
•• you may need to improve study skills
•• you may benefit from the section on ‘Attitudes’ 
above (pp. 105–9)
•• you may be in the ‘transitional stage’ referred to 
above (p. 121)
3  Behaviours (what do we do?)
You may feel you want one thing, but behave as 
if you want something else. For example, students 
usually want good grades for their work but may 
not study in ways that develop their knowledge 
and understanding sufficiently. These behaviours 
may be the result of peer pressure, unhelpful 
habits, poor induction into a job or programme, 
lack of awareness of what is expected, etc.
There can be all kinds of reasons for counter-
productive behaviours but if you are motivated by 
behavioural change, that is the focus for action. 
If, for you, the issue is primarily behavioural, this 
is likely to be expressed in speech that emphasises 
verbs (‘doing words’):  
‘I can’t learn or do that’;  ‘writing essays is too 
difficult’; ‘it takes me too long to do that’. 
If you are motivated at this level, you may notice 
that typical responses from you include phrases 
such as:
‘I’ll do it’; ‘I’ll have a go’; ‘I want to get on  
with it’.
Managing performance at the behavioural level 
Managing behaviour at the performance level 
means that you address the behaviours directly, 
looking for ways of changing how you act or 
respond, rather than using an analysis of why the 
behaviour occurs to find a way forward. It can feel 
motivating if you feel you have the power to adapt 
your responses in ways that produce the outcomes 
you want. Some actions you can take are: 
•• Become aware of contradictory behaviours – ask 
a blunt friend, partner or sibling!
•• Identify the trigger points – something you 
do that indicates to you or others that the 
unwanted behaviour or habit is about to kick in.
•• Decide what you will do differently at that 
trigger point so as to initiate a different set of 
behaviours.
•• Decide on appropriate rewards for particular 
changes in your actions.
•• Ask a friend to prompt you if you don’t spot the 
trigger.
•• Make sure you do reward your successes in 
changing behaviour.
Counter-productive behaviours could indicate a 
lack of motivation for attaining the end goal. If 
124

5  Emotional (how do I feel about …?) 
If the primary difficulty lies at an emotional level, you may 
emphasise words that refer to emotions: 
‘I feel I’ll never learn this.’ ‘This irritates, angers, upsets me.’ ‘I 
don’t feel good about this situation’; ‘I’m getting annoyed by 
this essay!’
Alternatively, you may express emotions through tears or your 
behaviour. The emotion may be related simply to difficulties 
with current study. However, there is very often a link to 
earlier learning which was distressing in some way. 
On the other hand, positive emotions can have a beneficial 
effect upon learning. Positive feelings about oneself, the 
learning context, the course, and potential outcomes can 
produce much higher motivation and make learning easier. 
Managing performance at the level of emotions 
Key factors in managing emotions are being able to recognise 
that your emotions are engaged in a negative way and that 
you need to address these. Pretending that they don’t matter 
probably won’t help much, unless action at other levels results 
in a change in those feelings. Examining your emotional 
intelligence as outlined above (pp. 109–12) can help. 
If you do feel your feelings are getting in the way of you 
performing at your best, some basic steps you can take are:
•• Don’t push the emotions away; notice them, sit with them 
for a while; see if they change if you give them some 
attention.
•• Consider whether there are some ways of approaching the 
task that would make you feel better.
•• Query whether your emotions are in proportion: is this 
something that you can just ‘shake off’?
•• Consider whether you are displacing emotions (see p. 114). 
If so, what might the real emotional issue be?
•• Consider using the ABC model to address these (p. pp. 
115–16).
•• If the emotions persist, talk to someone about them.
Reflection: Emotion as a motivator or 
inhibitor
•• How relevant do you think your emotional responses 
are as key factors in particular areas of your own 
performance, either in motivating you or in preventing 
excellent performance?
•• In what ways do they affect your performance?
•• What could you do in order to manage your emotions 
better so as to improve your performance?
•• you may work better at a different 
pace: many people find university 
programmes are very rushed
•• you may benefit from additional 
support and guidance. 
Give yourself time to approach each 
task. Break bigger tasks into smaller, 
manageable targets. Find or set up 
a support group or action set (see 
Chapter 5). 
Reflection: Capability 
as a motivator or 
inhibitor
•• How relevant is ‘capability’ in the 
way it affects your performance 
in a particular area, either in 
motivating you or preventing 
excellent performance?
•• In what ways does it affect your 
performance?
•• What could you do to improve 
your capability in that aspect of 
your performance?

performance, either in motivating you or in preventing

•• In what ways do they affect your performance?
•• What could you do in order to manage your emotions 
better so as to improve your performance?
7  Identity (who am I?)
Some students, when they encounter difficulties, experience 
this at the identity level. They decide that they are ‘the kind 
of person’ who can’t learn or doesn’t perform well. They 
emphasise the ‘I’ in descriptions of their difficulties: ‘I can’t 
learn it …’ or even ‘People like me can’t …’. 
Our sense of identity is very powerful, so if the primary 
difficulty is at the identity level, it is a good idea to address 
this as a priority. 
Managing performance at the identity level 
•• Consider the positive aspects of your identity: what 
makes you who you are? 
•• How can you harness those positive aspects of your 
identity to help you accomplish the particular task or 
goal? What is it about you, or ‘within you’, that can make 
success possible?
•• Do you identify with being: 
•• a ‘bad student’
•• a ‘lost cause’
•• ‘mediocre’ or ‘average’
•• ‘the clown in the group’
•• ‘the one who sits at the back’
•• ‘not a scientist’
•• a similar kind of negative identity?
If so, where did this sense of who you are come from? What 
can you do now to challenge that way of thinking about 
yourself?
If you are unsure of what your ‘identity’ is, it may help to 
work through selected aspects of Chapters 1 and 2, such 
as your vision for your life, your values, your life narrative 
and the kind of ‘hero’ you are in your own story (see pages 
53–4). Don’t get too tied down in the philosophical aspects 
of identity at this point.
6  Beliefs and values (why?)
Our belief systems exercise a strong hold 
over our learning. We use beliefs as a 
basis for action. Beliefs about self-worth 
and individual potential are especially 
powerful: some students have a deeply 
held belief that they ‘not supposed to 
be’ at university. Have you ever felt that 
you are ‘not good enough’, or ‘people 
like me cannot do well at university level 
study’? Do you believe the subject you 
are studying is really worthwhile? 
If your primary difficulty lies at the belief 
level, this may be apparent in speech 
such as: 
•• ‘I’m not likely to star at this subject’
•• ‘This is a soft option: I need to focus 
my attention on the other modules’
•• ‘It’s only a discussion group so I don’t 
need to turn up.’
There may also be a conflict between 
values and behaviours: ‘Music is what is 
important to me, that’s what I’d like to 
study, but I need a job at the end of this 
so, here I am, taking Business Studies.’  
Managing performance at the level of 
beliefs and values 
•• Check whether you can reconnect 
with any initial belief in the value of 
the task that might then help you 
through.
•• Identify a source of motivation that 
makes sense in terms of your values 
and motivation (pp. 30–6; p. 40).
•• Check whether there is consistency 
between your values, beliefs and 
actions (see Congruence pp. 46–7).
•• Challenge negative thinking (p. 106).
•• Speak to someone who can give you 
useful and constructive advice about 
how to achieve your aims.
•• Bear in mind that it can take time to 
change something as fundamental as 
our beliefs. 
126
Self-management

•• What does ‘really matter’ to you? What would 
drive you to accomplish the most difficult of 
tasks if you really needed to?
•• How or when do you provide space for that 
higher purpose in your life now? 
•• How or when could you enable more time to be 
given to what really matters to you?
•• For tasks that you are finding problematic now, 
list some ways that you could change the way 
you think about these, or the way you perform 
them, so that they help you to connect with 
what really matters to you.
Reflection: Identity as a motivator 
or inhibitor
•• How relevant is your sense of your identity as 
a key factor in motivating you or preventing 
excellent performance?
•• In what ways does if affect your performance?
•• How could you make better use of your sense 
of who you are in order to better manage 
your performance?
8  Higher purpose or mission
‘Higher purpose’ and ‘mission’ refer to the overall 
direction and motivation that drive a person. This 
might be the good that you hope will stem from 
completing your degree, such as providing better 
for your family, being a role model, gaining more 
independence, entering a profession that matters 
to you, etc. As the term suggests, higher purpose 
is typically associated with ambition for something 
greater than self-centred desire – that is, it is 
‘higher than ourselves’, such as:
•• ‘doing good’
•• helping others
•• ‘making your life count’
•• making a difference to your community, family, 
institution, country, sport, etc.
•• creativity and artistic endeavour
•• spirituality and/or religion.
Managing performance through ‘higher 
purpose’ 
If you can find a relevant and meaningful 
connection between what you are doing and what 
really matters to you in terms of ‘higher purpose’, 
you are more likely to be well-motivated and to 
persevere through difficulties. Conversely, if there 
is never any space in your day to engage with 
what matters to you – or even to consider what 
that might be – then you lack an essential source 
of motivation and may eventually feel that life is 
frustrating or dull.
Reflection: ‘Higher purpose’ as a 
motivator or inhibitor
•• How relevant is a sense of ‘higher purpose’ 
or mission in motivating you or preventing 
excellent performance?
•• In what ways does this affect your 
performance?
•• How could connecting to a sense of a higher 
purpose help to improve your performance?
Reflection: Identify your primary 
level for improvement
•• Which of the previous levels do you think 
is most significant in its effects upon your 
learning and performance?
•• Which levels have positive effects upon your 
studies or performance?
•• To which levels do you most need to pay 
attention?

Closing comments
This chapter covers a great deal of ground. 
As with any issues that relate to intra-personal 
matters, it is not a chapter to race through and 
feel you have ‘got it’. 
Many of the exercises in this chapter can be 
repeated with specific issues or questions in 
mind. You will also find that the responses 
you give on a day when you wake up feeling 
confident and happy are very different from 
those you give on days when you feel more 
vulnerable. This is to be expected. The issues 
covered in this chapter provide useful material 
for further exploration through your reflective 
journal. 
This chapter offered a basic introduction to 
some of the issues associated with personal self-
management. The activities and strategies here 
may be all you will need for the issues that face 
you as a student and in your first graduate jobs. 
The chapter offers tools for analysing a situation 
quickly, for identifying resources, for managing 
your time, and for exploring your own mind-set. 
It offers strategies for developing a solution-
focused, positive thinking style that can be 
applied in any circumstance, and not simply for 
study. It also offers you tools for beginning to 
analyse and understand emotional intelligence. 
As a student, you are especially likely to 
experience times of uncertainty. A stimulating, 
higher-level education should be challenging. 
You should feel stretched. You should feel that 
occasionally the ground is moving beneath 
your feet. Confusion and uncertainty are 
characteristics of moving from ‘novice’ to more 
expert or sophisticated levels of thinking. If you 
know this, then you should be able to cope with 
that uncertainty without feeling something is 
very wrong. 
Your intra-personal life is a rich source of 
information for you. It is one of the most 
important and valuable subjects you can ever 
study: you cannot know enough about the 
‘inner life’ of your mind. The knowledge you 
gain about yourself and how you can best 
manage your own attitudes and thought 
processes will enable you to optimise your 
performance in any walk of life.

People and task 
management skills
Inter-personal skills
Although your work as a student is usually 
graded on individual effort, people skills are 
still very important. Indeed, on most courses, 
these skills are essential.
Many class-based and on-line sessions are 
designed to be collaborative. You may be 
asked to take part in joint presentations 
for seminars and workshops, peer-based 
support, peer-criticism, group work, on-line 
discussions boards, producing class journals, 
collaborative research projects within your 
institution or with students or colleagues 
from other organisations. Your course 
may require you to work with research 
participants, technicians, administrators, and 
supervisors.
These are just some ways in which you may 
be called upon to exercise people skills. In 
addition, you will have the chance to meet 
and interact with a wide range of people 
through your course, your institution, and 
through the opportunities open to you as a 
student.
It is likely, therefore, that during your time as 
a student, you will:
•• develop your inter-personal skills naturally 
to a greater or lesser extent, through the 
experiences you encounter, adding to the 
portfolio of skills that you can carry with 
you into graduate roles, and
•• benefit whilst still a student from 
developing such people skills as these, 
which can make study easier and more 
enjoyable.
Problem-solving and task management
Good task management skills help you to get things 
done more easily and efficiently, with minimum stress, 
leaving you more time and energy for other things. 
In completing tasks successfully, it helps to draw on a 
broad range of skills: intellectual, intra-personal and 
inter-personal, and operational. In particular, if you have 
a range of problem-solving approaches upon which you 
can call, this then helps you to feel confident in taking a 
solution-focused approach to new tasks and challenges.
Task management skills also oil the wheels in your 
dealing with other people. For example, you can build 
a great deal of good will, confidence and trust if people 
can depend on you to be organised, punctual, and likely 
to complete tasks on schedule. For collaborative tasks, 
whether as part of your study or at work, people are 
more likely to want you on their team if you are good 
at managing projects, systematic in your approach, and 
able to resolve problems that arise.
If you can combine good people skills with good 
task management skills, then you also have strong 
employability skills that should enable you to succeed in 
most work roles.
This section helps you to understand more what is 
meant by such skills and the various behaviours and 
attitudes that help you to put them into practice.

Introduction
‘People skills’ are a combination of good inter-
personal skills (being able to work well with others) 
and intra-personal skills (being able to manage 
one’s own attitudes and emotions). ‘People skills’ 
are now critical to success in a wide range of 
careers. They are as important to the modern 
economy as are knowledge, information and 
technical skills. 
This has been a much neglected part of the 
curriculum in the past, perhaps because there 
was less demand for subtle understandings of 
inter-personal relationships. However, changes 
in the kind of work we do, in technology, in tele-
communications, in social structure, and the global 
economy have altered the way we interact. There 
are now much higher expectations for good inter-
personal and communication skills. 
In particular, compared with previous generations, 
we are more likely to meet and work with an 
extremely diverse range of people, often in 
global contexts. In the past, most people grew 
up and worked within a very confined world, 
with a narrow set of social rules. It was clear what 
behaviour was expected of you down to the finest 
detail of your personal life. People knew almost 
from birth what they should say, to whom and 
when. They tended to meet people from a very 
small geographical area, often only their own 
village or part of town. Horizons were very narrow. 
Today, most of the old social codes are 
disappearing. The context is infinitely more varied 
than in the past, the range of options in any one 
situation is much greater. This requires much 
higher levels of sophistication in our attitudes 
to others, in how we manage our personal 
beliefs and values in social settings, and how 
we respond to diversity. We have much more 
personal responsibility for developing good social 
relations, making relationships work and forming 
judgements about the appropriate behaviour in 
any setting. We all, too, have greater individual 
legal responsibility for our decisions and actions.
‘People skills’ is a vast and rapidly developing 
area. This chapter looks at some key aspects of 
developing people skills from the perspective of a 
student or new graduate.

Making a connection
Making a connection requires only a little effort. 
From this, the basis of good trust or even life-long 
friendships can develop. The minimum required 
are a few very basic gestures that show good will:
•• making eye contact
•• giving a genuine smile
•• being helpful when asked
•• giving a friendly greeting
•• showing basic consideration for the other person
•• using a friendly, polite manner
•• making a comment or asking a question that 
shows interest without being intrusive
•• being consistent in either friendly or distant 
behaviour.
These may seem small and obvious. However, 
think about the contact you have with people 
you find difficult. Which of the above gestures 
were missing either at your first encounter or on 
a regular basis? Which of these gestures do you 
value? A forced smile, an abrupt response, an 
unpleasant tone of voice, and such small details 
can put relationships on a wrong footing – making 
hard work of any future connections. 
Reflection: People skill needs
Which people skills are needed for:
•• the careers areas that interest you?
•• meeting the requirements of your 
programme?
•• your personal needs and interests?
If you are unsure, speak to the Careers Service 
at the university and to your tutors. 
•• What are your priorities for developing your 
people skills?
Developing rapport
Forming a good rapport is the cornerstone of 
relationships with other people. Rapport requires 
such behaviours as:
•• ‘making a connection’
•• taking a genuine interest in the other person
•• skilful listening
•• developing mutual trust and cooperation.
Activity: Self-evaluation: How good are your people skills now? (continued)
Interpreting your score
70–90  This is an excellent score. If your ratings 
were accurate, you are able to manage very 
well your relationships with other people. This 
suggests an invaluable set of people skills. 
Consider how you could develop these further. 
How can you use these skills in the career areas 
that interest you?
40–69  This is a good score. If your ratings were 
accurate, this suggests your people skills are 
already well developed. Look for themes in the 
statements to which you gave lower ratings. 
Which areas could be further improved? 
20–39  If your ratings were accurate, this suggests 
you have developed some people skills as well 
as an awareness of where you lack strengths 
currently. Look for themes in the statements 
to which you gave lower ratings. Taking your 
programme needs and career interests into 
consideration, which is your next priority for 
development?
0–19  If your ratings were accurate, this suggests 
that you have identified that people skills are 
not currently a strength for you. Check with 
people who know you well whether you have 
rated yourself too harshly. It is also important 
that you identify which people skills are most 
critical for meeting the requirements of your 
programme and career interests. Consider 
speaking to the Careers Service or your 
tutors to identify areas of priority for future 
development. This score also suggests that 
you might have difficulties in relationships 
generally. That can be stressful. If so, student 
counselling services can offer useful ideas 
about how to make your interactions with 
others run more smoothly.

People skills

Taking a genuine interest 
Generally, we appreciate people with similar values 
and beliefs to our own, who do not challenge our 
own view of the world or our material interests. 
‘Difference’ can be unsettling. It suggests there 
might be more than one way of doing or being. 
Our survival mechanisms do not like this idea: it 
suggests someone else might be ‘right’ and our 
way ‘wrong’. We are not usually comfortable 
with such ideas. Our minds tend to throw us 
lifelines such as ‘that’s boring’, ‘he’s a fool’, ‘that’s 
rubbish!’ very early, before we are even aware it 
is happening, so that we do not have to really 
consider what we are feeling. 
As we develop people skills, we are better able 
to accept a wider range of differences in other 
people. We learn to find the point of interest in 
difference and the value of diversity. We cease to 
see the world in terms of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, but 
as a rich spectrum. 
The benefits of finding the point of interest in 
other people are that:
•• we find the world around us to be more 
interesting
•• boredom disappears and our life experience is 
richer
•• we feel more comfortable, emotionally, when 
with strangers
•• people are able to feel more comfortable around 
us
•• we have a better understanding of the world 
around us and of the motivations of others
•• we are better able to manage any situation that 
involves other people.
Activity
Balloon game
In your journal or a notebook, give one page to each of the  
following (ten pages in all). 
The characters 
First, write the name of one person on the top of each  
page, so that you have the names of:
•• two people that you really know, like and admire
•• two people that you know vaguely and have no strong  
feelings about
•• two people that you think are just not like you at all and that  
you do not like much
•• two that you know well and really dislike or despise
•• two people that you do not know at all (you may invent names for them  
if you do not know them).
The motivation
Now, imagine you are in a television challenge. You are aloft in a balloon with these ten people. You 
will receive a prize of your choice (up to £5 million) if you can bring all ten people back to earth. 
Otherwise, you will be fined your income for a year. If you fail, they get a prize instead. 
The challenge
However, you are only allowed to transport back any person if you can convince the audience that 
each person is really worth saving. You will need to show that you know about the person and can say 
things about them that bring out their best features. 
For each person, use their name page to brainstorm responses to the following:
•• what I like, value, admire, find interesting already about this person
•• what I dislike about this person at present
•• what this person contributes to the world that is different or valuable
•• questions I could ask, to find out more
•• anything I could do to develop a better understanding of this person.

People and task management skills

‘Listening’ is something we take for granted. 
However, skilful listening is about more than 
‘hearing the words’. It involves understanding the 
message, the situation and other people. 
Good listening skills enable other people to feel 
at ease, to trust the listener, and to express more 
easily what they really wish to communicate.
There is an art to being able to discover what 
another person is trying to communicate, and 
this can take many years to perfect. However, the 
following are good starting places. 
Body language
Demonstrate clearly that you are listening, using 
appropriate body language. Usually this means 
slightly exaggerating what you would normally 
do anyway. For example, ensure you make eye 
contact, without staring. 
Use body language that shows you are listening: 
lean forward a little, tilt your head slightly to the 
side, nod occasionally to show you are taking in 
what is being said. Many people do this naturally 
when they are really listening but some do not. 
Let them finish
Let people complete the point they are making 
without interruption. Wait for a pause or an intake 
of breath before you start to respond. Make any 
necessary interruptions with consideration for 
the other person – even if you feel they have not 
been considering your needs. If you really must 
interrupt, because of time constraints, for example, 
apologise for interrupting. State the reason for 
the interruption politely. Make some reference, 
however brief, to what has been said, before you 
change the subject or rush away.
Listen for the underlying message
The ‘underlying message’ may be different from 
the actual words used. What does the person 
really mean? What do they really want you to 
hear or to know? Are they saying one thing but 
communicating something different? For example, 
they may say ‘I’m fine!’ but look or sound very 
angry or distressed. Just note these differences. 
If it feels right to say so, you may point out the 
message that you are receiving: ‘You sound very 
upset’ or ‘You look very angry.’
Reflection: Balloon game
In your journal or a notebook, note:
•• Which things you were less willing to do in 
this exercise? What was difficult and why?
•• In general, what kinds of people are you more 
likely to dismiss as ‘not your type of person’? 
Who do you overlook? What kinds of things 
might you be missing out on because of that 
way of thinking? Are there ways that your 
current behaviour may come back to haunt 
you in the future?
•• What effect might your behaviour be having 
upon other people?
Skilful listening 
Good listening skills are invaluable to forming 
a rapport with others. Most people react very 
strongly to feeling they are ‘not heard’ or that 
‘someone really listened’. This is especially true 
where people feel vulnerable (if they are new to a 
group, distressed, angry, have received bad news, 
etc.). 
Reflection: Being heard
In your reflective journal, jot down some 
thoughts on the following.
Think of a recent situation when you felt that 
you were trying to communicate your point of 
view and could not make yourself heard.
•• What was the situation: what happened?
•• How did you feel?
•• What did you do?
•• What could the ‘listener’ or ‘listeners’ have 
done differently to help you feel you had 
been listened to?
•• What benefits would there have been for that 
person if they had listened more skilfully? 
For example, how did their poor listening 
skills affect your attitude or responses to the 
person or people involved?
135
People skills

Check for meaning
People may not be skilled at communicating what 
they want you to hear. Alternatively, you may mishear 
or misread the situation. The only way to be sure of 
the message being communicated is to feed it back to 
the person and check their response. Summarise what 
you think you have heard. Usually, this is best in brief 
phrases, prompts or questions when the other person is 
pausing for breath. Do this in ways that suggest you are 
trying to understand: 
•• ‘They said you have to fill in the form today?’
•• ‘And that wasn’t what you wanted?’ 
•• ‘So you don’t want to go ahead any more?’
Clarify details
•• Ask questions to clarify points and show your interest.
•• If something isn’t clear, point out that you haven’t 
quite understood. Ask the other person to explain it 
again or in a different way.
•• Be specific about the exact points you do not 
understand. Your confusion may arise because 
the other person is not fully clear about the issue 
either. Your questions may help them to clarify their 
thinking. 
Leave silences
Some people find silence awkward and it can be 
tempting to keep talking in order to avoid silences. 
However, silence fulfils important functions: 
•• it gives a clear signal that you have finished speaking
•• it gives opportunities for other people to contribute
•• it allows time for reflection
•• it gives people time to develop their ideas 
•• it allows people time to manage their feelings and 
emotions
•• it can enable non-verbal communication to take 
place, which is often more powerful than speaking.
Reflection: Listening skills
•• In your reflective journal, note down which of 
these listening skills you find easiest.
•• Which do you find most difficult?
•• Which could you develop further? 
•• Can you think of recent examples where you used 
any of these skills?
Developing mutual trust 
Reflection: Developing trust
•• Who do you really trust with your 
secrets?
•• Who do you really trust with your 
money?
•• Who do you trust to tell you the truth 
about themselves?
•• Who do you trust to tell you the truth 
about yourself? 
•• In each case, what created that trust?
Your responses to the above activity probably 
elicited an awareness that trust develops out 
of acquaintance. It also takes time. It can be 
easily broken. It can take time to repair once 
broken. You cannot force trust onto people; 
the harder you try, the more suspicious 
people may become. You really do ‘earn it’ 
through the proof of your actions. 
It is difficult to establish good working 
relationships if these are not founded on 
trust. Co-operation with others, sharing 
ideas, revealing personal information, 
negotiating compromises, commissioning 
work, offering contracts, and numerous other 
everyday activities are all facilitated by the 
development of mutual trust. 
Reflection: Losing trust in 
others
In your reflective journal, think of an 
occasion when you lost your trust in 
somebody.
•• What happened? 
•• What did this feel like? 
•• What were the consequences? 
•• How has this affected your behaviour 
towards that person? 
•• What would that person have to do to 
regain your trust?
•• Which kinds of behaviour break trust?

People and task management skills

Team work 
Learning in groups reaps greater benefits than 
attending formal lectures or presentations. 
It gives students more scope to express 
themselves, to establish effective relationships 
with tutors and others in the group, and to 
develop a range of skills such as team working.
Skills and Enterprise Network, 2001
‘Finding and keeping a good team’ is 
amongst chief executives’ most highly rated 
ingredients of success (Taylor and Humphrey, 
2002). Despite the importance of team work 
to working life, few people have developed 
outstanding team skills. Team players are 
usually well-appreciated by both employers 
and colleagues. On the other hand, our 
natural self-interest in our own needs, moods, 
beliefs, wants and feelings can make it very 
easy for us to sabotage the teams or groups 
that we find ourselves in. 
Sabotaging the team 
You may have come up with a long list of 
items. Typical responses include:
•• not bothering to get to know some of the 
team members
•• dominating the group
•• not contributing enough
•• leaving one or two people to do all the 
work
•• speaking badly about some team members
•• trying to split the team into ‘goodies’ and 
‘baddies’
•• not taking responsibility for tasks that need 
to be done
•• being late or not turning up at all
•• putting your own needs before those of the 
team
•• not listening to other people’s ideas
•• not using the strengths and qualities of 
each person to best effect
•• messing about
•• not caring what happens to others on the 
team
•• not being able to take criticism.
Reflection: Losing trust in other people
In your reflective journal,
•• Think of an occasion when you did something to 
undermine other people’s trust in you. 
•• What happened?
•• What did this feel like? 
•• What were the consequences? 
•• How has this affected the relationship between 
you and that person? 
•• What was (or is) needed to restore that person’s 
trust in you? 
•• What did you learn about trust from this 
experience ?
•• Which kinds of behaviour break trust?
Brainstorm:
•• What kinds of behaviour develop people’s trust?
•• What kinds of things could you do to develop your 
abilities in gaining other people’s trust in you?
You can build trust if you:
Are clear what 
you can and 
cannot do
Do what you
say you will do 
Avoid making promises 
you can’t keep 
Are consistent in your 
behaviour from one 
day to the next
Are dependable and fulfil  
your responsibilities; turn 
up on time
Keep confidential 
information confidential

Sabotaging a team
In your reflective journal, take two pages. 
•• On the first page, brainstorm a list of things 
people could do to sabotage a group. How 
could they make the group an unpleasant, 
unproductive, irritating experience? When 
you have finished, compare it with the list 
given above.
•• On the second page, make a list of what 
people can do to make groups work. 
Compare your list with the one under 
‘Creating a good team’ below.
•• Which of those behaviours do you 
demonstrate? Be honest. What could you do 
to improve your own contribution to groups 
and teams?
Creating a good team
A good team will show the following 
characteristics:
Works as one
•• It has a shared vision. It knows what it wants to 
achieve
•• puts the desired team outcome first: individual 
interests take a secondary place
•• is clear about targets and priorities – and agrees 
these together
•• shares information
•• can make decisions.
Works to strengths
•• It has members with different qualities, who can 
make different contributions
•• takes time to discover the experience, skills and 
interests of all and how it can make best use of 
these
•• shares expertise. A team that is together for 
some time is strengthened if individuals share 
their knowledge and skills.
Includes everyone
•• It makes efforts to ensure that nobody feels left 
out or undervalued
•• gives room to individuals. Team work does not 
mean that everybody has to be and think the 
same. On the contrary, variety and difference 
can be a source of strength. There are different 
ways of being a good team player.
Respects its members 
•• It respects everyone’s time by: being punctual 
for meetings, completing individual targets on 
time, being aware of how one person’s own 
work affects other people’s achievements, 
monitoring personal contributions to meetings 
so that time is not wasted in long anecdotes and 
tangents
•• respects the opinions of the team and uses 
strategies to enable all team members to give 
their views: feeding in at the beginning of 
meetings, giving each member equal time to 
speak on an issue, inviting people who have not 
spoken yet to contribute their views. 
What I can contribute to the team?
The skills and qualities you contribute to a team 
will develop through experience. However, if you 
are not used to team work, you will feel more 
confident at the beginning if you think of what 
you are already able to contribute. The following 
activity helps you identify some things you could 
contribute to team work at present.

Turn short-comings into 
strengths
•• How realistic is the above view of yourself? 
•• Would you have the confidence to discuss 
this with someone else and be able to cope 
with their responses?
•• What targets can you set yourself to improve 
your performance for one of those areas?
•• What, if any, are the positive aspects to your 
‘short-comings’? What do these suggest 
about your potential strengths (such as 
flexibility, caring for others, willingness to 
accept responsibility, confidence in speaking 
your mind) that could be adapted to the 
benefit of the team? 
•• Take at least one short-coming and look for 
the way this could be adapted or converted 
into a strength. For example, if you are poor 
at attendance, how could you make up for 
non-attendance in other ways?
Belbin team types
Belbin and the Cambridge Industrial Training 
Research Unit made a dramatic discovery about 
teams. In an experiment that was repeated many 
times with different participants, it was found 
that teams made up entirely of the best business 
brains were far less successful than those with very 
mixed memberships. Belbin (1996) went on to 
outline different kinds of roles that people could 
occupy in a team, depending on their personal 
characteristics. The activity on p. 141 summarises 
some of the characteristics associated with each 
Belbin type. 
•• With which types do you identify? 
•• With which one type do you identify the most?
•• Which three other types would you most 
appreciate having in your team?

The best mix?
Belbin found some combinations work well. In 
particular, a group seems to work well if there is:
•• a co-ordinator type – to chair the group 
•• a good ‘plant’ – an imaginative person with the 
right kind of creative skills for the project
•• a monitor–evaluator who can spot and weigh up 
good and bad ideas
•• a spread of other types. In particular, an 
implementer or completer-finisher is useful. 
A balance of types is valuable: extrovert and 
introvert, those who generate ideas and 
those who can assess them, those who bring 
in change and those who maintain some 
continuity. 
What kind of balance is there in the team of four 
(including yourself) that you selected in the activity 
above.
What strengths would a team like that 
demonstrate? What would its weaknesses be?

Action sets
‘Action sets’ (McGill and Beaty, 2001) are a 
particular kind of team. They are semi-formal 
groups which offer opportunities to gain input 
and alternatives from others and receive structured 
support. 
Action sets, as the name suggests, focus on getting 
things done. Unlike most groups, however, the 
aim is to help each person to find a solution to 
a problem or difficulty of their own choice. The 
group brainstorms ideas and discusses solutions 
within a tight time-frame, and at the next meeting 
checks to see what action was undertaken. The 
group itself does not carry out the action: it merely 
proposes and monitors action, at the invitation of 
each member.
Advantages of action sets
The advantages of action sets are:
•• the rules are easy to follow
•• all members are equal
•• they provide supportive contexts: usually, you 
choose to be in an action set
•• you have a place where you can take a difficult 
issue and work it through
•• they are very focused
•• they offer a range of perspectives on a problem 
you choose to bring
•• they generate ideas and solutions
•• they require rapid decision making, and so assist 
decision-making skills for all members
•• they give practice in arriving at a solution in a 
very short time
•• they offer an additional source of motivation: 
reporting back to the group at the next meeting 
encourages you to take action
•• members get to know each other well and know 
what works for each member.

You may find it useful to select an action set 
according to Belbin types. If so, bear in mind the 
aims of the group. What types of person are likely 
to work best together for the kinds of problems 
that arise from your programme? Would it help to 
include someone who is not on the programme?
The limits of action sets 
Action sets are not usually:
•• emotional support groups
•• discussion groups: talk is very circumscribed
•• social groups
•• project groups: they do not ‘do’ the work 
needed to solve an individual’s problem outside 
of the meeting.
Guidelines for the meeting of an action set 
Ideally, leave at least 15 minutes for 
each member. If you have only an 
hour a week for such meetings, a 
set of four people is probably best. 
If you have 2 hours, a group of six is 
probably the optimum size. An even 
number will work best. The timing 
below assumes six people in a 2-hour 
slot. With a 15-minute break, that 
gives each person 17 minutes each. 
For each person:
Stage 1 (3 minutes)
•• Each person has a set time to discuss the area 
they wish to improve. Time is limited so each 
person needs to get to the point quickly. 
•• While that person is speaking, the group listens 
without interrupting.
•• One person keeps the time.
•• Once the time is up, the person must stop 
speaking immediately.
Stage 2 (2 minutes)
The group may ask one or two questions, briefly, 
to clarify the situation. 
Stage 3 (3 minutes)
The person whose issue is being considered 
listens without speaking whilst the rest of the 
group brainstorms possible solutions and ways of 
thinking about the problem. Again, a limited time 
is allowed. 
Stage 4 (4 minutes)
The person and the group have a set time to clarify 
and discuss options together briefly.
Stage 5 (2 minutes)
The person whose issue is being discussed has a 
set time to state which actions they will undertake 
before the next meeting. All members write down 
what has been agreed, and monitor this at the 
next meeting. 
Stage 6 (3 minutes)
In the following session, each person reports 
back on actions they have taken. The group 
encourages successes and improvements. If the 
person has not followed through on what was 
agreed, this may be used as their focus for the 
session. Feedback must be timetabled into the 
time allocated to each person. 
Running the action set 
Ideally, action sets are meetings of peers where 
everybody takes equal responsibility. Tasks are 
rotated or allocated to individual strengths:
•• organising the room
•• phoning members to remind them of the next 
meeting and of agreed actions
•• time-keeping in meetings
•• keeping the group strictly to the right stage 
and item under discussion
•• maintaining a supportive atmosphere 
•• ensuring everyone contributes 
•• ensuring everybody gets equal time
•• ensuring different people go first or last each 
time. 
Roles
You may find action sets work better if you 
allocate roles to the team. Useful roles to include 
are:
•• A Co-ordinator or Implementer: to ensure the 
group sticks to task, keeps to time, and that 
everyone gets equal time. Each stage must be 
very strictly timed.
•• A Plant or a Shaper or Resource Investigator: 
who may bring a different way of looking at 
things.
•• A Team-worker: to enhance the social skills of 
the group.
•• A Monitor–evaluator or Completer–finisher: 
to assist the group to move on and to choose 
between options.

People skills

It should: 
•• be formulated positively – as something which 
can be done to improve performance, rather 
than what is wrong
•• take the person forward – it is not simply a 
vague directive to do something differently
•• be realistic – the suggestion can actually be put 
into practice by the recipient
•• be selective – it addresses priorities rather than 
every aspect of performance
•• be offered kindly – delivered in a voice and 
manner that make it easier to accept.
Poor feedback includes:
•• too much comment and criticism. This is off-
putting. People stop listening and may get 
distressed
•• negative feedback. People ignore this if they feel 
their efforts are not recognised
•• vague feedback such as ‘Unclear’ or ‘More detail 
needed’. State exactly what is unclear or which 
details are needed
•• demoralising comments such as ‘this is 
nonsense’; ‘gobbledegook!’; ‘could do better’
•• illegible feedback. People usually do not bother 
to decipher illegible writing unless they think it 
says something very positive about them.
Reflection: Offering constructive 
criticism
Think of a recent occasion when you offered 
feedback to someone about their work or study. 
Jot down: 
•• What were the circumstances?
•• What did you do or say?
•• Which of the above constructive 
characteristics did you include or omit?
•• What else could you have said or done to 
improve your feedback?
Constructive questions and responses
Use constructive questions to discover why the 
person made the choices or took the steps they 
did – and to explore their next step forward. For 
example:
•• ‘What did you think worked well?’
•• ‘Is there anything you would do differently next 
time?’
Constructive criticism
Reflection: Constructive criticism
In your reflective journal, jot down some ideas 
about what you think is meant by ‘constructive 
criticism’.
Criticism does not mean pointing out ‘what is 
wrong’. Technically, criticism draws out what is 
good, bad and satisfactory. Constructive criticism 
goes further: it offers a clear and practicable ‘next 
step forward’ and is expressed in a positive way. 
It leads towards improvement. For constructive 
criticism to be effective, it has to be expressed in a 
way that is easy to ‘hear’ and understand. 
Making constructive criticism and giving 
feedback
The aim of feedback is to help other people to 
see how they could improve their performance or 
gain a new perspective on their work. The focus 
of criticism is the other person, their needs or the 
requirements of the task. It is not about showing 
how clever you are at ‘picking holes’ in what other 
people do or say. 
Constructive criticism is phrased so that it offers 
truthful but skilful feedback with ideas on how 
to improve or to progress. It is very easy to hurt 
people’s feelings through unskilful feedback, and 
nothing is gained by this. 
Good feedback involves:
•• waiting until invited for your opinion
•• recognising effort
•• being well informed: ensure you know the 
circumstances, intentions and requirements 
before offering feedback
•• being clear and truthful but not blunt or hurtful
•• indicating what the other person has got right – 
so they continue to do this in the future
•• indicating what has already improved
•• indicating a small number of achievable goals 
for improvement
•• giving concrete examples of what is required:
‘I think this would look even better if …’
‘I like this. Have you thought about …’
‘The first half was good. The second half would 
benefit from …’

People and task management skills

Receiving criticism
Accept criticism gracefully, however it is 
given. Not everybody is skilled at giving 
criticism. 
•• Consider all criticism carefully, even if it 
sounds unacceptable. 
•• Look for the elements of truth in what 
is said. This is sometimes easier after 
you have had some time to reflect.
•• Hear both the positive and the 
negative aspects. Many people hear 
only negative feedback.
•• Check you have understood what 
is being said. It is easy to mishear, 
especially if it didn’t sound positive.
•• Acknowledge the feedback. It was 
probably not easy for the other person 
to give it. 
•• Say thank-you. 
•• Reflect upon the meaning of what you 
have heard. What steps could you take 
to improve your performance?
Reflection: Receiving criticism
Think of a recent occasion when somebody offered you 
feedback or criticism about your work or performance. 
In your reflective journal, jot down: 
•• What were the circumstances?
•• What did they do or say?
•• How did you respond? What else could you have 
done to make best use of the criticism?
•• What does this experience tell you about giving and 
receiving criticism well?
Being assertive
What is assertiveness?
Assertiveness means standing up for yourself without 
demonstrating anger. Assertive people look for solutions 
that suit both parties, respecting the rights of both.
Reflection: Characteristics of assertive 
people
What picture comes to mind when you think of an 
assertive person? Jot down your thoughts in your 
reflective journal.
Assertiveness is about:
•• respecting your own and other people’s rights
•• respecting your own and others’ needs
•• being clear and straightforward with other people
•• taking more control over your own life and taking 
responsibility for changing what you do not like. 
Rights
Palmer and Dryden (1995) offer a list of rights associated 
with assertiveness. These include the right to:
•• say ‘no’
•• make mistakes
•• consider your needs important
•• express your feelings in an appropriate way without 
violating anybody else’s rights
•• take responsibility for your actions
•• respect yourself
•• set your own priorities
•• be assertive without feeling guilty.
You could include others, such as the right to:
•• do well in life
•• ‘What was your inspiration for this?’
•• ‘Did you find this worked?’
•• ‘That is an unusual approach. I am 
interested in why you did it this way?’
•• ‘Have you had any ideas about where 
we could apply this?’
145
People skills

have ‘the right to make mistakes’ on a regular 
basis. Having the right to an opinion means 
you have the right to hold the opinion, but not 
necessarily to subject other people to insult or 
harm as a result. 
Assertiveness is not about insisting on your own 
interests, irrespective of the consequences to 
yourself and others or without consideration of the 
circumstances. When you are assertive, you ensure 
that:
•• you look at the whole picture, but you put 
yourself in that picture
•• you know your own opinions
•• you are able to identify your own needs and 
interests
•• you weigh up, realistically, whether it is 
appropriate to stand up for your rights and 
interests in the situation. Sometimes it is too 
dangerous or risky to assert our rights unless we 
can ensure safety and support. 
Being clear and straightforward with other 
people
When we state our needs in a calm, clear, 
straightforward manner, then we are showing 
respect both to ourselves and to others. When 
other people know where you stand, they can then 
choose to respond in an appropriate way. You gain 
a clearer picture of their position. 
Assertiveness is not:
•• Being aggressive    Assertiveness does not include: 
rage, shouting, forcing other people to do what 
you want, physical force or threats of force, 
aggressive body language, intimidating others. 
You have the right to feel angry, or to shout in 
private, but not to express these to others in 
ways that might make them feel coerced into 
doing what you want. 
•• Being manipulative    Assertiveness does 
not include: using psychological games to 
manoeuvre people into doing what you want. 
For example, it does not involve shaming 
people, trying to make them feel guilty or 
anxious, reminding them of debts, playing upon 
people’s doubts and fears. 
•• Being passive    Assertiveness does not include: 
being silent about your own needs and interests; 
being a ‘martyr’; letting other people have what 
they want whilst you go without; staying quiet 
•• ask for what you need to know
•• be taken into consideration in decisions that 
affect you
•• fairness and justice
•• personal safety
•• love
•• think
•• be free of insult and discriminatory behaviour 
on the grounds of race, colour, nationality, sex, 
sexual orientation, disability, parentage, work 
history or personal beliefs
•• your opinions.
Respecting your own and others’ rights and 
needs
‘Rights’ are not universal nor equally applied. 
They are not all ‘human rights’ by international 
agreement and may not apply in all countries 
or conditions. People in prison cannot set all 
their own priorities, for example. Some rights 
are protected by law; others are commonly held 
beliefs about human rights. You may have to 
decide what rights are reasonable or legal for your 
own circumstances.

Reflection: A recurring siuation
Select one situation where you feel you deserve to 
have your opinions, needs or interests taken into 
consideration and respected – and where you feel this 
does not happen at present. Select an event that recurs, 
which you will have to face soon.
•• What usually happens?
•• What do you do?
•• What do you say?
•• What rights are at issue in this situation?
•• What are the rights of others in this situation?
•• What kind of behaviour do you demonstrate when 
you feel you are unlikely to get your way (aggression, 
passive aggression, manipulation or passivity)? 
•• What do you gain by this behaviour?
•• What are the effects of this upon others?
Assertiveness techniques
Activity
Assertive techniques
Consider the assertiveness techniques below in relation 
to your ‘recurring situation’.
1  Identify blocks to assertiveness
What has been preventing you from using assertive 
techniques up to now? 
■
■Not being aware of the differences between 
aggression, passivity, manipulation and assertiveness
■
■It wasn’t part of my family or cultural background 
■
■Fear of other people’s responses
■
■Fear of failure
■
■Blaming myself for the situation
■
■Not wanting to hurt other people’s feelings
■
■I wanted a quiet life
■
■My current methods may not be fair but I get what I 
want
2  Put yourself in the picture
This means that you:
•• look at the ‘big picture’: identify all the interests of all 
the parties, including your own
•• ensure you are in the picture: if you are more likely to 
respond in a passive way, you may not feel you have a 
right to be considered
when you want to speak out; effacing 
yourself so that you are not seen, heard 
or considered. This behaviour can be 
very irritating to others – and means 
they have to take responsibility for your 
needs. 
•• Being passive aggressive    Assertiveness 
does not include: appearing to be 
passive whilst being clear that you are 
angry. Passive aggressive behaviour is 
very distressing to other people, and 
confuses situations so they are harder 
to resolve. It includes behaviour such 
as saying ‘I don’t mind’, ‘do what you 
want’, ‘whatever!’ whilst using angry 
facial expressions, body language or 
tone of voice. Angry silences, walking 
out of the room, making a noise to 
block out what another person is 
saying, not turning up to appointments 
and generally not co-operating, are 
ways of expressing passive aggression.
Reflection: Evaluating 
personal assertiveness
It is rare for anybody to go through 
life in an assertive and completely fair, 
reasonable, manner. Most of us tend 
to use at least one or two of the above  
approaches (aggressive, manipulative, 
passive aggressive, or passive) for some 
or all of the time in order to get our 
own way or to avoid an unpleasant 
situation. In your reflective journal, 
consider:
•• Which approach do you use most 
often to get your way or to avoid 
unpleasant situations?
•• Do people who know you well agree 
that this is the approach you use?
Taking control over your life
When we use assertiveness techniques, 
we take responsibility for our actions in 
order to increase our control over an 
aspect of our life.

•• consider whether you really should be at the 
centre, near the centre or on the periphery of 
the picture. Passive people can believe it is polite 
or kind or good manners to put themselves 
on the margins. If this happens all the time, it 
is likely to be irritating to others, as they will 
always be put into the position of being the 
more selfish, greedy, inconsiderate person, 
which is not pleasant. Aggressive people may 
always find reasons to be at the centre. 
3  Make ‘I’ statements
People who find it hard to be assertive can find it 
difficult to make ‘I’ statements such as:
•• ‘I want …’
•• ‘I need …’
•• ‘I am responsible for …’
Sometimes this is very noticeable because they 
refer to their own needs in very general terms:
•• ‘Everybody needs …’
•• ‘We all need …’
•• ‘It is important to …’
•• ‘You have to …’
•• ‘One has to …’

People and task management skills

6  Use positive language structures 
When you make ‘I’ statements, use positive language 
structures. Positive language structures avoid the use of ‘no’, 
or ‘not’. They are also clear, to the point and say exactly what 
you will do. Avoid words such as ‘try’, which suggests hard 
work or failure. Avoid modifiers such as ‘some’, ‘maybe’, ‘sort 
of’, ‘quite’.

•• I will ask for a lift.
I’ll try and see if I can get a lift.
•• I am entitled to this

comments to stop.
I think it would be better if 
there were a little less of these 
comments.
•• I will complete the

I intend to make a good shot at 
completing the race.
•• Can I have help 
lifting this, please?
I can’t lift this on my own! You 
could help!
•• I need to say 
something.
I’m never given a chance to say 
what I need.
•• I feel angry and 
upset.
I am trying not to get angry here!
7  Ask the other person’s opinion
When you have stated what the issue is for you, check whether 
there could be a different interpretation. Ask the person how 
they see the situation and what they think about it. Show that 
you have a genuine interest in hearing their point of view. Let 
them give their interpretation without interrupting them.
8  Acknowledge the feelings
It is very common to see people arguing, even hissing through 
gritted teeth, ‘I am not angry! I am not angry!’ when it is clear 
to others that they are. This can make a situation difficult to 
resolve because the truth isn’t being acknowledged.
It isn’t always pleasant or easy to talk about feelings, but it is 
usually useful. Even if you do not voice your feelings, make 
sure that you at least know what they are. Otherwise, other 
people will know more about you than you do yourself. 
•• Check what you are feeling.
•• Acknowledge to yourself how you are feeling.
•• Make an ‘I’ statement about this: ‘I feel …’
•• Take care not to spill out the emotion on the people around 
you. You have a right to feel angry, for example, but not to 
coerce others with your feelings.
•• Be prepared to hear how other people feel and consider 
what that means. You might not like hearing what they say, 
but they have the right to express how they feel too. 
4  Choose the moment
Ensure that:
•• The time is right.    This does not 
mean waiting for a perfect moment 
that may never arrive. It means 
choosing the best time available. 
Make an agreed time with the 
person or ensure that, at a meeting, 
time is put aside to discuss the 
matter. Be clear how long you need.
•• You have the person’s full 
attention.   Ask for this if necessary. 
Choose a moment when they are 
able to give you attention. Avoid 
competing with television, radio or 
loud music.
5  State the issue and the desired 
change
Take responsibility for letting 
the person know what you find 
unacceptable or difficult about their 
behaviour. Do so in a manner that is 
calm, and does not sound blaming. 
Describe behaviours rather than the 
person. Say what the behaviour is, and 
acknowledge responsibility for your 
own part in the event and for your 
own feelings and responses. Make it 
clear what you want.
Example 1 
‘I feel hurt when you do not respond 
when I speak to you in the mornings. 
I would like you to say “hello”.’
Rather than:
‘You are so rude in the mornings. You 
make me feel ignored and angry and 
it affects my whole day.’
Example 2
‘I need the price lists by 4:00 p.m. If 
you send them after 4:00, it is difficult 
to get our updates in the post.’ 
Rather than:
‘You know the post goes out at 4:00. 
I don’t know how you expect us all to 
get everything done when you can’t 
be bothered to get the lists to us in 
time. It’s your fault I was so upset last 
night – you really stress us out.’

Dealing with difficult people
On becoming a monster
Any of us can be a difficult person some of the time. Most of us have 
‘pet hates’: situations and people that we do not manage skilfully 
and which seem to make us unreasonable. When we are confronted 
by a ‘difficult person’, empathy can be a useful starting place. It is 
worth considering that this person might, like us, be very reasonable 
if the circumstances were different.
Reflection: Being difficult
In your reflective journal jot down one occasion when you acted 
unreasonably or ‘out of character’ – when you found yourself 
shouting at somebody, complaining unnecessarily, making a 
difficult situation worse, or blowing something out of proportion. 
•• What was it about the circumstances that led you to behave 
like that? 
•• What can you learn from your own experience that might help 
you to understand when other people seem to be unnecessarily 
difficult?
•• Jot down a list of all the circumstances that can turn you into a 
‘monster’. Are these things that might be typical of the day of a 
‘difficult person’ you know?
9  Suggest and invite solutions
Being assertive means looking 
for a solution that suits both 
sides as far as possible. Make 
constructive suggestions for 
a way forward. Point out the 
advantages to both parties. Ask 
the person for their suggestions 
and be prepared to negotiate 
(see p. 153).
10  Clarify what has been 
agreed
Check you both agree the 
details of what is agreed. 
This will avoid disputes later. 
Writing down the agreement 
strengthens the commitment. 
Read what the other person has 
written and check you agree 
with the details. Keep a copy. 
If you are not used to being 
assertive, it will take time 
to change your habits and 
thinking. You can build your 
confidence by using some 
‘practice runs’, either with a 
trusted friend or with a student 
counsellor. Keep a record of 
times when you are assertive 
so that you can monitor your 
progress.
Reflection:

•• How will you address 
these? 
•• Which of the above 
techniques could you use?
Is it just me?
If you experience the same person as difficult on several occasions, 
you might conclude that the person is just plain awkward. That 
may be the case, but there may be ways that you can ease your 
own relations with that person, so that your day runs more 
smoothly. Consider:

People and task management skills

Managing the situation
Identify the behaviour
The golden rule for interacting with people is to 
separate the behaviour from the person. This is 
easy to say but much more difficult in practice. 
When thinking about the person, make a conscious 
effort to focus on their actions. For example: ‘That 
irritates me’ rather than ‘She irritates me’. This 
distinction will then come more easily to you when 
you are with the person.
Isolate the source of irritation
For the ‘difficult person’ you identified above, jot 
down all their behaviours that really irritate or 
concern you. For example, do they:
•• interrupt you all the time? 
•• refuse to let you express your point of view? 
•• interrupt your study or work? 
•• arrive late for each seminar or meeting? 
•• take up all the discussion time with their 
opinions?
•• other things?
Look for positive interpretations of their 
behaviour
Look for characteristics about the person that 
you can genuinely appreciate. Look for a positive 
aspect to their unwanted behaviour, such as a 
desire to please, a willingness to contribute, a 
sense of humour.
Consider their needs
Usually behaviour has an intention – even if it is 
inappropriate to the context. Sometimes people 
simply go about getting what they need in a 
misguided way. The people you find difficult will 
be acting the way they do in order to achieve 
something. This might be to:
•• gain attention
•• be noticed
•• be respected
•• feel that people think they are clever
•• be heard
•• draw attention away from something else
•• make friends.
Consider how you (or the group) could give that 
person some of what they need. This may make 
them less demanding, and easier to cope with. 
•• Do other people find this person difficult?
•• Who seems to manage situations with this 
person best? What do they do?
•• What is it about the difficult person that 
provokes a response in you?
•• What is it about the person that makes you find 
it difficult to give calm and measured responses?
•• What do you do that contributes to making the 
situation more difficult than it need be? What 
could you do to improve the situation?
Reflection: Dealing with difficult 
people
Think of one occasion with a ‘difficult person’ 
that you consider had a significant impact upon 
you. Jot down a brief outline of what happened.
•• How did you feel at the time?
•• How were you affected afterwards? For 
example, was it hard to settle down to work, 
enjoy your evening, sleep, feel calm? 
•• How many times did you narrate the episode 
to others? How much time did this take up? 
What would you have done with that time 
otherwise? 
•• In retrospect, how might you have responded 
differently, either during the event or 
afterwards, so the experience affected you 
less? 
•• What do you have to gain by changing the 
interaction you have with this person?
The effect on me?
Difficult people can have a profound effect upon 
the people around them. They can become the 
source of constant conversation and a good source 
of gossip. Dealing with them, talking about them, 
going back over what happened, planning what 
you will say or do on the next occasion, all take up 
time and energy. That time could have been spent 
more fruitfully. Although it may be important 
to plan how to cope with a difficult person, it is 
just as important to ensure that the person does 
not become an excuse for time wasting, and for 
diverting energies from other problems. 
Whatever the difficult person may have done, 
you have a personal responsibility to yourself to 
manage the effects upon yourself.

People skills

want several times if the person is shouting or in 
full flow. 
•• ‘I want to leave this until we all feel calmer.’
•• ‘I want you to stop ringing me after 9 p.m.’
•• ‘I want to have more time for group discussion.’
•• ‘I want to hear what other people have to say.’
•• ‘I want a refund.’
Offer positive solutions
•• Maintain a positive focus. Look for an acceptable 
solution.
•• Offer a way out of a stalemate.
•• State the advantages of the proposed solution.
•• Be prepared to negotiate a reasonable 
compromise or to find a ‘bridge’ – even if you 
feel the other person should be taking the 
initiative. 
•• Invite all parties to write down the agreed 
solution so that it is clear and on record.
Clarify tasks
If people are difficult team members, they may not 
be clear or happy about what is expected of them.
•• Involve them in key decisions.
•• Negotiate and clarify targets.
•• Ensure their role offers sufficient challenge and 
interest.
Look for the ‘bottled up’ emotions
Even if somebody is being difficult, they probably 
think they are very reasonable. At that stage, 
there is probably very little you can say to change 
their mind. When we are emotional, we are not 
open to logical reasoning. Be prepared to let your 
perspective wait until the person is calmer.
The probability is that the person has built up 
emotions such as anger, frustration, rage or 
fear over a very long time. If this has not been 
acknowledged, they may be ‘dumping’ this 
emotion on other people without realising it. This 
will be evident in disproportionate responses to 
small things. 
Acknowledge the other person
People behave unreasonably when their needs are 
not met. Listen to what they are communicating, 
and let them know you have heard. For example:
Their situation 	
Your response
•• They are distressed	
‘I can see/hear that you  
	
are upset.’
•• They are angry	
‘I can see/hear you are  
	
angry.’
•• They want attention	
‘That is a good idea.’  
	
‘That’s an interesting  
	
point.’
Identify what they want
•• Ask the person what they want.
•• Repeat this back to them so they know you have 
listened and heard them correctly.
•• Consider whether the request is feasible.
•• Let them know what is feasible.
•• Stay calm and repeat this if the offer is refused.
Acknowledge your own feelings
•• Identify your own feelings. This will give you 
more control over your own responses. Are you 
angry? distressed? unhappy? raging? guilty? 
irritated? 
•• Check how well you are managing your 
emotions? Do you need to calm down? 
•• State your feelings clearly and simply so that the 
other person knows how you feel.
State indisputable facts
Rather than get into an entangled argument, focus 
on statements of fact:
•• ‘They are closing the doors. We have to go now.’
•• ‘This is a seminar. The issue cannot be resolved 
now.’
•• ‘We haven’t got the receipts here. We can look 
at this again once we have them.’
Keep it clear and simple
•• Keep it simple. Unless it is really necessary, avoid 
arguing about points of detail. 
•• State what needs to be done.
•• Keep to the present situation: avoid going over 
past events.
State what you want 
Consider what would be a reasonable outcome 
for you from the situation. State this calmly, 
simply and clearly. Avoid unnecessary details or 
commentary. You may need to repeat what you 
152

through the issues and the questions you will face 
so that you are clear about your own position. 
The stakes 
What is really at stake? What is the ultimate aim? 
This should inform the negotiation process. The 
ultimate aim may not be achievable now: world 
peace, a harmonious group atmosphere, or a 
successful group project will not be established by 
solving a single argument or making a single deal. 
However, the negotiation should aim to take you 
closer to the ultimate aim. If it takes you a small 
way forward, then something has been achieved. If 
it takes you a long way forward, then you have less 
to do in future negotiations. 
The ideal outcome
Consider the ideal outcome for you. What would 
this look like? What would be the benefits? Form 
a clear picture of this so that it motivates you to 
negotiate strongly.
The bottom line
Consider your ‘bottom line’: what is the minimum 
you will accept? This is usually less than we 
really want. Negotiation usually involves two 
sides with competing interests. Each side will 
have to concede something if an agreement is 
to be reached. Be clear what you want from the 
situation. Consider:
The ideal solution  What 
would be your ideal 
solution? A clear vision can 
strengthen your bargaining 
position.
A good acceptable 
outcome  What would this 
look like? What would be the 
benefits of this for you? What 
parts of your ‘ideal outcome’ 
are you prepared to relinquish?
The next best option  This may 
mean giving up more of the 
‘dream option’. 
The likely outcome  Be realistic. 
What is likely to happen? Is this 
acceptable? You may gain a 
better deal, but if you do not, 
how will you come to terms 
with the likely outcome? 
If the emotions are dumped on you: this is not fair, 
and you should not put up with it. 
The angry person probably cannot see what they 
are doing. It is unlikely to be helpful to discuss this 
at the time unless:
•• you know the person very well
•• you have a relationship which permits discussing 
personal matters (as the source of the emotion 
may be very personal)
•• you have agreed to set time aside for this
•• you are both very calm.
Don’t ‘pass the parcel’
It is very tempting to respond to emotional 
‘dumping’ by unloading all your own emotions. 
This may even feel good at the time. However, 
it is not a skilful way of dealing with the person 
or the situation, and makes it even harder to 
resolve differences over the longer term. To avoid 
unloading your emotions on others: 
•• Check which emotions you are most likely to 
unload onto others.
•• What are the triggers for this response? 
•• What kinds of ‘emotional dumping’ do you 
seem to invite most from other people (their 
anger? guilt? shame? anxiety? fear?)?
•• Plan a coping strategy so that you are not drawn 
into this sort of interaction.
Negotiating
Negotiation covers a wide spectrum. It can cover 
everyday situations, such as how much of the food 
budget goes on beer, chocolate or vegetables. It is 
an important part of group work, and most types 
of work include at least an element of negotiation 
with customers, clients or third parties. 
Good negotiators exercise a broad and very subtle 
set of skills and qualities. These include:
•• decision making
•• reading the situation and the ‘opposition’
•• persuasiveness and communication skills
•• assertiveness
•• dealing with difficult people. 
Decision making
When negotiating, you may have to make 
decisions very quickly. It is important to be well 
prepared before you arrive, and to have thought 
153
People skills

Flexibility
From what has been described above, it should 
be evident that negotiation requires you to weigh 
up many possibilities, to assess the situation, and 
be able to accept one of a number of outcomes, 
depending upon the circumstances. One option is 
to be inflexible, and to insist on the best possible 
option. You may be successful, but you are more 
likely to leave with nothing. This usually means you 
have to start again on a new set of negotiations, 
so you need to weigh up the costs of a ‘Nothing’ 
option very carefully.
Reading the situation and the ‘opposition’
Investigate the background
Find out as much as you can about the other 
person or team and their needs, interests and 
motivations. This puts you in a stronger position to 
negotiate. 
Clarify mutual positions 
Invite both sides to discuss their objectives and the 
possible options. This will enable you to see where 
there is room for manoeuvre. There will be a range 
of items that are not negotiable. It can take a lot of 
energy to try to alter the ‘non-negotiables’. Ensure 
you are clear what the other side will or will not 
accept. If you can live with these requirements, 
then leave them out of the discussion, and focus 
on what can be negotiated. 
Body language
The Institute of Management draws attention 
to the significance of body language as a means 
of communication – and the importance of 
understanding its impact in the workplace. Ribbens 
and Thompson (2002) argue that up to 90 per 
cent of communication may be non-verbal. Look 
for signs that suggest the other party is feeling 
defensive. People are less likely to negotiate to 
your advantage if they feel they need to ‘defend’ 
their own position. Look for: 
•• signs of distress (fidgeting; agitated movements; 
rocking; eyes looking downwards; moving 
hands over the face; pacing)
•• a closed stance (arms and legs crossed; pursed 
lips; hands tightly clasped, the body leaning 
forward in a defensive position)
•• obstructiveness (avoiding eye contact; shaking 
the head; refusal to engage in communication)
•• anxiety about speaking (moving hands across 
the mouth; biting the lips)
The minimum offer  What is your 
bottom line? What aspects are 
you prepared to negotiate, and 
what are your upper or lower 
limits for these? Practise saying 
these in a calm, clear way so that you sound firm 
and convincing when you come to argue your 
case. Write these down and take them with you so 
you do not concede on essentials. 
Know when to concede
It is not always easy to strike the perfect balance 
between holding out for the best possible option, 
and knowing when to concede in order to gain 
something from the negotiation. You will need to 
weigh up:
•• Deadlines    How much time you have in order to 
hold out for the best option.
•• Costs    What might you lose if you take a long 
time to come to an agreement? How long can 
you hold out for what you want?
•• Risks    What will happen if you hold out and do 
not get what you want? Will you still be able to 
manage the situation (or your life)?
•• Competition    Is anybody else likely to make a 
better offer and put you out of the bargaining?
•• The history    In similar situations, or with this 
person or team, what usually tends to happen? 
What is likely to be agreed? What are the points 
that they are unlikely to concede? 
154
People and task management skills

Speak to their vision
Let them know you have been listening to what they 
said. Keep referring to their objectives and interests, 
identifying how your proposal goes some way towards 
achieving these. Spell out the advantages. It is 
important that the other parties see that their goals can 
be met through the solution you propose. If not, they 
are unlikely to agree.
Show willingness to compromise 
Let the other party know that you are willing to make 
concessions. Do not identify your own ‘bottom line’ 
straight away, as you will have no room to negotiate. 
Be clear about your ‘ideal’ scenario, so they can see 
clearly where you are prepared to negotiate: people 
do not like to feel that they are the only ones making 
concessions. Watch their response to your offer to 
see whether it is one they look comfortable with, or 
whether more persuasion is needed.
Keep the lines of communication open
Stay calm, even if you are not getting what you want. 
Do not ‘burn your bridges’ by walking out or giving 
ultimatums. Leave possibilities for further dialogue. 
If necessary, brainstorm more options together, take 
breaks and reconsider your options, start again from 
the beginning, or look for different combinations of 
options. 
•• unwillingness to listen (sitting forward with 
hands moving over the ears; moving to 
interrupt; drumming fingers on the table).
Persuasiveness and good communication 
skills
Create an open relaxed atmosphere
If people look, sound or feel defensive, as 
described above, it helps to put them more at 
their ease so that they open up to your ideas. 
You can improve the situation if you: 
•• avoid ‘hard sell’ approaches
•• focus on their agenda for a while, as this is 
familiar terrain for them
•• ask for a break so you can interact more 
informally for a few minutes
•• mirror their body language for a few minutes 
and gradually introduce more relaxed 
postures (arms in relaxed positions, legs 
uncrossed, sitting back in the chair, using 
calm movements of the head or hands)
•• smile
•• think through the situation from their point 
of view: you are more likely to act in a way 
they can accept if you are genuinely thinking 
about their position.

Leadership from the position of the led
Reflection: Leadership
•• What metaphor of your own best describes your view of 
a good leader? What does this metaphor tell you about 
your feelings towards leaders and leadership? 
•• Does your view of leaders and leadership encourage 
you to be a leader or to avoid this? What metaphor 
would inspire and encourage you more to be a leader? 
Does that metaphor apply to any roles that you already 
fill?
•• How do you feel a team would respond to a leader who 
fitted the metaphor you have selected? 
•• Which metaphors for leadership would best encourage 
active, motivated, self-reliant team members?
Leadership
The role of leader
Leaders provide the vision. They motivate others. Leaders need 
to have a clear internal model of their role. This is likely to be 
strongly influenced by other roles that they fill in life, by their 
values, and by the sources of inspiration that they call upon. 
You will have an internal model in your head, now, of what 
you think a leader is or should be. For example, some people 
might describe a leader by using one or more of the following 
metaphors. A leader is: 
•• a conductor leading an orchestra
•• an architect, designing and constructing a project
•• a sales-manager, selling a vision
•• a social worker, intervening to improve the lot of others
•• a general, commanding an army
•• an actor, playing to an audience
•• a diplomat, 
pouring oil on 
troubled waters
•• an artist, with a 
particular vision.
Activity
Your advice to the 
leaders?
•• If you want some ideas on how 
to motivate and lead others, give 
consideration to what it is like to 
be ‘led’. What kind of behaviour, 
communication or strategy would 
motivate you to ‘go the extra 
mile’ that is often needed for 
successful project completion?
•• Jot down a list of behaviours 
that you would associate with an 
effective team leader. 
•• Use your insights to formulate 
a list of ‘Advice’ points for team 
leaders.
When you have completed your list, 
compare it with the ‘characteristics 
of an effective leader’ given below.
Are you a leader?
Everyone has leadership potential, 
but not everyone recognises this in 
themselves. It takes courage to lead, 
and wisdom to see when somebody 
else might be a better leader in a 
situation. You can lead if:
•• you see that somebody needs to 
take the lead
•• you can see what needs to be 
done
•• you can convince others of this, 
in your own way.
Reflection: Do I take  
the lead?
•• How far do you envisage yourself 
as a leader?
•• When somebody needs to take a 
lead, is that person you?
•• If so, why? If not, why not?
159
People skills

Develop the strategy
One of the main tasks of the team or project leader 
is to develop the strategy. This will orchestrate the 
efforts and resources of the team towards the goal. 
A strategy may be simple or complex. 
Reflection: Using strategy
•• What experience of developing a strategy 
have you had so far?
•• What skills have you developed in evolving 
a strategy for yourself or for a team? (See 
Chapter 6)
•• What opportunities could you create for 
yourself to become more involved in strategy 
or policy formation (e.g. student clubs; 
political groups; charities; local government; 
being a student representative; starting a 
business; setting up a new group or project)?
Encourage contributions from others 
Team members are more likely to contribute if they 
feel valued. An effective team leader:
•• notices people’s contributions
•• thanks people for their contributions
•• makes it clear to the whole team where 
everyone fits in – and draws attention to 
achievements that are less visible
•• clarifies how the achievements of individuals 
contribute to the benefit of the overall project
•• treats all of the team with fairness, courtesy and 
consideration.
Demonstrate the value of all team members
Team members are more likely to contribute if they 
feel their opinions are valued. An effective team 
leader:
•• creates opportunities to ask the team for their 
opinions and encourages them to help evolve a 
solution
•• creates opportunities for the team to contribute 
to the planning and setting of targets
•• demonstrates how suggestions and comments 
from the team have been considered and 
adopted
•• allows individuals opportunities to develop their 
own plans for achieving targets.
Characteristics of an effective leader
Inspire others 
A good leader will ensure that the vision is kept in 
view, and does not become lost amongst a forest of 
targets, deadlines, and problems.
Heerkens, 2002
A leader develops the vision and exudes a 
realistic confidence in that vision. They must 
also communicate it well to others, ensuring 
that everybody else can see what the benefits of 
achieving that vision would be. 
A good leader can see ways that the overall goal 
can contribute to individual and personal goals. 
Typically, the vision of successful leaders is for the 
project or the team, rather than for their personal 
goals (Taylor and Humphrey, 2002).
Reflection: Leading towards a 
vision
•• What kinds of vision would you feel most 
comfortable in encouraging other people to 
work towards? 
•• In what ways would your values assist you in 
developing an interest in leadership skills?  
(See Chapter 1)
•• In what ways would your values help or 
hinder you as a leader?
Create a sense of commitment
Team members are more likely to contribute if they 
feel committed to the project. An effective team 
leader:
•• offers a clear and motivating ‘vision’
•• ensures that the whole team is clear about the 
purpose and aims of the project
•• identifies the significance or relevance of a 
successful outcome to the project
•• clarifies how the work of each member is 
significant to the overall project
•• leads by example.
160
People and task management skills

Reflection: Taking responsibility
Consider a situation where you had 
responsibility for the outcomes. If possible, 
select an occasion when it was difficult to take 
responsibility but where you did so. 
•• What happened?
•• What was your role?
•• What did it feel like to take responsibility 
then? 
•• What have you learnt from the experience 
that will be useful to you in other 
circumstances?
Activity
Updated self-evaluation
Complete a new self-evaluation of your people 
skills (see p. 132).
Compare this with the initial self-evaluation you 
undertook. What differences do you notice?
•• What are your current priorities for 
developing your people skills?
•• What opportunities could you create to 
develop your people skills further?
Clarify expectations
Team members are more likely to contribute if they 
know what is expected of them. An effective team 
leader:
•• negotiates clear targets for each person
•• clarifies how each person’s work connects to the 
work of others
•• negotiates clear ground rules for group 
behaviours
•• makes it clear what a successful outcome would 
be for each person
•• ensures that feelings of uncertainty are kept to a 
minimum.
Ensure the team works
Leaders ensure that the team works well, knowing 
what different people can contribute. Good leaders 
ensure their team is functioning smoothly, and 
intervene when it is not. They act as full members 
of their teams, and are readily available if things 
become difficult. (See ‘Team work’, above.)
Reflection: Leading a team
•• For what aspect of team work would you find 
it easiest to take a lead? 
•• When or where do you do that now?
•• If you lack experience in leading groups or 
sessions, what opportunities could you create 
to gain that experience?
Take responsibility
Leaders are the most prominent members of the 
team. They take the lion’s share of the glory when 
things go well. They must also be prepared to 
take responsibility if things do not go well. This 
can be quite a daunting thought. However, taking 
responsibility for our actions is important in most 
contexts. 
Demonstrate excellent ‘people’ skills
Leaders need to communicate well. Without good 
inter-personal skills, it would be almost impossible 
to bring a set of people to share a vision, pull 
together, commit to a project, meet deadlines and 
resolve their differences. Leaders may also have an 
ambassadorial function, speaking and negotiating 
on behalf of the team.
161
People skills

Closing comments
Increasing numbers of graduate and non-
graduate jobs will include leadership and 
management roles, with responsibility for 
managing other people and their relationships 
with each other. There are much higher 
expectations of most employees now for 
managing other people, whether colleagues, 
customers or clients. 
Many roles require a wide range of people skills, 
from communicating clearly, negotiating and 
persuading, to being a good team member or 
leading a team.
On the other hand, academic work is often 
organised to emphasise individual effort and 
achievement. There are a number of reasons 
for this, including the need to secure academic 
standards and to ensure every student is 
performing well on an individual basis. However, 
many programmes now include group work, 
team work and work placements to ensure 
students have real opportunities to develop their 
people skills. 
Whether inter-personal skills are provided 
through the curriculum or not, it is a good idea 
to search out opportunities to develop them. 
Careers Services, the Students’ Union, Schools 
Liaison Offices at the university, and voluntary 
agencies can provide such opportunities. 
Inter-personal skills require, above all, good 
self-management. This chapter should be read 
alongside Chapter 4. Emotional intelligence is 
a key factor in being able to manage oneself in 
interactions with others and to understand the 
needs and requirements of other people. Some 
universities run additional programmes such 
as basic counselling skills and assertiveness to 
develop people skills. 
Effective people skills are invaluable in all aspects 
of life, study and work. They provide the oil 
that enables your interactions with others to 
run smoothly. When you develop good people 
skills, you can see ahead to where difficulties 
may emerge, take steps to minimise these, 
and increase the harmony in everyday social 
interactions. This reduces stress, saves time and 
improves conditions for everybody. Everybody 
is happier – which is why people skills are 
becoming so valued.

Chapter 6
Successful problem-solving and 
task management
Introduction
Problem-solving is highly valued by 
employers. They want graduates to ‘hit 
the ground running’, able to apply skills 
to new situations and deal with new tasks 
with minimum supervision. Almost every 
activity, task or problem will draw on the 
following set of processes and skills:
1	 Strategy: tactics and an overall plan.
2	 Techniques: methods to use.
3	 People skills: working with others in 
appropriate ways to achieve the goal.
4	 Self-management: managing your 
time, personal issues, feelings and 
performance.
5	 Creativity: finding ideas that contribute 
towards a solution.
People who are very good at problem-
solving usually bring people skills, self-
management and creativity to the task. 
These three factors are so important that 
they each have chapters dedicated to 
them. This chapter introduces some basic 
problem-solving and task-management 
techniques. 
Tasks and problems
‘Task’ covers a wide range of circumstances. In this 
chapter, ‘task’ is used flexibly to refer to any activity or 
part of a larger project. The term ‘problem’ is also used 
flexibly. It can be: 
•• any question that calls for an answer
•• a puzzle waiting to be solved
•• a situation requiring a response
•• a challenge to be met. 
It is important to separate the idea of ‘problem-solving’ 
from that of ‘difficulty’ or ‘trouble’. Problem-solving is not 
necessarily difficult, although it can be applied to difficult 
situations. Any situation that presents a challenge or an 
opportunity for a new approach can be treated as a formal 
‘problem’ that requires a solution. 
Activity
Selecting a focus
In order to provide a focus for this chapter, identify 
one problem, task, assignment or personal goal that is 
relevant to you. Refer to this as you work through each 
of the sections below.
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• understand what is meant by problem-solving
•• develop techniques and approaches associated with successful problem-solving
•• develop the confidence to take on tasks, problems and projects
•• become a ‘good self-starter’
•• understand the processes involved in basic project management
•• audit your own ‘competitiveness’.

Score 
Interpreting your score
If your self-ratings were accurate, you have a 
score for your overall problem-solving skills. 
This is a rough indicator of how confident you 
are about these skills, which may, of course, be 
different from your actual ability. A score over 
40 is reasonable, a score over 55 is quite good, a 
score over 70 is very good, and a score over 85 is 
excellent. 
However, you should interpret how good your 
score is depending on:
•• how long you have been on the programme

Basic approaches to 
problem solving
Activity
Your current 
approaches
How would you go about solving 
the following problems? Spend 
a few minutes working them 
out, either on your own or with 
a second person. Jot down the 
processes you went through in 
order to arrive at a solution that 
satisfies you. 
1	 You want to go on holiday 
to a sunny place, within your 
budget. You do not know 
where to go yet, but do know 
that the options are all places 
where you do not speak the 
local language. What are the 
things you have to consider in 
order to ensure you will have a 
good time when you arrive? 
2	 You want to cook a meal for 
three friends to celebrate a 
birthday. One of them may be 
bringing a child. Another guest 
is allergic to nuts. You have 
three days to prepare this and 
want it to be something they 
would all really like. You also 
want to ensure that you have 
enough money to cover this. 
What will you cook? What else 
will you do to ensure that the 
meal is successful?
3	 Your tutor has just pointed 
out that your essay must be in 
on Friday. You hadn’t realised 
there were two essays to be 
completed this week. Both 
must be in on time. How will 
you go about meeting the 
deadlines?
Make a list of the approaches you 
considered. Then compare this 
with the ‘basic approaches’ list 
below.
Basic approaches
Your list probably included some or all of the following:
Talking to others
You would probably want to 
ask other people for ideas, 
their experience, what they 
know about the persons and 
places involved. People are 
a key resource in problem-
solving. This is why successful 
companies value ‘people skills’. 
Finding out what you need to 
know from others, or ‘informal 
learning’, is the dominant form 
of professional development for most American companies 
(Rossett and Sheldon, 2001). 
Lists 
Many people organise their lives by lists. They are 
quick and easy tools to use and excellent starting 
points for any problem.
Finding out information
You may have included approaches 
such as browsing the Internet, checking 
catalogues and looking in books. 
Researching information, weighing it 
up and selecting what you need are all 
useful to problem-solving.
Calculating
Many problems include a number component, 
such as working out the budget and finances. 
Some problems are solved more easily by using 
a mathematical formula. You may have used 
calculations to work out how much time there 
would be for different aspects of each of the 
two essays, or how to meet the budget for the 
meal or holiday. 
Following the rules
Sometimes it is easier to follow procedures laid down for the 
activity. Mixing chemicals for a particular purpose requires very 
precise measurements of specific chemicals, for example. If you 
are not used to cooking, following a recipe step by step will be 
helpful. When you become more familiar with the process, you 
will know how and when to adapt rules in order to achieve the 
results you want.

Successful problem-solving and task management

Seven key tips for task management 
1	 Clarify the task: know exactly what you need to do 
and why.
2	 Start where the energy is … all other things being 
equal.
3	 Start much earlier than you think is necessary. This 
gives you more room for manoeuvre.
4	 Think several steps ahead: plan out all the steps 
required to take you to the end point.
5	 Always look for several solutions … it is easier than 
looking for THE one answer.
6	 Give yourself tight time limits with early deadlines 
… otherwise tasks tend to expand to fill all the 
time available.
7	 Find out the background to the project. Not only 
are you more likely to meet the project aims, 
things are also more interesting from the position 
of an ‘expert’.
Many problems are relatively simple like these. We can 
use different problem-solving strategies at once, moving 
back and forward between them as necessary. For 
example, to organise yourself to meet essay deadlines, 
you might:
•• ask an academic adviser or tutor for advice
•• negotiate with other people to arrange for cover for 
your work shift or cooking rota
•• draw on a similar essay you completed for a previous 
programme
•• calculate the time available for what you need to do
•• chart in your diary the time available to you
•• visualise where you left your notes
•• draw a network or outline pattern of all the ideas you 
have on the essay
•• research further information
•• go for a walk to clear your mind. 
Trial and error
You may prefer to jump in at the deep 
end, trying out various ideas until you hit 
the right one. This works well for some 
people, but is a very labour-intensive way 
of working unless there really are 
no options. You may find you 
are good at ‘trial and error’ 
for some areas (such as 
cooking) and less so in 
others (gardening). 
This is sometimes 
regarded as 
intuition, but 
may be the 
result of 
expertise 
built up 
over time. 
Visualising
You may 
have pictured the problem in your ‘mind’s 
eye’, checking off the places where you 
might go on such a holiday or what 
the meal might be like. You may have 
visualised yourself performing each of the 
activities. Successful sportspeople tend to 
use visualising techniques to see the exact 
details of how they will achieve victory. It 
can be applied to most areas of life. 
Charting
You may have used a chart, flow diagram 
or other graphic device to draw out the 
problem, so that you could work it out 
visually.
Calling upon a similar experience
You may have thought about recent meals 
that you have cooked and whether you 
could adapt these to suit a child or the 
person with the allergy. If you have already 
completed an essay, you may have run 
through the processes involved, working 
out the time needed for each, based on 
your experience. You might even have 
been able to work out some ways of saving 
time in order to meet the deadlines. 
Problem-solving on the back of an 
envelope
Simplify
If you feel daunted by all the things there are to consider 
in working with a problem, begin by simplifying the 
problem down to essential features. See if you can 
summarise your strategy in ten steps on the back of an 
envelope. 
166
People and task management skills

Find the natural sequence
You may need to address stages of a task in a particular 
order, which may mean dealing with subsidiary issues 
before addressing the core problem.
When using a problem-solving model or framework, it is 
likely that you will move back and forth between stages, 
or between the kinds of questions identified on the 
envelope above, until you reach the decision-making and 
action stages. It is worth noticing how many of the ten 
stages above refer to thinking about the problem before 
any action is taken. 
Problem elaboration
Research shows that people who spend more time 
at the beginning working out what a task really 
involves, perform much better. For example, successful 
mathematics students spend much longer reflecting on 
what category of mathematical problems they have been 
set. They look for similarities with problems they have 
worked on before. They consider various approaches and 
weigh these up before beginning calculations to solve the 
problem. Less successful students tend to launch into an 
assignment too quickly without defining clearly what the 
problem entails and what needs to be done.
The early planning stage is sometimes referred to as 
‘problem elaboration’. Elaboration involves analysing a 
task from all perspectives and defining what the task really 
involves. The similarity approach outlines one way of 
doing this.
The ‘similarity approach’ to 
problem-solving
Butterworth (1992) argues that we are 
more likely to succeed at new tasks if we 
can find similarities with ones we have 
accomplished already. If we cannot see 
those parallels, then we may believe 
ourselves incapable of tasks well within our 
actual competence. This suggests that it is 
worth giving time and thought to what we 
have achieved in any one context and its 
applicability to other contexts.
1  Clarify the core questions
State the core questions as simply as 
possible. Remove unnecessary wording 
so as to pare the problem down to the 
essential features. This makes it easier to 
see whether it is similar to one with which 
you are already familiar. 
2  Identify an analogous problem
•• What are the core features or 
components of the problem? What 
skills, methods or techniques are 
needed?
•• What similarities are there between 
problems or activities have you 
undertaken before and the current task?
•• How can previous problems help you 
to think through what is needed for this 
problem?
•• How can you make use of previous skills 
and experience to solve this problem?
3  Identify the limitations of the analogy
List the differences between the current 
problem and previous tasks. The situations 
will not be identical so the same strategy 
may not work for the current problem. 
Identifying the difference is as important as 
identifying the similarity. 
4  Establish significance
•• Weigh up the significance of the 
similarities and differences.
•• How will you adapt your strategy to take 
account of these differences? 
•• What else do you need to know or to 
do?
167
Successful problem-solving and task management

•• Define the task and identify the purpose of 
the task: what are you hoping to achieve? You 
may find it helpful to describe the problem in 
different words so that it is clear to you what 
needs to be done.
•• What is the desired endpoint – what will indicate 
that you have accomplished what you set out to 
do?
•• Where are you now – and what is the distance 
to that desired endpoint?
•• Broadly speaking, how are you going to get 
from where you are to where you need to be? 
•• Is there another way of thinking about this? 
What might be an alternative way of achieving 
the desired endpoint? How many possible 
solutions can you generate in order to give 
yourself options on the way forward?
•• What do you need to get the job done? Are 
these resources going to be available? 
•• What expertise can you bring to bear? You 
may find it helpful to use the activity on p. 61 
to identify your expertise and consider its 
application to this problem.
Time spent productively in elaborating the 
problem in this way pays dividends later in the 
process. 
Planning 
Before launching into action, devise a strategy to 
achieve your goal and then plan out the various 
stages of what you need to do. 
Strategy
What is the broad approach you will take to 
achieve your goal? Some of the following might be 
applicable in working out your strategy:
•• Are you going to apply an approach you have 
used before, or try something new?
•• Will you have a trial run, pilot or draft version 
first?
•• Will you do this all at once or over a longer 
term?
•• On your own or with others?
•• Within current resources or do you need further 
resources? If so, will this involve fund-raising of 
some kind or securing a grant? 
•• Will you apply a particular model or theoretical 
framework?
•• Are there key features to your strategy, such as a 
particular focus or emphasis? 
The OPAL strategy applied to task 
management
The OPAL strategy (Cottrell, 2010), shown in 
the diagram below, offers a set format to help 
analyse a problem and manage the tasks that 
lead to its solution. This is a cycle that can be 
applied both to project management and to 
tasks that form part of a project. Reflection is at 
the core of the cycle, undertaken as you work 
through a task (reflection in action); it is also  a 
process taken outside of the cycle, standing back 
from it to gain a vantage point (reflection on 
action). OPAL stands for:
•• Orientation 
•• Planning 
•• Action 
•• Learning

Orientation
The cycle begins with orientation, which 
includes problem elaboration and good advance 
planning. The orientation stage is rather like 
starting a journey. Before setting out, you would 
define your task and elaborate what needs to 
be done by considering such questions as the 
purpose of the journey, the starting point, the 
route, your mode of transport, and how you will 
know when you have arrived. Similarly, to solve a 
problem or manage a task, you need to consider 
the following: 
168
People and task management skills

Actions, targets, deadlines 
Plan out what you will do, in what order, and by 
when:
•• What are the main steps or stages? 
•• Set targets and time-scales for each stage?
•• Set SMART-F targets (see p. 175)?
•• How will you meet these targets?
•• Draw these up into an action plan (see p. 177).
Draw up an action plan, identifying your mini-
goals or targets as well as deadlines for these. 
Your action plan might be elaborate, or it may 
just be a list. It depends on how complex the 
problem is – and what suits you. (An outline is 
provided on p. 177.)
Priorities
•• Identify priorities: what are all the things you 
need to do? 
•• What is essential? What can be left out? 
Monitoring points
•• Set specific times for monitoring your progress 
as you go along. Write these into your action 
plan.
At the end of the planning stage, you should feel 
that you have planned effectively, having thought 
through all possible angles. You should be clear 
about what action now needs to be taken.
Action 
This is the ‘doing’ stage. Work through your 
action plan, observing your targets. This is the 
first real test of your planning and strategy. 
Monitor and review your progress 
Use your action plan to check that you are on 
target towards your goals. 
•• Do you need to amend your plan in any way so 
that it is more realistic?
•• Are you meeting targets and deadlines? If not, 
do you need to revise these?
•• Are you maintaining your motivation? If not, 
what can you do to improve this?
•• Are you working within your budget and 
resources? If not, what action must you take? 
•• Do you need to revise your overall strategy?
Keep records 
•• Consider how you can demonstrate that you 
have worked to a strategy, reflected on your 
progress and revised your plan to increase your 
effectiveness. Gathering evidence as you go 
along will help you to do this.
•• Keep a record of what you do and the 
outcome.
Learning
At the end of the task or project, before rushing 
on to your next project, or drawing a line under 
this one, pause to see what you can can learn 
from the experience. This stage consists of:
•• Reflection (see Chapter 8)
•• Evaluation
•• Drawing out lessons for the future.
Reflection
Once you have completed the task overall, or 
specific actions that went either especially well or 
badly, stand back from it and take stock. You will 
find material and models for reflection in Chapter 
8 that can be applied usefully here. 
Evaluation
Evaluation is easier if clear targets have been set 
and, usually, is measured in terms of how well 
you have achieved those targets. However, it is 
useful to evaluate the overall strategy as well. 
Achievement
Did you:
•• Achieve your targets?
•• Meet the deadlines for the overall project?
•• Achieve the overall goal?
•• Keep to budget?
•• Maintain good working relationships?
Strategy effectiveness
•• What worked well? 
•• What could be improved? 
•• What evidence is there of your performance, 
reflection and achievement?
A pro-forma of an Evaluation Sheet is provided as 
a resource below (p. 172–3).
169
Successful problem-solving and task management

Propose an initial solution
You may arrive at your initial solution by using 
the similarity approach (p. 167) or the Expertise 
Metaphor approach (pp. 61–3). Your proposed 
initial solution does not need to be perfect as it 
is only one of many that you will consider. Jot 
down:
•• the ways in which this already meets the needs 
of the situation
•• weak points in the proposal or aspects that 
need to be considered further. 
Brainstorm further ideas 
•• Jot down, quickly, as many ideas as possible. 
For this stage, put words such as ‘realistic’ and 
‘sensible’ aside for a moment: release your 
imagination. 
•• Brainstorm solutions to the ‘weak points’ of the 
first solution you proposed.
Identify ‘seed’ ideas 
For every idea, look for the seed of one positive 
aspect. The idea itself may be maverick (‘relocate 
to the moon’; ‘win the lottery’; ‘kidnap the 
professor’) but it may hint at a workable solution. 
For example:
•• ‘Relocating to the moon’. The idea of 
relocation might be useful. Would a change of 
room or building help? Have all options been 
considered?
•• ‘Winning the lottery’. There may be other 
sources of money. Would it be useful to look 
for financial backing from a local business or 
charity?
•• ‘Kidnapping the professor’. Would a tutor, 
student or local employer offer advice or 
mentorship?
Evaluate solutions 
Weigh up factors for and against each solution, 
considering such criteria as:
•• Cost: can it be afforded?
•• Time: can it be completed in the time 
available?
•• Expertise: is the necessary expertise available?
•• Suitability: does it suit the circumstances and 
people involved? 
Drawing out lessons for the future
Consider what you have learnt either from the 
project overall, or from specific aspects of it, such 
as:
•• Whether the way you went about your 
advance planning was effective. Did it get you 
what you wanted in the way you wanted it? 
•• Are there aspects of the overall process in 
which you need training or more practice?
•• Were there unforeseen consequences of the 
way you went about things?
•• Were you over-ambitious? Or could you have 
been more ambitious?
•• From what you have learnt, what would you 
do differently now? What went well that could 
be applied to future projects?
Activity
Solve that problem!
Use the problem you identified in the activity on 
p. 163 as your ‘target problem’ for this activity. 
Apply the OPAL strategy by following the stages 
outlined above. Keep a record to help you 
evaluate the activity at the end and to learn 
from it. This can be completed electronically 
using the pro-forma provided in the electronic 
Resource Bank, and will also be of use for the 
activity on p. 171 below.
Reflection: Using your experience
•• How useful was your previous experience 
and expertise in finding and implementing a 
solution for this problem?
•• What did you do well?
•• What could you have done better?
The ‘multiple solution approach’ to 
problem-solving
You are more likely to arrive at the best option 
if you consider many solutions. The ‘multiple 
solution approach’ puts emphasis on generating 
several different solutions to the same problem. 
As you become more familiar with the OPAL 
model above, you can incorporate evaluation of 
multiple solutions into the Orientation Stage. 
170
People and task management skills

•• Value: which solution provides a good result with the 
least effort and cost?
•• Risk: will it work? What are the risks?
•• Goal: which best meets the project  
objectives?
Synthesise the best
•• Select two or three solutions to consider in more 
detail.
•• Identify the best aspects of each solution.
•• Identify ways of synthesising the best features of each 
solution. 
•• Check whether the best features of each still work 
well when brought together into one strategy.
Identify the essential criteria
•• Which criteria must be met (time, cost, 
design, etc.)?
•• List these in order of priority. Which are the 
most important criteria to meet?
•• Which solution do you want to go with? 
Does this meet the criteria you identified as 
priorities? If not, what can you change or 
do to ensure that those priorities are met?
Decision making
•• Select one solution that best meets 
essential criteria.
•• Fine-tune this option to meet the essential 
criteria.
Resource sheet
The resource sheet on the following page can 
be used to weigh up each solution.
Activity
Multiple solutions: solve that problem again!
Using the problem you identified for ‘Solve that problem!’ (p. 170), reconsider the problem from a 
different perspective, to see whether there could have been a better solution. 
Orientation 
1	 Define the task again, using different words. 
Plan 
2	 Brainstorm as many other possible solutions to this problem as you can, without censoring too 
much at this stage whether they will work.
3	 Identify the good ideas hidden within each solution.
4	 Select two or three solutions to consider in more detail.
5	 Evaluate each solution according to criteria relevant to you (cost, time, etc.).
6	 Synthesise the best ideas from all the solutions.
7	 Decide on a solution that best fits the priorities and adapt it to meet the criteria.
8	 If there is the opportunity to test out the solution, draw up an action plan (see p. 177).
Action 
9	 If there is the opportunity, apply the solution to the problem, carrying out your action plan. 
Learning 
10	 What have you learnt from this activity about how you might solve the problem you identified, 
and how you could improve your approach to problem-solving in general?

Identify relevant criteria for a solution
For each problem, consider the relative importance 
of issues such as those listed on the ‘Evaluating 
Multiple Solutions’ sheet on pages 172–3. Jot 
down details for each of those criteria that are 
most relevant for the task or problem on which 
you are working. Use these details to help you 
decide between solutions or to identify the best 
aspects to take on board from each of your 
potential solutions. 
Identify priorities amongst the criteria
When you have a complete list, write these down 
in the order that is most important.
•• Which criteria are essential and must be met?
•• Which criteria are relatively flexible?
•• Which criteria are very flexible?
Select only a few essential criteria and be prepared 
to be flexible on the others. The more essential 
criteria you set, the more difficult it will be to find 
a solution.
Identifying priorities
One common reason for not getting under 
way with a problem or project is that there are 
too many things competing for your attention. 
Emotions such as fear of not getting everything 
done, or guilt at letting someone down, make it 
hard to separate out what can be left and what 
must be addressed straight away. 
To help set priorities, Neenan and Dryden (2002) 
suggest dividing tasks into one of four categories:
1	 Urgent and important
2	 Not urgent but important
3	 Urgent but not important
4	 Not urgent and not important
You may find it helpful to colour-code these using 
the resource sheet on p. 176 so that you can see 
urgent items most easily. For example:
1  Red – Category 1: urgent and important 
Deadlines, crises, tasks timed for today, tasks which 
must come first in a sequence.
Problem-solving techniques
This section introduces some common problem-
solving techniques. These include:
•• setting goals
•• setting criteria to evaluate a solution
•• identifying priorities
•• setting targets and drawing up an action plan
•• planning project time
•• getting down to it
•• becoming a good ‘self-starter’
•• sticking with a task
•• completing a task.
Setting goals
Setting goals is an important part of the 
orientation stage of your strategy. When 
considering your goal:
•• Visualise what it would be like to achieve it (see 
p. 34, Chapter 1).
•• Identify how you will know when you have 
achieved it: what will be different?
•• Evaluate whether it is realistic.
•• Identify what you will have to sacrifice in order 
to achieve it. Is it worth it?
•• Think about your beliefs and values. Is it ‘you’?
Setting criteria to evaluate a solution 
Although evaluation takes place at the end of 
a task or project, you need to consider, at the 
beginning, the criteria by which you will evaluate 
success. Develop criteria that give you what you 
want but which are achievable. 
Dream solution
Begin with the ideal. As Chapter 1 emphasises, it is 
important to work towards a ‘vision’. However, use 
the vision to inform what you want, using it as a 
guide rather than a strait-jacket. 
Realistic option
What would you accept as a reasonably good 
outcome that is both motivating and achievable? 
What are the main features of this option?
174
People and task management skills

2  Yellow – Category 2: not urgent but 
important 
Category 2 activities enable you to plan ahead. 
These should be addressed before they become 
urgent. Prioritise between these according to 
when they must take place in a sequence, or the 
consequences of leaving them for too long.
3  Orange – Category 3: Urgent but not 
important
If possible, leave these until category 1 tasks are 
completed. Category 3 items may not need to be 
undertaken at all, but can attract our attention 
unduly because they are ‘urgent’. Emails are a 
good example of this. What other examples are 
typical of your own week?
4  Blue – Category 4: not urgent and not 
important
These are often good time-wasting activities. They 
can make us feel like we are busy, so that we do 
not get down to what is really needed. Reading 
junk mail, sorting out old papers, cleaning out 
cupboards may fall into this category. 
Activity
Identify priorities
For the problem you are addressing at present:
•• Brainstorm a list of all the things you need to 
do.
•• Divide the items on your list into the four 
categories on the priority sheet on p. 176. 
Write the things that are most important and 
urgent in the top left-hand box. Use the top 
left of that box for the most urgent items. 
•• Use the bottom right of the page for the least 
important items.
When you have completed the priority sheet, 
use it to guide you in organising tasks into a 
logical order:
•• Reorganise your original list of priorities into 
the order in which you will now complete 
tasks. 
•• Set targets for each priority (see ‘SMART-F 
targets’ below).
SMART-F target setting
Most tasks benefit from clear, achievable targets. 
SMART targets make it easier to see what must 
be done and then to evaluate success. SMART-F 
targets build in reasonable flexibility, so you can 
plan for unexpected contingencies. SMART-F 
stands for:
•• Specific: ‘I will complete the first section of my 
essay by this evening.’
•• Measurable: ‘I will produce the first three draft 
pages of my essay by this evening.’
•• Achievable: ‘This should be achievable because 
I have completed the research, organised my 
notes, and already produced the outline plan.’
•• Realistic: ‘I should be able to write three pages as 
I have written up to ten pages in a day before, 
and have done the preparatory work.’
•• Time-bound: ‘ I will finish by 8:30 p.m.’
•• Flexible: ‘I could continue until 10:30 p.m. if 
necessary. If I find I have additional research to 
do for those pages, I can slot that in tomorrow 
between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m.’
Targets should provide clear guidelines for action 
and be built into an action plan (see p. 177). 
However, they are not written in stone: they 
should be monitored and reviewed as the project 
proceeds so that it can be completed on time.
Activity
Evaluating Targets  (p. 178)
An example of a set of targets is provided for 
you to evaluate against SMART-F criteria and to 
check your responses. This will give you some 
insights into your own understanding of setting 
SMART-F targets.
Evaluating targets
Evaluate your own targets
Before launching out on a project, stand back 
for a moment and evaluate whether your targets 
are really helpful. An evaluation is provided on 
page 179 as a ready-made structure for your 
evaluations. You can copy this sheet for future use, 
or use it in the Electronic Resource Bank.

In your journal, jot down any weaknesses you can identify in these targets. When you have 
completed your evaluation, check your responses with those on p. 188.
Planning project time
Project schedules 
Good time management may require you to use several time-management tools simultaneously:
•• Action plans: set targets and deadlines for each step. Action plans are organised according to theme.
•• Schedules: organise all tasks and steps in the order they must be completed. For large projects, there is 
software available to organise the work schedule.
•• Diaries: organise tasks more closely within a week or day.

Work schedule and project diary 
The time slots on the project schedule are very 
broad. Several days are allocated for some aspects 
of the project. So that every project team member 
knows what they are doing, the project diary 
organises time in detail on a daily basis. For your 
projects, you may find it helpful to map out in 
diary form more specific aspects of each task, 
indicating when each task will finish. An example 
of a project diary entry is given below.
Projects often go wrong because there is no 
flexibility to the time schedule, or no ‘slack’ time, 
built in. Final deadlines are usually strict, leaving 
little scope for changes at the last minute. It is 
useful, therefore, to schedule the early stages of 
a project very closely, in order to increase the 
incentive to work efficiently. Set interim deadlines 
so that there are early achievements and so you 
can check if the project is running to schedule. 
This will make it easier to meet the final deadlines.

People and task management skills

Getting down to it!
Do you delay beginning an activity because:
•• you get easily distracted into irrelevant activities?
•• the time isn’t right?
•• you need more experience?
•• you work better at the last moment?
•• tomorrow is better?
•• you worry that the outcome won’t be right?
•• you think something will go wrong?
•• everything else is more important? 
If so, procrastination prevents you from following 
through on an action plan. 
a
Check your motivation, vision and targets
•• Check your motivation. Give yourself 
more rewards for each stage you 
complete.
•• Check your ‘vision’ (see Chapter 1). It 
may not be motivating you sufficiently. 
Link tasks more closely to your long-term 
vision.
•• Break goals and targets into small chunks 
that could be completed in a short burst.
Identify the hindrance zone
•• Identify what feelings (boredom, 
fear, irritation, anger, frustration) you 
associate with the activity. Can you 
commit yourself to putting up with the 
discomfort of these feelings until the task 
is done? What would help you tolerate 
these until the task is completed?
•• Give yourself more encouraging 
messages about the task. 
•• Find a different way of describing 
the activity so that it becomes more 
interesting for you. 
•• Combine the task with something you 
enjoy, such as listening to music. 
•• Stay away from anyone who encourages 
your procrastination. 
•• Identify the ‘level of inhibition’ (p. 122).
Commandeer support
•• Arrange to do tasks in pairs or a group. 
It is harder to avoid a task if others are 
involved.
•• Ask a friend to check on you. Give them 
permission to tell you to get started.
•• Join an action set (see p. 142).
Create unavoidable reminders
•• Write yourself 20 ‘Post-its’™ giving 
yourself instructions to get started on 
a particular task today. Put these on 
surfaces where you cannot avoid them.
•• Write 20 ‘Post-its’™ detailing what you 
will gain by completing the project.
•• Write more precise details of what you 
have to do into your diary.
As the project deadline looms, Michael finds it ever 
more essential to ensure that his pencils are lined up 
parallel to the Greenwich Meridian.
Procrastination can be a chronic condition (Sapadin, 
1997). If you always struggle to start a task, you may 
need professional help. However, if the problem is less 
serious, some of the following steps can help. 
Identify the core issue
•• Acknowledge that you are procrastinating.
•• What sort of things are you better at getting down to? 
•• What kinds of activity do you keep putting off?
•• Identify what characterises the things you put off: are 
there any themes?
•• Do you procrastinate more over some tasks than 
others? Are some times worse than others?

Successful problem-solving and task management

Reflection: Becoming a 
good ‘self-starter’
•• Which of the above characteristics are 
already amongst your strengths?
•• Which need to be developed?
•• Do you consider yourself to be a 
good ‘self-starter’? If so, what is your 
evidence for this?
•• Use the competence sheet on p. 
348–9. 
•• If you do not think you are a good 
self-starter, which of the above skills 
could you develop first? Locate the 
section in the book where these 
aspects are covered.
Sticking with a task
The characteristics of successful people, 
noted in Chapter 1, included a willingness 
to ‘do what it takes’, even if this means 
working very long hours, and developing 
patience. Thomas Edison, who is quoted 
in the activity below, is remembered today 
for inventions that contributed to the 
development of film and the light bulb. 
Edison is also famous for his adage that 
genius owes only 5 per cent to inspiration 
and 95 per cent to perspiration!
Reflection: ‘Stick-with-it-
ness’
Three great essentials to achieve anything 
worthwhile are, first, hard work; second, 
stick-to-it-iveness; third, common sense.
Thomas Edison
•• In general, how good are you at 
‘sticking with’ tasks so that you finish 
what you start?
•• Which types of activity or project are 
you most likely to ‘stick with’? 
•• For the goal you identified on p. 163, 
consider the ways that Edison’s ‘three 
essentials’ are relevant.
Reflection: Procrastination
In your reflective journal, consider what some of the 
underlying causes for your procrastination might be. 
•• When did this kind of behaviour begin?
•• What triggers it? Are you worried? Tired? 
Overworking? Anxious about the outcomes? 
Overestimating the scale of the task? Perfectionist? 
Spending too much time getting the beginning 
perfect so there is no time to do anything else? 
•• How can you or others make interventions that 
could change this behaviour?
Becoming a good ‘self-starter’
Many job specifications ask for ‘good self-starters’. Some 
people are naturally motivated to launch into a project 
with minimum assistance. However, the characteristics of 
a good self-starter can be acquired by most people. Self-
starters tend to be:
•• highly motivated; they create a clear vision of the task 
and set themselves specific goals
•• able to use strategies for ‘getting going’
•• open to the possibility of success
•• solution-focused: they will search out information that 
will bring about a solution
•• organised: they develop a strategy and they use their 
time well
•• self-confident: they trust they can manage the task 
reasonably well
•• good at finding support and asking for help when they 
need it
•• good at people skills (this is necessary as, when 
starting a new task, they usually need information and 
assistance)
•• aware of their own limitations: this is essential – a good 
self-starter will be open about what they do not know 
and what they cannot do. They either develop the skills 
themselves or find someone who can help.
Such characteristics are usually acquired in the process 
of other tasks, such as team working, leading groups, 
managing smaller projects, and working up to larger 
projects. However, each time you undertake any 
assignment, you can practise techniques that are relevant 
to being a good self-starter.
182
People and task management skills

Completing a task
The following characteristics are 
usually needed to take tasks through 
to completion on a consistent basis: 
•• enthusiasm
•• ability to see or conceptualise the 
‘end product’
•• perseverance 
•• patience
•• self-belief: belief that you can do it
•• being willing to give the task 
sufficient time
•• being prepared to practise
•• being prepared to keep thinking 
of different solutions
•• accepting constructive criticism
•• searching out a point of interest
•• keeping the goal and benefits in 
mind
•• pride in a job well done.
Reflection: Finishing 
off
•• Which of the above 
characteristics are your 
strongest? 
•• What examples can you give 
of where you used those 
characteristics?
•• Which do you need to develop 
further? 
•• Do you have other qualities 
that help you to take a task 
through to completion?
•• Think of five things you could 
do to develop your ‘finishing’ 
skills.
•• How and when will you apply 
these to meet your current 
goals?
If you find it very difficult to 
develop these characteristics, you 
may find it helpful to speak to a 
student counsellor.
Projects
What is a project?
A project is:
‘A temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product 
or service.’
Project management is:
‘The application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to 
project activities to meet project requirements.’
(Project Management Institute, 2000) 
Characteristics of a project
Projects are characterised by:
•• A goal    There is a purpose, a desired outcome.
•• A discrete focus    The activity is ‘set apart’ in some way. It is 
not part of the usual course of day-to-day events.
•• Magnitude    Projects are associated with setting aside time 
to focus on something special, important or that needs to be 
completed. It suggests a mustering of effort and resources.
•• Time limits    Projects must be completed within a set time-
frame. It should be clear when a project is complete. As the 
definition above indicates, a project is a temporary event.
•• Management    Projects are managed, organised and planned 
events, leading to an outcome within a time-frame.
•• Individuality    The nature of a project is that it is a one-off 
event, leading to something unique. 
Scale of the project
The characteristics of a project could apply to activities of any 
scale. An essay, for example, has:
•• A goal    To address the essay title; to gain a good grade.
•• Discrete focus    Each essay is a separate assignment.
•• Magnitude    Essay writing requires a ‘mustering’ of time and 
resources.
•• Time limits    Deadlines are set for assignments.
•• Management    Essay writing involves multiple processes of 
elaborating the question, research, information management, 
selection, organising ideas, drafting, editing, fine-tuning, 
proof-reading. These have to be orchestrated to achieve the 
final goal.
•• Individuality    Although all students on a programme may be 
given the same assignment title, each student is expected to 
provide an individual answer. 
Writing essays can develop some of the skills needed for project 
work.
183
Successful problem-solving and task management

Successful project management
The skills identified on p. 164 are applicable 
to most projects as well as to general task 
management. The following items also 
contribute to project success.
Problem-solving
Problem-solving techniques can be applied 
successfully to projects.
Elaboration
Problem-elaboration is especially important 
to project work as the wrong strategy 
wastes time and other resources. Heerkens 
(2002) warns against ‘solution jumping’: 
‘the tendency of people to talk about 
what to do before analysing the situation 
adequately, trying to develop a solution 
before thoroughly understanding a 
problem’.
Piloting the methods
Have a trial run or ‘pilot’ to test out your 
methods and materials on a small scale 
before embarking on the full-scale project. 
Identify what needs to be changed. This is 
easier to do after a pilot rather than when 
the project is well under way.
‘Doing what it takes’
Make a commitment to achieve specific 
goals. You can decide that you will give 
‘whatever it takes’ to make a relationship 
work, to get good grades for your course-
work, to get to grips with a subject you do 
not understand, to get a job in a specific 
field, or to launch a business.
‘Doing what it takes’ may mean that 
the majority of your time, energies, 
thinking and even finances go towards 
the achievement of the goal. This is not 
necessarily a healthy approach. However, 
that might be the difference between 
fully achieving a goal and accepting a 
compromise. It is a personal decision 
how far you want to accept a reasonable 
compromise.
Student projects 
However, essays are usually distinguished from student 
‘projects’. For example: 
•• Goal: the purpose of a student project is to develop 
a more in-depth study than would be expected in 
an essay. The desired outcomes are usually both the 
results of the project itself and the development of the 
competences necessary to manage a project.
•• Discrete focus: projects are usually one-off pieces of 
work, related to the overall programme but covering 
ground decided by the student. 
•• Magnitude: projects usually have greater word 
limits, but the magnitude is in the level of personal 
responsibility involved.
•• Individuality: as you have more control over the 
content and processes, it is typical for student projects 
to be more individual and varied than student essays.
•• Time limits: the time allocations for projects tend to be 
greater than for essays.
•• Management: projects are usually more complex than 
essays, requiring more management of the various 
processes.
Employers’ interests in student project skills
Employers are interested in:
•• skills and qualities associated with project 
management
•• experience of undertaking projects
•• the scale of the largest project that you have taken 
part in
•• the scale of the largest problem you have managed 
alone.
The scale of projects can be differentiated by such factors 
as:
•• how many people were involved
•• the time scale – how long it was planned to last and 
how long it did last
•• who ‘commissioned it’ – whether it was yourself, a 
tutor, an employer, an agency
•• the size of the budget
•• how many beneficiaries there were (who benefited?)
•• the significance of the outcomes. What was the impact 
of the project?
Student projects do not always give opportunities to 
develop all these skills or to work on a grand scale, 
but some work placements do. The student union and 
voluntary work are also good sources for gaining such 
experience.
184
People and task management skills

Because projects work to set 
deadlines and focus on new 
areas, they tend to demand more 
time and thought than is usually 
anticipated. The project leader, in 
particular, is likely to spend every 
waking moment on the project if 
it falls behind deadlines, or if new 
solutions are required.
‘Doing what it takes’ is difficult to 
apply to more than one goal at 
a time.
Reflection: 
Commitment
•• How far do you think you 
are generally someone 
who is willing to ‘do what 
it takes’ to gets something 
done?
•• What kinds of activity are 
more likely to prompt you 
to put in the most effort and 
commitment?
•• What conditions encourage 
you to increase your level of 
commitment?
•• What are your limits?
Clarity
Good problem elaboration and 
planning should mean 
that it is clear what needs 
to be done, by whom, 
where and when. When 
the plan is clear, the 
team can work more 
effectively. Confusion leads 
to additional work, puts 
deadlines at risk, puts the 
team under stress, and can 
put up the costs.
Decision making
When projects are under way, you may have to make decisions 
at speed. This is easier if you have already considered different 
solutions and planned for contingencies. Keep the main goal in 
sight and know which compromises are possible. You will also have 
to weigh up the relative importance of key criteria such as:
•• costs
•• deadlines
•• effects on other people
•• the availability of expertise
•• aspects of quality
•• which changes will be acceptable to the client or commissioning 
agent (or tutor).
Know the project ‘inside out’
To make decisions under pressure, you need to know the project 
‘inside out’. You need a keen sense of what the ‘client’ (maybe the 
tutor in your case) will consider acceptable. Spend time finding out 
the background to the project. For example, why is it considered 
important? Are there ethical or political considerations which 
should be taken into account? What are the most similar projects 
that have been initiated in the past – and what were the outcomes 
of these? This information can help you with your own planning 
and decision making.
Keep the vision in mind
Whilst it is important to keep to deadlines and budgets, it is easy to 
lose sight of the main purpose of a project. A good leader will keep 
the team focused on the end-point as well as on interim targets.
185
Successful problem-solving and task management

Meeting the criteria
Performance indicators should be closely linked 
to the criteria for success identified earlier in 
the project (see p. 172). They are unlikely to be 
exactly the same because some criteria may not be 
measurable. You may meet the criteria of a project 
without feeling that you performed well in all 
respects. Your individual or team performance may 
be different from the criteria for individual projects. 
Activity
Meeting the criteria
When you have completed a current project, 
return to the criteria you set near the beginning 
of the project (see p. 172). Consider:
•• Did you meet the essential criteria (the 
‘bottom line’) that you set?
•• Were these criteria realistic?
•• What criteria do you think could have been 
better, if any?
Work with performance indicators
Performance indicators you could use for study or 
project work include:
•• how often you meet deadlines for assignments 
•• the number and percentage of the times that 
you complete a particular action successfully
•• how long it takes to perform a specific activity
•• how often you reach your targets
•• feedback received from others
•• how many of the milestones you set for yourself 
were achieved
•• how much it cost compared to budget
•• percentage improvement over previous 
performance
•• grades and marks.
The whole team must be clear about the 
background to the project and understand the 
vision of the person who commissioned it (you, 
your tutor, a client). This makes each team 
member feel more involved. It also means that 
each person is better informed to make interim 
decisions in line with the overall ‘vision’. All project 
decisions should be guided by the overall goal, not 
by the requirements of short-term targets.
Team work
Most projects in the workplace are team efforts. 
If the team does not pull together, the project 
becomes a ‘sick’ project: people are unhappy 
and less willing to put in the extra effort needed 
to bring the project to completion. Successful 
managers ascribe their achievements to good team 
work and to trusting their team.
Team work requires the ability both to be a good 
team member, and to be able to take the lead 
where relevant. This calls for a range of people 
skills. Hallows (1997), argues: ‘Hard though it may 
be to admit, the people side of projects is more 
important than the technical side.’ Because of the 
importance of people skills, a specific chapter has 
been dedicated to this (Chapter 5).
Performance indicators (PI)
How do you know whether what you are doing 
is successful? ‘Performance indicators’ are 
one way of monitoring and evaluating your 
performance. They ‘indicate’ where you are doing 
well or need to improve. Performance indicators 
should be ‘measurable’ so that you can compare 
performance either over time or against the 
performance of other people. Some examples are:
•• 95 per cent of targets to be achieved by the 
deadline.
•• The project to be completed within 5 per cent 
of the project budget.
•• 75 per cent of the participants to indicate in 
a feedback questionnaire that they are ‘very 
content’ with the outcome.
•• A mark of 60 per cent or more to be achieved 
for every assignment.
•• Attendance levels to achieve at least 95 per cent.
•• Punctuality to be at least 95 per cent.
186
People and task management skills

Activity
Use performance 
indicators
•• Choose one area of activity 
where you can practise using 
performance indicators.
•• Set yourself at least three 
performance indicators for the 
activity you select. 
•• Make sure that the indicators 
you set are ones that can be 
measured or checked. This 
means that they will include a 
measurement or number of some 
kind. 
Soft criteria
Some project criteria cannot easily 
include a number or ‘measurable’ 
component. For example, it is hard to 
quantify:
•• creativity
•• innovation
•• ethical approaches
•• sensitivity
•• flexibility
•• emotional intelligence
•• how well you manage a difficult 
situation
•• responsiveness
•• assertiveness.
Soft criteria require you to develop 
skills in being an objective evaluator 
of your own performance. You 
have to develop a ‘feel’ for whether 
something is going well or not. 
Wherever possible, this should still 
be evaluated against specific criteria 
and performance indicators to get 
a rounded picture of how you are 
doing. Compare your personal 
evaluations with feedback from others. 
Activity
Using soft criteria
What kinds of soft criteria or performance indicators do you 
use to check your own performance for:
•• Working with other people?
•• Managing your own work?
•• Coping with difficult situations?
•• Being creative in some way?
How do you go about checking the quality of your 
performance for these? 
What do other people say about your performance in these 
areas?
Benchmarks
A benchmark is a point of comparison. For example, a 
sportsperson might benchmark their speed or accuracy 
against the records of people at the top of their own sport. A 
programme on TV might benchmark itself against audience 
ratings for other programmes. Organisations and projects 
use benchmarks to measure their performance against other 
companies or projects. 
Good benchmarks compare like with like. For example, if your 
project involves writing an information leaflet for the public, 
the benchmarks would need to relate to another project 
that aimed at producing a similar number of leaflets in a 
similar time-scale on a similar kind of issue. The performance 
indicators for such a project might include some of the 
following:
•• how much it costs to produce each leaflet
•• how many readers, when asked, rated the leaflet as useful
•• the percentage of readers who, when asked, rated the 
leaflet as useful
•• an independent mark (by an independent assessor or tutor)
•• a measure of how far the leaflet changed opinion or 
behaviour.
A good benchmark enables you to evaluate your own 
outcomes against those of a comparable project or set of 
benchmarks. 
For example, you may find that you wanted to achieve a 
90 per cent return for a questionnaire and yet received only 
35 per cent. This might feel like failure as it is far short of 
the target. If you compare this with similar questionnaires in 
comparable circumstances, you may find that a typical (or 
benchmark) response is only 20 per cent. This would mean 
that your target was unrealistic but your performance for the 
questionnaire was good.
187
Successful problem-solving and task management

terms of ‘competitiveness’. Depending on the business, 
this will include such factors as:
•• skills and experience of staff
•• use of performance indicators
•• using feedback from other people
•• improvements in quality and efficiency
•• awareness of developments in the field
•• thinking and planning ahead of the competition.
As people are the most important resource of any 
project, the quality of the personnel is a key factor 
in the competitiveness and success of a business or 
project. When you apply for work, employers may be 
considering how you could contribute to the overall 
competitiveness of their business or project.
The activity on p. 189 is a personal ‘competitiveness 
audit’. It will give you a score out of a hundred – or 
your ‘percentage competitiveness’. This is only a rough 
estimate. However, it gives you an indication of how 
you may be viewed in competition with other people. 
If you score well, you can be more confident about what 
you have to offer in job interviews. If your score isn’t 
high, you have an indicator of where you can focus your 
energies next in order to develop your skills and extend 
your experience.
Activity
Using a benchmark
•• For an activity that you are involved 
in currently, what would be a useful 
benchmark? (Consider existing 
statistics and written records of 
performance.) 
•• How could you use this benchmark as 
a way of setting your own targets for 
improving your performance?
The drawback with benchmarks is that 
if all similar projects are mediocre, the 
benchmark will be low. You may need to 
set targets that ensure you exceed the 
benchmark in order for your project to 
be successful.
Competitiveness
Competitiveness is a concept used to 
promote and evaluate good practice in

’Evaluating targets’ on p. 178
•• Target 1: This is too vague, has no time limits 
and is unlikely to be achievable or measurable. 
It isn’t realistic.
•• Target 2: This is unlikely to be achievable or 
measurable as it is hard to define a ‘mistake’ 
with respect to an essay. Very few essays are 
perfect. This is not a realistic target.
•• Target 3: This may be realistic and achievable 
for the person. Success could be measured. No 
time-scales are set so the target isn’t SMART.
•• Target 4: This has a clear time-scale and is likely 
to be achievable and realistic. However, it is so 
vague that it is meaningless.
•• Target 5: This is specific, measurable, and time-
bound. It is likely to be realistic and achievable, 
and if not, there is sufficient time before the 
hand-in date to adjust the deadline.
•• Target 6: This is specific, measurable and time-
bound. You would need to know more about 
the circumstances to see if the target was 
achievable, realistic and sufficiently flexible.
•• Target 7: ‘More’ is too vague. ‘From October’ 
sets an initial time-scale but does not indicate 
how long this will continue.
•• Target 8: This is specific and measurable. 
A 5 per cent improvement is likely to be 
achievable and reasonable, unless the mark 
was already very high. Setting a target for 
all assignments is challenging: it has little 
flexibility. This target would need to be 
accompanied by other targets which specify 
more clearly how the improved mark will be 
achieved.
•• Target 9: This is likely to be a SMART-F target.
•• Target 10: This is too precise and allows for 
little flexibility in choice of work placement. It is 
not likely to be realistic or achievable.

Successful problem-solving and task management
© Stella Cottrell (2003, 2010, 2015), Skills for Success, Palgrave

Closing comments
Problem-solving is essentially a way of getting 
things done, and therefore can be applied to a 
very wide range of circumstances. If you develop 
the skills associated with problem-solving, you 
will have a good starting place for taking on any 
task. 
This chapter has looked at the skills and 
processes that contribute to successful problem-
solving and task management. It addresses 
some of the generic skills that contribute to the 
success of any kind of ‘project’ such as writing 
an assignment, conducting a student project, 
undertaking projects at work, or taking on an 
undertaking in your personal life. This includes 
such processes as defining the task, elaborating 
the problem, setting priorities, developing 
an appropriate strategy, setting SMART-F 
targets, developing an action plan, monitoring 
performance against targets and indicators, and 
taking a task to completion. These processes are 
key to almost any project in any environment. 
Problem-solving and task management tend 
to push us beyond our previous limits. At 
university, for example, assignments become 
increasingly more challenging as we move 
from one year or level to the next. At work, the 
problems and projects facing graduates will tend 
to contain new aspects that colleagues will not 
have covered before. 
A good problem-solving strategy, along with 
developed people skills, will enable you to take 
on such new tasks with greater confidence.

People and task management skills

Academic study generally develops your thinking 
skills, especially if you bring an attitude of intellectual 
curiosity and active engagement with the debates in 
your subject.
Reading widely, making judgements about material 
to use in assignments, discussing academic questions, 
completing mathematical formulae, tackling lab-
based research, and formulating ideas in writing – all 
help to develop your thinking skills. Such academic 
tasks stretch the mind so that you develop the mental 
capacity to take on complex and difficult tasks in 
a range of contexts. Typically, courses of higher 
education require, and develop, such skills as critical 
analysis and reflection, creativity and problem-solving, 
which can be applied fruitfully to most academic and 
work-related tasks.
However, skills do not necessarily transfer 
automatically from academic study to broader 
contexts. It takes further thought to identify how to 
transfer and apply skills, including ‘thinking skills’, 
effectively to new kinds of task.
This section looks at two aspects of such thinking, 
both of which can strengthen academic and 
professional abilities: creative and reflective thinking.
Chapter 7, ‘Thinking outside the box’, looks in general 
terms at how you can maximise your brain capacity. It 
helps you to reflect upon how you think, and provides 
tools to help you to develop creativity, synthesis, 
and adventurous thinking. As creativity can sound 
challenging to those who don’t automatically think of 
themselves as ‘creative’, the chapter also looks at the 
risk-taking and self-management that creativity entails.
Thinking reflectively in structured and 
systematic ways about your performance is 
now typical of many academic and professional 
areas. Chapter 8 looks at what is meant by 
the ‘reflective practitioner’. Reflective thinking 
sounds simple, but students tend to struggle 
to do well at this aspect of their course. It is 
all too easy to fall into superficial, descriptive, 
or blaming approaches rather than bringing 
the high levels of analysis, evaluation, 
critique, synthesis, personal responsibility, and 
metacognition that are expected.
Building on the thinking skills developed 
in Chapter 7, Chapter 8 outlines diverse 
approaches to reflection in order to help you to 
understand what is required, to develop your 
skills in reflection and to find an approach that 
works for you.
You don’t need to be an expert in each method 
and mode presented. Rather, experiment with 
different approaches until you:
•• find the combination that best helps you 
to generate, organise, synthesise and fine 
tune your thoughts in ways relevant to your 
circumstances, and
•• can apply creative and reflective thinking 
flexibly to benefit your academic and 
professional work.

Introduction
Born to learn 
Learning is a natural process. Our brains 
are set up to learn – they consist of 
approximately a hundred billion 
neurons, which are linked in 
elaborate networks. These neural 
networks enable us to:
•• transmit information from one 
part of the brain to another
•• form associations between 
new information and what we 
already know
•• make sense of what we 
experience
•• encode information for 
memory.
We can envisage our brains as 
billions of trees laid out in all 
directions, and whose roots and 
branches are all in contact. For 
any one activity, several billion 
contacts may be made between 
those branches and roots – and 
this happens in milliseconds. A 
thought is like a bolt of lightning 
illuminating a vast forest of 
connections.
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• understand how your brain works so you can use it more effectively
•• develop your natural ability to learn new things
•• develop confidence in your creativity
•• use strategies to generate ideas
•• use creative approaches to thinking.
Chapter 7
Thinking outside the box
193
Thinking outside the box

Our brains are also very flexible. They 
allow us to learn in innumerable ways, 
through: 
•• listening
•• imitation
•• taking small steps
•• practice
•• watching others
•• day-dreaming
•• taking an inspired leap
•• linking different problems
and so on.
Learning can be easy. The most 
complex things our brains will ever 
have to learn were accomplished 
when we did not even know what 
‘learning’ was, before the age of five. 
This chapter will look at how you can 
make best use of your brain’s amazing 
capacities. The earlier part of the 
chapter looks at some characteristics 
of your brain, so that you can use its 
natural tendencies to best effect. 
Inspiration is most difficult when 
we think in rigid, logical ways. This 
chapter looks at ways of stimulating 
the idea-generating capacities of the 
brain – which may mean thinking and 
acting in ways that are not typical of 
your usual study or work habits. To 
begin, do the activity below. 
Activity
The ‘box’
In your reflective journal, jot down 
your response to the following 
question:
•• What is the use of a shoebox?
We will return to this later in the 
chapter.
Limiting intelligence
Are cleverness and creativity the same thing? If you did well 
at school, does that mean you are automatically a creative 
thinker? De Bono (2006) argues that clever people are often 
hampered by their apparent intelligence in two keys ways:
1	 They are very good at arguing and are usually better at 
defending their position. As they are more likely to win the 
argument, they are more likely to think they have the best 
solution. You may know people like this. If you think you 
are ‘right’, there is no reason to listen to other people or to 
look for a better solution. 
As a result, many highly intelligent minds are  
trapped in poor ideas because they can  
defend them so well.
(De Bono, 2006)
2	 It is easier, quicker, and more dramatic to prove somebody 
else wrong than to devise constructive solutions. 
Negative criticism adds to your visible ‘superiority’. Being 
constructive can take longer and can make other people 
look good rather than yourself. However, negative criticism 
doesn’t promote creative thinking. 
Our views of what is ‘intelligent’ can prevent us from 
developing our minds to their full potential. If we hold 
negative thoughts about our own intelligence, for example, 
those thoughts can also limit our ability to perform well 
(Cottrell, 2013). People who feel they are ‘not very bright’ 
or ‘not very creative’ probably will fulfil that estimation 
of themselves. On the other hand, positive thinking and 
constructive mental activity develop the mind. 
Creativity is like a muscle: it gets stronger the more you 
exercise it.
Reflection: Limiting creativity
Note in your reflective journal:
•• any ways that you currently put limits on your capacity 
to think
•• any ways you prevent yourself from achieving your full 
potential as a creative, imaginative person.

Interpreting your creative thinking score
You now have an approximate score for creative thinking. This is not an exact science, but it gives you 
an idea of how confident you are about your own creativity. It also gives you an insight into how you 
could develop your creative thinking skills further.
Activity: Self-evaluation of creative thinking skills (continued)
75–100	This is an excellent score. If your ratings 
were accurate, you already use the kinds of 
strategies that contribute to creative thinking. 
This suggests an invaluable approach to 
problem-solving and to life in general. 
Consider how you could develop these further, 
especially in relation to your programme and 
to the career areas that interest you. It is also 
worth checking whether your logical, analytical 
skills are as well developed as your creative 
thinking skills. It is important to develop both 
kinds of thinking.
50–74 	 This is a good score. If your ratings were 
accurate, this suggests your creative thinking 
skills are already well developed. Look for 
themes in the statements to which you gave 
lower ratings. What else could you do to 
develop your thinking skills? This chapter may 
give you some ideas. 
25–49	 If your ratings were accurate, this 
suggests that you have started to develop 
creative thinking skills. There is probably a 
lot more you could do to build these further. 
It is worth spending time considering what 
prevents you from developing your creativity 
at present. It is important not to try too hard 
at creative thinking: it may be that you worry 
too much about doing things the right way. 
Experiment with a more relaxed approach 
and make sure you leave plenty of time to 
try out new approaches as well as your usual 
methods. It can take time to build confidence 
in new approaches.
0–24	
If your ratings were accurate, this 
suggests that you have identified that creative 
thinking skills are not currently a major area of 
strength for you. Check with people who know 
you well whether you have rated yourself too 
harshly. Identify what kinds of thinking skills 
are most critical for meeting the requirements 
of your programme and career interests. Read 
through the comments for the score 25–49 
above. These may also apply to you. Most 
importantly, do not be discouraged. This is not 
a scientific test – and creative thinking skills 
can be developed.

many neurons or brain cells we have that makes us 
capable of tasks, but the number of connections 
between them. We develop these connections 
through engagement with the environment, with 
activity, with stimulation.  
If we try to be experts when we are still novices at 
a task, the brain may not have developed the right 
connections to solve the problems we encounter. 
It can leave us feeling that we are incapable of the 
task. This can seem like failure and encourage us to 
give up when we may simply need more practice. 
The longer we perform or practice an activity, the 
more we build up the mental connections that we 
need to do it well. There really is sense in the old 
saying, ‘If at first you don’t succeed, try, try, try 
again.’ 
We often find that the things we found hardest 
to do, and had to practise the most, are those for 
which we develop the best overall and long-term 
understanding. 
Reflection: Stimulating your brain
•• What kinds of new challenges do you 
give your brain to keep it ‘stretched’ and 
stimulated?
•• For what kinds of activity do you tend to stick 
with the task, increasing your chances of 
succeeding in the long run? 
•• What kinds of activities do you ‘give up on’ 
early?
The brain uses short cuts
The brain likes short cuts. Professional magicians 
know this and trick the eye by encouraging such 
‘short cuts’. 
If the brain thinks it knows what it is seeing, it 
stops looking for explanations. It matches what 
it thinks it is experiencing with the ‘schema’ or 
mental models it has already built up. If it finds a 
good enough match, it uses the stored information 
to make sense of the new experience. If not, it uses 
the new experience to adapt the mental models. 
interest when rehearsed and delivered many times. 
Throughout history, people have been fascinated 
by riddles, puzzles, codes, mazes and labyrinths. 
In many ages, art has been heavily allegorical or 
symbolic, so that an apparently simple picture 
could be decoded or interpreted, item by item, to 
read out a hidden message.
Reflection: Complexity
•• What kinds of complex, skilled, multi-layered 
or multi-sequenced activities do you enjoy? 
•• What kinds of complicated tasks do you 
avoid?
•• What makes you seek out and enjoy one kind 
of complexity and avoid others?
Our brain can cope with very complex problems. It 
sets up connections between our new experiences 
and what we already know. It develops increasingly 
elaborate networks as we become more expert in 
an area. However, it can’t do this all at once. 
What we are able to learn is partly the result of 
what we have already learnt. 
The more you learn, the easier the next thing 
is to learn
When we encounter new situations, we draw upon 
and develop our existing knowledge. We then 
organise this into internal models called ‘schema’.
If we have been on one picnic, for example, we 
do not know how typical that is of any other 
picnic. When we have been on ten picnics, we 
have an elaborated idea of a picnic. We know 
the variations that are possible, we can anticipate 
what to expect at future picnics, plan for such 
occasions, and develop criteria to evaluate whether 
they are ‘good’ or ‘bad’ picnics depending on 
our experience. At this stage, we have a well-
developed schema. 
As we go through the day, this process is going 
on all the time. According to Piaget (1952), our 
experiences reinforce or alter what we already 
know. 
If we expose the brain to varied and complex 
problems at a reasonable pace, it will usually 
develop the neural networks we need. It isn’t how 
197
Thinking outside the box

Most of the time the brain’s short cuts are useful. 
We often refer to these as ‘generalisations’. 
Generalisations help us to make sense of what is 
going on from one moment to the next, without 
having to start from scratch each time. We are 
able to tell what are ‘typical’ experiences, what 
are variations and what is new. If we can see a 
connection between something we are good 
at and the problem in hand, then we may offer 
the brain a short cut to solving the problem (see 
Chapter 2).
We can also feed messages to the brain that 
encourage it to take short cuts. ‘I have tried and 
cannot do this’ is one such message. Alternatively, 
we could choose to feed it encouraging messages 
such as: ‘There is a way to solve this’, or ‘Let’s 
look at this again’ or ‘This is interesting’, and the 
brain will respond differently.
Reflection: Spotting the short 
cuts
•• Which short cuts does your brain take? In 
other words what kinds of things are you 
less likely to notice that other people seem 
better at spotting? 
•• Which messages do you give your brain that 
may encourage it to think it can’t do things?
•• How could you change those messages?
Expert chess players
Experts are experts because of the power of the 
brain in recognising patterns. Expert chess players 
can recall how all the pieces were arranged on 
a chessboard even if given only five seconds to 
view it. This is not because they have superior 
memories. Expert chess players see the whole 
configuration as one meaningful whole. They see 
it as one ‘chunk’. They can only do this if they 
recognise the pattern as one that they have seen 
and used before. In effect, they are remembering 
only one pattern, which is easy.
Novice players have to remember the positions 
of up to 32 items – but the short-term memory 
struggles with more than 5–7 items. Novices 
have to work harder in order to remember more 
items – and are less likely to get the answer right. 
However, expert chess players are no better at 
remembering the layout of the pieces than anyone 
else if they haven’t seen the pattern before (Chase 
and Simon, 1973). The effect of spending time 
practising, seeing and learning significant patterns 
over and over again, is very evident here. 
Significant patterns
Although the brain can get used to any pattern, 
it works more effectively if the pattern you look 
for has an underlying meaning. The brain likes 
significance and meaning. For example, it is easier 
to remember a set of names if they all belong to 
The brain likes organisation and patterns 
The brain organises information in many 
different ways. A colour, a scent or a few bars 
of music can evoke very detailed memories. 
Similarly, we can generate information 
quickly on the basis of the first letter of 
a word, the end of the word, words that 
mean the same thing, or any number of 
other similarities or differences. It is easier to 
remember information if we:
•• organise it into groups, clusters or 
categories
•• organise it into hierarchies
•• make links between pieces of information.
If we find links between one kind of activity 
and another, we are better able to perform 
the second activity. Looking for patterns or 
similarities enables us to transfer ‘expertise’ 
from one area to solve new problems (see 
Chapter 2).
198
Extend your thinking

Activity
Subject chunks
Sometimes working from two or three books, 
seeing how the material is arranged in each, can 
help to develop a sense of how the information 
can be organised into different sets of meaningful 
chunks. You may find some texts organise 
information in ways that are easier for you to 
understand.
•• Look at three different books for a topic you 
find difficult. 
•• Write down the headings and sub-headings 
used by each. 
•• Browse the material written under each. 
•• Which book organises the information in the 
way that suits you best? 
If you work with material in this way, you may also 
find that seeing the same information from several 
different angles helps to build up your overall 
picture of the subject.
The brain is naturally playful
The brain makes odd, unusual and unexpected 
connections. This enables us to make jokes and puns, 
to invent, to find solutions. Children use play as their 
main tool for learning. They act out adult roles. They 
play with the world around them, and experiment 
in order to find out more about it. As adults, we may 
be self-conscious about using ‘play’  to develop our 
thinking. When we allow it to be playful, the brain 
can provide the answers we need. 
However, the brain often presents information to us 
in unexpected ways. It may disguise the answers in 
riddles or give us clues to decipher. It encourages us 
to ‘play’ with information.
Our brain may spot a dinner fork on the table, make 
a connection with garden tools, and send us a signal 
about gardens. In the past, we may have associated 
gardening with hard work, and the brain has spotted 
the fork as a reminder to us to work on an essay. 
Sometimes we can catch hold of this odd train of 
connections, which is meaningful only to the person 
concerned. More often, the links are hidden. When 
the brain plays with us in this way, we can, if we 
play with the ‘clues’ it sends us, find the solutions to 
problems that are teasing us.
members of your family. Similarly, if expert 
technicians are asked to reconstruct a circuit 
board, they will do so on the basis of what 
each part does – its function or significance to 
the working of the board. Novices will try to 
assemble the board according to how it looks 
(Egan and Schwartz, 1979). This approach is 
superficial and recall is less effective. You can 
test this for yourself with the activity below.
Activity
Memory for patterns (1)
•• Write down the start time.
•• Time how long it takes you to learn the 
following sequence, in order. You can 
learn this in any way you like, as long as 
you end up being able to recite it or write 
it without looking.
O h n s   t   d o   w t e u   o r h
•• Put the sequence and all copies where 
you cannot see them. Now write it down.
•• Check for accuracy. 
•• If you have not got it right, keep going 
until you do. Then write down the time 
again.
•• Write down how long it took you, 
altogether, to learn the sequence 
perfectly.
•• When you have finished, time yourself 
learning the second sequence, found on 
p. 203.
You probably found it took less time to 
remember the second sequence, even though 
you may never have seen this written down 
before. This is because you are familiar with 
the chunks of meaning (the words) and a 
single bigger chunk (the meaning of the 
sentence). The knowledge of experts for any 
task is divided into meaningful chunks, similar 
to words and sentences. 
As you become more expert in any subject, 
you will start to construct the ‘meaningful 
chunks’ of the subject, so that you can ‘read it 
off’ as quickly as you did the second sequence 
in the activity on p. 203.
199
Thinking outside the box

The brain works when you are not looking
The brain is working on our behalf all of the time. 
Most of what we do and learn, we do without even 
realising it. The brain does not respond well to being 
forced. For example, if a word or idea is ‘on the tip of 
your tongue’ you can try for hours to remember but 
without success. However, a few hours later, when you 
are focusing on something else, the answer will seem 
to ‘pop into your head’ from nowhere.
You can send the brain on errands
As the brain will work on a problem when 
you are not consciously thinking about it, you 
can give it directions about what you want it 
to do. You need to be precise about what you 
want, and be prepared to wait. For example, 
if you know where the Buddha was born but 
can’t remember and want to know, the brain 
will often deliver the answer a few minutes or 
hours later. Sometimes, it sends the message 
in code: you may find yourself thinking about 
an Indian film or Indian music or food, even 
though the only link with the Buddha is India. 
Be aware of this so you are ready to spot the 
clues.
Sleep on it
Work on a problem before you sleep. Identify 
the core questions as far as you can. List the 
things that are puzzling you. Write these as 
questions. Focus on one or two questions that 
are really key.
Whilst you sleep, your brain may continue to 
work on the problem. It may not. However, 
you increase the chances of your relaxed, 
unconscious mind working on the problem 
whilst you sleep. Keep paper and a pen by 
the bed as you may wake up with lots of 
ideas. 
You can use the brain to work for you by focusing on 
a problem, analysing it as far as you can, generating 
as many solutions as possible – and then leaving it for 
a while. When you stop analysing and labouring over 
the problem, allowing the mind to relax, the brain 
will continue to work on the problem for you.
Indeed, if you change environment, and return to a 
problem, your brain may have drawn your attention 
to clues from your surroundings without you being 
aware of it. Experiments with children show that 
they used the shape of the light bulbs, clouds, even 
shadows on the ceiling or cracks in the wall to resolve 
problems they had been discussing before taking a 
rest break.
You can make use of this capacity of the brain if you:
•• spend time elaborating the problem so the brain 
is absolutely clear what you are looking for; ‘day-
dreaming’ alone is not enough
•• give the brain some space to work on the problem
•• enter a relaxed state of mind for a while
•• return to the problem after a break.

Various oils have also been associated with the 
way the brain functions (Stordy, 2000). For most 
people, a varied diet provides the small amounts 
of a very wide range of chemicals that the body 
needs. 
Reflection: Nourishing your brain
•• How well do you feed and water your brain?
•• How much water do you drink each day?
•• Does your diet help or hinder your brain? If 
you are unsure, speak to somebody at your 
student health centre.
You can take your brain for a walk 
Our brains first developed to manage movement 
and to respond to the environment whilst moving. 
The brain is stimulated by movement. It has been 
shown that mice learn better after a period of brisk 
exercise, as the supply of endorphins and other 
chemicals to the brain is increased.
In humans, a very large part of the motor cortex in 
the brain is devoted to the fine motor movements 
of the  fingers and mouth (for using tools, writing, 
playing an instrument, speaking). If you want 
to stimulate your thinking, take a walk, play an 
instrument, draw, do something. 
Activity
Exercising the problem
When working on a problem, take a brisk walk 
for about 20 minutes before returning to study. 
What is the effect? Do you come up with any 
ideas about your study whilst walking?
If you are required to sit and listen, find ways 
of increasing your personal engagement. For 
example, in long presentations or lectures, it 
is natural for the mind to wander after a few 
minutes. You can manage this process by:
•• deliberately diverting yourself from listening for 
a few seconds at regular intervals. You can time 
this to coincide with when the speaker pauses 
or changes a slide. Otherwise, the brain will 
automatically ‘switch off’ but at less well timed 
occasions, and without you noticing.
•• Listening actively, in a questioning way, jotting 
down your questions and opinions.
The brain likes to be fed and watered
Greenfield (2001) describes the brain as the 
greediest organ in the body. Although it is less 
than 2.5 per cent of our body weight, when 
the body is at rest the brain uses up 20 per cent 
of the body’s fuel input. It consumes oxygen 
from the air we breathe and glucose from the 
carbohydrates we eat, burning these off at ten 
times the rate of any other body tissue.  A good 
diet assists the brain. Over time, starving the body 
of carbohydrates will reduce the fuel that the brain 
needs in order to function. 
Our bodies are mostly water. Water conducts 
electricity – and the messages our brain sends and 
co-ordinates are ultimately electrical impulses. 
These are affected by dehydration. When we are 
dehydrated, we reduce the efficiency of our brain 
as well as the general functioning of the body. 
Drinking water increases brain efficiency; other 
drinks do not have the same effect. We need 
about eight glasses of clear water a day, taken in 
gradually over the day.
The brain uses energy to process food and drink. 
After a large meal, you can become drowsy as the 
brain diverts its resources to deal with digestion. 
A big meal or drink is best avoided just before an 
exam or interview. 
‘The brain is fundamentally a chemical system’ 
(Greenfield, 2001). The chemicals ultimately 
come from what we feed the body. Nicotine, for 
example, puts the body into survival mode, raising 
heart rate and blood pressure, whereas creative 
thinking is associated with more relaxed states. 
201
Thinking outside the box

•• Making notes: this can be an act of ‘translation’ 
of ideas from someone else’s speech into 
your own words and ideas. Your listening is 
more active if you are choosing what to note, 
considering how to summarise, turning the talk 
into a diagram, and looking at how different 
aspects link up.  
The brain won’t work well when it is upset
When we are anxious, our body releases chemicals, 
such as adrenalin, which put us on the alert for 
danger. It is a very ancient bodily response, to 
help us survive. Our eyes look for movement 
at the periphery of our vision, so that we can 
detect danger, and we become more alert to 
noise, ready to react. We are easily distracted by 
our environment. Resources are diverted to large 
muscles in the arms and legs so that we can fight 
or run. 
When we are stressed, the brain is not interested 
in ‘thinking’ tasks:  it wants us to move, to 
escape, to survive. The more distressed we 
become at not understanding something, 
the more the brain diverts energy away from 
the thinking brain to the survival brain. Some 
strenuous activity, such as exercise, a brisk walk, 
housework – anything which uses the arms and 
legs – uses up the excess adrenalin, leaving us 
more relaxed and able to concentrate.  
Strategies for managing stress and thinking 
positively can ‘trick’ the survival brain into 
believing that everything is OK, even if we do 
not fully feel or believe that at first. This allows 
us to use the parts of the brain needed to work 
out a complex solution. If we get too stressed, it 
becomes necessary to get help from somebody 
who isn’t – and who can think more clearly.
The brain works well when it is excited and 
engaged
The brain likes to be stimulated and engaged. 
When tasks are not challenging enough, the 
brain finds it hard to stay focused. If tasks are too 
difficult for its current level of experience, the 
brain may become stressed. To work well, the 
brain needs to find a task that is stimulating but 
not a threat at its current level of competence.
If you look for the interest in a task, you are more 
likely to find it manageable than if you dismiss 
the task as too difficult. When we are excited or 
frightened, similar sets of chemicals are released 
in the body. We can direct the brain on how 
to interpret those chemicals. If we approach 
complex thinking problems as ‘difficult’, we may 
feel ourselves ‘freeze up’. On the other hand, if 
we choose to look for the interest and excitement 
in them, we are less likely to ‘go blank’ and more 
likely to use the expertise we already have.
The brain likes to be refreshed  
Although the brain enjoys being stimulated, the 
mind can become too busy. It becomes cluttered 
with thought and benefits from being ‘stilled’ 
occasionally. This is one of the most difficult 
things to achieve. One way of practising this is 
outlined on page 203.
If we are anxious about an essay or exam, we can 
have the same adrenalin and survival response.  As 
the body is then ready for large movements, we 
confuse it if we simply sit still. When we read or 
write or use the computer, we focus our attention 
on a small central space whilst our eyes want to 
look around for danger. We give mixed messages 
to the brain.

Activity
‘Mindfulness: Being in the present moment
Read through the whole activity first. After that, all you have to do is be in the present moment whilst 
watching your breath. 
•• Sit so you are upright but comfortable. You 
may find the activity easier if you close your 
eyes.
•• Watch the way that your breath enters and 
leaves your body. Notice whether it is cool or 
warm. Notice whether your breaths are long 
or short, easy or laboured. Avoid changing the 
way you are breathing – just notice the detail. 
The exception is if your breathing is noisy: 
breathe as quietly as possible.
•• Your mind will wander. This is natural. Avoid 
forcing it. Just notice when it wanders and 
gently return your attention to your breath.
•• As ideas enter your head, tell yourself to ‘let 
go’ of them. If you notice that you are getting 
uncomfortable, shift very slightly and slowly, 
and then focus on your breath again. 
•• You may find that really interesting ideas and 
thoughts enter your head, or that you have 
become lost in a dialogue about an event that 
happened that day, or that you remember how 
angry you are with someone. The brain finds 
it difficult to let you remain quiet with just 
yourself in the present moment. Don’t explore 
interesting ideas or try to remember them just 
now. Let them vaporise or fly away.
•• You may think that your brain is too smart, 
clever, fast-moving, idea-filled, and imaginative 
for you to benefit from this exercise. The exact 
opposite is true. 
•• This task is almost impossible for most people. 
However, noting which justifications you 
find for not doing it tells you a great deal 
about yourself, if you can work it out. Simply 
acknowledge the frustration or other emotions, 
and again, just let go of them. 
•• Smiling relaxes the face muscles, making this 
activity easier. If you feel agitated, remind 
yourself that you have created the luxury of 
doing nothing but breathing and being with 
your own mind in the present moment. 
•• Each time you ‘let go’, you clear and energise 
your mind. You give it a break. You allow it to 
stop worrying and give it an opportunity to 
relax and do nothing. 
At first you may not notice any difference. However, doing this for 20 minutes several times a week 
develops better mental and emotional awareness. Sometimes, the activity will leave you feeling clear-
headed, relaxed and calm.

Thinking outside the box

Creativity 
Most people equate creativity with 
a particular kind of person. You may 
have associated creativity with being 
an artist, designer, performer or 
inventor. 
Most of us underestimate our capacity 
for creativity. We may compare 
ourselves with great artists, for 
example, ignoring all the occasions 
when we have used our minds and 
resources creatively to deal with 
the situation we are in. We all have 
our own spheres where our natural 
creativity shines. This might be, for 
example:
•• knowing the right things to say
•• seeing the funny side when things 
go wrong
•• finding ways of avoiding work and 
inventing unusual but convincing 
excuses
•• co-ordinating the activities of 
several children so that they are all 
entertained, occupied and safe
•• making patients feel at ease before 
an operation
•• cooking a special meal on a budget
•• soothing the waters when people 
are arguing
•• finding the perfect present for other 
people.
Reflection: Personal 
creativity
•• If you think of creativity in the 
ways suggested in the list above, 
what kinds of creativity do you 
show in your life? For example, 
what things do you do that seem 
easier for you than for some 
other people that you know? 
Do you have your ‘own ways of 
doing things’ for certain tasks? 
•• In which areas of your life would 
you like to be more creative?
•• Do you feel comfortable with the 
idea of yourself as a potentially 
creative person?

Creative problem-solving
Previous chapters looked at problem-solving when managing 
tasks, yourself and other people. The magic element in all 
these situations is coming up with something new when it is 
needed – the ‘creative spark’. This is often the hardest part 
of problem-solving. It is easy to sit waiting for inspiration, 
expecting an answer to fall from the sky. This chapter looks 
at strategies you can employ to oil the brain and assist it in 
generating ideas when needed. 
The ‘many quickly’ approach
If you have one solution, look for five, ten, twenty more
Those who feel they know the answer to a question rarely look 
for a better one. Also, looking for one solution can take longer 
than ten possible solutions. We can be so concerned about 
finding the one ‘right’ answer that we block our thinking. If 
we look for ten solutions, our thinking can be more relaxed: 
we will not use nine of the ideas so it is safer to have some 
bad ones. Even if we then only find six ideas, we still have lots 
to work from. The chances of finding the best idea first time 
round are quite remote. The more alternatives we consider, 
the more likelihood of finding the best solution. 
Phrase brain-stimulating questions
In the activity on p. 194, you were asked to consider the 
use of a shoebox. This usually prompts one response, as 
the wording of the question suggests there is only one use. 
However, if asked, ‘How many uses can you think of?’ people 
usually generate many more responses. The way we phrase the 
question influences the way we approach a problem. 
Reflection: Multiple solutions
Jot down your responses to the following:
•• How many uses for a shoebox can you think of in three 
minutes?
•• For one problem that faces you on a regular basis, 
how many possible approaches to solving this can you 
generate in five minutes?
You probably found many more uses for a shoebox this time 
round. Answers people give include: carrying shoes; storage; 
for making a doll’s house or garage; a door stop; carrying 
things; hiding things; a sandwich box; stepping on when the 
floor is wet; cardboard; rattling things as a musical instrument; 
protection from the rain; holding CDs; a small bench or seat; 
for babies to tear up; holding pencils; a treasure box for 
children; to decorate as a gift box; sending something in the 
post; papier mâché; food for goats, etc.
204
Extend your thinking

•• ‘Why not … ask those residents what they want 
their town to be like?’
•• ‘Supposing … we ate ten small meals a day 
rather than any big ones?’
•• ‘Supposing … we drew our reasoning  
rather  than using words and numbers?’
•• ‘What if … witnesses were never visible  
to the accused?’
‘What if’ questions open up  
an area for exploration.
Reflection: Multiple solutions
•• How typical is it for you to push yourself to 
keep looking for more answers?
•• For which activities would it be most useful 
for you to adopt this kind of approach?
Just a minute
It may seem paradoxical, but it is often more 
productive to give yourself a short time limit to 
generate ideas. The brain can leap into action 
better if it knows it has a time limit. This does not 
usually work well if you leave things to the last 
minute, as you need to be relaxed. Approach the 
task in a ‘playful’ way. 
Try it. Give yourself just one minute to jot down 
everything you can think of to solve a problem you 
are working on. If you do not generate any useful 
ideas in that time, you have lost only a minute. 
Play with time  
If an activity is likely to take three hours, leave 
at least four hours to complete it, but aim to 
complete it in two. If you plan to allow more time 
than you need, you reduce the need to ‘get it 
right’ first time. Less stress can mean more creative 
thinking. You will also have more time to fine-
tune your answer and deal with emergencies. The 
time challenge creates just enough excitement 
to generate adrenalin to help with the task and 
reduce ‘sluggishness’. If you have too much time, 
it is easy to start too slowly or work at a slower 
pace. Set off at a good pace, aiming to finish at 
an earlier target time rather than your absolute 
deadline. 
‘What if questions …’
‘What if …’, Why not?’ or ‘Supposing … ?’ 
questions stimulate the imagination. The wording 
suggests an imaginary state that is safe to explore 
(it isn’t real so it can’t do any damage) but which 
might provide real answers. If you reach a point 
where your ideas feel stuck, use ‘what if …’ 
questions. For example:
•• ‘What if … we designed a model that worked on 
its side/upside down/in reverse …’?
Activity
What if …
Take one problem or issue that you are working 
on at present.
•• How many ‘what if…’ questions can you 
generate in three minutes? 
•• Select three of these.
•• How many responses can you brainstorm for 
each question in three minutes (each)?
•• Jot down any leads that arise from this 
activity. If there were none, take a walk or a 
break and then repeat the activity.
Generative thinking
There are many techniques that can be used 
to generate ideas and they are not difficult. An 
attitude of mind is the most important factor. Many 
people censor ideas at a very early stage if the ideas 
do not immediately seem sensible or useful.
Suspend judgement
Negative attitudes strangle creativity. We often 
dismiss the embryo of a good idea because we 
will not risk appearing foolish. Creativity, however, 
involves risks, mistakes, and ‘bad’ ideas as well as 
good. Only one in ten or twenty ideas will lead 
anywhere. To be creative requires the capacity to 
suggest ideas without immediately worrying about 
whether they are ‘right’ or what other people will 
say. 
205
Thinking outside the box

Nolan (2000) cites research which shows that 
when people’s ideas are judged or dismissed, 
the number of ideas that are put forward 
drops dramatically. We tend to become more 
cautious and anxious if our suggestions are 
not welcomed, adopting a ‘survival’ response 
to avoid being discounted again. 
Suspending judgement means:
•• encouraging others to suggest ideas
•• avoiding negative self-judgements such as  
‘I am not a creative person’
•• giving all ideas a chance to flow
•• being willing to express ‘bad’ or ‘silly’ ideas
•• noting all ideas in the early stages, without 
immediately evaluating them
•• being willing to look at all ideas for hidden 
potential
•• not assuming that a good idea holds all the 
answers
•• avoiding self-criticism if good ideas do not 
emerge quickly.
Activity
Self-censoring
•• How far do you censor your ideas to 
avoid appearing foolish?
•• What allows you to let your imagination 
work more freely?
Thinking with a ‘light touch’
Usually, when we work on problems, we 
use logical, sequential, ordered thinking. 
Sometimes this is referred to as ‘left brain’ 
thinking, although thinking is not strictly 
compartmentalised in that way. Logical 
thinking is a necessary part of arriving at a 
solution to most tasks. However, such thinking 
tends to run along tramlines, following 
predictable routes. If you do not already 
know the answer, the tramlines may not lead 
anywhere.
Creative thinking takes a lighter touch. It does 
not respond well to being forced. It works 
well with direction and a clear goal, but not if 
the mind is too rigidly focused on a particular 
outcome. It works when you ‘hover’ over an idea, or 
play with it, teasing out possibilities. It is rather like 
holding a small bird in the palm of your hand: if you 
hold the intention or goal or idea too tightly, you 
crush or suffocate it.
You can see this when you know the answer to a 
question but cannot remember it. The harder you try 
to capture it, the more the answer seems to elude 
you. Sometimes, playing with the idea or letting it 
rest works better than forcing it.
Other generative thinking techniques
Chapter 8 describes a range of other generative 
thinking strategies. These are useful for developing 
open reflection, but can be used more generally. 
These include:
•• Brainstorming
•• Free association
•• Day-dreaming
•• Free-writing
•• Drawing and doodling.

Synthesis is an important aspect of creativity. At a 
simple level, combining any two items creates a new 
entity.

Synthesis as play
The ‘Creating from two’ activity 
invites you to play with ideas. Most of 
the time, ideas do not lead to earth-
shattering discoveries. However, even 
apparently strange and silly ideas can 
lay down connections in the brain 
that one day might help you find the 
solution to a problem you do not yet 
know exists. 
When you have a problem to solve, 
you can organise your ideas in lists, 
chunks or diagrams and then chop 
these up and rearrange them in new 
combinations. You can write or draw 
each on a separate piece of paper and 
shuffle these around until you find the 
best combination.  
Play is about:
•• having a go
•• finding out new things
•• stimulating the mind
•• suspending worry about getting it 
right
•• allowing the mind to relax
•• experimenting
•• ‘letting go’
•• informality.
Play is unpredictable. You may be 
playing with one idea, looking for 
a solution, and find that you are 
suddenly struck by the answer to 
something completely different that 
has been puzzling you for a long time.
Reflection: On being 
playful
•• How comfortable do you feel 
about the idea of ‘playing’ with 
solutions to academic work?
•• Where do you allow yourself to 
be most playful?
Making connections
Expertise connections
In the synthesis activities above, you were, in effect, looking 
for and making connections. As you saw in earlier chapters, 
whenever you are working on a problem, the early stages are 
best spent in looking for connections and patterns between 
the current problem and:
•• any similar problems or situations you have encountered 
before
•• other problems you are working on or subjects you are 
studying
•• the skills needed and those you have already used elsewhere
•• your areas of personal expertise, even if these seem far 
removed.
Unlikely connections
It is logical to look for expertise connections. However, creative 
thinking can benefit from almost any set of connections. As 
the brain likes to be entertained, it will pay particular attention 
to what it finds curious or unfamiliar. It can use any change 
in your surroundings or experience to find unexpected 
connections with a problem you have been grappling with.  
You can assist the brain by searching out new perspectives in 
an active and interested way. Be prepared to let what you see, 
hear or experience change your views or inspire you. Some 
ways of doing this are listed below. Tick those that appeal to 
you most:
■
■walk a different way round the campus or town so that you 
are exposed to new patterns and layouts
■
■go into shops that you do not normally visit
■
■browse books that do not normally interest you
■
■speak to students from different subjects about themes in 
their study
■
■talk to people about their work and life experience
■
■make friends with people from different walks of life
■
■find opportunities to talk to or work with people of 
different ages
■
■take a bus journey; visit a new place
■
■do something you do not usually do: draw, dance, sing, 
act, run, yoga, learn a language
■
■look at an object from a new perspective: draw it upside 
down or with both hands at once
■
■listen to different music; draw or write with the hand you 
do not usually use
■
■use a different medium to describe a problem (paint, 
model clay, use graphics, sing it, dance it).

‘Personal planning is like … because …’

Networks
Networks follow the natural habit of the brain to look for 
patterns. Making notes in patterns to explore a problem 
is usually much quicker than writing in full sentences 
and paragraphs. You can use single words, phrases, 
images, symbols, or colour to indicate an idea. If you 
prefer, you can create ‘webs’ of links using images rather 
than words. Networks can be very liberating as there are 
few rules to follow. You can:
•• start anywhere on the paper
•• move from that focus point to anywhere else on the 
paper
•• generate other focus points where one set of ideas 
meets another set
•• write as much or as little as you like at each point (a 
word or short phrase usually works best; however, 
if your creative flow is stimulated by the process, go 
with the energy. You can return to the rest of the 
pattern once you have captured your idea)
•• take the ideas anywhere you like, developing new 
connections: it is not a ‘map’ of what already exists 
but a new structure that you are creating
•• let your mind take you for a walk
•• be focused and logical or ‘day-dream’ and ‘play’, 
depending on what suits.
Information contained in networks is easier to remember 
if you:
•• write in ‘joined-up writing’ (cursive script). It is easier 
for the brain to recall a continuous movement. Avoid 
capitals as these are harder for the brain to process
Reflection: Change 
perspective
Which of these will you try out? Which 
could you do today?
Activity
Change perspective
Add at least five other items to the 
‘Unlikely connections’ list on p. 208.
Choose at least three suggestions from 
that list above and apply these to a 
problem you are working on at present.
•• Jot down your observations of any 
changes in your thinking.
•• If there was no effect, choose three 
more suggestions and repeat the 
exercise.
•• How can you build some of these 
opportunities for making alternative 
connections into your daily life?
Search for ‘the missing links’
When breaking your routine with a new 
activity, act ‘as if’ the answers or the clues 
that you are looking for are in that book, 
object, music, conversation, journey, 
etc. Search out connections between the 
problem you are addressing and the new 
activity. Use language structures such as:
•• ‘This is similar to my problem because 
…’ or
•• ‘My problem is like this journey/statue/
house because they both …’
Do this 10 or 20 times. The least likely 
connection may prompt a useful solution. 
For example, doing a degree is like going 
for a walk because:
•• you can plan a specific route
•• you can select alternative routes
•• they can both take you to unexpected 
places
•• the end of both can seem a long way off
•• they both require some effort
•• they both stimulate the mind; etc.
209
Thinking outside the box

•• write so that you can read the writing without 
turning the page around
•• avoid using words such as no, never, isn’t,  
won’t, etc. as these are harder for the brain to 
process
•• use colour, symbols and shapes that make 
sections of the pattern stand out as interesting in 
their own right
•• take pauses to look for connections you might 
have missed
•• ask ‘what if …?’ questions about links that 
initially look unhelpful
•• work on the same problem more than once, 
designing a different network for each; on 
the second or third time, you may make very 
different sets of connections
•• for your last or working model, develop the 
pattern into an overall image or shape that 
you find easier to remember, such as a real 
object. Use a different shape for each topic. You 
then have only one ‘item’ for your short-term 
memory to recall (see the ‘Expert chess players’ 
section, p. 198).
There is an example of a network on p. 211.
Activity
Networks
•• Do something relaxing, such as going for a 
walk. 
•• Then take a large piece of paper and as many 
coloured pencils, pens, paints as you like.
•• Make a network for a problem or issue that 
you are working on at present. (See p. 198 
for an example.) Hold the idea quite lightly at 
first and let your pen play with ideas.
•• Follow the networks guidelines above.
•• When you are finished, look at the overall 
shape that your map makes. Look for a real 
object or recognisable shape (flower, house, 
wheelbarrow, table, castle, etc.) that you 
haven’t used before for this exercise. Draw in 
a few lines to outline the shape. 
•• Alternatively, use a distinctive image or style 
within the network to help you remember it.
•• Consider how else you could make this 
pattern more memorable so that you can 
recall the different sections easily.
Lateral thinking   
Much of the ground-breaking work on ‘thinking 
about thinking’ was developed by Dr Edward de 
Bono, who created the term ‘lateral thinking’. 
Dr de Bono encourages unconventional ways 
of looking at a problem, playing with the most 
unlikely solutions and then looking for an aspect 
that might actually work. Lateral thinking 
values humour, looking for opportunity in the 
‘accidental’, a willingness to do things in new 
ways, and exploring all ideas. 
For example, a De Bono statement might be that 
aeroplanes should land upside down, or that a car 
should have square wheels (De Bono, 2006). By 
working ‘as if …’ this were a serious proposition, 
this creates an opportunity for really examining all 
the taken-for-granted processes such as the tyre 
pressure, tyre threads, braking devices, puncture 
problems and so forth. In practice, real-life 
advances have been made through such forms of 
thinking. 
Activity
Crazy questions
•• Generate as many apparently ‘crazy’ ‘what  
if …’ questions as you can for a problem or 
issue you are working with at present. 
•• Select one of these and work through what 
would need to be changed in order to make 
this work. If possible, do this in a group. 
•• What light were you able to throw upon your 
problem by looking at it in a different way?
As if … it were them
You can also brainstorm solutions to a problem 
from the perspective of different people. This can 
generate a different set of responses from those 
you make ‘in your own voice’. Imagine yourself ‘in 
the shoes’ of somebody who you think would have 
sensible things to say about the problem.

Thinking outside the box

Activity
As if … they were solving the 
problem
•• Put the ‘sensible you’ aside for a moment. 
•• Select at least three people who you think would 
have an interesting perspective on a problem or 
issue you are addressing at present. You could 
include your lecturer or employer or somebody who 
inspires you, or a character from history that you 
find inspiring, etc.
•• Put yourself into their shoes. Imagine their voice 
talking about the issue. How would they move their 
hands, head and body? Would they smile or frown? 
How would they describe the problem?
•• What advice would they give you?
•• Jot down the ideas that emerge
Wear different hats
Dr de Bono (1996) devised a system of imaginary hats, 
each a different colour and representing a different 
approach to thinking. When you ‘wear’ each of these 
hats, you address an issue in a completely different way. 
In effect, you give your mind permission to let go of 
one way of thinking for a while, and explore a different 
approach. 
Activity
Design your creative thinking 
wardrobe
•• Imagine at least six hats that represent different 
types of people, occupations or approaches. If you 
prefer, use shoes, coats, chairs, etc.   
•• Describe or draw these if it helps you to imagine 
them clearly. 
•• Which kind of hats (or shoes, etc.) do you associate 
with: reflecting, planning, relating to others, 
analysing, finding information,  
writing, evaluating? Try these  
on when you perform  
these  
tasks!
Although De Bono has a specific series of hats, you could 
devise whatever set of hats works for you: a practical hat, 
a dreamer’s hat, a philosopher’s hat, a mechanic’s hat, a 
chef’s hat, a poet’s hat and so on. Alternatively, you could 
devise a set of coats or shoes that suggest different ways 
of working and thinking. 
Thinking upside down: sabotage 
It is usually easy to think catastrophically. 
Most of us are quite good at imagining all 
the things that could go wrong. Use this 
ability to good effect by playing with the 
idea of deliberately doing everything wrong. 
The more the wording is exaggerated, the 
more inviting this task can be.
For example:
•• What 20 things could I do, deliberately, 
to waste my time at college and have 
zero to show after three or four years of 
effort?  
•• What can I do so I feel more pressurised, 
irritated, thoroughly miserable, and miss 
all deadlines? 
•• What are all the things I could do and say 
in the seminar group to really inflame the 
situation and make everything thoroughly 
explosive?
•• How can I really work myself up into 
a stressful state so that I make the job 
interview as difficult as possible?
It is usually easy to generate a long list of 
items to answer such questions, attesting to 
our native wit in knowing what we should 
and should not do in most situations. Once 
the list is generated, create a second list 
alongside it, writing the positive solution 
to each potentially ‘catastrophic’ action. It 
can be remarkably easy to generate ground 
rules or an action plan using this technique. 
Activity
Sabotage
•• Select one problem that you 
are working on at present or a 
forthcoming event that is important to 
you.
•• Brainstorm all the ways you could 
make this a miserable flop. Pay 
attention to the details that could 
ensure it all goes horribly wrong.
•• Then go through your list and identify 
the positive action that you can take to 
avert each method of sabotage.
•• Your second list contains the basic 
ingredients of a constructive action 
plan.
212
Extend your thinking

of the ground for signs of a break or a change 
or something that doesn’t ‘fit’ or match. This 
‘glitch’ or ‘bump’ is a sign that something is worth 
investigating below the surface. The same is true 
for the creative process. It is the bits that seem 
to be getting in the way of finding a solution, 
the tricky bits, that lead to creative and sound 
solutions. 
When you hit a ‘bump’ or the narrative stops, it is 
important to return to the early-stage techniques 
again, brainstorming, free writing, discussing, 
developing networks of ideas. Focus on the area of 
difficulty. Then return to the narrative until you hit 
the next ‘bump’.   
Working with raw material   
Most of the strategies discussed above are ‘early-
stage’ techniques. They emphasise letting ideas 
flow. Structure, selection, criticism, censoring, 
and evaluation are not helpful to the process of 
generating early ideas. 
However, creative thinking does not stop here. The 
first stage develops a mass of material, which is like 
undifferentiated dough or clay. The next stage is to 
shape this into something that works. This means 
playing and working with your ideas:
•• Analyse:    What are the interesting aspects of 
each idea or suggestion?
•• Evaluate:    What could each suggestion 
contribute to an understanding of the issue or to 
finding a solution?
•• Synthesise:    Which aspects 
of each idea would work well 
together?
•• Spot gaps:    What is missing? 
For what else do you need to 
generate ideas and solutions?
•• Elaborate:    Add details to fill 
gaps and clarify ideas.
•• Select:    Which ideas do you 
want to take forward, and 
which do you want to leave to 
one side for now?
•• Organise:    Structure your ideas 
into a relevant pattern. This 
may be a diagram, flow-chart, 
model or piece of writing.
•• Plan:    Draw up an action plan 
to put your ideas into effect.
Develop the narrative
Write down how the whole solution or plan will 
work from start to finish, in order to provide your 
initial narrative. If you prefer, record yourself 
talking through your ideas. Producing the narrative 
can, itself, allow a different set of ideas to flow. 
Focus on the aim (to develop a solution) rather 
than on the quality of the writing at this stage. 
Creating the narrative may be a stop–start process. 
The halts are also part of the creative process. 
They usually indicate precisely where you need 
to dig deeper to ensure something will work 
well. Geologists, for example, look at the surface 
Creativity and risk taking
Behold the turtle. He makes progress only when he 
sticks his neck out. 
James Bryant Conant
Creative thinking requires risk taking. Most of 
us have been trained from a very early age to 
be logical, sensible, not to act the fool. It can be 
hard to work against that training and to remain 
confident in what we are doing.  It is easy to feel 
embarrassed or anxious about what others will 
think.  
213
Thinking outside the box

Creativity and emotional self-management
Nolan (2000) argues that an education aimed 
at developing innovative, creative thinkers must 
begin at the emotional level. If we do not have 
the emotional stamina to deal with other people’s 
opinions, then we divert our creative energies into 
protecting ourselves from being judged. We won’t 
be able to risk other people’s opinions of us. 
Creativity carries an element of anxiety and stress. 
Goleman (1995) has described the physiological 
reasons for this. It is a natural part of our biology to 
resist negative feedback. However, we can develop 
our mental attitudes so that we are less affected 
by fear of criticism. Goleman’s work suggests that 
the better we are able to manage our anxiety, 
the more we can think freely and creatively (see 
Chapter 4).
Calculated risks
The creative risks we take may not pay off. In the 
early stages of generating ideas, it is a good idea to 
take risks. At this point, ideas are only on paper. 
As you move towards developing an idea, costs 
come into play. There may be costs in terms of 
time, money, resources, the environment, or 
personal prestige. It is then important to limit the 
risks, without necessarily dismissing the possibility 
of taking a risk. This means considering such issues 
as:
•• The consequences of a course of action: who 
will be affected; what are the costs to all parties?
•• What are the possible benefits? Who will gain? 
How significant are the advantages compared 
with the disadvantages? 
•• What are the chances of success?
•• Can you really afford the solution?
•• Is the risk worth it?
•• Can you deal with the consequences if it does 
not work?
Not all risks are worth it. Some will pay off; others 
will not. You need to be sure that you and all 
the affected parties can cope emotionally and 
financially with the consequences if things do not 
work out as hoped.
Taking responsibility
Because creativity involves risk taking, it also 
involves taking responsibility for one’s own actions. 
This means:
•• thinking through the needs and interests of all 
parties, including yourself
•• being able to accept the consequences of your 
own actions
•• planning safety nets where necessary, so that 
other people do not get hurt
•• being aware of legal and ethical responsibilities.
If you are being creative in the way you approach 
an essay or experiment, this may simply mean 
being prepared to accept a low mark if the tutor 
does not agree that your novel ideas meet the 
requirements of the assignment. Check what 
possibilities are open to you, especially if you really 
need to get a high mark. On the other hand, you 
may wish to push the boundaries, no matter what 
the cost. That is your decision.
If, on the other hand, you are designing products 
for the public or making decisions that affect 
people’s livelihoods, you need to consider a wider 
range of issues that will become your responsibility, 
such as:
•• health and safety requirements
•• legal requirements
•• financial issues 
•• ethical considerations.

Closing comments
This chapter emphasises that creativity is both a 
state of mind and a way of developing the mind. 
Creativity is accessible to everybody. Strategies 
which develop creativity require relaxation, 
playfulness, a light touch, and enjoyment in 
order to be most effective. Our level of creativity, 
and hence our ability to be a creative problem-
solver, will be affected by our attitudes and 
beliefs, our sense of humour, our emotional 
self-management, our health and well-being. 
Creativity does remind us that mind and body 
function as an integrated whole.  
Creative thinking strategies are unpredictable. 
They can be time-consuming. It is hard to say 
how long ‘thinking’ or creativity will take.  When 
work is left until the day before a deadline, 
there is not time for the brain to tease out the 
connections between things, and for you to 
mull over possibilities. It is also harder to stay 
relaxed and open to creative possibilities when a 
deadline is looming.  
On the other hand, creative thinking may lead 
to answers in a small fraction of the time taken 
by logical, analytical thinking. Time spent in 
play, musing, synthesis and making connections 
can lead to innovatory ways of seeing and 
thinking.

The art of reflection
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• understand what is meant by ‘reflection’ 
•• understand the importance of reflection to evaluating and improving personal performance 
•• identify different kinds of reflection for different purposes
•• develop methods for improving your reflective skills
•• devise your own model for reflection
•• consider how to communicate the results of your reflection to other people.
Introduction
If you have a fleck of bright green paint between 
your eyes, or egg on your chin, you cannot see 
them as they are too close to your eyes to be 
visible to them. Without a mirror or a comment 
from other people, you could pretend there was 
nothing to see. This won’t, of course, prevent 
others from seeing what you cannot. 
Similarly, we are usually too close to ourselves to 
be aware of the things we most need to know. 
We can easily fail to recognise what may be very 
evident to other people. Fortunately, we can stand 
back occasionally and reflect about such things 
as our aims, responses, feelings and performance. 
Well-developed skills in reflection can help us to: 
•• gain a more in-depth and honest picture of 
ourselves
•• become more aware of our hidden motivations, 
our thinking styles, and of how we appear to 
other people
•• develop a better understanding of what affects 
our own performance and progress
•• develop our insight and judgements
•• gain more control over our own thoughts, 
emotions, responses and behaviour so that we 
are in a better position to achieve what we want 
to achieve.
Reflection in everyday life  
Reflection is a natural activity. To a greater or 
lesser extent, we all spend time going back over 
what we have said or done, or what we wish we 
had said and done. Often, reflection accompanies 
hindsight: we realise long after an event how 
things might have been different, or how some 
small event was more significant than we realised. 
This is reflected in everyday expressions:
•• ‘If only I had known then what I know  
now …’
•• ‘With hindsight, I realise …’
•• ‘I could never have imagined that doing X 
would result in Y …’
•• ‘Now I realise where this leads, I wouldn’t do it 
again …’
•• ‘If I had the chance, I would do it all over again.’
•• ‘It was worth it/it wasn’t worth it/it was worth 
the risk.’
•• I wish I had …’
217
The art of reflection

In other words, we review what was said or done, 
weighing up the consequences and considering 
what the alternatives might have been. We 
evaluate whether we would do things differently if 
given the chance again or whether we were right 
first time.
Reflection as challenge
The reflective process is challenging. We do not 
always like to discover the truth about ourselves: 
it can be embarrassing to find we have walked 
around for several hours with a dab of egg yolk 
on our chin. We would rather believe it wasn’t 
there or that nobody could see it. The same is true 
of the reflective process. When it works well, we 
discover things that make us feel uncomfortable. 
Our natural reaction is to pretend they do not 
really matter, or to look for an excuse, or to blame 
someone else. The things we most need to know 
can be the hardest to hear. 
It takes time and practice for people to develop 
good reflective skills. Don’t be discouraged if you 
think reflection does not come 
naturally to you. This book 
structures reflection on a 
wide range of issues. If 
you have undertaken 
some of the reflections 
and activities, then 
you will already be 
developing a sense of 
what is involved.
Is reflection important? 
At university level, you need to take responsibility 
for your own progress. Students are expected 
to develop into independent thinkers, capable 
of evaluating their own performance, drawing 
conclusions about what they did well and how 
to improve. Your success will depend, to a large 
extent, on yourself.
You need to be confident  in your own judgements 
of your work. The feedback you receive from tutors 
and other students gives you a rare opportunity to 
compare your own evaluations with those of other 
people.  
Your evaluations should be based upon sound 
criteria rather than a general feeling that you 
are right and others wrong. Consider the 
differences between your own evaluations and 
the feedback you receive from others: these 
may hold important clues about how to achieve 
better grades and to improve your performance 
generally. 
Reflection and Personal 
Development Planning 
All British universities are required to 
provide personal development planning 
(PDP) for students as a ‘structured 
process of reflection’. By the time you 
leave university, you are expected to 
know how to use structured reflection to 
understand:
•• yourself, your motivations, choices and 
behaviours 
•• what you want to achieve
•• how to plan, follow through, review 
and evaluate a course of action 
•• how your responses and performance 
affect other people
•• how to take action to improve your 
work or learning to the benefit of 
yourself and/or others.

The ‘reflective 
practitioner’ 
Many occupations now 
require a ‘reflective 
practitioner’ approach. This 
is built into the work cycle in 
some way, such as through 
staff reviews or appraisal. 
Typically, this means taking 
personal responsibility for:
•• your continuing 
professional development 
(CPD)
•• evaluating your personal 
experience, strengths, 
qualities and skills
•• identifying ways of using 
your strengths well, within 
your professional area
•• identifying personal 
limitations and areas 
that could be improved 
through training, practice 
or informal learning
•• recognising the effects 
of your own responses 
and behaviour and taking 
responsibility for these
•• making useful 
contributions to team 
discussions
•• improving individual and 
team performance
•• identifying your own 
contribution to the results 
of a task, project or 
outcome.
Your current programme may 
include reflective activity. 
If not, the self-evaluation 
questionnaire on p. 221 can 
help you to decide where you 
need to work next.
What is ‘reflection’?
Reflection is a type of thinking. It is associated with deep thought 
aimed at better understanding. It includes a mixture of elements, such 
as: 
1  Making sense of experience
It is important to note the difference between ‘experience’ and 
‘learning’. Experience can be the basis for learning and development. 
However, just because we have been through an experience it does 
not mean we have learnt all there is to learn about it – or even that 
we have learnt anything at all. Reflection is an important part of 
the learning experience. It is where we analyse experience, actively 
attempting to ‘make sense’ or find the meaning in it.   
2  ‘Standing back’
By ‘standing back’, we gain a better view or perspective of an 
experience, issue or action. It is not always easy to reflect when caught 
up in the midst of activity.
3  Repetition
Reflection involves ‘going over’ something, perhaps even several times, 
in order to look at it critically from several points of view or to check 
nothing has been missed.
4  Deeper honesty
Reflection is associated with a striving after the truth. It is through 
reflection that we can come to acknowledge things we find difficult to 
admit in the normal course of events.
5  ‘Weighing up’
Reflection involves a sense of even-handed judgement and critical 
evaluation – it usually involves ‘weighing things in the balance’, taking 
all things into account rather than just the most obvious.
6  Clarity
Reflection can bring greater clarity, as though seeing things reflected 
back in a mirror. This can be useful at any stage in the process of 
devising, carrying out or reviewing activities. 
7  Understanding
Reflection is associated with opening up to learning and understanding 
at a deeper level, including gaining insight into theories and concepts 
that are difficult to access by other means. 
8  Making judgements
Reflection involves an element of making judgements and drawing 
conclusions.

Basic steps for reflection
If you are new to reflection, the following steps 
outline some basic features of reflection to help 
you get started. 
•• Small regular bites    Keep a regular journal, 
log or blog. Write something in this at regular 
intervals. Little and often is better at first, so 
that you develop the habit of reflection. Seven 
minutes every weekday evening is all that is 
needed. Alternatively, you may prefer to take 
half an hour once or twice a week. 
•• Be specific    Choose a particular incident or a 
feature of your day or week to focus on for each 
entry. This will develop your critical thinking 
better than writing on a superficial basis about 
your whole day.
•• Aim at improvement    Choose something 
that was difficult or ‘sticky’ during your day. 
Think through what gave rise to the problem. 
Consider how you might achieve a better 
outcome next time. Alternatively, spot the things 
that went unexpectedly well, and consider why 
that might have been the case. 
•• Focus on yourself    Avoid using reflection as a 
way of blaming and taking out anger on others, 
even if you feel they deserve it. Focus on your 
own role, and how you can make a similar 
situation more manageable next time. This helps 
to take you forward.
•• Use prompts    Select an activity from the book 
and use this to structure your reflection. See 
pages 235–8 on the ‘Core Model for Reflection’, 
for ideas for prompt questions. 
•• Critical rather than descriptive writing    Reflection 
involves critical, analytical thinking. Weigh 
up the strengths and weaknesses, costs and 
benefits, decisions and outcomes. These are 
thinking skills required for most academic work. 
Avoid descriptive writing that simply recites 
what happened, or who said what, unless there 
are particular reasons for doing this as part of 
your course. For more about critical thinking, 
see Cottrell (2011).
•• Have a purpose    Reflection should be directed to 
a purpose. It is better to write a short entry that 
is meaningful than a long one which is simply 
pages of description. Find a topic that is useful 
to you. What do you most need to improve? 
What do you need to think through?
•• Find the right questions    Consider the right 
questions for structuring your reflection. It is 
easier, when you start out, to answer questions 
that give shape to your thinking. See p. 223. 
•• Review    After a few weeks, read back over your 
entries. Look for the main themes in what you 
have written and consider the significance of 
these for you. Decide what action to take next.
Example
Brief critical entry aimed at improving performance
How good were my people skills today?
Today was useful as I realised I am still interrupting people when they are talking.  I cut right across Mary today 
during the seminar break.  I realise this was not very skilful or considerate. Mary looked annoyed. I just ignored this 
at the time because I was embarrassed. It would have been better to have apologised as soon as I realised. I will 
next session. I have to take more care not to burst in when other people are talking. Maybe I could ask Joe and Ali 
to point it out to me for a while so I notice it more.
Descriptive entry
The following is an example of poor reflection. It simply describes what happens and focuses on other people. 
The writer doesn’t take personal responsibility for actions or plan to improve performance. It doesn’t take the 
writer forward.
In the seminar break today, Mary was talking and I wanted to say something. She had been talking for a few 
minutes already and I hadn’t said anything. I was interested in what she was saying but then just interrupted. It 
was a simple mistake. I didn’t mean to upset her. Mary carried on talking for a moment and then decided to stop. 
She looked angry. Everybody just looked at me as if I was in the wrong. I didn’t even talk for very long.  Peter said I 
had an interesting point. Then we went back in the seminar and Mary avoided looking at me all the way through.

Approaches to structured 
refl ection
There are many ways of approaching 
refl ection and you are unlikely to need 
them all .  Browse through the chapter and 
see which activities most appeal or are 
most useful to you at present . The types of 
refl ection introduced below are: 
 • question-based refl ection
 • open refl ection
 • synthetic refl ection
 • developmental refl ection
 • evaluative refl ection .
As you will see, there are overlaps and 
connections between these different types 
of refl ection . Each type may be useful for 
a different task or for different stages of a 
task . As you develop your refl ective ability, 
you will fi nd that you begin to move quite 
easily between these different methods to 
suit the task in hand . Your tutors may also 
be able to guide you about the types of 
refl ective activity that are most suitable for 
your subject .
Question-based refl ection 
Question-based refl ection is a highly 
structured form of refl ection; it is used 
extensively throughout this book . The 
method is relatively simple . Generally, a 
series of questions is given under a set of 
headings . Question-based refl ection has a 
number of advantages:
 • it prompts and guides you through the 
refl ective process
 • it helps ensure you don’t miss out any 
essential elements
 • it can give shape and direction to the 
subject of refl ection, reducing vague 
discussion and ‘waffl e’
 • it enables everyone in a group to refl ect 
on the same set of issues in a particular 
way in order to make direct comparisons 
on specifi c issues
 • questions increase motivation to produce 
a response and can sharpen thinking . 
Who does it suit?
Question-based refl ection is associated with analytical, 
serial thinking . It tends to suit people who like or need 
to work in a logical, ordered or controlled way, and who 
appreciate some external direction . 
But why did I … ?
Could I have … ?
At what point did … ?

Example
Question-based refl ection
Question
How did I make use of feedback for my course-work?
Response
I read through it, I accepted most of it, I identifi ed 
themes that need to be addressed. 
Question
Did I make the best use of the feedback I received on my 
report?
Response
At the time I thought I had made good use of the 
feedback. I did read it and I set myself priorities for 
action. However, looking back, I don’t think I took it 
seriously enough. I wondered if the tutor had been too 
harsh on me, so when I did my essay for the next tutor, 
I didn’t really follow through on the advice I had been 
given. I then got some of the same feedback again. I 
realise I ignored my own priorities.
Question
How can I make more effective use of feedback?
Response
I need to set myself a realistic target. I tried to take 
on too many changes at once last time and then got 
discouraged. I need to speak to my tutor to work out 
one or two changes that would make the most impact. 
Basically, I need to be more focused and accept that I 
cannot change everything at once.

The art of refl ection

Open reflection
Open reflection methods encourage you to ‘let 
go’ of some concentration, and ‘go with the 
flow’ rather than trying to control the process too 
tightly. Open reflection can seem ‘unstructured’. 
However, there is usually a structure of some kind 
to the method, such as working from prompts, 
working through several stages in a process or 
following semi-formal rules. 
The benefits of open reflection are:
•• it makes it easier to get started on a task as it 
helps you to generate thoughts and ideas
•• it allows the imagination free rein so that a 
relatively uncensored set of associations can be 
formed
•• unexpected ideas may emerge, which can be 
energising and exciting
•• it can be more personally 
relevant than working through 
questions set by somebody else. 
Open reflection is good for 
generating ideas, but not always 
for structuring and making 
sense of them. It can help to 
combine open reflection with 
other methods to structure your 
thoughts effectively and make 
meaning from experience. 
This method of reflection suits 
people who like to work in organic 
ways, and who appreciate things 
evolving in new or original ways. 
Open reflection can be conducted 
in an orchestrated way (a tutor 
guides the process) or can be 
personally controlled.
The various methods of open reflection are 
discussed below.
Brainstorming
Brainstorming is a very simple and quick 
technique. Take a large piece of paper and a pen. 
Write the problem or question down somewhere 
on the paper – the centre is often a useful place 
but you can choose wherever suits you. Write 
down every idea or solution that comes into your 
head. At this stage, do not evaluate or judge what 
emerges – just let the ideas flow. 
Brainstorming is one of the most widely used 
techniques for generating ideas quickly. You can 
use it to start the process of reflection, as well as 
for writing essays or other assignments.
Activity
Setting questions
Select an activity that you engage in regularly or you wish to improve.
In your reflective journal, jot down a list of at least ten questions to structure your reflection 
about your performance.
•• Answer your questions.
•• What did you find out about your performance by questioning it in this way?
224
Extend your thinking

Activity
Brainstorming
•• Select a topic that you need to think about 
this week – or brainstorm ideas about an ideal 
birthday gift for someone you know. 
•• Write the topic somewhere on the paper. 
•• Give yourself five minutes to jot down as 
many ideas as you can. 
•• Avoid judging your ideas as you go along; 
just write down whatever comes into your 
mind.
•• Once you have finished the brainstorm, 
consider each suggestion in turn. Cross out 
the least useful. If other ideas emerge as you 
do this, jot them down for consideration too.
Discussion
Discussion can be a very valuable form of 
reflection. It has the advantage of offering multiple 
perspectives. Paired or group discussions may raise 
challenging questions that you, as an individual, 
may wish to avoid. Such questions are often the 
ones we need most to address – so discussion-
based reflection can keep you on your toes. 
Discussion, unless strongly steered, can tend to 
drift in many directions. It is more creative if only a 
limited number of prompt questions or statements 
are used. This allows the discussion to wander 
broadly over the topic. For a more controlled 
discussion, set more questions and time limits for 
responses. If the discussion veers away from the 
agenda, don’t dismiss the tangents straight away. 
The tangents may be giving you important clues 
about the target subject, or about how well the 
group is working together, or how you might 
approach a particular problem.
Day-dreaming
Without forcing the issue, let your mind drift over 
the target subject. Day-dreaming about the target 
subject is more likely to occur if we give the subject 
serious and detailed consideration, and then do 
something very different for a while. Day-dreaming 
is not something that can be forced, but it can be 
encouraged and nurtured. Keep pen and paper, a 
digital recorder or a lap-top computer nearby to 
capture ideas as they occur. Reflections that arise 
in this way are easy to forget. Sometimes, there 
is a natural movement from this more relaxed 
reflection towards more analytical questioning, as 
you become aware of what you are discovering.  
Networks
These are useful for letting your mind develop an 
idea in a visual way that follows the way the brain 
works. See page 211 for details.
Free-writing
Writing as a reflective tool is different from writing 
intended for an audience or tutors. Its aim is to 
stimulate thinking, not to communicate a message 
to others. This means that the writing may look, 
sound and flow differently from other writing that 
you do. Your method will be quite different from 
any other person’s. You may just pick up the pen 
and write; you may write words and phrases rather 
than sentences; you may scribble and draw as you 
write; you may write in verse. In other words, you 
assess the value of this writing for yourself, in terms 
of whether it helps you to reflect and achieve your 
own aims.
Activity
Free-writing
Choose a subject that you want to think about 
this week. This may be the same as one you 
considered for a previous activity.
•• Give yourself ten minutes to write down, as 
fast as you can, any thoughts that come into 
your mind on this subject.
•• Unlike brainstorms, where you just jot down 
any phrase, for free-writing aim to link the 
thoughts to some extent. Consider how one 
idea connects to others. Monitor, lightly, 
where your thoughts are going. As in the 
example above, this does not have to be a 
very developed process. 
•• When you have finished, read through what 
you have written. Look for one key theme or 
idea. Highlight or underline this.
•• Give yourself a few minutes to free-write on 
only that one theme.
•• Then highlight a second theme and free-write 
on that.
•• You will find that your ideas on the subject 
are starting to develop.
225
The art of reflection

Caricatures, cartoons, paintings or other graphic 
means may be your preferred methods for 
reflection, for exploring past actions or events and 
for getting a feel for their meaning.
Activity
Doodle
•• Select a new topic for reflection.  
•• Take a piece of paper and scribble in the 
middle. 
•• Either doodle as you think about the subject 
or draw a picture or diagram of it. The 
image does not have to be of good quality: 
it is simply a tool to distract you from 
concentrating too hard on the topic. 
•• If ideas emerge that you want to jot down or 
develop, then let yourself do so.
•• After you have finished, consider how far you 
find this method suits your learning style.
Generative thinking
The strategies suggested above are associated 
with generative thinking styles. The strategies and 
approaches developed in Chapter 7, ‘Thinking 
outside the box’, can support the development of 
this way of working.
Synthetic reflection
Synthetic reflection involves a ‘bringing together’ 
or a ‘synthesising’ of different aspects and 
perspectives. It is useful for giving shape to a series 
of reflections or making sense of earlier stages of 
reflection.  It helps you find the meaning behind 
your reflections, thoughts and actions. It also 
stimulates creative thinking. 
Advantages of synthetic reflection
Synthetic reflection is useful for:
•• seeing links and connections
•• gaining a sense of the ‘bigger picture’
•• gaining a concrete overview from where to 
begin more detailed analysis
•• giving shape or structure to the reflective 
process
•• drawing reflections together into a coherent 
whole.
Reflective free-writing, like other free-writing, will 
probably take more than one draft:
•• a draft that generates ideas
•• a draft that explores some issues in more detail, 
going off at tangents and with more details
•• later drafts with more structure, as you begin to 
draw conclusions from your reflection and write 
them for others to read.
Example
Reflective free-writing 
A good day. Enjoyed the session. Made 
contributions. Really liked it when we saw video 
and discussed the video. I got very involved in 
the debate, which surprised me. I hadn’t thought 
I felt so strongly. Not sure why I do. Why do I? I 
don’t like the design of the bridge. Ugly. Not that 
though. More … Reminds me of history lessons 
more than engineering. Hated history at school. 
Maybe not a good reason for me to respond to a 
design now. Or maybe it is. Maybe other people 
will feel the same way. What else influences 
my responses apart from history lessons? I like 
sculptured surfaces …
The above example may not make 
much sense to you, but it did to 
the person who wrote it. He knew 
the issue he was trying to explore 
and this was just his first step. Try 
for yourself the free-writing activity 
on page 225.
Drawing and doodling
Drawing and doodling can be used 
to distract you from controlling 
your thought processes too closely, 
allowing your mind to 
take you where it wishes. 
You may find that the 
drawing and the reflection 
have little in common. 
On the other hand, you 
may wish to analyse your 
drawings for clues about how 
your mind is working. You could 
need to check whether your 
interpretation made sense when 
weighed against other evidence. 
226
Extend your thinking

Synthetic reflection is associated with gestalt, 
holistic, or ‘right-brain’ thinking. It suits 
people who like to spot clues, solve puzzles or 
put things together into new forms. Artistic 
endeavour and synthetic processes are closely 
associated. Linking can be made in logical or 
creative ways, so synthetic reflection can suit 
those who like order and those who like to work 
organically. The importance of developing these 
modes of thinking is highlighted in Chapter 7, 
‘Thinking outside the box’.
As synthetic reflection helps to draw things 
together, it can be used to follow up reflection 
based on free writing or discussion.
Look for links and themes
Synthetic reflection is an active type of 
reflection. You are looking for links, connections 
and leads in material you have already 
produced. Use it to search out hidden themes 
that are there on the page but which you may 
not yet have noticed. Going over the material, 
re-writing it, colouring it, highlighting it, 
organising it, illustrating it, will help you to 
focus on each theme. 
Activity
Synthesis
•• Select one theme that you began to 
explore in a previous activity.
•• Identify themes and links in your earlier 
reflections.
•• Organise your thoughts so that the themes 
and links stand out clearly.
Developmental reflection
Whilst any method of reflection can assist the 
process of personal development, the following 
methods focus specifically on understanding and 
improving your performance and achievement.  
Activity
Developmental reflection
•• If you have not done so already, complete 
the activities on p. 221 to identify your 
developmental priorities.
In your reflective journal, note down your 
thoughts about one of your priorities. 
For example, you may find it useful to 
consider some of the following questions:
•• What made you select this as a priority? What 
is really the key issue for you? 
•• What is the goal? What do you hope to gain 
by developing this area?
•• How does this contribute to achieving your 
long-term or short-term goals?
•• What is the problem?
•• What have you tried already? How successful 
was this?
•• What will you do next?
•• What would be a realistic time-scale to 
address this successfully? 
•• Who else would benefit if you addressed this 
priority?
•• What might you do to sabotage your success 
in achieving this?
•• What are your feelings about this priority? 
What emotions, if any, does it bring up for 
you?
Monitoring performance
You may be asked to keep a log, blog or 
journal as part of your course. Even if this is 
not a requirement, it is a useful practice. Many 
employers require logs to be kept of actions taken, 
along with the rationale and outcomes. These may 
be used in team meetings or staff reviews.

The art of reflection

Example
Transferring skills 1: communication
I have been working with children in a local school, helping 
them with their mathematics. The main developmental 
points for me were in taking responsibility for others and in 
using ‘plain English’. However, I am also much better now 
at organising information so other people can use it.
The teacher pointed out that when I first started at the 
school, I launched straight in and tried to finish as much of 
the worksheet as I could. Now, I structure the work much 
better, so the children know what they are learning. This is 
partly good communication. However, I am also developing 
skills in structuring information. I look much more closely at 
how to break down instructions into small chunks that the 
children can take in at once.  They don’t like it if I have to 
repeat instructions. 
I have found that this is useful when talking to adults 
too. In my part time job, I now do this when giving 
guidance on technical problems. I find I don’t have to 
go over information so many times. This way of thinking 
seems to be helping me to plan and structure my written 
assignments. My tutor says I write more clearly.
It is worth giving time and thought to what we have 
achieved in any one situation and considering its 
applicability to other situations. The self-knowledge gained 
may help us later in new situations.
Example
Transferring skills 2: academic skills
I was very anxious about writing an essay as I hadn’t 
written one before. My programme mainly uses report 
writing. Reports are very structured whereas I couldn’t see 
how essays fitted together.
I spoke to a third-year student who talked me through 
the process. He pointed out that the discussion part of 
my reports is quite like an essay. If I take out the different 
sections of the report, such as the method and results 
sections, and remove all headings and tables, I have the 
core of an essay already.
I find it easier to write the main part of an essay as if I was 
writing a report. I use headings and write a paragraph 
under each of these. This helps me see the structure of my 
writing. I have noticed I need to check my paragraphs are 
linked because sections of essays flow into each other more 
than sections of reports. I then remove the headings when I 
am ready to hand in the essay.
Example
Monitoring performance
Project Group: reflection
20th February 
I chaired the project group meeting 
again today. This went better than last 
time. I was able to keep the group to the 
agenda. Unlike last time, this time I did 
not let people just bring up new topics 
as they felt like it. I was quite tough, for 
me. I summarised points well and the 
feedback on this was good. 
Unfortunately, the meeting still ran over 
time. I did find it difficult to break in to 
interrupt the flow when Carla and Ian 
started arguing. I am not sure whether I 
should speak to them before the meeting, 
or whether I should just cut across them, 
which might seem rude. I am worried 
because they speak loudly and it would 
look bad if nobody could hear me when 
I try to interrupt. Because I didn’t keep 
these two in check, we ran over time. 
Time-keeping looks like my big challenge, 
but really the issue is about knowing 
how to interrupt people. This is my next 
priority. I have arranged to speak about 
this to my tutor. 
Transferable skills 
Chapter 2 demonstrated that expertise 
can be used in diverse contexts. However, 
skills do not transfer automatically. Skills 
are likely to be ‘transferable’ only if we:
•• identify the range of skills involved in an 
activity. It is easy to overlook the wide 
range of sub-skills that are integrated 
even into everyday experience
•• make specific attempts to draw parallels 
between one activity and another, 
searching out the comparisons
•• are able to see how one situation is 
similar to the other. If we cannot see 
those parallels, then we may believe 
ourselves incapable of dealing with 
situations that are well within our actual 
competence.  (Butterworth, 1992)

Reflection: Spotting your skills
In your reflective journal, write for a few minutes about any 
one new activity that you have undertaken recently. Consider 
things such as: 
•• What skills did you already have that you used for the new 
activity?
•• Were there any ways you adapted your usual ways of 
thinking or doing to help you with the new task?
•• Did you discover anything about yourself by doing 
something new?
Reflecting on your academic development 
Take time to stand back and look at the big picture regarding 
your academic development. Consider:
•• Are you sufficiently motivated to achieve well academically? 
How could you increase your motivation? 
•• How coherent are the choices you are making for options or 
electives? How will these choices help you achieve your longer-
term ambitions?
•• Are your choices giving you a strong enough specialist base?
•• Will your choices make you stand out as distinctive with 
interests and capabilities beyond your subject specialism?
•• What are the most stimulating aspects of your current 
learning? 
•• What is blocking your progress in any area? Are your study 
strategies still relevant or do they need to be revised?
Example
Academic choices
I wanted to study nothing but chemistry as that interested me 
most but I am concerned that this will look boring when I go for 
jobs. I am also interested in travelling abroad.  I couldn’t see how 
the two could fit together as I imagined myself in a large British 
factory near where I grew up.
The Careers Service showed me some case studies of career paths 
that people from my programme had taken, and I was struck by 
the opportunities that are available through some big companies 
for working in international branches.  I am not sure yet whether 
to take a language, which I could start from scratch. This would 
make it easier to get picked for a placement abroad in the future. 
However, a specialist IT option might be more useful.  
I also need to look at the opportunities open to me if I take a 
subsidiary in a subject such as health science or nutrition. I have 
put some time aside next Thursday to look through materials in 
the Careers Service library.
You could reflect on differences in 
your performance from one topic 
or option to another. For example, 
you may experience a sudden drop 
or increase in your marks, or find 
you are more successful in some 
areas than others. You can begin 
to investigate this by techniques 
such as:
•• listing how you approach each 
subject differently
•• free writing about your attitudes 
or approaches to each subject
•• brainstorming differences 
between the topics and how you 
will manage these. 
Example
Reflection on assignments
I spent a long time on my last 
assignment and was disappointed 
with the marks. This time I spent 
less time and yet my mark was 
better. It seems to me the main 
difference is that I really thought 
a lot about what the question 
meant this time. All of my work 
was very focused on addressing 
the title. It felt like I really knew 
what I was doing – so it took less 
time. I spent more time, though, 
just working out my initial plans. I 
think I have made a breakthrough 
in the way I go about my 
assignments.
What I need now is to know 
how to work out what is needed 
for my land-surveying option. I 
can’t really see how to work out 
the problems in the same way. I 
suppose I haven’t actually tried 
applying my ‘breakthrough’ 
method to surveying yet, so I 
don’t know if it will work or not.  
229
The art of reflection

Reflecting on your personal development
Reflection isn’t useful only for academic or work-related 
contexts. You can use it to look hard at any area of your 
personal development. For example:
•• Are your life ambitions changing in any way?
•• Are your values and beliefs undergoing any changes? What 
is influencing such change?
•• Are you giving sufficient time to friends and family?
•• How are you taking care of your health?
•• What are you doing to manage stress?
•• What are you doing to ensure a good ‘work/life balance’? 
Do you get time to enjoy yourself without undermining 
your work and study?
Example
Personal development
I have been working long hours at college and at work 
recently. I added this up to 65 hours last week. I was 
supposed to go to my brother’s birthday party but in the end 
had to work an extra shift as it was double pay. This was 
good for the money, but my family was disappointed. I’m not 
getting the right balance. 
I need clear breaks with no work or study. I have to start 
planning out my time so I get time to rest and enjoy myself 
occasionally. Just stop. I have noticed that I am not sleeping 
well. It would be better for me to start earlier and then finish 
off earlier in the evening. Studying late just keeps me awake 
at night, rattling it all round in my head.
I am also neglecting my interest in music. I would really like 
to spend more time listening to recent releases. I could do this 
by …
Evaluative reflection
Questionnaires and checklists
Self-evaluation questionnaires are useful starting points for 
self-evaluation:
•• the questions help to define the field, indicating the areas 
that are important to consider further
•• the questionnaire can be used in a ‘before’ and ‘after’ way, 
enabling more precise comparisons between answers given 
at different times
•• it is often difficult to answer a questionnaire with a straight 
‘yes’ or ‘no’. Those questions that resist easy answers 
prompt longer answers, indicating what the real issues 
might be for you
•• questionnaires are usually good starting points. They 
are not particularly useful if used in isolation from other 
reflective methods.
Reflecting on your professional 
development
Take time occasionally to consider 
your short- and long-term professional 
development. 
•• What skills are you developing? Are 
there obvious gaps in your profile 
of skills and experience? Will these 
matter when you apply for jobs?
•• Are your programme choices right for 
the type of career you have in mind?
•• Are you focusing too much on study 
at the expense of other experience 
which would help your career?
•• Are you making the best use of all that 
university has to offer to develop your 
skills, experience and CV?
•• Is there some kind of work experience 
you could undertake to develop your 
people skills in the workplace?
•• Are you making good (and early) 
use of the Careers Service and its 
resources?
•• Would it be useful to have a mentor 
from the area you are considering for 
a career?
Example
Professional development
I have noticed that many job adverts 
require good team-building skills. 
There is not much opportunity on this 
programme to work in teams. I am 
worried that this will be a weak point 
when I come to apply for jobs. I have 
heard that there are volunteer activities 
being co-ordinated on campus and I will 
follow this up this week. Some of that 
might involve team work. 
Another alternative might be to study 
an elective that includes team work in 
its skills profile. Unfortunately, I haven’t 
found one that interests me. I might 
have to choose one that is not especially 
interesting. I would rather work in a 
team that was involved in real-life 
activities rather than study, as I think 
employers would prefer that …

Critical event
One good way of finding 
out more about yourself 
is through an in-depth 
analysis of a single event. 
To begin with, select an 
occasion that was of some 
importance to you such 
as: 
•• the first time you … 
•• the last time you … 
•• a very difficult occasion
•• a test of your values
•• a test of your abilities
•• a test of your will-
power
•• a test of character
•• a turning point in your 
life
•• a time you realised 
something unexpected 
about yourself or other 
people.
If you undertake this 
exercise several times you 
have valuable materials 
for reflecting on your 
performance. Consider:
•• What themes emerge?
•• What noticeable 
areas of improvement 
are there in your 
performance over time?
•• What areas did you 
highlight for further 
action that you did 
not then attend to? 
What do you think is 
preventing you from 
doing so?
Example
Critical event
I undertook a student project for MMM Manufacturers, spending one 
afternoon a week working with their development team. I was responsible 
for designing paper-based materials that made their new software easy to 
use for short-contract workers. I worked alongside the IT-development team 
in Human Resources, and one of these acted as a ‘line manager’ . I piloted 
my materials with ten part-time workers, and used their feedback to make 
some major changes. 
The paper-based materials I produced were used by the company. That was 
a success, but the work experience was an important event to me for very 
different reasons. First of all, I had no confidence that I could work in that 
kind of environment or work to deadlines. I proved to myself that I could be 
relied on to carry out a job well. 
I had been very anxious about piloting the materials. I imagined that people 
would be very critical and that I would get upset if I was criticised. During 
the pilot, I was determined to listen to what the part-timers had to say, as I 
wanted my materials to work. They said some very positive things but they 
also pointed out a lot of aspects that needed to be changed. I surprised 
myself. I stayed very calm and encouraged them to say what they really felt. 
What they said was actually very sensible – I could see how most of it would 
improve the materials.  
I learnt the value of feedback as I was able to put it to good use. I also 
learned how important it is to allow people to be critical. My main 
achievement, from my perspective, was in ‘taking it on the chin’. I accepted 
what was said without being devastated that everything wasn’t perfect in 
the first place. This is something I have not been able to do in the past so I 
feel this has been an important turning point. 
This experience will help me in my seminar group. For example, I used to see 
all feedback as a kind of attack on me …
Reflection: Critical event
Select one event that is of key importance to you. Consider:
•• What happened generally – the context?
•• What did you do – your own role?
•• What were the outcomes or consequences of your actions?
•• What alternative actions could you have taken?
•• How might you prepare differently for a similar occasion?
•• How did your performance or action differ from your performance on 
other occasions? What were the reasons for this?
•• How did you use or how could you use feedback from other people?
•• What is the one main area where you need to focus to improve your 
performance? What do you need to do in order to take this forward? 
•• What did you gain and learn from the experience?

The art of reflection

Using feedback
As a student, you will receive regular feedback 
on your work in ways you may never experience 
again. Such feedback, provided by experts who 
want you to succeed, is an extremely valuable 
resource. Be open to all feedback, irrespective of 
whether, in your opinion, it is fair and accurate or 
not.  
Write down your answers to each of the above 
questions so that you have a record to which 
you can refer on future occasions.
NB    If anyone else will see these reflections, 
check first that you have not included names 
or other information that identify people, 
departments or organisations without their 
express permission.  
See Resource Bank, page 345.
Reflection: Critical event (continued)
kinds of things may not draw the same positive 
feedback a second time – how will you build 
on your success so that you show you are 
developing from where you were before? If 
you disliked the feedback, what steps can you 
take to change or improve that area of your 
performance? 
•• considering sources of support available to you 
(books, web pages, tutors, support services) to 
address areas for improvement.
Put time aside at least two or three times a year to 
go over written feedback that you have received. 
Note any emergent themes as these may be 
losing or gaining you marks on a consistent basis. 
Jot down guidance for yourself on how you will 
address those points so that you really gain from 
having received this feedback, whether it pleased 
you or not. 
Varieties of feedback 
Bear in mind that much of the feedback that you 
will receive both as a student and in life more 
generally is not written out as individual comments 
at the end of an essay. If there are comments that 
apply to most of a class, it can make more sense 
for the tutor to avoid writing these out individually 
for each student, and to provide these to the 
whole class verbally or through a group handout 
or on the course website. This is still important 
feedback for you to consider.
Look out for feedback that may be available to 
you in a wide range of formats depending on your 
programme, such as:  
•• short or passing verbal feedback on your 
performance during lab work, on the wards, in 
the studio, etc. 
•• comments provided on your ideas or an early 
plan or draft for an assignment
•• opportunities created for you to receive 
feedback from other students, employers, 
clients, patients, or other stakeholders
•• comments during a taught session which 
provide insights into what is expected of you as 
a student or for that module of study 
•• feedback from supervisors on work-placement.
If feedback is not provided in written form, 
consider how you will capture this and record it in 
your own notes so that you will be able to make 
use of it later.
You can use it as a basis for reflection on your 
development by:
•• reading it! – and reading it again a few days 
later, as you probably will not be objective the 
first time you see it
•• considering whether the comments are 
unexpected; if so, why is that?
•• considering whether you agree with the 
comments. If not, what are the grounds for your 
disagreement?
•• deciding if you want to see similar comments 
on future work. If so, consider what you can 
do next time in order to gain similar comments 
again. Bear in mind, that just doing the same

Models of reflection
Reflection is now a key component of many 
professions and courses of study. Various models of 
reflection have developed that provide structures 
for considering the rather abstract or ‘fuzzy’ 
concept of ‘learning through reflection on your 
own experiences’.  A summary of some key models 
is provided below, so that you can recognise these 
when you see or hear them referred to, and draw 
on them to develop your own model of reflection.  
The underlying concept  
Reflective models, in summary, assume we can:
1	 think about our experiences
2	 understand them at a deeper level
3	 learn from that thinking and understanding so 
as to effect change.
Staged models
Models of reflection often break down the various 
reflective processes into steps or stages. These 
stages are usually represented in the form of a 
cycle, the idea being that we can use what we 
have learnt from active reflection in order to 
bring greater understanding and better forward 
planning to similar experiences in the future. The 
reflective process may be conceived of in different 
ways, with a number of stages depending on the 
model.
Four stage Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb)
Kolb’s Cycle (1984) has been particularly 
influential on the developments in thinking about 
experiential learning.
Kolb’s cycle consists of four stages: 
1	 Concrete experience: experience or action
2	 Reflective observation: actively taking note of 
what you are observing about that experience
3	 Abstract conceptualisation: forming ideas about 
what you have observed
4	 Active experimentation: putting those new 
ideas into practice.
The third stage, abstract conceptualisation, gives 
significance to the act of drawing generalisations – 
an important cognitive step in identifying how one 
experience could relate to others. 
Many-stage models 
Other models have more and/or different stages, 
each focusing on particular components of the 
learning process such as: 
•• awareness of initial responses
•• the impact of emotions on behaviour
•• consideration of issues and theories
•• etc.
A five-stage model, the core model for reflection 
(Cottrell, 2010), is provided below on page 207. 
Atkins and Murphy (1994) use a six-stage model 
incorporating stages for:
•• awareness of thoughts and feelings
•• describing these and the broader situation
•• analysing them, challenging assumptions.
Reflection: Working with staged 
models
How useful do you think the concept of ‘stages’ 
would be for your own reflection?
Are you likely to work better with: 
•• a model that has few stages, and you 
elaborate the details and prompts yourself?
•• a model with more stages, with prompts 
provided that you select from as needed?

The art of reflection

Themes and focal points for reflection 
There is a wide range of themes that could be 
used to provide a focus to reflection.  For example, 
models could include broader contextual issues 
such as culture, society, politics, economics and 
media. These have an overarching influence on 
our experience – and our interpretations of that 
experience. Themes could include: 
•• Behaviours  
•• Interactions with or between others
•• Feelings
•• Knowledge
•• Thoughts
•• Theories 
•• Local practice
•• Systems and structures 
•• Policies, procedures, rules
•• Ideas 
•• Values
•• Ethics 
•• Feedback from stakeholders 
•• Personal histories
•• Language 
•• Broader issues (e.g. history, ideology, economics, 
politics, culture, media).
Activity
Focus points for reflection
•
•
Which of the points on the above list 
of focus points strike you as being of 
most relevance and interest to you when 
considering your experiences?
Example: focus on feelings
Boud, Keogh and Walker (1985) emphasised 
that experience, and reflections on experience, 
are both influenced by unconscious aspects such 
as emotions as well as conscious ones such as 
intent. Boud et al. argued that emotions tend to 
override our rational thinking without us being fully 
conscious of this, making us less aware of how and 
why we are acting as we do. If we re-evaluate an 
event, focusing on feelings and their impact, this 
helps us to identify how to manage similar events 
differently in the future.
Schön’s model 
Schön (1983) drew distinctions between 
reflecting: 
•• in action: reflecting on what you are doing 
whilst in the process of doing it, such as when 
experts call upon pre-existing knowledge as 
they work
•• on action: making sense of an action or event 
once it is over, so as to learn from it for the 
future.
Many models refer back to this distinction. There 
is also a case for reflection:
•• before action: drawing on knowledge 
(including theory), experience and input from 
others before you do something.
It is generally easier to reflect:
•• Before action: as part of forward planning, 
putting aside time to find out useful 
information and examples of good practice, 
identifying relevant skills and learning or 
refreshing these; simulating difficult scenarios; 
practising what you are going to say or do, 
and giving thought to how this will all be put 
into action when needed.
•• On action: putting time aside to think 
significant events through in detail, as outlined 
above.
Reflection: ‘Before action’ and 
‘in action’
Your response for the reflection above, 
‘Critical event’ (page 231), was an example of 
reflection on action – so if you managed that, 
you know what that kind of reflection feels 
like. What kind of reflection do you think you 
could also undertake: 
•• Before action? (How would you plan 
differently in future for that kind of 
scenario?)  
•• In action: whilst you are actually in the 
midst of the scenario? What would you 
be able to call to mind and do differently 
whilst ‘in action’?
234
Extend your thinking

Developing your own model for 
reflection   
Your current model? 
Does your current model for action and reflection 
sound at all like the following?
I usually launch into action with a rough idea of 
what I think  is needed. I work out my next steps as 
I go along, adapting to the evolving circumstances, 
using ideas that come into my head, or memories of 
doing something similar in the past, or other people’s 
suggestions, or thinking on my feet as I read the 
situation and calculate what is needed. Often, I don’t 
know why I did exactly what I did but it all works out 
pretty well anyway. Sometimes, if things go well, or 
someone compliments me, or if I feel things didn’t 
go well, I find myself mulling over who did or said 
what, or what I should have said or done. I might 
remember this next time I am in that situation – but 
then again, I might not.
If you recognise this scenario, then you are in good 
company. Much of the time, this approach works 
well enough. Depending on the task, we form 
unconscious expertise in a variety of ways, such as 
training, practice, hearsay, reading, watching TV, 
or being around others who are experts. However, 
this model doesn’t include setting time aside 
specifically to focus in a structured way on how 
things might be improved for the better.
Reflection: My current model
•• Jot down a brief outline of how you approach 
your work and/or study or a particular kind of 
activity in which you engage.
•• Is this generally true of you in most areas of 
life?
Why develop a better model for yourself? 
We saw above that reflecting on your learning and 
experience is regarded as a means of deepening 
your understanding of how and why things work 
out the way they do for you. This can help you to 
make better decisions and exercise more control 
over the outcome of events. Reflection is a valuable 
tool. 
Unless you are required by your work or course to 
use a particular model of reflection, then there is 
value in devising a model that:
•• makes sense to you
•• with (or without) prompt questions
•• with as many stages as you find useful
•• adapting existing models or starting from 
scratch.
The ‘Core Model’ below is suggested for you 
to adapt, drawing if you wish upon the models 
outlined above and selecting those focus points 
(page 234) that you feel pertinent to your 
experience.

1  Evaluate significance: Is it worth reflection?
Before launching into reflection, it is worth making an 
initial evaluation of the relative value of that experience 
as the focus of your reflective energies. Consider, for 
example, the following prompts:
•• Will I encounter this kind of experience again? 
•• Could it provide lessons for the future?
•• Does feedback from other people suggest I need to 
do this differently?
•• Were there things I did really well that I could apply 
in the future?
•• Would working this through help me understand 
niggles and concerns I have and how to deal with 
them?
•• Is this a key aspect of my job that merits reflection 
from time to time?
•• Would reflecting on this experience lead to positive 
outcomes for other people? 
•• Is there an aspect of my life, work or study that I take 
for granted but which could benefit from refreshed 
thinking? 
•• Does thinking about this experience arouse strong 
emotions suggesting it merits reflection?
•• Is this the issue that most merits deeper reflection 
now?  
Core Model for reflection
The Core Model below suggests 5 key components that you 
can draw from to help you formulate your own model. 
Core Model for Reflection (Cottrell, 2010)
2  Reconstructing the experience 
This is the stage where you go through 
the surface aspects of the experience, from 
where you consider it ‘starts’ to where you 
consider it ‘finishes’. Inevitably, this is an 
act of reconstruction, not an exact record. 
Draw out what you feel are the most salient 
points. You may find it helpful to consider 
the following prompts:
•• Events    Is it helpful to go through the 
storyline of the experience point by 
point, identifying who did what and 
when? Sometimes this helps to uncover 
details that might prove to be significant, 
sometimes not. 
•• Intent    What was the purpose of your 
involvement? What were you aiming to 
achieve through your actions, words, 
silence or  
inaction? 
•• Feelings    How did you feel during the 
experience? Do the feelings evoked in 
reconstructing the event throw any further 
light onto your own behaviour?
1	 Evaluate significance: is 
it worth reflection?
2	 Reconstruct the 
experience: what 
happened? 
3	 Analyse: why did it 
happen that way?
4	 Distil learning: draw out 
lessons for the future.
5	 Apply: prepare for 
future situations. 
Select those you find 
appropriate. Further details 
and prompts are provided 
below.
236
Extend your thinking

It was all her fault.
•• Your role    What role did you think you were 
playing at the time? In retrospect, what role 
did you play? What was the impact of your 
involvement? What might have been different 
if you had not been present, or if someone else 
had taken the part you played?
•• Other people    What part did others play? What 
could you have done to change the flow of 
interactions for the better? 
•• Surface outcome    What was the outcome? Did it 
end well? well enough? as a disaster?
3  Analysis: Why did it happen that way? 
This is the analytical stage, where you go behind 
the surface events to examine why things unfolded 
in the way they did and arrive at a deeper 
understanding. Consider such questions as:
•• What interpretations, explanations and theories 
help me to make sense of it?
•• What was really going on for me? For others? 
On that day? In the place?
•• Were the final outcomes as intended? If not, 
why not? 
•• Which actions, words, or omissions were most 
significant in the way events unfolded – or on 
the final outcomes? 
•• What made the situation better or worse?
•• Did the scenario have roots in something that 
pre-dated that occasion? 
•• Is it really ‘finished’ or are there loose ends and 
bad feelings that could be addressed?
4  Distil: What lessons can be learnt?
What lessons do you draw from your reflection?  
For example:
•• Positive features that are worth applying in the 
future? 
•• Trigger points that could be better managed? 
•• Skills you exercised and qualities you 
demonstrated that you could apply to similar 
situations?
•• Specific actions that you, personally, could take 
or omit in similar situations so that things run 
more smoothly, harmoniously or with better 
consequences?
•• Ways of tracking and managing your emotions 
and responses differently?
•• Areas for training or practice? 
•• Awareness of other people’s needs or issues and 
how these could be addressed differently?
•• Would different preparation, planning, or timing 
produce better outcomes?   
•• Could different theoretical models apply?  
5  Apply: Prepare for future situations
In this stage, give active consideration to how you 
will make use of your reflections so that they have 
an impact on future experiences. For example: 
•• Identify your wish list    What do you want to be 
different?
•• Identify potential scenarios    What kinds of 
situations are suitable for applying what you 
have learnt?
•• Identify the consequences    What will be different 
as a result of you changing the way you do 
things?
•• Who are the beneficiaries    Who will gain as a 
result of these changes? What will be different 
for them? 
•• Identify personal benefit that will motivate you to 
act    What will you gain through these changes?  
•• What will you do differently?    (Focus on what 
you personally can do or say – as these are most 
under your control.)
•• Advance planning    What preparation do you 
need to do now so as to respond differently in 
such situations in future? 
•• Plan memory-joggers    Once those situations 
arise, what will trigger your memory about what 
you wish to do?

The art of reflection

Presenting your reflection to others
Raw reflection: first stage reflection
Most of us engage quite naturally in very deep 
reflection when we do it in our own time and 
way. It is important to capture such reflections in 
a way that suits our personal styles. However, such 
‘first stage’ reflections are in raw form. They are 
not usually accessible to other people and are not 
necessarily in a form that is useful to you.
Worked reflection: second stage reflection
Second-stage reflection is characterised by:
Time    Leaving time between the initial reflection 
and the current stage of reflection.
Summary    Second-stage reflection seeks out and 
summarises key themes and salient points, noting 
down where more detailed evidence can be found 
in the portfolio.
Insight    Identifying what has been learnt – 
especially the less obvious learning. This will refer 
to broad themes rather than specific subject 
knowledge. It will bring out issues of relevance 
and significance rather than focus on data. During 
second-stage reflection you come to appreciate 
the deeper and subtler aspects of your learning. 
Communication    It is at this point that you are 
ready to consider presenting the results of your 
reflection to others. The context will determine 
what it is appropriate to show to others. For most 
purposes, you will need to remove:
•• material about your personal life you wish to 
keep private
•• personal details about other people
•• repetitive or irrelevant material
•• unnecessary examples
•• materials produced by other people, such 
as guideline materials, tutor notes, copies of 
background reading, lecture notes, etc.
Devise your own model for reflection
Jot down the steps or stages that you consider 
you would find it helpful to have in your model. In 
deciding this, give thought to the different steps 
you feel that you need to draw your attention 
to – so that you don’t miss them out. Balance 
that against the number of steps that you feel will 
motivate you and be easy to remember. 
Looking at the ‘Core Model’ above (page 236), 
decide whether you would wish to merge some 
of those stages into one or, alternatively, divide up 
further some of the stages of the Core Model. 
Once you have decided on the number of steps, 
give each a name. Naming the stages may cause 
you to reconsider how many stages are really 
useful for you.
Once you have decided on your stages and the 
order that you want to place them in, use the pro-
forma on page 239, to record these. If you find 
that you want to include more than six stages, 
copy the table and use two or more sheets.
•• Use the first column to number your stages.
•• Use the second column to record the name of 
each stage.
•• Use the third column to devise a range of 
‘prompt questions’ to structure your reflection. 
If you are not sure what to include, draw on 
those in the Core Model, on pages 236–7, as a 
starting place.

Submitting reflections to tutors
You may be asked to submit your reflections to 
tutors either as part of assessment, or for more 
informal monitoring. If so, you may be asked 
to submit either raw or worked reflections, or 
both. For example, you may be asked to submit 
a journal, log or extracts from a blog as part of a 
portfolio of materials. 
Alternatively you might be asked to draw on your 
reflections as the basis of work undertaken in 
class or to provide material within an assessment 
such as an essay, case study, position paper or 
observation, without there being a requirement to 
submit your journal.
Confidentiality
NB    If anyone else will see these reflections, check 
first that you have not included names or other 
information that identify people, departments or 
organisations without their express permission.  
The details you provide should not enable people 
to make a good guess at who is being referred to 
in your reflections or any other assignment.
Submitting selective portfolios 
If your tutors are going to mark your portfolio, 
they will look for such factors as:
How well it meets the required learning 
outcomes. How well the portfolio overall meets 
the learning outcomes of the unit, module or 
course; make sure you know what these are 
before you start to put your portfolio together. 
These are usually provided in a handbook or 
on a website for the course.
How well you summarise your insights into your 
learning (or the subject of the portfolio). Most 
marks are likely to be given for the reflective 
essay, position paper or similar document, 
which draws together the main points, 
rather than for raw reflection and supporting 
documents, important though these are too.
How well you select and edit relevant 
information for inclusion in the portfolio. Large, 
unedited portfolios that contain all the 
information you could possibly gather on 
a subject are unlikely to impress. Bulk does 
not usually gain marks. The tutor is likely to 
give marks specifically for skills in selecting, 
drawing out clearly what is relevant, good 
editing and cross-referencing.
How well the evidence and examples you refer 
to in the portfolio really do support the point 
you are making. If you say the evidence 
demonstrates a particular skill or insight, it 
must be a very clear example. You need to 
specify how skills or the application of theory 
were demonstrated, rather than assuming 
these are obvious to the tutor. 
How well the portfolio is constructed. Clear 
contents; all documents labelled; the summary 
writing makes exact cross-references to the 
page where the evidence can be found. Use 
a highlighter pen or number the lines to 
indicate exactly where the tutor should look 
to find the evidence if these are submitted 
in paper form. If you are submitting this 
electronically, you can use editing and 
reviewing functions such as those for inserting 
comments, to provide a commentary on your 
text. If you make vague references to long 
free-ranging reflections, leaving the tutor to 
find what you are referring to, this is unlikely 
to be accepted.
How well you select one or two good pieces of 
evidence for each main point you make. More 
than one piece of evidence is usually not 
needed or wanted.
How well you draw on relevant theory as part 
of your reflections. If you are submitting work 
as part of an academic assessment, then it is 
generally assumed that you will demonstrate 
that you are aware of which theories are 
relevant and how these provide insights on 
the issue under consideration. 
In other words, good guidance for portfolios is:
•• include a contents page and a strong summary 
document (e.g. position paper or essay)
•• label and signpost clearly
•• back up your main points with good evidence
•• cross-reference your argument clearly to 
evidence in the portfolio
•• include only essential evidence
•• keep it as succinct as possible.

A reflective essay
Purpose
Some programmes set reflective essays as 
marked assignments. The contents of the 
essay will vary depending on the focus of the 
programme and the purpose of the essay. For 
example, some programmes ask for a reflective 
piece of writing at the beginning of the 
programme in order to encourage students to 
focus on their goals and learning needs. Others 
set an essay at the end of a module for students 
to draw together their learning and identify 
next steps. 
Usually, you will be given specific guidance on 
what is required. If not, the guidance below 
outlines features typical of reflective essays. The 
structure is not dissimilar to that of other essays. 
The content and style are distinct.
Structure
Like any other essay, a reflective essay will have:
•• a specific title: you must structure your essay 
to respond to the question contained within 
the title
•• an introduction that identifies your overall 
position and prepares the reader for what to 
expect from the essay
•• a main body divided into paragraphs: this 
does not usually contain any headings or 
bullet points
•• a conclusion that sums up the main points: 
this does not introduce any new material
•• references to source materials within the text
•• a list of all references at the end of the text. 
Contents of a reflective PDP essay
Typically, a reflective essay will contain a 
selection of the following elements.
Personal aims and goals
•• Why did you choose your programme: what 
were your aims and objectives?
•• Have these changed since starting the 
programme? In what ways and for what 
reasons?
Expectations
•• What were you expecting from the 
programme?
•• What did you expect from yourself?
•• What led you to form these expectations?
Programme learning outcomes
•• What are the learning outcomes for modules 
you have taken so far?
•• What skills development is linked to the 
modules you have taken?
•• How do these outcomes and skills correspond 
to your own aims and goals?
Other activity
•• What else do you do outside of your 
programme in order to achieve your personal 
goals or to supplement your learning for the 
programme?
Learning goals and targets
•• What are your current areas of strength in 
relation to your programme, career or life 
ambitions?
•• Which areas do you need to improve?
•• What are the priority areas for improvement 
as ‘learning goals’?
•• What are your targets, milestones and time-
scales for meeting these learning goals?
Personal reflection 
•• What methods have you used for reflection?
•• How do you use reflection? 
•• A detailed example of how you developed 
and evaluated your performance in one area.

Personal development
•• How have your opinions, attitudes, beliefs or 
values changed since starting at university? 
•• In what ways have you changed as a person

•• What does this incident demonstrate about 
you?
•• How does this incident relate to any theories 
of learning you have covered on your 
programme?
•• What did you learn from this incident?
•• See the Reflection on p. 231 above, and the 
Critical Incident Sheet in the Resource Bank, 
page 345.
Use of theory
A reflective essay is still an academic piece of 
work. You should draw on your background 
reading for the subject, relating your own 
experiences to the theoretical perspective 
relevant to your programme of study. Consider:
•• Does your experience support or exemplify 
theories you have covered in class or through 
your background reading?
•• Or does your experience run counter to those 
theories? If so, why might that be the case? 
What is different about your experience that 
might account for this?
Style
Reflective essays are about your own 
experience. This means that it is more 
acceptable for these to be written in the first 
person (‘I’, ‘We’).
Use of feedback
•• What kinds of feedback have you received 
from tutors, students, employers or other 
people?
•• How do you feel about this feedback? 
•• How have you made use of this feedback?
Evaluation of personal choices
•• In practice, how far does the programme 
meet personal goals and interests? 
•• Would any other programme or set of 
modules be more suitable for you?
•• What other subject choices, additional 
modules or supplementary programmes 
would help you to meet your personal goals?
Evaluation of learning
•• How well are you achieving the learning 
outcomes of your programme?
•• What else have you learnt through the 
programme?
•• What are you gaining, additionally, from your 
programme or from university that was not 
part of your original goals?
Evaluation of the programme
•• How does each module or aspect of your 
programme contribute to your professional 
and personal development?
Evaluation of personal performance
•• How well are you achieving your personal 
goals?
•• How well have you engaged with your 
programme? (Attendance? Punctuality? Level 
of interest? Contributions made in class? 
Efforts to make personal meaning of the 
course material? Additional reading or work 
undertaken?)
•• How far do you consider you have taken 
responsibility for improving your own 
learning?

Example
Personal statement 
This semester, I took three modules in Business 
Studies. These covered project management, 
business communication and entrepreneurship. I 
was able to draw out several themes that ran across 
the three modules. 
First of all, the communication skills were important 
in identifying ways of varying a message so that 
it comes across to very different audiences: client 
groups, bank managers, the buying public, products 
aimed at different age groups and at people who 
purchase for those client groups. We also focused on 
communication within teams.
Communication skills
Communication skills were important to my 
entrepreneurship project as I was part of a team 
that took a product (light-weight collapsible bikes) 
through from idea to design to market. We drew 
up a business plan that we presented to a funding 
panel. There was an accountant on the panel who 
gave us feedback on our presentations. Although 
our group did not win the funding, we were given 
valuable advice on what a business plan should look 
like and how to communicate its strengths when 
asking for funding.
The entrepreneurship students were not all from 
a business background: some were from product 
design, fine art, engineering, marketing and multi-
media. One important lesson was in discovering 
that students from each discipline use very different 
ways of describing their work process and the 
product than we expect from a business perspective. 
Although we learnt that we have to find a common 
vocabulary, a shared way of communicating, we 
could have approached this is in a more organised 
way and avoided some misunderstandings. 
Communication for team work across disciplines is 
an area that I would like to investigate further.
Team work
The product designers and engineers, in particular, 
approached their work in ways that the business 
students found challenging. This meant that we 
had to establish ground rules for working together 
as a team. This took several attempts because 
our starting points were so different. We had 
not anticipated this and did not realise      n the 
beginning, each of us was unwilling to compromise 
on methods we had been trained in.  
However, as the deadlines drew closer, we made 
a choice to develop a hybrid way of working that 
met the needs of the project rather than what we 
thought we should do as ‘business students’ or 
‘design students’. This felt like a risky strategy but 
we were encouraged by our tutors, who gave us 
some useful tips on how to negotiate a strategy …
Personal statement 
Personal statements are important tools for making 
real use of on-going observation, reflection and 
evaluation. They are characterised by:
•• being written in a more formal manner than 
reflection for personal purposes
•• drawing together learning that has taken place
•• identifying themes (from a portfolio or journal) and 
summarising these
•• identifying the overall path that developmental 
work has taken over a period of time
•• identifying the lessons that have been learnt
•• evaluating current performance
•• making recommendations for future 
improvement
•• identifying action that needs to be taken.
The emphasis of a personal statement may 
differ depending on whether it is written:
•• at the beginning of a programme
•• as developmental work within a programme
•• for assessment or submission at the end of a 
programme
•• for a specific purpose such as a job 
application.
An example is provided on page 213.
243
The art of reflection

•• How has your past learning and life experience 
equipped you for this course and for being 
a student now? Evaluate the knowledge, 
qualifications, skills, attitudes and experiences 
that you bring with you and which are relevant 
to your study and goals. 
Appraisal
Where am I now?
•• What skills and abilities will be required of you as 
a student on this course?
•• What are your main strengths and weaknesses as 
a student on this course?
•• What will you need to improve in order to do 
well?
Planning 
How will I achieve my aims?
•• How do you plan to achieve your ambitions and 
study aims? What are you going to do, when 
and how?
•• What targets have you set as milestones (to 
what time-scales)?
•• What difficulties might you encounter? 
•• In what ways might you sabotage your own 
success? What steps will you take to prevent 
yourself or others from sabotaging your success? 
•• How will you keep yourself motivated?
•• What other preparation and planning do you 
need to undertake?
Evaluating progress
What have I achieved?
•• How will you be able to recognise that you have 
achieved your aims?
•• What changes do you expect to see in yourself, 
your work, and in the attitudes of others when 
you have achieved your aims?  
•• How will you be able to demonstrate to others 
what you have achieved? 
Position papers
A position paper is a ‘snapshot’ of where you are 
now, which draws together reflections on your 
personal development. Typically, its format follows 
a time-line from past to future. You are usually 
asked to:
•• look back over past experience and identify 
what you have learned from your experience
•• evaluate your current position
•• project forward to where you wish to be
•• decide a plan of action that takes you from 
where you are now to where you wish to be in 
the future, using your past experience
•• identify how you will be able to recognise when 
you have achieved your goals.
To write a position paper, you can draw upon 
entries from your reflective journal, responses to 
activities in this book, self-evaluations and action 
plans. A possible structure is suggested below, 
organised through a series of questions. You 
can use these to guide you, selecting relevant 
questions. Where possible, include references 
to texts you have read in order to support your 
reasoning.
Orientation
Aspirations and motivation: where am I going?
•• What are your aims for your future? Where 
would you like to see yourself in five or ten 
years’ time? (Be imaginative and bold.) 
•• In what ways do you think your programme will 
help you to achieve those aims?
•• What skills and attributes do you want to 
develop whilst at university?
Review
What do I bring from my past?
•• What has led you to the present stage in your 
study or career?
•• What has inspired you? (Give references where 
possible.)

Closing comments
Reflection is not something that comes easily to 
everyone. However, there are many strategies 
and approaches that can be used to develop 
your skills in undertaking reflection. Reflective 
abilities develop over time and with practice. 
•• Put time aside on a regular basis to reflect 
upon your performance.
•• Use a structured approach. Make use of 
activities in the book if you are not sure where 
to begin.
•• Read back over your reflections on a regular 
basis. Look for themes.
•• Consider regularly how far you have achieved 
personal goals.
•• Find approaches that suit you and your 
programme. 
•• Look for changes in yourself, your actions, 
goals or values.
•• Notice and celebrate your achievements. 
•• Be positive about the process: over time, you 
will see the benefits.
Extrapolation
What have I learned?
•• What have you learned about 
yourself or your learning that 
was unexpected in some way?
•• How might this learning help 
you more generally with your 
studies, life and work?  
References
Include references to books, 
films, music or other sources 
that have inspired you on your 
journey to where you are today. 
Include references to all materials 
you have used in writing the 
position paper. Remember to use 
the correct referencing system, 
such as the Harvard or Vancouver 
system, as recommended by 
your tutors.
Example
Sample introduction
In this position paper, I demonstrate how my past experiences and 
future objectives are influencing my current study on a degree in 
media technology. The paper is based on an in-depth consideration 
of my previous life and learning experiences, and shows the ways 
in which prior learning has provided me with skills, knowledge 
and personal qualities that are relevant to my present studies. 
In particular, I draw attention to the range of skills and insights 
I acquired through working as a volunteer last summer and how 
these, unexpectedly, have provided me with starting points for 
design work on the degree. 
My main aim is to use this qualification to advance my professional 
career. This position paper outlines both the areas I need to 
investigate in order to improve my career prospects and my reasons 
for the module choices I have made for next year. It also looks at 
skills I need to improve next year to improve my course marks. 
In addition, I demonstrate how the programme I am on and the 
decisions I am making will help me to achieve my goals.

Getting a good job is high on the list of priorities 
for most students.
Whilst some know exactly what kind of work 
and career they want, many have only vaguely 
formulated ideas or even no idea at all. Whether or 
not you know what you want to do, you can still 
start to prepare ahead now, so that, when the right 
job comes along, you are ready.
The likelihood is that, sooner or later, you will be 
competing with others for a job, placement or 
internship that you really want. At that point, you 
will want to feel confident that you understand 
what is required of you and that you are well-
prepared both for the appointments process and 
for the requirements of your new role.
Whilst it is not impossible to gain a great job with 
minimum effort, it is unusual. It is much more 
likely that you will succeed in your application if 
you have put some time into preparation and into 
understanding the field. This means:
•• Understanding the appointments process from 
the perspective of a recruiting employer
•• Understanding what you really want from your 
next, or first, job
•• Knowing how to manage the appointments 
process, from first contact through to 
acceptance, or rejection, and beyond.
This section looks at employability from the angle 
both of the employer and of you, the potential job 
applicant. It can help you to clarify such things as:
•• What employers look for in job applicants
•• What is meant by employability
•• Whether you should apply for a particular job or 
placement
•• How you can make a strong application
•• The kinds of appointments processes that you 
may encounter and what employers look for 
when they use these
•• How to keep records, prepare and practise 
so that you feel more confident and more in 
control during the appointments process
•• How to make good use of placements and 
current work, in preparation for the future
•• Whether you want to work for yourself rather 
than for anyone else and, if so, where to start.

Balanced consideration
It is natural, when looking for a job and reading 
job advertisements, to look at how each role would 
suit us. Matching the job to our own needs is, of 
course, important, at least where there is some 
choice, and this point is addressed in Chapter 10. 
However, you are more likely to be offered a job 
if you are also able to consider new roles from 
an employer’s perspective. Aim to balance your 
interests with the business needs of the prospective 
employer.
Understanding employers
This chapter helps you to understand employers so 
that you are better placed to take on board their 
needs. It provides guidance on:
•• What is meant by ‘the labour market’
•• Generic attributes, such as work-readiness, that 
employers look for
•• The skills and other attributes most in demand 
by employers
•• Continuities over time in what employers say 
they want from graduate appointments.
Translate your skills
You will have developed a wealth of skills through 
your course of study. That is a bonus, but is not 
necessarily sufficient in itself. Your job applications 
will be more powerful if you can articulate your 
skills in ways that make sense in terms of the 
workplace.
This chapter helps you to look at your skills from 
an employment perspective.
Yourself as employer
There is an alternative to working for someone 
else and that is working for yourself. It is worth 
considering whether you would prefer to run 
your own business, either now or at some time 
in the future. This is an exciting option and many 
new businesses and start-ups have been formed 
by students and new graduates. You will have a 
chance to consider some of the pros and cons of 
this option.
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• understand what is meant by employability
•• develop insights into employers’ needs and interests that will help you when applying for jobs
•• identify the skills and attributes that employers value
•• think through how skills that you have acquired as a student translate into the skills needed in the 
workplace
•• consider whether you want to work for yourself rather than another employer.

What do employers really want?

Employability
Employability is a concurrence of:
•• capability
•• preparedness for employment
•• and the relevance of these to the current job 
market.
The term can be used:
1	 in general terms, to mean that you have the 
abilities needed to gain a job and keep it, or
2	 in a narrower sense, with reference to your 
readiness for a particular range of roles, such 
as graduate jobs, or specialist posts in a given 
field, or
3	 in relative terms, to indicate how strong your 
chances are of gaining a job compared with the 
competition.
Capability
In this context, your capability is the sum of 
your skills, knowledge, experience, habits, 
understandings, attitudes, qualities and personal 
attributes. These are relevant to gaining a job, 
keeping it, and making it work for you.
Preparedness
Preparedness is the outcome of the time, thought 
and practice you have put into developing and 
nurturing your capability from the perspective 
of future employment and for the appointments 
process itself. It includes your readiness, and ability, 
to make use of the opportunities 
that present themselves and/
or to create opportunities 
for yourself.
Employability capabilities
For students, developing skills for employability 
involves the following.
1	 Career development: Being proactive and self-
directing in gaining a portfolio of qualifications, 
attributes and experiences either that enable 
you to pursue a given career path, or that open 
up a range of future career opportunities.
2	 Labour market awareness: Knowing what kinds 
of work are likely to be available, and being 
able to match your strengths, qualities and 
interests to these.
3	 Articulation: Being able to recognise, evidence 
and demonstrate your strengths to employers 
during job application processes.
4	 Self-awareness: Developing insight so that you 
are able to recognise your own strengths and 
preferences, as well as the significance of these, 
when making choices and decisions that have 
an impact on your career path.
5	 Self-management: Building the perseverance, 
resilience, confidence, beliefs, motivation and 
attitudes needed to manage the demands of 
applying for work, responding constructively to 
setbacks, and presenting yourself at your best.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Put yourself in the employers’ shoes
The employer’s WIIFT
You are much more likely to impress an 
employer if you come across as having the 
business’s interests in mind. Bright and Earl 
(2000) recommend that when applying 
for jobs, candidates should always keep in 
mind ‘an employer’s WIIFT’. WIIFT stands for 
‘What’s In It For Them’?
•• Use the information available: if the 
employer has provided background 
information and a job description, look at 
this in detail.
•• Investigate: find out about the company, 
such as from its website, Companies House, 
LinkedIn, or their presence in social media.
•• Use common sense and empathy: give some 
thought to why the employer is likely to be 
advertising for this post. What do they really 
need done? What would make life easier for 
them in looking for the right candidate?
Minimum effort, minimum cost
When employers advertise a new post, 
clearly they have work that needs to be 
done. Naturally, they want to get that work 
done with minimum costs, training and lost 
time. They will want someone up to speed 
with the job as soon as possible in order to 
avoid additional work for existing staff and to 
reduce any delays or disruption to clients and 
other stakeholders.
Generally, that means they look for applicants 
who, as far as possible …
•• already have the skills, knowledge, 
experience, qualities, and desired 
behaviours outlined in the person 
specification for the job
•• demonstrate a good understanding of the 
role and the business
•• inspire confidence that they can get on 
with the job straightaway, with minimum 
direction, supervision and training
•• share the values of the business.
Do employers all want the same things?
Every employer is different. The requirements of the 
first few employers might not be the same as those of 
the next. Just because you were not a match for one 
employer it does not mean that you won’t be exactly 
what the next employer is looking for. If one employer 
was impressed by your course or your skills, these 
might not be relevant to the next. Such differences 
mean it is essential to investigate the requirements of
•• the occupational sector
•• individual employers
•• each job.
I am really keen and 
enthusiastic. I would 
give you 110%.
Do they all want experience?
•• Some employers recruit only people with previous 
work experience and practical expertise in the field.
•• Others are keen to recruit recent graduates that 
they can train into the culture of the organisation. 
They look for candidates who could learn quickly on 
the job and meet their essential criteria. Some offer 
training or graduate schemes; others do not.
•• Some employers prefer to focus on attitude, values 
or behaviours.
You should be able to tell which approach an 
employer will take, such as by looking at their website 
and reading the material provided about the job.
Hmmm. That still 
amounts to 110% of 
no skills or expertise in 
this area!

What do employers really want?

What employers want: large employers and SMEs
Understanding the labour market
Undergraduates are often advised to make sure 
they understand the labour market. That can seem 
a rather daunting task: it may feel hard to know 
where to begin or even what that means. Below, 
there is some key information about the labour 
market that provides a starting place to focus your 
research and thinking.
Where are most jobs to be found?
Large employers
Large employers will recruit, at most, only 10% 
of the total number of students graduating in any 
year (Wilson, 2012). Despite this, much of the 
information about what employers want is drawn 
from a relatively small number of large employers; 
such employers also play a prominent role in 
graduate job fairs and in job news.
The largest recruiter of graduates in the UK in 
2014 was Teach First (1550 vacancies). This was 
followed by PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC) with 
1200 vacancies, and Deloitte with 1000 (High 
Fliers Research, 2014). In 2013, PwC received 
over 22,000 applications for graduate places, and 
Teach First had 1262 places and 7602 applicants. 
As competition for such jobs is fierce, consider 
whether your application is likely to be competitive 
for the field.
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
The majority of graduate jobs are in SMEs: you 
are more likely to get a job with an SME than 
with a large company. According to BIS (2014), 
there were 4.8 million SMEs in the UK in 2013. 
This accounted for 99.95% of the total number of 
UK enterprises in the private sector, and 59% of 
employment in the UK Private Sector. The sector 
is dominated by businesses with fewer than 50 
employees. Three sectors account for 44% of 
employment in enterprises in all sectors, these 
being (a) Construction; (b) Professional, scientific 
and technical; and (c) Wholesale and retail (Sear et 
al., 2012).
The importance of work placements
In 2014, employers anticipated that 37% of their 
graduate entry level positions would be given to 
graduates who had worked with them already 
in a work placement, paid internship or vacation 
work (High Fliers Research, 2014). Such experience 
gives a head start in gaining work with a company. 
However, it may also be reassuring to note that 
if you didn’t get a placement with your first 
choice of employer, the large majority of their job 
opportunities don’t go to those who have worked 
for them already.
‘Most wanted’ characteristics
Based on a survey of over 200 employers, large 
and small, Pennington et al. (2013) found 
employers gave their highest ratings to the 
following four items (out of eleven possible items).
(a)	 Interest in role
(b)	 Organisational fit
(c)	 Skills
(d)	 Work experience.
These findings are not untypical of various surveys 
of employers. However, each employer will give 
a different weighting to such characteristics and 
to their own organisational needs, so must be 
researched separately.
Behaviours, values and attitudes
Different sectors and companies look for particular 
characteristics in their staff. Pharmaceutical giant 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) expects all employees, 
whether new graduates or top management, to 
demonstrate a small set of key behaviours, which 
are available via their website. This emphasis on 
‘behaviours’ is not unusual in large companies.
252
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

On the other hand, charities tend to put their 
emphasis on values. Law companies tend to lay 
emphasis on ‘passion’ for working in the legal 
field, commercial awareness, and people skills 
(TARGETjobs Law, 2014).
Evidence of career planning
Pennington et al. (2013) found that employers 
place value on students’ having engaged in extra-
curricular activities – but that students did not 
always recognise this or take it seriously. Employers 
also expect students to have firm career ideas by 
their final year and to show evidence of career 
planning. It is probably worth noting that the 
majority of employers don’t know about the 
Higher Education Achievement Record (HEAR) 
used in UK universities, so it is best not to assume 
that they know what this is. Instead, draw on this 
to answer their questions.
Importance of degree classification?
Many employers state that they want a 2.1 or first 
class degree for some or all of their graduate posts. 
However, overall, Pennington’s research found that 
both large companies and SMEs rated a 2.1 degree 
only fifth in importance out of 11 selection criteria.
Importance of educational 
institution?
In a list of 11 selection criteria, employers rated 
‘university attended’ 10th, just ahead of ‘school 
attended’. Overall, 74% of employers stated that 
their decisions to offer a job were not influenced 
by a graduate’s institution. However, this was more 
pronounced for large companies, 91% of which 
agreed they were not influenced by the institution, 
compared with only 64% of SMEs.
Despite this, because of the costs involved, over 
40% of employers preferred to focus recruitment 
on a limited number of specific institutions. They 
targeted institutions with the right courses for their 
field, and those in their geographical area.
Mobility and flexibility
Geographical mobility: large employers seek 
graduates prepared to be mobile to take up work; 
they find graduates, especially those from low-
income backgrounds, tend to prefer to return to 
their home region after university (Pennington et 
al., 2013).
Job mobility: employers also prefer graduates 
who are mobile in moving between sectors and 
job roles early on in their career. Docherty and 
Fernandez (2014) note that this may ‘come as a 
surprise to graduates and HE providers, for whom 
advice has emphasised a focus on developing skills 
and experience in a particular subject or sector of 
employment’.
UCAS tariff points
A third of large employers stipulate a minimum 
UCAS tariff (large employers are three times as 
likely as SMEs to state this).
What do SMEs want from graduates?
SMEs are far more varied than large employers, 
not least because there are so many of them. It can 
be hard to find generic information about SMEs. 
You may need to check with occupational sectors, 
sector skills councils, professional organisations and 
trade magazines for information about SMEs in 
particular occupational areas.
Miller (2014) identified the top attributes of the 
employees of small businesses as the following:
1	 Bringing a ‘can do’ attitude and willingness to 
work beyond the core job description
2	 Welcoming new opportunities and looking for 
opportunities to develop their role
3	 Holding ambitions for the company where they 
work, seeking entrepreneurial opportunities for 
it
4	 Working well in small teams
5	 Being innovative, coming up with new ideas 
and ways of doing things better.

What do employers really want?

What employers want: work readiness
What is work readiness?
Employers say they want students 
to be work-ready. Having any 
work, whether paid or voluntary, 
part-time or full-time, helps to 
develop an understanding of 
what this entails. ‘Work readiness’ 
is hard to define precisely, but 
includes the following attributes.
Attitude
Employers want to take on new 
staff who identify with the needs 
of their business. Generally, 
employers are more likely to 
employ you if you:
•• bring a ‘can-do’ attitude, 
undertaking reasonable tasks 
when asked (rather than when 
you feel like it or finding excuses 
not to)
•• take pride in your work, going 
the extra mile when needed and 
being professional in all you do
•• use time effectively, being 
punctual for work and meetings, 
and getting work done 
efficiently
•• spend work time efficiently, 
remaining focused on your job 
rather than texting and phoning 
family and friends, browsing 
the internet for personal use, 
running personal errands, 
sorting out relationship issues, 
day-dreaming, writing your 
novel, playing computer games, 
taking long breaks, etc.
•• are generally helpful and 
flexible, taking on additional 
paid hours or changing work 
hours, or working in a new 
location, if needed.
Professionalism
In a professional role: this means having the abilities and skills 
to undertake the specialist work associated with the role, to the 
required professional standards and adhering to relevant codes of 
practice.
In general: for any role, this is about the way you approach 
your work at all times. It involves setting out to produce work 
of a consistently high standard, with attention to such things as 
accuracy, precision, timeliness, punctuality, courtesy, sensitivity, 
and respect for the dignity, safety and well-being of others.
‘Customer service’ approach
Employers usually want staff who are able and willing to ‘put the 
customer first’, even when this might be inconvenient or difficult. 
The same is true if the ‘customer’ is a client, student, patient 
or member of the public making an enquiry. There are usually 
protocols to follow about what to do and what to say in difficult 
situations. This is also a question of attitude and professionalism.
A ‘safe pair of hands’
Employers value staff who they can depend on to:
•• get the job done as they would want
•• make sensible, workable decisions that are suitable to the 
context
•• meet deadlines and other given requirements
•• avoid reckless, unprofessional or risky or unwanted behaviours.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

What employers want: work readiness
Initiative
Using your initiative in the workplace means:
•• working independently – getting on with your job 
with minimum direction
•• being resourceful – using imagination and 
inventiveness to address a problem or issue in a 
practical way
•• being proactive – rather than waiting to be asked to 
do something or responding to what emerges, take 
action or ask how you can help
•• looking for improvements and alternatives – 
thinking beyond the immediate task to consider how 
the overall outcome or process could be improved, 
and then taking your idea forward through the 
correct channels for the organisation
•• knowing when to act – developing a fine sense of 
when it is appropriate for you to come up with your 
own ideas and ways of getting things done, and 
when it is more important to follow protocols exactly
•• seizing opportunity – being able to spot occasions 
for advancing the business interests in the moment, 
often in a small but appropriate way, and getting on 
with it.
Understand how organisations work
Although it is unlikely that you will need to answer 
direct questions about how businesses operate, 
employers will look to see your general commercial and 
business awareness. They will notice if you don’t seem 
to understand the basics.
(a)	 Browse employers’ websites and financial reports 
on-line to get a feel for how businesses are run and 
the kinds of things that concern them.
(b)	Become familiar with concepts such as
•• ‘end-users’, shareholders, stakeholders
•• vision, mission, strategy and business plans
•• company values
•• financial sustainability; profit and loss;
•• company performance; performance indicators; 
targets
•• staff appraisal, performance management.
(c)	 The checklists ‘Make effective use of your 
experience of work’ (pp. 280–2) provide a 
structured way of thinking through some of the 
above issues.
Understanding why ‘time = 
money’
‘Time is money’ is a well-known adage in 
business. Broadly speaking, employers have 
a range of costs such as salaries, pensions, 
accommodation, maintenance, insurance, 
utilities and investment, all of which 
they have to cover even if they have less 
money coming in because of time wasted. 
When taking on new staff, employers will 
be looking for people who can use time 
efficiently.
Commercial/business sense
Increasingly, employers are asking 
for ‘business acumen’ or commercial 
understanding, especially for graduate jobs 
and management or team leader roles. They 
look for some evidence of interest in the 
kinds of issues relevant to their business. This 
might be such matters as: whether there is 
a good market currently for its goods; how 
that market might be changing; customer 
demographics; likely new competition or 
opportunities at home or overseas; costs; 
logistics; technological changes or recent 
innovations and their impact. If you are 
interested in the company, then you should 
be able to give sensible answers based on 
some research, some thought, and common 
sense.
You can build your commercial awareness for 
the kinds of business that interest you by:
•• taking optional modules in business, 
enterprise or entrepreneurship
•• reading trade or professional magazines
•• a relevant work-placement or internship
•• browsing questions and answers on 
LinkedIn
•• talking to your Careers Service about 
relevant sources of information and 
websites.
255
What do employers really want?

What employers want: specialists or generalists?
Subject specialists or 
‘generalists’?
Almost all employers have graduate jobs 
open to students of any discipline. This 
is true even in sectors that may appear 
specialist, such as finance, management, 
accounting, HR, law, marketing, 
communications and advertising: these 
have jobs open to graduates of any 
degree subject, especially for those 
who achieve a good degree grade/
classification – not just for those with 
specialist degrees.
Some roles do require a particular 
degree subject and specialist knowledge 
and expertise. That is especially the case 
for professional and technical roles such 
as in medicine and health, engineering 
and languages.
Even when a specialism is required, this 
is used as an initial filter to cut down the 
field of applicants. After that, employers 
look at all the other attributes a 
candidate may bring. For specialist roles, 
an applicant with the right specialist 
degree, a rounded portfolio and who 
meets the person specification will have 
a good chance of being short-listed.
Rounded applicants
Not all employers value subject 
specialisation. Increasingly, and 
especially in the international labour 
market, value is being placed on 
graduates who can draw flexibly across 
a range of disciplines and experiences. 
This position was articulated in the 
report An Avalanche is Coming:
The trend in the academy towards 
specialisation, which is at least a century 
old, continues unabated, but citizens 
of the world now cry out for synthesis – 
synthesis now provided largely outside 
of the academy by organisations such as 
OECD. (Barber et al., 2013, p. 17)
There is a growing interest in employees who demonstrate 
a breadth of knowledge and experiences, who can connect 
these up, contextualise them, and identify the opportunities 
that arise. Steve Jobs, founder of Apple, wrote that, for the 
field of design and technology, it was essential for employees 
to be able to draw on as wide a range of experiences as 
possible (Jobs, 2011).
Like many innovators, he saw the value of a broad education 
rather than a narrow focus on a particular specialism alone.
Ability to innovate and integrate skills
Employers look for people who demonstrate that they can 
come up with soundly based ideas and then carry these 
through. Shell (2014), for example, stated:
We’re looking for people with the intellectual, analytical and 
creative ability to learn quickly, identify issues and propose 
solutions. Can you reach informed conclusions through broad 
thinking? Can you work with incomplete or conflicting data and 
take well-calculated risks? Have you ever identified new ways of 
doing things based on an analysis of current conditions, data 
and feedback?
Shell also states that its ideal candidates should display an 
ability to work effectively as part of a diverse team and form 
mutually beneficial, long-term working relationships, as well 
as demonstrate characteristics and achievements which could 
identify them as future leaders.
You might like to consider how you would demonstrate such 
abilities – and how you could develop them.
Broad approach to development
Typically, employers will be interested in your broad personal 
development. That is why universities and colleges encourage 
students to take part in activities outside of the formal 
curriculum and to start to build their CV as early as possible.
Reflection: Being a strong generalist
As there are so many jobs available for graduates with 
good generic abilities, it is worth considering how you 
would demonstrate how you could draw on a wide range 
of experiences.
What could you do to broaden your knowledge, expertise 
base and abilities further to better match the descriptions 
outlined above?
256
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

What employers want: how does this change?
How stable are employers’ 
requirements?
When studying for your qualification, it is 
reasonable to wonder whether the skills that 
you are developing now will still be those that 
employers will want in a few years’ time. Broadly 
speaking, the list of ‘most wanted skills’ does not 
change significantly over time but the range of 
skills required is extended.
Activity
Continuities and changes in 
employers’ requirements
Compare the themes that occur in the employer 
skills needs (identified on p. 258) and Miller’s 
report (2014) (p. 253).
•• Note which skills needs remain constant.
•• Note the additional skills that have appeared 
recently.
•• Where do your own strengths and skills gaps 
lie with respect to these?
1998 TMP Research
Research by TMP Worldwide Research (1998) 
found the top five skills most valued by employers 
were: 
•• oral communication
•• team working
•• listening
•• written 
communication
•• problem-solving.
1998 CVCP Report
In 1998, the Committee of University Vice-
Chancellors (CVCP) commissioned research by 
Coopers and Lybrand to identify ‘employability 
skills’ for graduates. This outlined four categories of 
graduate attributes.
1  Traditional intellectual skills
The ability to: evaluate evidence critically; argue 
logically; apply theory to practice; model problems 
qualitatively and quantitatively; challenge taken-
for-granted assumptions.
2  Core or key skills
Communication; application of number; working 
with others; information and communications 
technology; improving one’s own performance.
3  Personal attributes
Self-reliance; adaptability; flexibility; ‘nous’; 
creativity.
4  Knowledge about how organisations work
The report points out that it is important that 
employability skills include this fourth area.
2009 CBI report
Ten years later, employers continued to want such 
skills but new items were being added to the list, 
such as ‘cultural awareness’. For example, in March 
2009, the CBI (Confederation of British Industry) 
and Universities UK released the report ‘Future fit – 
preparing graduates for the world of work’, based 
on a survey of 581 employers.
Employers rated ‘Employability skills’ as the most 
important factor in recruiting graduates. They 
were keen to find self-management, team working 
and a ‘can do’ approach in applicants. They were 
broadly satisfied with graduates’ IT and numeracy 
skills, but less than satisfied by how well graduates 
were able to demonstrate skills in communication 
and literacy, business and customer awareness, and 
self-management.
2011 Lowden report
A report by Lowden et al. (2011) of HEIs and 22 
leading employer organisations such as the CBI, 
the Association of Graduate Recruiters and Council 
for Industry in Higher Education (CIHE) identified 
employers’ ‘most wanted’ characteristics. The top 
five skills and attributes most sought in graduate 
employees were:
•• team working
•• problem-solving
•• self-management
•• knowledge of the business
•• literacy and numeracy skills relevant to the post.
257
What do employers really want?

What employers want: most-wanted skills
Leadership and management
In practice, employers are often looking for 
graduates who can step up quickly into managerial 
roles. That is why they are keen to see evidence of 
the following:
•• ‘Academic’ / intellectual skills: strategic thinking, 
making good decisions, exercising good 
judgement, analysing information, finding 
solutions, bringing a creative or innovative 
approach.
•• People / interpersonal skills: managing 
relationships in the work place, team work, 
communicating clearly, inspiring, encouraging 
and supporting to get things done well and 
efficiently, understanding customers, clients and 
competitors.
•• Task-management / operational skills: 
organisational skills, managing projects, setting 
goals, developing systems and processes, 
monitoring performance, using resources 
efficiently, managing money, all with attention 
to detail.
•• Self-management / intrapersonal skills: the 
ability to manage your own needs, emotions, 
motivation and development so that you are 
able to work well under pressure and focus on 
your responsibilities.
Reflection: Using employers’ steer
The quotations from employers in this chapter, 
and the lists and other information provided, 
offer insights into what employers want.
•• From these, what messages do you take away 
as relevant to you?
•• How can you act upon those messages?
Skills for particular jobs
Advertisements usually list the most important 
features of the job, including skills requirements. 
Browsing through the job advertisements 
associated with career areas that interest you will 
help you form a picture of the relevant skills for 
you to develop.
Activity
Job advertisements
•• Find at least 20 advertisements for jobs 
in career areas that interest you. To find 
these, you can look in locations such as 
the Careers Service vacancy bulletin, main 
national newspapers and leading websites for 
graduate vacancies (see pp. 385–6).
•• For the range of jobs that most interest you, 
which kinds of skills are referred to the most 
often?
How strong are your own skills in these areas?
•• Complete competence sheets (pp. update 
346–82) for the skills relevant to your career 
interests and place these in your personal 
records.
Skills in context: same words, 
different assumptions
Although employers and job adverts may use the 
same words as HEIs when speaking of skills, the 
terminology often means something different 
in a work context. Employers do value the skills 
developed by a university or college education, 
but do not always understand or value examples of 
these drawn from academic contexts. They like to 
see examples of those skills being used in work and 
‘real-life’ contexts.
Pages 260–6  can help you to break down your 
skills into some of their component parts, and to 
identify how these might be articulated in ways 
that make more sense to employers.

What employers say
UK Top 300 (2013–14)
In The Guardian UK 300 – The UK’s most 
popular graduate recruiters 2013/14, the 
following core skills were identified by the 
majority of the companies featured:
1	 Ability to work under pressure
2	 Attention to detail
3	 Commercial awareness
4	 Communication Skills
5	 Creativity
6	 Team work skills
Disciplined ambition
I like to see someone with a lot of ambition, 
that doesn’t flow into arrogance; somebody 
who is hungry to learn, but at the same time 
is disciplined to actually put it into practice 
and put the hard work in. (Juergen Maier, 
Chief Executive, Siemens Industry UK; in The 
Guardian UK 300 – The UK’s most popular 
graduate recruiters 2013/14) 
Leadership and responsibility
Less is more – we’d suggest you get very 
involved in one or two clubs and societies that 
you join and take a leadership role. Recruiters 
will be more impressed with a president’s 
role at one society than being involved at a 
basic level in four societies. (Donna Miller, 
Enterprise Rent-A-Car – European HR 
Director, in Sharp (2012) ‘What do employers 
look for in graduates?)
Coping flexibly with precise demands
We need people who can manage the realities of today’s 
workplace, who can juggle many projects at once, 
delivering all to a deadline. In a new graduate, we would 
want to see that they have experience of working on 
complex projects, have a good eye for detail, can cope 
with stress, get along with others and be flexible as needs 
arise. They will need to take on responsibility straight 
away, so we need to know they can handle that. (Chief 
Executive, SME, creative and digital sector)
Attitude is key for us. We look for candidates that are 
hungry for a job within our company. By that, we mean 
that it is evident from the care they took to research 
our company, to consider what we are looking for, and 
provide us with strong evidence that they can deliver 
what we need. (General Manager, manufacturing and 
engineering)
Reflection: What employers say
How well would you match up to each of these 
employer demands?
•• Which of the 6 skills identified by the UK Top 300 
do you consider are your strongest?
•• Which of those 6 skills do you need to develop 
most?
Do employers value graduates?
Each year, employers invest time and money in visiting 
HEIs to talk to students about job opportunities in 
their businesses, in creating placements, internships 
and graduate training schemes, advertising for 
graduates, setting up assessment centres for graduate 
recruitment, and interviewing students and new 
graduates. All this indicates that employers, especially 
large businesses, value graduates.

Translating academic skills for the workplace
Do employers value academic skills?
Although employers search out graduate 
employees, you may find that they have a more 
ambivalent approach to academic skills, or are 
uncertain what these might be. As academic 
skills are integral to gaining a degree, this might 
surprise you. However, whilst being sceptical 
about the value of academic study, some 
employers consider that a degree indicates that 
an applicant is bright and intelligent. It is up to 
you to find ways of demonstrating the value of 
academic skills to their business.
Which academic skills?
Most workplaces would gain from the 
application of academic skills such as:
•• Research skills
•• Information management
•• Synthesising ideas and/or information
•• Writing up and presenting reports
•• Critical reflection on practice
•• Analysis, criticism and evaluation.
You may find it helpful to break key academic 
skills into their component sub-skills, as in the 
self-evaluation opposite. It is generally easier 
to see how sub-skills could be applied to a 
workplace.
What employers say
More than anything, I value critical, analytic 
thinkers. I need to know staff can handle complex 
information, make sense of it for themselves, and 
present it in ways that make sense to me and my 
company. I need them to do the thinking, and 
be able to explain to me clearly why they are 
recommending a course of action. (CEO of a UK 
national charity)
We look for people who combine academic 
excellence with common sense. (Recruitment 
brochure; Travers Smith LLP)

Writing skills for the workplace
The value of academic writing 
skills
For most courses in higher education, writing 
tasks play an important part. Depending 
on the kind of tasks that you undertook for 
your course, it is likely that you will have 
developed written communication skills that 
are highly relevant to the workplace.
Writing skills – for work and 
study
Ideally, by your final year, you should 
be able to write accurately, at speed, 
to deadlines, selecting the most salient 
points, structuring these and clarifying 
their significance, drafting copy and proof-
reading it, to produce a fluent, well-styled, 
relevant piece of writing for specific purposes 
and audiences. If you have developed such 
writing skills, then you are likely to do well 
in your studies. Such skills are real assets in 
employment. Conversely, if your written skills 
are weak, then it is worth fine-tuning them.
Note that, even if this is not specified, it will 
probably be assumed that you have perfect 
grammar, spelling and punctuation, and that 
all aspects of your application will be well 
proof-read and error-free.
What employers say
Communication, both written and verbal, is 
really important and I look for people who have 
an energy and spark about them. (Danella 
Bagnall, Vehicle Architecture Planning 
Director, Jaguar Landrover; The Guardian UK 
300 The UK’s most popular graduate recruiters 
2013/14)
If I see silly mistakes in an application, even 
in a covering email, I bin it. I am not going 
to have time to correct their work if I appoint 
them. (Managing Director, SME)
Make opportunities
Experience of writing for audiences outside of your 
academic studies enhances your CV. Businesses, 
charities and community projects may appreciate help 
with tasks such as the following:
•• Summaries of press clippings, position papers, 
government documents, research papers, and 
information about funding proposals
•• Informational literature, such as posters, leaflets, 
web-materials, articles in a trade magazine or 
community newspaper
•• Promotional materials such as fliers, webpages
•• Social media writing – such as a community, twitter 
feeds in a professional context, team or manager’s 
blog, Facebook or LinkedIn pages
•• Staff literature, such as compiling or updating 
manuals, the staff handbook, a website, policy 
documents.
There may be good opportunities in your institution; 
workplace; place of worship; a student society or for a 
local community group. Some starting places would 
be:
•• Your Student Union
•• Careers and Employability Services
•• Chaplaincy and student mentoring services
•• Volunteering Services on campus or in the local 
community
•• Community centres
•• Enterprise and Innovation Centres.

Oral communication skills for the workplace
Good verbal communication skills are real 
assets in the workplace. For most jobs, such 
skills are required continually in day-to-day 
work, whereas written communications may 
be used less frequently.
Evidencing your verbal skills
Students often cite ‘presenting a 
seminar paper’ as an example of ‘oral 
communication’. Leading a seminar is a 
valuable experience and does develop 
public speaking skills. However, formal 
presentations are not typical of everyday 
working life.
It is probable, at work, that you will need 
verbal skills for meetings, formal and 
informal, to contribute as a team member 
to discussions, or to explain matters to 
clients, customers and colleagues. Employers 
will be interested to hear about how you 
have communicated with different kinds 
of people, fielded difficult questions or 
contributed to discussions in workshops, 
projects, on-line or in work contexts.
What employers say
I need my front line staff to be able to 
provide clear, accurate information to 
the public. They need to respond quickly 
to what they are hearing, adapting the 
message to suit the customer. Team leaders 
and managers must excel at communication 
in order to resolve difficult situations quickly 
and effectively. (General Manager, call 
centre for large, international utility 
company)

People skills for the workplace
Skills in a team context
At university, because you are working towards 
a qualification that is awarded on an individual 
basis, you are judged primarily on your individual 
effort. In the workplace, whilst individual input is 
still valued, the team and wider company goals are 
more important points of reference.
When employers refer to creativity, 
communication, problem-solving or any other 
skills, they tend to assume that you understand 
that it isn’t just about whether you shine at these 
things alone. They want to know how well you 
can apply skills and draw on your knowledge and 
experience when working with colleagues, clients 
and other people.
They will also be looking to see that you 
understand that your development of such skills is 
not just about your personal satisfaction, but has 
relevance and adds value to the work of the team 
and the organisation.
What employers say
I need to feel confident that every member of my 
staff exhibits my charity’s values in all of their 
interactions with our children and young people, 
their parents and carers and with their colleagues 
too. Valuing diversity and respect for all is at the 
heart of our work and I want to be able to see 
that through things such as taking the time to 
listen to what children and young people want, 
advocating on others’ behalf and making sure that 
everyone who has contact with my organisation 
is treated in the way they would like to be treated 
themselves. The tougher the task, the more I need 
to know that they can stay connected with what 
really matters to us. (CEO, Charity for disabled 
children and young people)

Task management skills for the workplace
Task Management skills
Good task management or ‘operational’ skills 
are essential at work. Employers tend to assume 
that graduate employees will have developed 
these skills.
Student life often involves a great deal of 
independent study, with most time left 
unscheduled. If you already manage your time 
well, working in a systematic way, with well-
established routines, then you have a good 
basis on which to build further development of 
the operational skills needed for employment. If 
not, then start now to develop such skills:
•• Establish a daily routine
•• Develop systematic planned approaches to 
larger tasks and assignments
•• Fine-tune underlying functional skills 
in literacy, numeracy and information 
technology
•• Find projects where you can help with the 
management and organisation – or devise 
your own. (You may find it useful to use 
Cottrell, 2014.)
What employers say
As well as looking for graduates with potential, we 
want to recruit the technical leaders of tomorrow. 
These are individuals who can lead teams in 
designing and supporting the projects upon which 
we can continue to build the business. (RDS, the 
rig design and engineering specialist)
I want someone who is going to keep a sound 
grip on our projects. I want to feel reassured 
that the projects would be well managed, that 
I would be given early warnings of potential 
risks or problems, preferably with realistic 
proposals for resolving these. (CEO of UK 
national charity)
Reflection: Task management skills
•• Which task management skills have you gained 
as a student, either through your course, work 
placements or co-curricular activities?
•• Where else could you develop such skills to 
broaden your skills base?

Self-management ‘skills’ for the workplace
Why are self-management skills 
valued?
Independence
It is an obvious advantage to an employer if an 
employee can work out quickly what is required 
of them at work and then just get on with the job 
without much guidance. If an employee is well-
organised, responsible, and manages their time 
well, they are more productive. This saves on staff 
costs or opens up new opportunities for using that 
staff time.
Coping with change and challenge
The labour market is changing so quickly that it is 
a real advantage to be able to manage change and 
uncertainty well.
Change can be experienced as exciting, or 
stressful, or both. It requires you to move from 
known and safe terrain into the unknown. You 
may have to alter ingrained habits, adapt your 
preferred ways of working, learn new skills, adopt 
new working patterns, assimilate into a new team, 
move site and change your home or your travel 
plans. You may have to cope with disruption.
Employers value candidates who can demonstrate 
that they have encountered difficulty and 
challenge and managed these well, learning from 
experience.
What employers say
... so you won’t expect to be spoon fed. You’ll be 
eager to throw your ideas into the mix, shoulder your 
fair share of responsibility and prove you know how 
to put customers first. (Heinz, 2014)

Self-employment allows you to work to 
your own values
Being your own employer: pros and cons
So far we have considered what an employer might want when that 
employer is someone other than yourself. There is also the option of 
being your own employer, whether as a sole-trader or micro-business, 
freelance professional, small to medium-sized business owner, or 
growing a small business into a large company.
There are a number of professional areas such as in law, finance, 
accounting, psychology and architecture where, once you have 
experience and chartered status, you can set up your own practice.
If the idea of having your own business appeals, then it is essential to 
think this through in meticulous detail.
The benefits
If you have a good idea for a marketable service or product, and 
can sell it at a profit, then you can reap many benefits from self-
employment.
•• You can follow your own vision and take forward your own ideas 
with fewer restrictions.
•• You have more control over your own destiny, more responsibility 
for success or failure.
•• You can work to your own values: you have a larger say in the 
culture, ethos and lifestyle associated with your workplace.
•• It suits those who want to work in creative, design, digital and 
performance industries, and also in retail, consultancy, coaching, 
counselling, therapies, translation, hospitality – and many other 
areas.
•• You may be able to choose your own hours, so you can combine 
work flexibly with creative, leisure or family commitments.
•• It can be really exciting and rewarding to take an idea to market and 
see it succeed.
•• If the business is successful, you may take a larger share of the 
profits.
Realities
Working your own hours
In general, to make your 
business work, you have to be 
prepared to work very long 
hours, especially in the first 
few years. Most entrepreneurs 
are so passionate about their 
concept that they don’t 
count the hours they work.
Being in charge
Being in charge does not 
mean that you get to do 
everything your own way. 
You have to listen carefully to 
your potential market and to 
anyone who invests, whether 
friends, family, partners, 
banks, or crowd-funders, 
taking their views on board. 
You may have to adapt 
your concept, product and 
plans to suit the market and 
investors.
Making a lot of money
It is possible to make a great 
amount of money if your 
business is a success. Some 
companies, especially some 
on-line start-ups, have been 
overnight successes.	
When starting out, and 
especially if borrowing money 
to invest, be realistic. Most 
businesses are small and 
remain small. You may make 
small profits – or a loss.
267
What do employers really want?

Being your own employer: pros and cons
Responsibilities
Being an employer carries specific 
responsibilities, and these increase 
depending on the size of your 
workforce and your turnover.
•• The first responsibility is finding out 
what are your responsibilities and 
liabilities – you are in charge, so you 
are expected to know.
•• If you borrow money to get started 
or to invest in development, you 
are responsible for making sure 
your investors get their money back 
as well as agreed returns on their 
investment.
•• For your goods and services, you 
have a responsibility to deliver on 
what you promise.
•• You are responsible for the health 
and safety of employees, those 
visiting your work premises, and 
anyone using your goods and 
services.
•• If you have employees, you have 
responsibilities to them, such as 
payment of pensions, employee 
national insurance, the minimum 
wage, and adhering to employment 
law, etc.
•• It is up to you to ensure that 
you meet all legal and financial 
requirements, including those 
relating to taxes, the environment, 
equality, health and safety, 
data protection, charity and/or 
companies law, staff malpractice, 
goods and services, etc.
•• You need to arrange insurance 
cover, to meet all your liabilities.
The risks
A high proportion of new enterprises fail. In some sectors, 
this is as high as 90%. Make sure you are aware of the likely 
pitfalls. Here are some reasons why businesses fail.
They spend too much on start-
up costs, assuming that they will 
make bigger profits in the early 
years than is likely to be the case. 
For example, they invest heavily 
in refurbishing premises and in 
new plant rather than making do 
with serviceable and affordable 
options, such as recycled or 
second-hand plant.
They don’t undertake a full 
cost analysis that covers all the 
incidentals such as insurance, 
energy, distribution costs, 
maintenance, wastage, slow 
markets, and myriad other things. 
All of the small items can add up 
to a significant amount, and total 
more than the obvious, larger 
items. They can eat into cash flow.
They don’t watch cash flow. 
Without available cash to pay 
salaries, invest in stock, etc., 
even a large business can fold.
They don’t understand the 
market. This may be because 
they don’t conduct the right 
kind of market analysis, select 
the right kind of focus groups, 
or interpret their findings 
correctly. Generally, people 
love their own business idea, so 
they think others will too. They 
can assume a larger market for 
the product than is actually 
the case and/or underestimate 
competition.
268
Employability: enhancing your career prospects
 I want everything to 
look shiny and bright
... and then just a few 
other bits and pieces 
which shouldn’t amount 
to much more money
I think it is a great idea and 
my mum says so too. I really 
believe it will sell!

Great idea – will it really work?
Be enthusiastic for your idea, but also be hard-
headed: can it really work?
Being your own employer: eight essentials
1	 A concept. Your starting place is having an 
idea for a product or service. This must be 
yours to sell, so check first whether anyone 
already holds the patent. If so, consider 
whether your concept could be adapted to 
be made sufficiently different for patenting 
in its own right. Find out about patents and 
intellectual property at the Intellectual Property 
Office at www.ipo.gov.uk.
business located? How would you distribute 
your product and at what cost? What might 
restrict you in getting your product to market, 
or in scaling up your business? The answers 
would be different depending on whether 
you are trading in ice-cream, digital services, 
logistics or acupuncture.
5	 Finance and financial planning. You will 
need to obtain finance to get started, though 
it is possible to start and keep businesses afloat 
with a good idea, a small initial outlay and 
plenty of hard work.
•• Use any free financial advice available. See 
page 386.
•• Consider taking an enterprise course.
•• Produce a business plan, including a detailed 
financial plan. See www.startupdonut.co.uk.
6	 An exit strategy. Take advice on how to 
manage the business finances so that, if the 
business does not succeed as planned, you can 
afford to pay your debts, cover any losses and 
not go bankrupt.
7	 Skills and mind-set. You need the motivation, 
skills and drive to ‘make it happen’. You have 
to be: prepared to work long hours; systematic 
in planning; disciplined in sticking to targets; 
willing to keep yourself and others focused 
and on task; able to negotiate with others and 
persuade people to believe in you and your 
product. If you can, find a good mentor as a 
sounding board, and partners or employees 
whose skills and qualities complement your 
own – then value what they offer and listen to 
what they say.
8	 A first step. All businesses have to start 
somewhere. If the idea excites you, then speak 
to an expert adviser. There is a wealth of free 
advice and support available for entrepreneurs, 
including students. Visit the Employability/
Careers Service or see page 386.
2	 A brand and selling point. What makes your 
product or service stand out in the market? 
What does it have that would make customers 
choose that over others? How would people 
recognise your product and your promotional 
materials and messages as yours rather than a 
competitor’s?
3	 A market. However brilliant your concept 
looks to you and your friends, it has to be 
one that will sell. Your sales have to generate 
sufficient income to cover all costs, including 
your salary.
Investigate your market carefully and 
thoroughly. Have similar projects been 
tried already? If these were successful, have 
competitors captured most of the potential 
market already? If they failed, were there 
particular reasons? Think carefully about what 
lessons you can learn from the existing market, 
both looking at business ideas and those that 
haven’t captured a market.
4	 A route to market. Even if there is a potential 
market, you need to think through how 
potential customers would find out about your 
business and be able to purchase your goods 
and services. How would you promote your 
products? If on-line, how could customers 
check the product is right for them? Where 
are your products manufactured and/or the 
269
What do employers really want?

Closing comments
In recent years, there has been a growing 
interest in ‘employability’ skills. Students say 
they want jobs, employers say they want 
employability skills, and higher education 
institutions have responded. Most HEIs now 
provide a broad range of opportunities for their 
students to develop such skills, whether through 
the curriculum, alongside it, or both.
It is up to you to make sure that you:
•• Understand the generic requirements of 
today’s employers, so that you can broaden 
the range of job opportunities open to you
•• Understand the specific attributes required for 
graduate, specialist and management jobs in 
areas that particularly interest you, so that you 
are well-placed when applying for these
•• Make use of the opportunities on offer to you 
through your institution, or external to it, so 
that you don’t miss out and so that you come 
across to employers as well-motivated and 
forward-thinking
•• Are well informed about opportunities on 
offer, so that you are in a position to apply for 
these and make effective use of them, as and 
when they arise.
You make yourself more ‘employable’ if you 
match what employers are looking for. There is 
a vast range of easily accessible information that 
can help you to develop for yourself a sense of 
what employers want. Your university or college 
careers service will also be keen to point you in 
the right direction.
In preparing for future work roles, whether for 
your first job, your first ‘graduate job’ or your 
next promotion, it is common sense to identify 
the kinds of qualifications, experience, skills and 
qualities that tend to be associated with that role 
and then to take steps to acquire these.
Your experience as a student will have 
developed your skills in all kinds of ways, often 
gradually over time, so that you may not be 
aware that this has occurred. Take time to stand 
back and reflect upon such things as:
•• What kinds of activities you have undertaken 
repeatedly over your time as a student – 
continual practice is likely to fine-tune your 
abilities
•• How, exactly, such abilities have developed – 
so that you can describe your strengths more 
precisely
•• How these abilities would be relevant in work 
contexts – consider how you would persuade 
employers of this through examples that make 
sense in a work context.
This chapter has focused on employability from 
the perspective of the employer. Understanding 
the labour market and knowing what employers 
want from their new staff recruits are important 
aspects of gaining the job you want. The 
following chapter looks in more detail at 
employability from the perspective of you, the 
job applicant – what you want and what you 
can do to manage the job application process 
successfully.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• reflect on four key stages in career planning, identifying where to focus your energies
•• decide what you want from your first, or next, job
•• plan, and act, ahead in order to put yourself in the strongest possible position when applying for 
jobs
•• extract the most value from work placements or current employment, to benefit your future job 
applications
•• make a strong job application, managing the appointments process effectively from start to finish.
Chapter 10
Getting the job you want
Aspire – aspire to the best possible jobs and career 
routes for yourself, whether short-term or longer-
term.
Act – act now so as to improve your chances of 
getting the jobs you want.
Apply – apply for the right jobs for you in the most 
effective way possible.
Achieve – achieve the grades, skills, confidence 
and experiences that will, in turn, help you to 
achieve well both academically and in gaining a 
good job.
All this is not acquired overnight, so the sooner 
you start thinking and planning, the more 
successful you are likely to be.
Introduction
Applying for jobs is an art in itself. It is no longer 
sufficient to send a CV to a host of employers and 
hope that one will notice you. The quality of your 
application is more important than applying in 
bulk: tailor your application to each employer and 
role.
For almost every job, you can expect strong 
competition – others will want that job just as 
much as you do. There are likely to be applicants 
who will have planned ahead for several years 
towards just such an application, building an 
excellent CV based on a range of experiences. You 
can do the same.
It pays to start the process of thinking about 
employability and careers planning in a systematic 
way from early in your first year of study. This 
includes being willing to do the following:
271
What do employers really want?

Getting the job you deserve
Remember, a degree on its own won’t 
guarantee the job you have always wanted. The 
graduate labour market is very competitive: you 
need to make sure you are ready and able to 
compete with the very best.
Career Planning – When do I start?
It’s never too early to start planning your career. 
We recommend you start this process from day 
one of your studies. The key element is deciding 
what you want to do with your degree and 
putting together a plan to ensure this happens.
(Femi Bola MBE, Director of Careers and 
Employability, University of East London)
What gives students the edge?
… in my experience, academic credentials 
combined with evidence of transferable skill 
such as problem solving, communication and 
team work, tend to form the real threshold 
level for serious consideration in graduate 
selection processes. The key differentiators (the 
“deal breakers”) beyond this threshold are 
commercial awareness and career motivation.
Commercial awareness: this involves things 
like understanding why the organisation 
exists, its competitors, etc. The elements of 
the selection process which are designed 
to test this also test the applicants’ career 
motivation. It would … be very difficult to 
answer convincingly even a question such as 
“why have you applied for this role?” without 
a genuine understanding of the commercial 
issues relating to the business.
Be ‘authentic’: it might be helpful to think 
in terms of authenticity … Are there industry 
sectors and/or job roles about which you could 
talk with enthusiasm and apparently little effort 
because they genuinely reflect your interests? If 
so, your answers about these will feel authentic 
rather than forced or contrived.
(Dr Bob Gilworth, Director of College Careers Services, 
University of London Careers Group)
Employability positioning
Having long-term career objectives is ideal but, 
realistically, not everyone is in a position to 
define their long-term objectives … Apart from 
anything else, these objectives may change 
as more attractive ones emerge. Therefore, 
positioning oneself against an unknown future 
using education and training opportunities 
could be seen as a good investment.
What strategies can I adopt against an 
uncertain future?
•• Keep up to date with local labour market 
trends – local newspapers and local authority 
economic unit bulletins can reveal which 
sectors are recruiting, and skills and specialist 
qualification shortages
•• Keep in touch with your skills – reflect and 
build on your skills on a regular basis
•• Keep in touch with your aspirations – are 
there new things you may want to try?
•• Keep an eye on your future – consider how 
things might change, personally, politically or 
technologically.
(Mohammed Hussain, Academic Guidance 
Officer, University of Leeds)
Gaining success in the job market
In today’s job market the key to success isn’t 
just what you know. It’s how you apply that 
knowledge, how you sell yourself, how you 
connect with people and, increasingly, it’s also 
about having a global mind set. 
Investing time in planning how you will develop 
your personal and professional profile and 
committing your efforts towards a particular 
career path or career sectors will enable you to 
identify and make the most of opportunities in 
today’s job market.
(Joanne Beaumont, Head of Careers & 
Employability, University of Bradford)
What careers experts say …
272
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Career planning: Aspire, Act, Apply, Achieve
Planning your career is like planning for a journey:
•• Your planning can help to make the experience more 
enjoyable and, ultimately, successful.
•• You can’t plan for every eventuality, so you also have to 
be prepared for the unexpected.
What is ‘Career planning’?
Career planning is mainly about thinking ahead so you 
don’t miss out. It is about opening up possibilities rather 
than about precise outcomes.
It can appear rather off-putting, as it can sound as if you 
need to know your end point in order to plan towards 
it. Although that seems logical, it is not typical of career 
planning. Indeed, it is acknowledged that:
•• career paths are hard to predict
•• many students have little fixed idea about what they 
want to do when they graduate; those that do may 
change their minds along the way
•• life circumstances pan out differently than expected 
and personal interests change, so particular career 
routes close down or open up
•• the labour market changes, with old jobs disappearing 
and new jobs appearing.
Aspire, Act, Apply, Achieve
Broadly speaking, there are four stages to career 
planning; these could follow on from each other 
although, depending on when you start and when 
opportunities fall for you, they may run concurrently.
Aspire
•• Aim high. Whilst it is sensible to aim for jobs within 
your reach, it is just as important to be ambitious, 
aspiring to the best possible jobs and career outcomes 
for you.
•• Consider leadership options. For whatever field of 
work appeals to you, a leadership role may be open 
to you on graduation or in the future. Take steps to 
enable this possibility – even if you decide later that 
this is not for you. Consider the sections on leadership 
in this book.
•• Expand your options rather than limit them.
•• Be proactive in your aspiration, rather than just 
‘wishing and wanting’ or thinking ‘if only …’.
Act
Act now so as to improve your chances of 
getting the jobs you want. That includes:
•• Active self-reflection and self-
evaluation, so you know which 
strengths you can play to, and which 
areas to work on further.
•• Active planning, so you know when 
you will fit in different aspects of careers 
development.
•• Active engagement in activities and 
experiences that will build your CV.
•• Active decision-making, to provide 
focus for your career development and 
job applications.
Apply
•• Use the available work opportunities 
to build your experience; don’t wait too 
long for the perfect job or placement to 
come along.
•• Gain practice in applying for jobs, using 
workshops and mock interviews but also 
through real applications.
•• Tailor your application: select carefully 
where to apply, then fit your application 
to the employer and job.
Achieve
•• Academically: develop skills and habits 
that will enable you to gain the best 
possible grades, for their own sake and 
to improve your career options.
•• Professionally: both short-term and 
long-term.
•• Personally: develop in confidence and 
self-reliance; attain your own goals for 
success in life.

There are different models of what career development 
might look like ideally. You don’t necessarily have to 
know about these, but understanding some of the 
theory can help to put your own endeavours into a 
broader context. It can be reassuring to compare these 
with your own activity. The previous pages outline one 
‘model’ of career planning: Aspire, Act, Apply, Achieve 
(4 ‘A’s). Two other models are offered below for you to 
consider.
The Career EDGE model
Formulated by Dacre Pool and Sewell (2007), 
this identifies specific components that promote 
employability. These are:
1	 Career development learning, plus …
2	 Experience (work and life)
3	 Degree subject knowledge, understanding and skills
4	 Generic skills
5	 Emotional intelligence.
In the model, reflection and evaluation on these 
components build the self-confidence, self-efficacy and 
self-esteem that lead to employability. Interestingly, 
although the model includes experience of work, it does 
not specifically refer to employability skills.
Reflection: Experience of work
What would you find useful about this model?
The model refers to experience of work. 
Such experience on its own doesn’t 
necessarily produce relevant knowledge and 
understanding. How do you think people could 
make use of such experience to make it most 
meaningful for their own career advancement? 
(See pages 280–2, ‘Make effective use of your 
experience of work’.)
The Career Management model
Bridgstock (2009) argues that, as well as 
gaining skills that employers require, it 
is also important to gain and use career 
management skills. These are necessary 
to help you to direct your learning and 
skills development in ways that will prove 
meaningful.
This model recognises the importance of:
1	 career-building skills (such as using labour 
market intelligence, developing the right 
networks and relationships for gaining 
work)
2	 self-management skills (such as evaluating 
your skills, qualities and values)
3	 underlying ‘traits and dispositions’ (such 
as being open to new experience, 
beliefs about your employability, your 
vocational interests, or willingness to 
develop career skills).
Such career management skills help you 
to direct your energies appropriately, so 
that you then make best use of the career-
related opportunities available through 
your course and elsewhere. An important 
aspect of this model is the ‘intentional 
management’ of work, learning, and life. It 
calls for active reflection and evaluation.
Reflection: Career 
development model
•• Does this model make sense to you?
•• How focused are you on developing 
career management skills in a planned, 
intentional, reflective manner?

What students and graduates say
Make a start
What I have to say is probably what 
everyone says: ‘I wish I hadn’t waited so long 
before starting to think about planning my 
career.’ So my advice is, just do it. Get on 
with it. You have to eventually, so it might as 
well be now. Gloria, 3rd-year student
Get experience
I am really glad that I joined lots of societies. 
Being president of one student society and 
treasurer of another made it much easier 
for me to answer questions at interview. I 
could talk easily about a long list of things 
– such as using my initiative, taking the 
lead to get things done, discussing things 
in meetings, making sure we had records of 
meetings and that we followed through on 
what we agreed, managing budgets, taking 
responsibility for making decisions, having to 
account for my actions, all the sorts of things 
you have to do in work all the time. I think 
this would be good for all students, taking 
on any roles where they can show they took 
some initiative and have some drive. Imani, 
recent graduate
I couldn’t get an internship that I really 
wanted. I was very dejected at first. On 
the advice of the university careers service, 
I looked for other work instead. I did two 
part-time voluntary jobs, and then got some 
paid part-time hours at one of these. I then 
found another part-time job which I thought 
would be a dead-end. That employer asked 
if I had good writing skills and asked me to 
help out with some office work. After that, 
the manager asked if I would write material 
for their website. A partner company then 
offered me a job in their communications 
office, and now I am a trainee manager 
there. One thing can lead on to another, 
so if I hadn’t taken what was available, I 
probably wouldn’t have got this chance. 
Basha, graduate
Keep your options open
I left a job to start university and was convinced that 
when I got my degree I would go back to my old 
company. When I finished, I realised I didn’t want to 
do that, and wished I had bothered to check out other 
businesses and what was required for management 
entry roles at these. I could have done much more to 
prepare my curriculum vitae, to be more interesting 
as an applicant. I don’t look as if I have done anything 
except study in the last three years. Raheem, final year 
student
I didn’t think I would work for an SME but the Careers 
Service was sent the option of a placement and asked 
me if I would be interested. I thought, ‘why not?’ and 
I am so glad because it has been amazingly helpful. 
There are only eleven people in the company and we 
all just pitch in as needed. I work with everyone and 
have a go at everything – almost everything. It has been 
good for me because I wasn’t sure what it would be like 
working with colleagues at work and not just students. 
Because we work so closely as a team, I have learnt a 
lot very quickly, how to get on with people at work and 
how to handle clients too. Shuang, 3rd year student
Think of all options
I just assumed that I would work for a big company 
and that that is where the jobs were. That is all I heard 
about. I didn’t even think about most being in smaller 
companies, although it is obvious when you think about 
it. I was disappointed not to get a job with a major 
corporate but it has been interesting joining a micro-
company. Everyone knows who I am at work, and I feel 
like I really count. Duncan, recent graduate

What do employers really want?

Gaining experience of work
‘Must have  
experience’
Treat all placements seriously
It is likely that you will have to compete 
for placements and internships as well 
as for mainstream jobs. Approach the 
appointments process for every role 
seriously. This gives you practice in 
developing the skills you will need when 
you apply for graduate jobs.
Many placements and internships lead to 
a job within the company, so make a good 
impression from the outset. Even if you 
think, now, that this is not the company for 
you, you might find that you want to stay 
on once you have been there for a while 
and seen the potential for acquiring more 
experience.
Create opportunities: Ask
Let your work supervisor or manager 
know that you are keen to take on 
responsibilities. Such additional experience 
will be invaluable for your CV. Ask if you 
can have a meeting to talk through what 
you might be able to offer the company.
Create opportunities: Tell
Let your supervisor or manager know 
of any skills that you might have that 
could be useful. Look for occasions 
when you could apply your skills to help 
the company. These do not need to be 
related to your degree, though could 
be. For example, you might see ways 
that employers could use social media or 
student volunteers to help their business.
Create opportunities: References
When you apply for your next placement 
or job, you must provide details of all 
previous employers, including for work 
placements and internships. The employer 
will contact management for a reference. It 
is essential to present yourself well during 
all placements. Future employers will be 
interested to hear what employers have to 
say about you.
Job advertisements often state that experience is needed, 
but it can be tricky to find a job that provides this. If you 
are caught in this conundrum, don’t despair. You can gain 
experience.
You can make any job work for you
Any employment experience is better than none. If the 
right placement does not come along, take the work that 
is available, even if not ideal.
Where to find work
Part-time work. If your university or college has a jobshop 
or recruitment agency, start there. Even while you are a 
student, you can apply for work at your institution or in the 
student union. Look in your local paper and register with 
on-line agencies. There will be recruitment agencies and 
jobshops in your region, and some shops, religious bodies 
and community organisations display job advertisements.
Work placements and internships. These come in various 
packages, paid or unpaid, short or long, part-time or full-
time. Ask at your Careers or Employability Service. Look 
for a placement that provides you with the experience and 
skills that are most closely aligned to careers that interest 
you, but accept what is available.
Voluntary work. It may not seem ideal if this is unpaid, 
but it provides a starting place. Your student union or 
careers service is likely to offer volunteering roles and 
there may be some organised through your course. If 
you approach charities directly, be clear about what time, 
experience and skills you can offer.
Treat all placements seriously.

customer service skills, 
brand awareness

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Work placements and internships: the benefits
If you haven’t yet had a job or held a position 
with responsibility, then it is important to 
consider taking on either a placement or 
an internship, whether paid or unpaid. As 
Fanthome (2004) noted, ‘work experience 
is becoming an essential component of an 
applicant’s CV within the post-graduation 
employment market’.
What will I gain?
The key purpose of placements and internships 
is to gain experience and work readiness to 
support general employability. You can gain 
some, or all, of the following:
•• Payment – some provide a wage or 
accommodation or other benefits; some don’t
•• Skills – either new skills or opportunities to 
fine-tune and apply existing ones in a new 
context
•• Application of theory – the chance to test out, 
in practice, what you have learnt in class
•• Work-readiness – practice in developing the 
attitudes, habits and life-skills needed to hold 
down a job
•• Understanding – insights into how 
organisations work (see pages 280–2 
regarding placements, etc.)
•• Personal insights – greater clarity in what you 
want from your working life
•• Experience and referees to help with future 
job applications.
Reading the work culture
Above all else, you can learn about how to 
read the work culture. Part of being a good 
employee is fitting in to the social and cultural 
life of the organisation, especially in your 
department or team. You can start to gain a 
sense of how workplace politics and conventions 
operate. These vary from one company to 
another, so being able to compare two or more 
workplaces is invaluable to building your general 
understanding.
Reflection: Experience of work
What do you think you could gain from a work 
placement or internship in the near future? What 
kind of placement or internship would you want?
What students say
I had become used to a student way of life. I 
worked hard as a student, very hard actually, 
but I could do this more or less on my own time 
schedule. It was a real shock to the system to 
have to work the same hours every day, Monday 
to Friday. After three days, I thought I would have 
to give up, that my system couldn’t cope. I don’t 
know how I got through the first week but I did. 
I got used to the routine and realised I could 
survive it! I am glad I found that out! Hassan
It was compulsory to do a work placement on my 
course. I was sent to a nursery 20 miles away. I 
had to get up at 6.30 a.m. to arrive for 8.30. I was 
not pleased about that! What I gained from the 
placement? It was all the organisational skills for 
managing my own life. I had to apply for financial 
support for the train fare, and then make sure 
I didn’t spend it on anything else. And sort out 
my travel, smart clothes etc. It was hard getting 
myself organised to be in work on time, looking 
presentable. I even had to polish my shoes! I 
had to prepare what I would do all day with the 
different age groups in the nursery – and the legal 
requirements – there was a lot of responsibility 
involved. I really needed all that experience. Jade
I’d say get any experience and as much work 
experience as you can. If you can get a paid job 
in a relevant field, great! If not, just take any work 
and look at it through professional eyes. So, if 
you want to be an accountant or a lawyer, look at 
everything at the placement through the eyes of 
a legal or financial expert. Think about what they 
would notice, and the advice they would give, 
and the opportunities they would see. This helps 
you to think and speak like a professional. Maisha

What do employers really want?

Make effective use of your experience of work
Learning from experience
However good a match your current employment, 
internship or placement is to your preferred career, 
you can make more, or less, of the experience.
Senior staff find they can learn a great deal about 
their organisation by going ‘back to the floor’, 
including in the most junior roles, and seeing from 
there how things are operating currently at every 
level of the business. 
If they can learn from ‘the floor’, then so can you. 
Even if your role is relatively junior, you can still 
make this into a rich opportunity to observe, reflect 
and learn about work environments and your 
developmental needs. You may even be able to 
draw on your insights to gain a job, or promotion.
Be systematic
Take a systematic and structured approach to 
reflecting critically and analytically about your 
workplace. Use your insights to help you to 
prepare for more senior roles. The following sets of 
questions can help to guide your thinking.
Jot down your observations. However, unless you 
have workplace permission for keeping notes about 
this, keep your personal records private.

4	 What could have gone better? What could 
you practise or prepare better for future 
applications?
5	 If you were appointing a member of staff, would 
you do anything differently from those who 
interviewed you?

4	 Is there an organisational chart that illustrates 
the line management structure to employees?
5	 What difference does it make to your working 
day to know the people around you?
6	 Why do you think the organisation is 
structured in this way?

employees (such as general discussion, meetings, 
newsletters, blogs, etc.)?
2	 From what you see, hear and experience, do these 
methods seem broadly effective?
3	 If they seem to work reasonably well, why is that?
4	 If they don’t work well, why does that seem to be the 
case? What could be done more effectively?
5	 Do employees get a chance to give their point of view on 
how things work?

What difference do you think it would 
make if such training were provided?
7	 Did you make good use of the 
training opportunities that were open 
to you?

training to best effect in future job 
applications and interviews?

3	 How are they communicated and 
promoted?
4	 Are those values much in evidence in 
the day-to-day work of the company?

If not, why do you think that might 
be the case?
6	 Are the values interpreted differently 
within your team?
7	 How do customers (or clients, 
patients, pupils, etc.) benefit from 
such values?
8	 If you were in charge, what, if 
anything, would you change to 
embed company values effectively?

management roles?
Relevance to your preferred career path

what considerations tended to rise to the fore most 
often and easily? For example, did you find you 
were more interested in matters related to Human 
Resources (HR)? Finance? Legal issues? Management? 
Policy? Customer service? Design? Quality assurance? 
Operations? Other things? What does this suggest

through this work? How could you make this relevant 
if asked about your commercial understanding in a 
future job interview?

If you want a graduate job, then you need to 
apply early, preferably starting that process in 
your penultimate rather than final year.
Developing your aims
In Chapter 1, you considered what your vision and 
values were for the next ten years. You may have 
changed your mind about these as you worked 
through the book.
Mature students and those in certain professional 
routes may have a good idea of the job they want 
when they leave university, although even they 
can change their minds when they find out about 
other options. Some students worry that they are 
not clear about what work they want.
It is easy to rush such decision-making. Although 
it is useful to make interim decisions that help 
provide focus, or at least a general direction, it 
is more important to gain experience, skills and 
insights when setting out on your career.
Career portfolio
Whatever job you choose, it is unlikely to be for 
life. It is more typical now to have a ‘portfolio’ of 
careers across a lifetime. Consider what there is to 
be gained from the opportunities available rather 
than panicking that the perfect career opening 
does not seem to be available to you straight away. 
Consider how particular opportunities or roles 
could advance your longer-term aims and career 
portfolio.
Jobs for graduates
Your first few jobs as a graduate may be traditional 
‘graduate’ jobs. These offer reasonably good 
salaries and are often designed specifically for 
new graduates. They involve skilled work and 
recognise the value of a degree. Large companies 
offer graduate schemes but there are excellent 
opportunities in other companies too.
Waiting until after graduation to apply for jobs 
makes it more likely students will end up in non-
graduate jobs.
What do you want from your first ‘graduate’ job?
More experience
Many graduates opt to enter the wider workforce 
with the aim of gaining experience and building 
their skills. This is especially true in creative 
professions, where it is expected that graduates 
will enter at a lower rung and plan for the longer 
term – or run their own business.
How can your next job help you?
Your first step is to think about what it is you 
want to gain from your first jobs after graduating, 
whether this is ‘learning the ropes’, personal 
projects, travel, trying out different occupational 
sectors, or developing expertise. You may prefer 
to work part-time on more than one job, or use 
agency work to build additional skills. If your plan 
is to walk straight into a particular job, make sure 
you have contingency plans in case this does not 
happen. Decide on other jobs that could carry 
your career or life plans forward.

Know what is right for you
The Careers Service will have a wide range 
of paper and electronic resources, including 
psychometric tests, which will enable you to 
pinpoint the kinds of work that suit you. If you 
completed the activities in Chapters 1 and 2, you 
should have a good idea already of the general 
direction that you want to take in life.
When applying for jobs, consider:
•• How could this job advance, in the short or long 
term, my professional aims?
•• How could this job advance, in the short or long 
term, my life vision?
•• Is it consistent with my values and beliefs? (It will 
be hard to come across well in interview if the 
job contravenes your basic beliefs and values.)
Consider the best route
Some jobs receive thousands of applications – they 
are very popular and the reality is that almost 
every applicant will be disappointed. That does not 
mean that it is impossible to find a job that suits 
you. The most obvious route isn’t necessarily the 
only, or best, route to the profession that interests 
you.
Know all your options
Too many graduates select only the most obvious 
jobs.
•• Talk to the Careers Service so that know the 
range of jobs open to you. More than two out 
of every five jobs are open to any graduate, 
whatever their degree subject.
•• Find out about the labour market (see pp. 
252–3).
•• Identify which jobs have fewer applicants and 
whether any of these would suit you. They may 
provide easier entrance routes to the job you 
prefer over the longer term.
Plan long term
Consider alternative routes to your desired 
destination. Work experience, travel or gaining 
skills that are in short supply but relevant may 
all provide unexpected routes. Broaden your 
portfolio. Consider how you could network to meet 
potential employers in occupational sectors that 
interest you.
Starter posts
Companies tend to be loyal to their own personnel. 
It is worth thinking about entering at the bottom 
or in a less competitive post, and aim to work 
towards the job you want from inside the company. 
Consider interim jobs that you could fill for a few 
years and that would provide a sideways route into 
the job you want.
Choose jobs you can really do
Every employer receives a large number of 
applications from people who have not interpreted 
the job description correctly or have not addressed 
the person specification fully, generally because 
they are too inexperienced for the role. If you have 
very few of the qualifications, skills and experiences 
required, you will not be short-listed. You could 
have spent your time making a stronger application 
for a job that is within your competence.
Consider smaller companies
Many students consider only the kinds of large 
companies that are invited to careers fairs at 
universities. However, many small and medium-
sized companies also recruit graduates (see pp. 
252–3). These can provide very good opportunities 
to develop experience and to rise quickly within a

In your reflective journal, consider:
•• What kinds of jobs are you most interested in?
•• Broadly speaking, what are the statistical 
chances of you gaining that job as a first job? 
Your Careers Service will give you details of 
what to expect.
•• Brainstorm alternative routes into that job. 
Which of these would you consider? Which 
are you most likely to succeed in gaining as 
your first job?
Choosing a job
285
What do employers really want?

For your first job as a graduate you may 
want to look for specific characteristics in an 
employer – or you may just want to get a foot 
on the employment ladder. Local and personal 
circumstances will affect what kind of choice is 
available to you. However, the following points are 
worth considering.
Investors in People
A number of companies have gained Investors in 
People (IiP) status. This means that the company 
has demonstrated a commitment to the training 
and development of its employees. If an employer 
has IiP status, they are more likely to welcome 
questions at interview about how they develop 
their staff. They are very likely to ask candidates 
about what steps they take to further their own 
professional development.
Equal opportunities
Equality legislation is aimed at protecting against 
unfair practices and discrimination, especially on 
grounds such as race, sex, disability, age, sexual 
orientation, and religion. Many employers will 
make a reference to being an ‘equal opportunity 
employer’. This means, usually, that they are keen 
to be seen making efforts in equal opportunities. It 
does not necessarily mean that all aspects of work 
at the company will affect all workers equally, nor 
that discriminatory practices do not take place. 
However, if equal opportunities matter to you, 
you may feel more comfortable at a company that 
has an equal opportunities policy that extends 
beyond the basic legal requirements. For more 
information, see www.equalityhumanrights.com.
Career opportunities
Some companies expect their graduate employees 
to move very quickly from one post to another. 
This may mean travel, very varied work, and 
opportunities to gain a range of experience. 
Some provide opportunities to work or travel 
overseas. Larger companies will usually detail such 
opportunities in their graduate literature. It is 
reasonable to ask questions about this at interview. 
Smaller companies are not usually able to create 
such opportunities so this may affect the type of 
company that would suit you. However, a small 
company may be growing quickly and would 
offer a different kind of opportunity to employees 
who were with them from the beginning. For 
information about different kinds of companies, 
see:
•• www.bloomberg.com (international and 
entrepreneur site)
•• www.companieshouse.gov.uk (lists all UK public 
companies)
•• www.bestcompaniesguide.co.uk (reports 
employee feedback on what it is like to work for 
named companies).
See also the websites on pages 385–6.
Graduate apprenticeships, internships 
and company schemes
Some companies offer programmes to bridge the 
time between university and work. Sometimes this 
is for an apprentice or intern, with training offered 
for a reasonable but relatively low salary (or no 
salary). These are useful for gaining experience 
of a new work context. Other companies offer 
outstanding opportunities to work on a particular 
project in a workplace but under supervision from 
the university. Your university or college Careers or 
Employability Service would have details of these.
Your ‘bottom line’
A first job can offer experience and training that 
will be of use in future applications. You are well 
advised to accept less than the ideal employment 
in order to gain that first step. However, you 
should be clear in your own mind about what 
is and what is not acceptable to you. This may 
relate to the level of pay, working hours, location, 
behaviours, being the only person of your sex or 
colour, lack of reliable transport, or something 
personal to you. You should be clear where you 
will not compromise on issues such as:
•• personal security
•• health and safety
•• disability access
•• culture and values
•• working hours
•• travel requirements.
What do you want from an employer?
286
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Make opportunities
Career planning does not start with applying for 
jobs in your final year at university. Employers will 
want employees who know how to spot and use 
opportunities, think on a broad front, and can plan 
ahead for the good of the company. 
They will look to see how you spotted, created and used 
opportunities on your own behalf. If you did not do this 
for yourself as a student, they will be less convinced that 
you could do this on behalf of their company. Ideally, 
your planning should start in your first year, so that you 
are in a strong position by the time you apply for jobs.  
Develop a rounded portfolio
When people invest in stocks and shares, they are 
advised not to put all their money into one investment, 
but to develop a rounded portfolio that includes 
different kinds of investment. If one type of company 
fails, others may still provide returns on the investment. 
Your time at university is a similar kind of investment. 
Your energy can be invested entirely in study or spread 
over a wider portfolio. Your degree is likely to be your 
most important investment at present, but it does not 
have to be your sole investment. Furthermore, there are 
‘smart’ ways of putting a degree together so it counts 
for more. 
A rounded student portfolio will contain ‘investment’ in 
at least three of the following:
•• the degree subject
•• complementary subjects 
•• a broad set of skills that could be transferred to the 
workplace
•• unusual technical expertise
•• work experience
•• volunteer activity 
•• contributing to the community 
•• a position of responsibility
•• general career awareness
•• awareness of the professional field or the companies 
where you want a job
•• evidence of taking responsibility for personal 
development needs or training.
When applying for a job, you need to 
consider:
•• ‘How have I used my time?’
•• ‘What have I done that makes my 
application stand out?’
•• ‘What will make this company consider 
me rather than somebody else?’
•• ‘What evidence have I got that I can 
deliver the skills they are asking for?’
•• ‘What experience can I offer?’
The subject and grade of degree are 
relevant, but are only a small part of the 
story for most jobs. You will not get a 
job simply because you have a ‘first class’ 
or ‘2.1’ degree. That may be one of ten 
things the employer will consider, if at all, 
and is possibly the least important on their 
list. 
Reflection: Developing 
your personal portfolio
In your reflective journal, consider:
•• How are you currently planning 
ahead so that you have a better 
chance of gaining the job you want 
after you complete your degree?
•• For jobs that interest you, what are 
employers likely to look for apart from 
your degree?
•• Which aspects of the ‘rounded 
portfolio’ are you already working on?
•• Which aspect will you work on next? 
How will you go about this? Who will 
you speak to first about this?
Plan ahead

What do employers really want?

When to use the Careers Service
The Careers Service can give you excellent 
advice from your first year at university, so 
that you can plan the best possible route 
towards the jobs that will interest you 
later.
The Careers Service should be able to 
guide you to put together a rounded 
portfolio. They can advise you on how to 
spend your time as a student so that you:
•• choose an interesting but relevant 
selection of subjects and options
•• understand which skills are relevant to 
the field of work that interests you
•• know how to make the best use of work 
experience
•• plan and prepare well in advance for the 
areas of work that interest you
•• are aware of the range of opportunities 
available to you through the university, 
locally and further afield.
Many also have ‘job shops’ or similar, to 
help you gain student jobs whilst studying. 
You may find it helpful to browse websites 
that give career guidance for graduates. 
For example, see:
•• www.prospects.ac.uk
•• www.gradunet.co.uk
•• www.careerplayer.com
•• www.insidecareers.co.uk 
Activity
The Careers Service
•• Visit the university Careers Service in person or via 
their website within the next three weeks.
•• Find out what services are available. 
•• Find out how you can make best use of the service.
Plan to stand out
Employers see hundreds of similar people, all wanting 
the same job for similar reasons, and all holding similar 
certificates and qualifications. This is one reason why 
Careers Services ask to see undergraduates early, so that 
they can give advice about planning ahead towards the 
job-application stage. You can prepare to ‘stand out’ from 
other applicants by various means:
•• Choose unusual subject options as electives or subsidiary 
subjects
Employers are likely to be interested in why you chose 
unusual options. They may appreciate that you have a 
broader outlook, or they may be able to use the subsidiary 
subject in some way. You should plan to choose companies 
that are likely to appreciate the subjects you selected. For 
example, you may choose to take a language as an option 
and look for companies that deal with overseas clients or 
have overseas branches. Be prepared to answer questions 
about what it was that interested you about the options 
you chose, and the links you can make between this, your 
subject and your career plans. 
•• Choose smart combinations
Consider combining different subjects. For example, 
lawyers, accountants or designers work for all kinds of 
businesses. A law student who has studied a module 
or two of sports science will look more appealing as a 
lawyer to the sports industry. Similarly, media industries or 
architectural firms might be more interested in business 
graduates who have undertaken some study in their 
own fields and therefore know something about these 
professions and their terms of reference.
•• Do something different
An unusual interest, study abroad, travel, a curious 
combination of languages, success in a competition, 
holding an exhibition of your work, voluntary work and 
similar activities can spark an interest in employers. They 
are likely to ask you questions about these if they interview 
you. 
When to use the Careers Service
288
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Presenting yourself to employers
How should I ‘stand out?’
Clarify to potential employers exactly what you 
can offer to them. This means:
•• addressing directly and precisely what the 
employer has stated they want in the person 
specification, drawing on the job description
•• drawing on your research of the business
•• demonstrating the ‘added value’ you would 
bring.
Your ‘value-added’
You may have skills or experience which bring 
value to employers and which would interest 
them even if they have not asked explicitly for 
them. Some areas worth mentioning are:
•• additional languages, spoken and/or written
•• work overseas, or possibly having lived 
abroad
•• legal, HR, financial, technical and media 
expertise, especially if applied already in a 
business context
•• experience of governance, such as being a 
school governor, or Board membership for a 
company or charity
•• managerial or leadership experience
•• work that directly supported a member of a 
senior team, such as PA, research tasks etc.
•• undertaking a research project for a business
•• having followed a non-traditional route into 
higher education or into the professional 
area. 
How not to stand out
You can stand out in the wrong way. Avoid:
•• not addressing the person specification, or 
leaving it unclear how exactly you match 
this
•• inaccuracies in written English, in any part 
of your application, including emails, texts, 
covering letters, application forms, etc.
•• cliches such as ‘I would give 110%’
•• focusing on how much you want the job 
(rather than what you can bring to the role)
•• writing styles that are long-winded, 
pompous, apologetic or over-complicated.
Is it good to have a ‘personal brand’?
Trought (2012) argues that you should develop a 
personal ‘brand’ to market yourself to employers. This 
is true to the extent that you need to consider how 
your application will compete against others.
However, bear in mind that employers are more 
interested in their own brand, company style and 
values, and will be looking to see how well you will 
‘fit in’. Present your strengths in ways that make sense 
in terms of their brand and values. If you simply ‘sell 
yourself’ or your ‘personal brand’ you may come 
across as only interested in you.
Demonstrate your knowledge of them
Use company websites
Be well-informed about what a company says about 
its aims, plans, achievements, values and employee 
behaviours on its website. Look at what it requires of 
employees in general, not just from recent graduates 
or for this role. Read any company reports in the 
public domain.
Use LinkedIn
Many companies can now be found on LinkedIn. This 
is an easy way of doing initial research on:
•• the company in general
•• how it communicates to others, and what it 
chooses to communicate about
•• key people who work for the company
•• recent developments in the company.
Clicking ‘see connections’ will enable you to see who 
company personnel connect with professionally. 
This might also identify similar kinds of companies, 
opening up further possibilities for you to explore.

What do employers really want?
What makes you stand 
out from the rest?

Making use of personal records
Chapter 11, ‘Maintaining good personal records’, 
provides a range of resources to assist you in recording the 
information you will need for applications and interviews. 
These cover most, if not all, of the material you need in 
order to apply for almost any job.
It is particularly important to focus on the section on 
personal competences and the competence sheets (see 
pp. 346–82). Some employers use competency-based 
approaches for recruitment. Most employers ask for, or 
welcome, answers rooted in your experience. These forms 
can help you to prepare well for a wide range of experience-
based questions.
These resources are also provided electronically to help you 
build your electronic portfolio (see p. 23).
Reflection: Stand out from the crowd
Making use of the information in ‘Presenting yourself to 
employers’ (page 289), in your reflective journal, consider:
•• What is it about you that would make you stand out on 
an application form, increasing your chances of gaining 
an interview?
•• What is it about you that would make you stand out 
on in an interview, so you will be remembered out of a 
large number of interviewees?
•• What can you do now or during the year to develop 
your profile in this respect?
All of the chapters in this book have been designed to 
assist you to plan towards your future, develop personal 
insights, devise strategies for improving personal 
performance, and understand the skills that are required 
in many occupations. If you have worked through 
the activities in this and earlier chapters, you will have 
developed a good picture of yourself, and the kind of 
career that might interest you.
When completing your application or preparing for an 
interview, you will find your ‘personal statement’ (Chapter 
8, p. 243) is of particular value. In the context of applying 
for a job, a good personal statement will summarise 
your goals, achievements, and experiences in relation to 
the post you are considering. If you are not asked for a 
personal statement, then include similar information in 
your covering letter.
Activity
Update personal 
records
•• Put time aside to update your 
personal records this week. Which 
aspects need updating?
•• Which three of the competence 
sheets on pp. 346–82 would you 
find most useful for the jobs that 
interest you? Your answers to 
competence-based questions need 
to be very brief and very specific.
Browse your personal records, progress 
file, Higher Education Achievement 
Record (HEAR) or equivalents, to help 
you prepare for the application process. 
These will remind you of:
•• what counts in your life
•• what you aim to achieve
•• what you have achieved and what 
you have to offer in a job.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Making the application
Making the application
Read the documentation
First read the documentation you are sent. You will 
usually receive one or more of the following items.
General information
This will tell you more about the company, work 
conditions, and sometimes includes information 
about matters such as pensions, holidays, bonuses, 
and so forth. Check the company website or 
contact their Human Resources or Personnel 
department for further information.  Research the 
company: large companies expect you to know 
something about them. All employers expect 
you to know something about their general area 
of work, whether from personal experience, 
from having talked to others or from some basic 
research. Ensure that you are happy with the work 
ethos, the conditions on offer and the direction 
and ethics of the company.
The job description 
This will outline the responsibilities of the post 
and what the post-holder is expected to do, 
building on information that was contained in 
the advertisement. Check that this does match 
what was said in the advertisement and that you 
are still interested. Tick all the responsibilities that 
you can manage successfully. It is unlikely that any 
candidates will be outstanding in all the areas that 
the employer requires, so do not be put off if there 
are one or two areas where you consider yourself 
to be weak. Consider what the essentials are and 
whether you could do these. 
The ‘Person specification’
The person specification will list the qualifications, 
experiences, skills and qualities that the employer 
is looking for. These may be divided into ‘essential’ 
and ‘desirable’. If many candidates meet all the 
‘essential’ specifications, employers will then 
look to the ‘desirable’ items and use these for 
making a short-list of people to interview. It is 
unlikely that many candidates will meet all the 
‘desirable’ requirements; you need to make a 
judgement about your suitability for the job if 
you do not meet some of these. For example, 
some qualifications are very specific, such as for a 
qualified engineer, or an educational psychologist 
to administer tests closed to the public. If you 
lack those qualifications, it is not usually worth 
applying. However, sometimes relevant experience 
and skills can be considered as alternatives. 
Ensure that your overall application refers 
specifically to ALL of the items on the person 
specification, usually in the order they are 
listed. Typically, an employer will tick off each 
specification that has been addressed successfully, 
and then add up the ‘ticks’. If you merge two or 
three characteristics into a single paragraph or 
example of your experience, some items may not 
stand out clearly enough to show you meet the 
specification and this may cost you the interview. 
Person specifications usually include:
•• a requirement for qualifications: ‘educated to 
degree level’, ‘preferably a degree in a business 
subject’, ‘a degree in a care subject’, ‘preferably 
with a higher degree (MA)’
You say here that you play a key role 
in managing national distribution of 
all Ace Supermarket’s products. Tell 
us more about that.
Yeah, that’s right. On Saturdays 
I open the gates for the lorries 
to go out.
291
What do employers really want?

Complete the form
Complete the form, following the directions closely:
•• Ensure the form is clearly written, proof-read and 
neatly presented: good impressions do count.
•• Be honest and accurate: the company is likely to check 
on information you give them, either immediately or 
at a later date.
•• Be complete: do not leave gaps in work or recent 
educational histories as this suggests you have 
something to hide. Include all relevant training and 
give reasons for work breaks. Complete all requests for 
information.
•• Refer clearly to all skills, qualities, qualifications and 
experience.
Qualifications
Provide the names of qualifications in full, either in the 
space provided or in your CV or covering letter. The 
employer may not know what is meant by abbreviations 
so avoid using these. This is especially important if you 
are applying for a position overseas. Find out the local 
equivalent of your qualifications, and indicate these in 
the covering letter, so that the employer takes them into 
account. 
If you have your degree results, you do not need to go 
into details about school history unless you are asked for 
this, or unless a particular school qualification is relevant 
to the job. However, if you have good A-level grades or 
equivalents, it is worth mentioning these. Also provide 
details of GCSE or equivalent in English, maths and, for 
jobs such as teaching, science.
Write the personal statement
This is an extremely important part of the application 
process and requires time and thoughtful consideration. 
Structure it well so the main points can be found easily. If 
you were asked to send only a CV or letter of application 
rather than an application form, it is a good idea to 
include a personal statement to accompany these. 
Good personal statements
In good personal statements for job applications, it is 
clear to the employer: 
✓
✓that you know what the job will entail
✓
✓that you understand what they are looking for in the 
new employee and can deliver this
✓
✓that you know something about the organisation or 
company
✓
✓why you want the job
•• skills specific to the job: ‘experience and 
ability in managing a team’, ‘experience 
of working with the public’, ‘at least two 
years’ experience of working in X’
•• general skills: ‘ability to work as an 
effective member of a team’, ‘excellent 
communication skills’, ‘ability to work 
independently’, ‘a good self-starter’
•• willingness to accept particular work 
conditions: ‘ability to work flexible hours’, 
‘willingness to work across several sites’, 
‘must be willing to travel’. 
Information about how to apply
Read carefully to see whether the employer 
asks for a CV or other information to be 
sent in, and whether specific directions are 
given about completing the application 
form. Do exactly what is asked because if 
there are many applicants, the employer 
may choose to read only those applications 
that are completed correctly. Failure to 
follow instructions reflects poorly on 
applicants’ ability to pay attention to 
details. If you are asked for a CV, send one; 
if you are asked not to, then don’t.
Equal opportunities form
This form is usually for the personnel 
department and should not be available to 
the selection team. Large companies need 
to monitor that they are following equal 
opportunities policies, and to monitor for 
potential bias. If the form is not completed, 
it may make the company appear to be 
more successful at equal opportunities than 
they are, as the percentage of people they 
appoint from under-represented groups 
may appear to be a high percentage of 
those who actually apply. 
An application form
Not all employers use these. If they do, 
you must complete it. If it has space for a 
long personal statement, you can usually 
provide this as a separate word-processed 
sheet, writing ‘see attached’ on the form. 
Forms are usually provided electronically 
now, but if they need to be hand-written, 
people with disabilities who cannot 
complete a form by hand can request other 
means of applying. 
292
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Example
Specification: ‘ability to work as an 
effective member of a team’
As part of my current part-time job, I am a 
member of a team of ten people. This requires 
me to work towards common goals to strict 
deadlines. The employer has provided two 
training days in team-work skills. I have been 
asked to stand in as deputy team leader on 
several occasions, which attests to my team-
management skills. I feel I am a good team 
member as I am ready to listen and act 
upon other people’s ideas and am confident 
in making my own suggestions. I also have 
extensive experience of problem-solving in small 
groups as part of my degree. I completed a 
successful group project, which received good 
feedback from tutors. My main roles in that 
group were as meeting co-ordinator and data 
researcher.
Refer to the job 
In the statement, include a few sentences in 
which you clarify why you are interested in the 
job and what you have to offer to the employer. 
Select three or four skills or qualities that you 
think are particularly relevant and list these as 
benefits that you can offer to the company. This 
will indicate to the employer that you are serious 
about this particular job. It will suggest you have 
thought about its needs and have selected it on 
the basis of your own suitability.
Writing a covering letter
If you have included a personal statement, 
your covering letter can be brief (see page 
294). If not, your letter should cover the points 
addressed in the ‘personal statement’ section 
above. Your covering letter should:
•• demonstrate real interest and passion for the 
job
•• be clear, to the point and businesslike – avoid 
waffle and anecdote
•• tailor the content to the job for which you 
are applying, including any reference number 
that was given
•• state where you saw the job advertised
•• be well-written and proof-read
✓
✓how your skills, qualities and experience match 
what they have asked for, in ways that are relevant 
to the job that you will be doing
✓
✓exactly where you are addressing each item in the 
person specification
✓
✓that you have tailored your application to this 
particular job rather than sending a standard 
response
✓
✓that you write well, clearly, and succinctly and can 
proof-read accurately (this is an example of your 
written communication so make sure it is perfectly 
presented)
✓
✓that, through the way you have laid out 
information so that key points are easy to find, 
you value the employer’s time. 
Refer to your personal records
If you maintain good records and competence 
sheets, such as those recommended in Chapter 11, 
it will be easier to select appropriate information to 
complete your personal statement. Read through 
your records to remind yourself of your strongest 
competences and the best examples of your 
experience. 
Employers will want to know what you are capable 
of achieving, so it is important to identify which 
of your experiences and responsibilities can be 
described as achievements and successes. If you 
have held positions of responsibility, ensure that it 
is clear what your role was. If you held a post in a 
student society or have held down a job, identify 
your achievements during that time. For example, 
turn a sentence such as:
As Social Secretary, I was responsible for organising 
social activities for the student body.
into a more detailed statement such as:
As Social Secretary (2013–14), I was responsible for 
organising activities for a student body of 14,000 
people. I successfully ran 10 events involving 3000 
people. Satisfaction surveys were conducted and 
these received excellent feedback from 87% of 
respondents. I also increased income by six per cent 
over the previous year. 
Write to the person specification 
Go through the person specification and job 
specification in detail. Use each item in the person 
specification as a separate heading. Write a succinct 
paragraph to address each item, giving at least one 
good (but brief) example to illustrate each.

Dear Ms Browne
I am very interested in the post of Assistant Conference Manager  
(ref. AAP/223/01) advertised in the Guardian on 27/8/2015.
I have recently completed a degree in Business and Economics. As 
part of my degree, I undertook a project for an events company that 
mounted conferences for employers locally and nationally. As well as 
this providing me with experience of event planning, I thoroughly 
enjoyed the atmosphere and the opportunity to meet a wide range of 
people.
I have worked in sales and with the public for many years. I hope 
my ability to speak and write several languages including Welsh and 
Punjabi will be of additional benefit in the conference world. 
I am particularly interested in working in a new and growing 
organisation with an international dimension such as Alpha 
Conferences. I would like to feel I had contributed to the development 
of a new company in its early stages. Your commitment to employee 
training is impressive and I would be keen to further my own 
professional development. 
I live locally and would be ready to start work at short notice. I enclose 
my CV, as requested, and would appreciate the opportunity of an 
interview to discuss the post further. I look forward to hearing from 
you.
Yours sincerely
Amit Evans

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Curriculum vitae (CV)
This used to be the most common form of document 
required by employers. However, it is less in demand 
than it used to be. Agencies often request CVs, and 
some employers respond to CVs even when they do not 
have a job on offer. There is a wide variety of acceptable 
CV formats. However, as an employer may spend less 
than a minute reading your CV, whatever format you 
choose needs to be pleasing to the eye and contain a 
few key details that will make the selector choose you 
for interview (see the two examples on pp. 296–7). 
Content
CVs must include:
•• full name
•• home address
•• contact details (phone, 
email)
•• educational history 
•• qualifications 
•• employment history 
•• complete interests 
and other information 
(relevant training, 
languages, certificates, 
driving licence).
Incorporate, in the relevant sections, a few key details 
that indicate levels and breadth of responsibility and 
experience.
Layout and style
Presentation
Presentation is extremely important to CVs. Employers 
may receive hundreds of CVs and may conduct the 
first selection on the basis of presentation skills. If so, 
they are more likely to eliminate CVs that are too long, 
which clearly omit essential sections, are handwritten or 
poorly typed.
Your CV should be:
•• headed by your name 
(don’t include ‘CV’ as a 
header)
•• no more than 2 sides 
long 
•• divided into clear 
sections with headings
•• laid out in legible lists 
or tables for educational 
history and employment 
•• easy to read and proof-
read for errors
•• brief and concise
•• relevant to the job. 
The whole document should be in the same font style. 
Use larger fonts and bold or underlining or italics for 
headings. Each main section should have the same level 
of heading (the same font size, style and format). Avoid 
colour, images, unusual or hard-to-read fonts. Avoid 
‘gimmicks’ and special effects.
•• demonstrate with confidence how you 
meet the requirements of the job – or 
state that this is outlined in your personal 
statement. 
If the employer’s form offers very little space 
for details about your employment history, 
use the covering letter to detail the relevance 
of previous roles, responsibilities and training.  
Mention any other personal qualities, skills 
and experience that are relevant to the post.
Competence-based applications
Competence-based applications ask 
candidates to provide concrete examples of 
how they have demonstrated the skills and 
qualities needed for the role. This provides an 
opportunity to demonstrate transferable skills 
and how these can be applied to the role.
Such jobs are open to a wide range 
of people, rather than only those with 
experience of that line of work. This can 
be an advantage if you haven’t had a 
previous job or if you wish to change 
your field of work. However, such jobs 
tend to attract many applicants, so care is 
needed in selecting the best examples of 
your experience for each competence and 
specifying their relevance to the demands of 
the new role.
Typically, competence-based applications 
use an application form and allow very 
small, specific amounts of space for you to 
complete details about each competence. 
You will probably be told not to send 
additional sheets or a CV. This means that 
you must be very precise and succinct in 
summarising your competences in order to 
include the maximum amount of information 
about yourself in the space available. 
The competence sheets on pp. 346–82 will 
help you to identify the relevant information 
and to develop skills in writing brief 
summaries of key information. Competence-
based applications are time-consuming, 
so it is useful to keep good and updated 
personal records that enable you to identify 
information quickly.

What do employers really want?

Sending uninvited CVs 
Some employers do file and use CVs sent to 
them when they have not advertised for a post. 
Many will not, as those using equal opportunities 
practices usually will advertise all posts. If you have 
rare and marketable specialist skills, such as high-
level IT skills, then the opportunistic CV can be 
particularly useful. 
If you do send CVs on an opportunistic basis, 
include additional information relevant to the 
post, either in the CV or in a covering letter. The 
employer will need to know, for example:
•• the kinds of job that interest you – using job 
titles if possible
•• whether you wish to work full- or part-time
•• an indication of the salary level you expect
•• which parts of the country you are willing to 
work in
•• the size and kind of company you are interested 
in working for
•• what your ideal job would be. 
These CVs may be slightly longer – but do aim to 
stay under two pages. Include more details about 
your skills, experience and what you can offer. Your 
enthusiasm and interest should radiate from the 
CV in order for it to be considered. 
Using the Internet
A source of jobs and advice
Graduate jobs will normally be advertised through 
the Internet. There are several hundred job sites on 
the web. Good places to start your search with are 
www.monster.co.uk and www.gradunet.co.uk. In 
addition, there are career advice resources on the 
net, some aimed at students. Some employers will 
send job details and accept applications and CVs 
by email. A list of such resources is given in the 
‘Useful Websites’ section at the end of this book.
Language
Use words that emphasise action (verbs). Look for 
opportunities to include words such as:
achieved, contributed, co-ordinated, organised, 
established, demonstrated, accomplished, 
applied, implemented, initiated, created, set up, 
developed.
Use words and phrases that demonstrate qualities 
that employers will value, such as:
attention to detail, positive outcome, achievement, 
success, effectively, efficiently, care, creativity, 
team work, meeting deadlines, co-operation, 
value for money, time-saving, problem-solving, 
self-starter, coping strategies, negotiating, 
networking, flexibility, versatility, creativity, 
innovation, entrepreneurship, profits, leadership, 
decision making, priority setting, competitiveness, 
commercial awareness, communication skills. 
CVs for different purposes
You may need more than one CV. The basic CV 
should be brief, and contain standard information. 
Academic CVs tend to be longer. If you are looking 
for an academic job, then include conferences 
and seminars to which you contributed a paper 
or workshop, all research projects with details 
of who funded these, and all your publications. 
When applying for a job, adapt your basic CV to 
fit what you know about the company and the 
requirements of the person specification. 
Competence statements in CVs
Traditionally, a CV fits on 1–2 pages. If you have 
a large number of qualifications or jobs, the 
information may need to fit onto more than one 
page. In either case, use only a few words to list 
the responsibilities associated with each item.
Bright and Earl (2007) argue that candidates who 
include a brief competence statement within a CV 
have a good chance of being short-listed. They 
found that there was no particular place on the CV 
where it was better to position the competence 
statement. When you have elaborated your 
competences (see Chapter 11), you may wish to 
use short competence statements in your CV.
298
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Assessment centres
Employers state that many students do not 
do themselves justice at assessment centres 
and interviews, even after sending in excellent 
applications and CVs.
What is an assessment centre?
Assessment centres provide a series of extended 
selection procedures which are used by many 
companies during recruitment. Sessions typically 
last one or two days. They may be used either 
as an initial selection tool or for additional 
information in between first interviews and final 
selection. 
What would I have to do? 
Selection tasks vary. You may be asked to sit a 
set of written papers or you could spend time in 
a relatively small group of 6–8 people with 2–4 
assessors. You can expect to be assessed through a 
combination of the following.
Group exercises
These are used to assess how effectively you can 
work in a team, and your communication and 
problem-solving skills.
In-Tray exercises
These assess your ability to manage complex 
information quickly, make decisions and manage 
your time. They are based on realistic work 
scenarios. 
Presentations
These assess your ability to structure information 
and convey this to other people. You may receive 
details of the presentation topic in advance of the 
assessment centre or on the day itself.
Psychometric assessments
These are carried out by licensed professionals 
and provide a structured and standardised way of 
assessing how you might perform on a given task 
or within a given context. Assessments may be 
either ability tests or personality assessments. 
1	 Ability Tests
These look at specific skills and knowledge 
within categories such as cognitive ability, 
e.g. memory, verbal reasoning, hand-eye co-
ordination.
Activity
Newspaper sites
Find out which quality or trade papers run 
advertisements for jobs that interest you. 
Enter their website address, and check whether 
they run the jobs on-line too. Most do. 
Alternatively use www.jobhunter.co.uk. 
You can check for jobs on a weekly basis.
Put your CV on-line
Large recruiters may provide their own facilities 
for you to create a CV using a ‘wizard’. This is not 
simply a question of putting up the CV as you have 
already typed it as, if you do that, you can lose 
most of the presentational features such as font 
style and layout: it may look fine on your screen 
but look messy or bizarre when viewed on the 
employer’s. 
You will usually need to write in your details 
for each website. This takes time so it is worth 
researching the best recruitment sites for the jobs 
that interest you. Use a plain-text version to ‘cut 
and paste’, using the same font throughout and 
without using tables or formatting. This will save 
you time. Leave at least half an hour to do this for 
each site.
Some employers may simply ask you to send a CV 
as an attachment. If so, use a rich-text format so 
that you increase the chance of it printing with the 
desired layout and presentational features on the 
employer’s printer.
Email cover letters
If you send an application by email, include 
a covering letter. This should follow the same 
general principles as any other cover letter. In 
other words, it should be brief, relevant, to the 
point, summarising your interest and what you 
have to offer to the company. Email responses can 
be signed off as ‘Best wishes’ rather than ‘yours 
faithfully’.
299
What do employers really want?

•• Stay focused through the sessions. Even though 
assessment centres can be very tiring, your 
motivation levels are being assessed and you 
need to maintain these.
Referring to disabilities
Many students with disabilities are unsure whether 
they should mention a disability at interview or 
not. In Britain, legislation should protect your 
rights if you have a disability, but employers are 
still not always aware of what to do when faced 
with a candidate with a disability. 
Should I tell the employer?
There is no easy answer to this. If you need 
particular help for the application process, the 
interview or the job, then you will need to disclose 
the disability. If you do not, then it may not be 
relevant and it would be an individual decision 
whether you say anything. You must ensure that 
you would not leave employers in a position 
where they could not meet their health and safety 
responsibilities to you or the public if you do not 
disclose. 
How should I bring up the subject in 
interview?
If you have not needed to change the interview 
in any way because of the disability, then the 
employer may not be aware of the disability. 
Personnel usually keep this information 
confidential. It is probably best to assume that the 
employer may know little about what the disability 
means in terms of how you might do the job, 
and may even hold erroneous, very confused or 
exaggerated ideas about what different disabilities 
are. 
Choose a positive way of introducing the disability. 
For example, identify the additional skills and 
qualities you have acquired because of the 
disability. It is likely that you will have developed 
additional skills and personal qualities to manage 
the disability alongside study, work and other 
people’s attitudes. This may have become such a 
way of life that you underestimate how many skills 
you have developed in this respect. For example, 
you may have:
2	 Personality Assessment
These are usually questionnaires that you fill in. 
There are two main types:
•• Trait instruments: these focus on behaviour 
and what you are likely to do in a given 
context. Your scores are likely to change over 
time as your skills and experience change. A 
typical test is the OPQ32.
•• Type instruments: these focus on our 
preferences for thinking, interacting, learning 
and working. These preferences tend to be 
more stable and less likely to change over 
time. A typical test is the Myers Briggs Type 
Indicator.
How to prepare for an assessment centre
Some aspects of assessment preparation are very 
similar to how you would prepare for a standard 
job interview. You can prepare by:
•• researching the company website and taking 
note of any information on recruitment
•• thinking about your strengths and potential 
areas for development
•• planning your journey to the assessment centre 
to make sure that you get there on time.
You are not usually being assessed on what 
you know, so you do not need to learn specific 
information in advance. There are a number of 
websites that can help you prepare for specific 
aspects of the assessment centre by giving you 
more information about the types of task that 
may be given and opportunities to complete test 
questionnaires. Some of these are listed at the end 
of the chapter (page 310). 
Assessment centres can be quite daunting but it is 
important to bear in mind:
•• As a range of areas are being assessed, it is likely 
that you will find some assessments easier than 
others and that you will perform more effectively 
on some than on others. Try not to panic if you 
feel you have performed poorly on one task – 
you may perform well in other areas and it is 
your overall performance that is being assessed.
•• Focus on your own performance and 
avoid becoming over-concerned about the 
performance of other candidates. You are being 
assessed against pre-determined criteria rather 
than your performance in relation to other 
people. 
300
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Outline briefly how the disability does 
affect you
If possible, present this in the context of 
what you can do, or the strategies you have 
developed in order to achieve a result. For 
example:
My writing skills are good when I use speech-
to-text software. I am very familiar with X 
software. I work quickly and I have a clear 
writing style. I proof-read well but it is useful if 
someone else checks the final version.
I organise my time so that I change between 
tasks every few minutes if I can, so as to 
change the groups of muscles I am using. I 
tend to keep two or three different tasks on the 
go at any one time. This is usually very efficient 
because I do not get bored and it fills in the 
natural pauses that occur when you wait for 
responses from clients. 
Mention ways that the disability will affect you 
at work and what your needs will be.
•• ‘I need to jot down verbal instructions and 
then I can work through them.’
•• ‘The wheel chair requires a width of X cm.’
•• ‘I am sensitive to light and will need to work 
in dimmed light or wear glasses with tinted 
lenses, which I will provide.’
Preparing for the interview
Mental preparation
If you have made a sensible job choice, were 
able to meet the ‘person specifications’ and 
have thought through answers to likely 
questions, you should feel confident that you 
have a reasonable chance of being considered 
for the job. The majority of applicants do 
not receive an interview, so if you have been 
offered one, this is already a success. Focus 
on being calm, and on the questions you 
can answer. Remind yourself of your interest 
in the job and of what you have to offer the 
employer. Make sure you sound convincing to 
yourself. It is natural to feel anxious, but avoid 
feeding your anxiety by negative thinking.
a
•• IT skills (awareness of different ways of making 
electronic material accessible, which the company 
might need in order to meet disability legislation)
•• people skills (familiarity in dealing with other 
people’s discomfort, embarrassment or 
rudeness; familiarity with a wider range of 
people; awareness of how people respond to 
‘outsiders’; greater ease in dealing with people 
with disabilities, who form a large minority of the 
population)
•• creativity and problem-solving skills (you 
will probably have had to find new ways of 
performing a range of tasks, some of which called 
for ingenuity)
•• self-management skills (disabilities usually call for 
greater application, determination, self-motivation 
and endurance).
No two people are alike
Your disability and your strategies for dealing with it, 
as well as your individual characteristics, will mean 
that you are different from any other person with 
a disability that the employer has met. However, 
the employer may have had a bad experience 
employing a person with a similar disability. Even 
though it should be obvious, it is worth your 
mentioning that no two people with the disability 
respond in the same way, so that the employer starts 
with a cleaner slate in considering your application. 
Be clear about your abilities
The employer may have very mistaken ideas about 
what a person with your disability can do. They may 
underestimate your capabilities. Outline, briefly, your 
achievements. For example:
I gained excellent feedback from my work 
placement, where I helped to design a new door 
operation system. I was able to call upon the design 
and IT skills that I had developed through my 
degree, and feel these would be very useful for this 
job too.
I worked as a volunteer technician for three years for 
a local theatre group. This brought me into contact 
with a wide range of people. Many community 
groups used the theatre. I feel this experience 
has developed my expertise in finding technical 
solutions at very short notice and on a tight budget. 
It also showed me that I enjoy working with older 
people. These skills and qualities should stand me in 
good stead for this post.
301
What do employers really want?

Activity
Speaking time
Look at the example below. How long do you 
think it would take to deliver? Read it aloud at 
a reasonable speed, with expression, and time 
yourself. 
Q:	 ‘Have you worked in a caring post before?’ 
(The candidate has not done so.) 
A:	 ‘My most relevant work experience has 
been in acting as a student tutor to three 
young children in a local school. Those 
children were very vulnerable, and I had 
to develop skills which are typical of those 
needed in care posts. For example, I focused 
on building a rapport with the children, 
watching for non-verbal cues, and being 
sensitive to their feelings. I had to be 
prepared to wait and work at their speed. 
I also had to consider the wishes of the 
teacher and other parties. I feel I achieved 
a good relationship with the children and 
their teachers. I negotiated work schemes 
with the teacher and each child. The teacher 
said that they all made an improvement 
and I received very good feedback, so it 
seems to have worked well. I think that gives 
me a good foundation for this post, and I 
particularly look forward to working with 
children and parents.’
•• What do you think are the strong points 
about this answer?
Presentation
Employers expect candidates to be smartly dressed 
and presentable: you may need to act as the public 
face of their company at some stage. Pay attention 
to details such as clean hands and fingernails, 
polished shoes, and a smart bag. This is true even if 
you will not be expected to dress smartly in the job. 
In the interview
First impressions
Although the whole interview is important, you 
can make the interview run more smoothly if the 
first minute is well managed. This requires only a 
few simple actions. 
•• Look clean and smart.
•• Be on time.
Prepare for likely questions
Preparing for the more obvious questions will help 
you to feel confident about answering at least 
some questions well. This gives you more room for 
error on other questions. The section below gives 
an indication of the kinds of questions that you can 
expect.
Two-minute answers
When preparing your answers, aim to complete 
any answer in one to two minutes. The interviewer 
may wish to ask between six and ten questions, as 
well as using time to ask the question and make 
comments of their own. It is unlikely the employer 
will wish the question stage to last more than 
20–30 minutes. If your answers are long, they may 
not be able to ask all their questions, which means 
you will be disadvantaged if they award points for 
each answer. 
Identify your strong points for each question
Before the interview, identify what are the 
strongest points you can make for each likely 
question. A strong answer will refer to experience, 
achievement and success. It will also be specific: 
give at least one example, with reference to the 
scale or importance of the achievement, including 
one or two key pieces of data if relevant. 
Prepare points to include in the interview
Use the interview to bring out your strongest 
points. Be very clear what these are in advance so 
that you bring them in when an opportunity arises. 
Before the interview:
•• List your strongest five achievements, qualities or 
attributes 
•• sum these up in fewer than 20 words
•• think of which questions you may be asked 
where you can bring in these five points
•• be ready to bring them in elsewhere if they do 
not arise naturally.
Sense of time
Practise speaking aloud and timing yourself so 
that you develop a sense of what two to three 
minutes feels like. You should build up a sense of 
how much you can say within that time, without 
sounding rushed. You can cover a number of 
relevant details in two minutes if you are precise 
and to the point. The activity ‘Speaking time’, 
below, should help.
302
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

the employer already has information about your 
skills and experience. The employer or interview 
panel will want to choose someone who:
•• can do the job with minimum training and 
supervision 
•• seems like a reasonable, sensible person, with 
common sense, whom colleagues could work 
with
•• answers their questions, rather than delivers a 
sales pitch
•• will ‘fit’ the post; who seems to suit the work 
temperamentally
•• looks as though they will ‘fit in’ generally.
Team work and supportive working climates are 
important so it is understandable that interview 
panels will favour people who seem to have the 
right characteristics to suit their work environment. 
This is usually a question of apparent personality. 
Under equal opportunities legislation, interviews 
should not discriminate on the grounds of sex, 
race, disability, etc. However, personality and other 
characteristics can become confused in people’s 
minds. If you suspect discrimination, you have 
legal rights.
It is important to project yourself as mature, 
reasonable and friendly. It may help to focus 
on this rather than struggling to make ‘perfect 
answers’. Many people come across as very stilted, 
and even bizarre, in interview because they are 
nervous. Focus on the needs of the panel – what 
they are looking for – rather than on ‘selling’ 
yourself.
During the interview
Put yourself in the employers’ position. They are 
likely to interview at least four people during 
a period of two to three hours. They may be 
interviewing dozens of people over several weeks. 
Even four interviews in a row can be tiring. It will 
be appreciated if you:
•• provide brief answers which are to the point
•• provide clear examples
•• provide exactly the information you are asked 
for 
•• are ready for predictable questions so that you 
can answer promptly.
Avoid
•• long, winding answers that go off the point
•• Ensure your right hand is free in order to shake 
hands.
•• No matter how you feel, smile and appear 
relaxed.
•• Look pleased to meet the interviewers. Shake 
hands firmly, look them in the eye, and listen 
when they say their names. 
•• Move calmly so that you do not crash into 
furniture.
•• Sit upright, alert and interested for the interview.
During the interview, avoid apologies and 
regrets. Work with the situation as it is, not with 
what might have gone better. Tell yourself that 
the interviewers’ questions are interesting and 
manageable – keep considering what it is they are 
looking for in an employee and what examples 
you can give them to reassure them that you can 
meet their needs.
You do not need to be magical, a super-brain, or 
word-perfect. Everybody stumbles on some words 
and questions. Avoid gimmicks, ‘hard sell’ and 
theatrics. Be natural. If possible, imagine you are 
being interviewed by an interested relation of one 
of your friends or colleagues. Although this advice 
seems obvious, many candidates do not come 
across as genuinely interested in the job, easy to 
get on with, honest or natural.
Keep it simple 
It is not unusual to ruin a potentially good 
interview by trying too hard to impress. If you 
demonstrate a reasonable degree of calm, interest 
and enthusiasm, you will already be well placed.
Employers may take a number of approaches to 
selecting a candidate. They will usually look for a 
‘good fit’ between what they want and what the 
candidates can offer. This is partly a question of 
skills and experience. However, the majority of 
candidates short-listed for interview will probably 
be well matched for skills and experience. Possibly, 
none may meet all the requirements. All will meet 
about 75–95 per cent, with different kinds of 
strengths. If the employer needs very specific skills 
which are in short supply, the person with the best 
skills will get the job. 
However, the probability is that the choice will 
come down to inter-personal skills and behaviour 
demonstrated in the interview. The interview is 
about meeting you and seeing what you are like:

What do employers really want?

hope to achieve from this job that will further your 
own aims in a few years’ time. Your answer should 
suggest there is benefit to yourself as well as the 
employer in you being offered this post. 
‘What attracted you to this job?’
Candidates are unlikely to be interviewed and/
or appointed unless they show interest in the 
specific job and work context, unless they possess 
very highly valued skills in short supply. Find out 
about the occupational area or industry and the 
employer – at least enough to hold a conversation 
for a few minutes.
‘Tell us about yourself’
This can be the most difficult question as there 
is so much to choose from. It is, therefore, a 
question for which you should prepare. Play safe 
by referring to your career ambitions and why you 
think these suit your personal characteristics and 
experience. Keep it very brief. The employer may 
be looking to see how aware of your audience and 
how concise you are, rather than being interested 
in your life.
Person specification and competency questions
Most questions will relate to the person 
specification. Although you will have given this 
information already when you applied, employers 
may ask similar questions to ones you believe you 
have answered. This may be for several reasons.
•• The panel may not have been involved in the 
short-listing process and may have received your 
details at the last moment. 
•• The panel is seeing many people. They are likely 
to remember what they hear rather than what 
you have written. 
•• Do not assume that just because you have given 
the answer in the paperwork, the panel will have 
read it. Give a full answer in case they have not. 
•• The panel is looking at your people skills. They 
know you know the answers to most questions, 
but want to see how well you communicate 
information to other people.
•• They are ‘double-checking’ to compare your 
verbal answers with those on paper. 
Competence questions
For competence-based applications, most 
questions usually relate to the competences in the 
person specification. This means you can prepare 
for these with reasonable confidence. Think of 
•• ‘interesting anecdotes’
•• giving several examples if you are asked only for 
one
•• giving a long background to your answers.
Opening questions
Employers tend to start interviews with one or two 
questions to settle the interviewee. Here are some 
typical questions.
‘Have you had a good journey?’ 
This is politeness. Answer very briefly. 
‘Tell me a little about your programme’ 
Two or three sentences will suffice. Draw out 
unusual features as these may reflect well upon 
you.
‘Why do you want this job now?’ 
Be as specific as you can. Include reference to 
something about the company that appeals to 
you. The employer wants to know why you want 
to work at this company, and that you have done 
some homework about the company, not that you 
are desperate for a job. Indicate what you think 
you can offer to the company.
‘Where do you see yourself in 3/5/20 years’ 
time?’
The employer is looking to see whether you are 
realistic and whether you are a good match for 
the job. They may be checking to see whether you 
are likely to leave within a few months or weeks 
of appointment. You may not know your plans 
five years into the future but give a strong answer 
that indicates you have an idea of what you want 
to achieve. Refer to the kind of experience you 
304
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

•• can take on major projects in almost any area
•• is a responsible worker.
‘Flexibility’ may mean willingness to:
•• fit in
•• work with a wide range of people
•• work unusual or long hours
•• change schedule at short notice
•• respond quickly to crises
•• work at different locations
•• travel
•• help out different departments in emergencies
•• change department, role or workload 
•• find solutions to a wide variety of problems. 
It is important to work out, from the level and 
nature of the job, what kind of interpretation to 
use. It is also important to gain a balance, so that 
you can show that you are able to work with and 
listen to others, but are also able to work alone, 
take responsibility, and give direction to your own 
and others’ work. 
Anticipating questions
For each element of the person specification, 
consider how you would respond to the following 
questions, bearing in mind the requirements of the 
job for which you are applying:
•• Your best example. What is good about it? What 
worked well? What was your own contribution? 
•• Two or three brief examples. What do these 
suggest about the breadth of your experience? 
•• An example from which you learnt something 
that improved your current performance. If 
you are asked for your ‘worst experience’, this 
may be a useful example as you can emphasise 
what you learnt that benefits your current 
performance. 
•• How would you advise somebody else to 
perform this competence?
•• What professional development have you 
undertaken in relation to this competence?
•• What skills and personal qualities were involved 
in an example of this competence?
•• How regularly do you demonstrate this 
competence? (This is to check whether your 
example is a ‘one off’ or represents your 
everyday experience.)
•• At what level of responsibility do you 
demonstrate this competence? (This is to check 
your ability to take responsibility for tasks that 
involve this competence.)
unusual angles for the question. A competence 
question may be phrased in very different ways. 
For example, a question on dealing with difficult 
people might be phrased as:
•• ‘From your life and work so far, give the best 
example of a time when you had to deal with a 
difficult member of the public.’
•• ‘Can you give us two or three examples of a 
time when you …’
•• ‘Think of an example when you dealt badly with 
a member of the public. What did you learn 
from that occasion and how has this affected 
the way you would approach a similar situation 
now?’
•• ‘What kind of advice would you give a new 
member of staff who had not dealt with the 
public before?’
•• ‘What professional development have you 
undertaken in recent years to improve your 
capability in dealing with members of the 
public?’
•• ‘What is the worst example of you dealing with 
a member of the public? What did you learn 
from this experience?’
Catch-all questions
A number of questions tend to appear in many job 
descriptions, and mean different things depending 
on the type of job. 
‘Team work’ may be used to mean:
•• good at people skills
•• easy to get on with
•• takes on board colleagues’ needs
•• has specific skills in negotiating with others
•• has experience of working in project teams. 
‘Leadership’ could be used to refer to:
•• willingness to speak on behalf of the group
•• a strong vision that carries other people – such 
as directing plays or setting up student groups
•• a tendency to be the person chosen to act as 
group chair
•• experience of running a project
•• experience of running a major project.
‘Good self-starter’ may mean:
•• enjoys working on their own
•• will accept a job that offers little support
•• works well independently
•• can start a new job without supervision
•• has good problem-solving skills
305
What do employers really want?

about these. Be prepared to give examples if 
questioned further. See pp. 319 and 346.
A critical event in your life or work that you 
have coped with
This may be another way of asking about ‘worst 
mistakes’ or ‘highlights’, depending on how it 
is phrased. You are unlikely to receive all three 
questions, so you should be able to use the same 
material to prepare for at least two of these 
questions. This question is looking for such features 
as evidence of levels of responsibility you have 
held, coping and problem-solving strategies, ability 
to reflect upon and learn from experience and 
apply learning to new areas. For caring professions, 
it may be used to explore your ability to describe 
and work with emotions and feelings; in creative 
fields, to see how you use experience as inspiration 
for your artwork; for management posts, to see 
how well you manage complex and difficult 
situations.
What you learned from …
You may be asked why you chose a particular 
study option or job, and what you learned from 
these. For example, you may have learnt to be 
flexible, to work with difficult people, to maintain 
high levels of concentration when working with 
numbers, to think analytically, to be a stronger 
person emotionally, to deal with the unexpected. 
Indicate how the subject or experience drew out 
your natural strengths and abilities. Focus on those 
aspects that are relevant to the job for which you 
are applying. 
Closing questions
General interest questions
Sometimes employers ask about your general 
interests at the end of an interview. These usually 
seem to be easier, and so candidates may relax and 
let down their guard, revealing a different side to 
themselves. For example, the employer may ask:
Q:  ‘I see you are keen on Mexico. What is the 
interest there?’ 
It is important to remember that you are still being 
interviewed. The employer is still looking to see 
what it is you have to offer the company. Your 
answer should reflect this. Keep your reply brief: 
this is not an opportunity to tell the employer all 
about your pet interests. Your answer might bring 
Other typical questions
Other favourite questions are variations on the 
following themes.
An example of a highlight from your life or 
career so far 
Be prepared to describe briefly what happened 
and why you consider this to be a highlight. For 
example, it may have developed particular skills 
that would be useful to the company. It may have 
been an occasion where you took on a challenge 
or worked at a higher level of responsibility than 
previously and proved your capability. 
An example of your worst mistake
Use this as an opportunity to show how you are 
willing to learn from mistakes and to put that 
learning to good use. Avoid using an example that 
would make the employer worry about employing 
you. Select the kind of mistake that anybody could 
make. The employer will also want to see that 
you are willing to take responsibility for your own 
actions, rather than trying to lay the blame on 
others (even if it was someone else’s fault, in your 
opinion). See the Competence Sheet on p. 374.
Examples of your commitment to personal 
development
You can expect this kind of question from 
employers who have ‘Investors in People’ status, 
professional organisations and posts related to 
public office. 
What contribution do you think you can make? 
What have you got to offer?
Refer to specific experience and skills that you have 
gained and which are likely to be of benefit to the 
company. Relate your contribution to what has 
been described in the job specification and to what 
you have found out about the company. Include 
personal qualities. If possible, refer to feedback 
that you have received from employers or from 
colleagues or team members. 
What personal qualities do you possess that 
would be of benefit in this work?
Select two or three qualities upon which you 
can focus. Give one or two sentences to sum up 
where you demonstrated this quality and why you 
consider it relevant to the current post. List briefly 
three to five other qualities that you also possess. 
Leave it to the interviewer to ask you more details 
306
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

•• about whether advertised terms and conditions 
can be changed just for you
•• questions that start with ‘Will I have to …?’ (Use: 
Will the job involve …?)
•• that your common sense should be able to 
answer.
Is there anything you feel we should know that 
you have not yet had a chance to tell us?
•• Some employers are aware that candidates 
are anxious and may not have given their 
best answers. If you really feel that you have 
let yourself down on an answer, this is an 
opportunity to return to it, if you feel you can 
now give a better response.
•• Before the interview, you may have rehearsed 
skills and qualities that you feel are important 
to this kind of job or company. If these have 
not been referred to in the interview, raise these 
now. 
If we offered you the job, when would you be 
able to start?
Ensure you are clear about your personal 
arrangements so that you are in a position to 
answer this. 
Activity
Sabotage the interview
1	 List all the things you can think of to really 
mess up an interview so that the employer 
is convinced you are unprepared and 
unsuitable. You may include comments 
related to:
•• your clothing
•• your punctuality
•• not knowing anything about the company
•• asking silly questions when given the 
opportunity. 
2	 Give yourself advice!
What advice would you give to somebody 
else who said they sabotaged interviews in 
this way? The advice may seem obvious to 
you – but many people forget the basics. If 
you are uncertain about how to prevent the 
sabotage you suggest, speak to a careers 
adviser at the university. 
3	 Write a preparation list for yourself in order 
to ensure you are ready for your interview.
out personal qualities or an ability that is useful 
to the company. For example (depending on the 
circumstances):
A:  ‘I am keen to develop my Spanish.’ (Useful if 
the company has Spanish-speaking offices or 
customers.)
A:  ‘I wanted to find out about a different culture 
and have always been interested in Mexican 
art.’ (This suggests you have a breadth of 
interests and the confidence to go and find things 
out for yourself.)
Do you have any questions you would like to 
ask us?
You do not have to have a question, especially if 
the information is available in the literature that 
was sent to you, or is available from Personnel or 
on the Internet. Avoid unnecessary questions: they 
may suggest you have not done your homework. 
The employer will not want the interview to go 
on too long, so keep to one or two essential 
questions. Reasonable questions to ask are, for 
example:
•• related to something that was reported recently 
in the trade papers about the company, 
especially if it allows them to make a positive 
response
•• genuine questions that determine whether you 
want the job. Now is the time to ask these
•• questions about training and professional 
development 
•• whether there is a mentoring scheme for new 
employees
•• what would the employer consider to be a 
sign of your success after two years with the 
company? What are their expectations of you as 
a new employee?
•• who you will be reporting to
•• opportunities for travel, or for secondment
•• what the next step will be. When are you likely 
to hear the outcome of the interview? 
Questions to avoid
Avoid asking questions:
•• where the information is provided already in the 
paperwork or on the company website
•• that you could have checked with HR/Personnel 
before the interview
•• that you should have checked before applying in 
order to make sure this was the right job
307
What do employers really want?

•• Were your answers too brief? If so, think of a 
good example of your experience that you could 
use to develop that answer more fully.
Analyse your performance
•• Which examples did you use? Were these your 
best? Remind yourself of your best example so 
that this stays in your mind next time.
•• Did you include all of your best points?
•• What went well about the interview? Jot this 
down and read it before the next interview.
•• What could have been better? How would you 
deal with this next time? Write this down and 
read it before the next interview.
Ask for feedback
Some companies will give brief feedback to 
unsuccessful candidates. It is worth asking for 
this. However, be prepared for very general 
comments such as ‘the candidate we selected was 
the most successful in meeting the criteria’. Some 
companies refuse to give any feedback, in order to 
avoid legal repercussions.
Reflection: Learn from the job 
application
•• Select one job interview that you attended, 
whether successful or not. If you have not 
applied for a job interview, now is a good 
time to practise with a friend. 
•• In your reflective journal, go through the 
‘After the interview’ section above. Jot down 
ten things you did well.
•• Jot down the three things which are most 
important to improving your performance at 
job interviews.
Activity
Practise the interview
•• Find one or preferably two other people with 
whom to practise your interview techniques. 
This may be embarrassing, but it is better to 
get feedback before the interview rather than 
after.
•• Give details of the kind of job for which you 
are applying. The other person(s) can use 
and adapt the questions in this chapter to 
conduct an interview for your job. 
•• Give at least 15 minutes for each person’s 
interview.
•• Ask for (or give) feedback that is constructive. 
The feedback should give clear guidance 
on what is good about your interview 
performance already, as well as what could be 
even better. 
•• Note down the feedback you receive and 
decide what you will do to improve your 
performance.
After the interview
After the interview, you will probably remember all 
the things you wish you had said. It is not always 
easy to tell whether you were successful. Use the 
experience to learn more about your performance 
so that it was not a waste of time, no matter what 
the outcome is.
Analyse the questions
Jot down all the questions you were asked. 
•• Which ones were unexpected? Were any of 
these similar to questions that you had prepared, 
without you realising? Note the different ways 
that employers can word questions aiming at 
similar information. 
•• Note how many questions you were asked. 
How long was your interview supposed to last? 
Take ten minutes off that time and divide the 
remaining time by the number of questions. 
How long did the employer expect each answer 
to be? 
•• Were your answers too long? If so, practise 
punchier responses for the next interview. 
308
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Closing comments
This chapter opened with an outline of the 
career planning journey: Aspire, Act, Apply, 
Achieve. The opening sections of the book 
encouraged you to consider what ‘success’ 
meant for you. This should help you to set life 
and career aspirations that are meaningful for 
you. Creating and taking the right opportunities 
for you will help you to achieve those 
aspirations.
This chapter helps you to put your career 
planning journey on a good footing, helping 
you with guidance on how to act, apply and 
achieve successfully. It guides you through 
the appointments processes for new jobs, 
placements or internships, so that these 
become more predictable, manageable and 
more likely to result in success. It also supports 
you in learning from work placements and 
employment, in order to help improve your 
future performance when applying for jobs.
This chapter has covered the basics of applying 
for work as a graduate student. There is a very 
wide range of materials available to help with 
specific aspects of the process. If you are very 
anxious about certain aspects, such as answering 
interview questions, or writing CVs for the 
Internet, then there are books to help with every 
detail. 
However, in most cases, the basics are enough. 
If the employer wants someone with more 
experience or particular skills, they will employ 
on that basis, no matter how good your 
application. The important basic rules are:
•• Apply a problem-solving strategy to 
finding a job. Good preparation is similar 
to the ‘problem elaboration’ referred to in 
Chapter 6. 
•• Research your options and look for 
opportunities that carry you towards your 
long-term goals.
•• Choose well. Unrealistic and unsuitable 
applications may be a waste of your time. 
•• Rather than sending out hundreds of 
applications, select a few applications, 
research the companies and fine-tune the 
personal statement or competences so that 
they are precise, informative, clear and 
relevant to the job. 
•• Ensure you keep your personal records or 
progress file up to date so that you can 
make a good application at short notice. See 
Chapter 11.
•• Prepare for the interview. Use the competence 
sheets in your progress file.
You will be a stronger job applicant if you can:
•• demonstrate how a job matches your personal 
aims and values (see Chapter 1)
•• talk knowledgeably about the business and 
role
•• explain coherently how you gained relevant 
experience
•• show how you made good use of 
opportunities
•• articulate your skills in managing people, tasks 
and yourself, and demonstrate that you can 
think intelligently about the job.
Finally, aim to learn from the experience. You 
may pass the majority of courses or exams 
that you take in your life, but it is unlikely that 
you will be successful in gaining a job for each 
application. You will benefit enormously if 
you view each application and interview as a 
chance to gain experience, develop application 
skills, and learn something about employers or 
yourself. Reflect on the experiences and keep 
records so that you can benefit in the future.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Introduction
It’s never too early to start planning for life after 
university and you can save yourself a lot of time 
and effort if you record your achievements as you 
progress through your course. Chapters 1 and 2 
focused on an analysis of yourself, and the vision 
and goals that should be informing and inspiring 
such advance planning, in order to assist your 
career development. 
When you apply for a job or attend an interview, 
you will be required to identify, at speed, the best 
examples for a wide range of questions. Most of 
us have the information we need to make good 
responses – but accessing it at speed is not always 
easy. 
This chapter provides resources for collating 
information about your experience and reflecting 
upon that experience so that you can identify your 
achievements easily.
It is important to bear in mind that employers will 
be looking to see not only what experience you 
have but also what you made of the opportunity: 
your successes, what you learned from the 
experience, its significance in your life, and 
how you can use the experience to benefit their 
company. They will want to see how you make 
use of experience and opportunity generally – so 
that they feel comfortable that you will make good 
use of opportunities on their behalf as well as your 
own. They will use the information you give them 
to form judgements about your coping strategies, 
your work ethic, your attitude to work and life, 
your character, and even the way you relate to 
others. 
Paper or electronic personal records?
You are likely to need both paper-based and 
electronic personal records for different purposes. 
Many certificates, licences and similar records 
will be provided to you in paper format. It is 
useful to develop a system of records that holds 
these together. Moreover, you will be asked to 
send copies of these to employers, so keeping 
these together with your personal records will 
save you time. In addition, you may wish to 
include reflective notes, examples of your work, 
photographs, images, and hand-drawn records for 
your own personal use. These may be best stored 
in paper form.
Chapter 11
Maintaining good personal records
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• create and build your personal records
•• undertake a profile of current skills and qualities
•• map your personal competencies in relation to the ‘person specifications’ frequently required for 
jobs, and to questions typically asked at job interviews
•• record your education, training and other examples of professional development
•• develop personal resources that you can draw upon to write a CV and personal statement when 
applying for work.

On the other hand, some records (such as your 
CV, education and training history, personal 
statement, and competence sheets) will need to be 
updated regularly. This is accomplished most easily 
electronically. Hard copies of these can be useful 
for reminding you of things you need to do when 
browsing through your records. 
Developing your personal records
Organising your personal records
The contents of your personal records will be 
particular to you. Whatever you include, it is useful 
to:
•• include a contents page or folder so that you 
can find records and evidence easily
•• make electronic copies of data that need to be 
updated, such as records of your employment 
history, skills and competences 
•• number the items in each folder or section 
rather than from the front of the file. This will 
enable you to update sections with minimum 
effort
•• for paper folders, invest in a large folder (as your 
records will grow as your work history develops) 
and section dividers.
An example of a Contents sheet is offered below (p. 
317), as a guide to what you could include in your 
records. 
Records for personal planning
The nature of these records will vary depending 
on the requirements of your programme. They will 
also vary according to the importance you place 
upon your own personal development and the role 
of reflection in your life. 
The various chapters of this book have structured 
reflection along thematic lines and through a 
variety of activities and questionnaires. If you 
completed any of those activities, you will already 
have compiled a record of yourself, your thinking, 
your attitudes and your goals. You may find it 
useful to draw together some of those resources 
into a single electronic folder and supporting 
paper-based portfolio. In particular, you may wish 
to make a photocopy of responses you completed 
on paper to some of the following activities. If so, 
include copies of the blank pro-formas so that you 
can update your responses.

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

It is extremely common for people to emerge 
from an interview saying. ‘Why didn’t I say that?’ 
‘Why didn’t I use this example rather than that?’ 
Similarly, it is easy, once the envelope is in the 
post, to remember information that could have 
been included to strengthen the application. 
The answer is usually in the preparation. Good 
preparation means that you have much more 
control over your responses, whether at the 
application or interview stage. Your memory is 
primed to call upon the examples you really want 
to use. Moreover, knowing that you are well 
prepared will increase your overall confidence, 
so that you come across as a much stronger 
candidate. 
Records of reflection
Recording reflection
Keeping personal records of some kind is integral 
to personal development work. Your university 
may require you to keep a log, blog journal or 
portfolio and give you very precise directions 
about what to include and how to present it. 
Alternatively, you may be asked to devise your own 
records and presentation. Most of the resources 
associated with this chapter are provided in the 
Resource Bank for easy use, at the end of the book 
and electronically.
Logs, blogs and journals
In this section, the term ‘reflective journal’ is used 
to refer to all kinds of reflective logs, blogs, diaries, 
journals and notes. There are different ways of 
keeping reflective journals. You can: 
1	 Note down all aspects of a particular 
experience, such as the fine details of an 
observation or experiment or how you 
designed a product. Some subjects require you 
to note this objectively (without comment); 
others require you to reflect upon what you 
observe.  
2	 Keep a daily or weekly diary on a particular 
theme.
3	 Keep together all the influences, inspirations, 
sketches and thought processes that led to a 
final product or outcome. This is particularly 
true of art, design and other creative 
programmes.

Records for job applications
Chapter 10 looks at the process of applying for 
a job, and making best use of information about 
yourself. A good application will be tailored to the 
particular job and person specification, which takes 
time to put together well. Good interview answers 
may require you to reflect upon your experience 
from quite different angles. 
313
Maintaining good personal records

•• a notebook you like or electronic variant you 
enjoy using
•• numbered or labelled so you can find previous 
entries easily and quickly. Use headings and 
dates for each entry.
A loose-leaf folder or electronic journal has the 
advantage that you can enter your responses to 
events out of sequence, when the idea strikes you. 
However, you may prefer to keep a notebook, 
diary or portfolio, depending on what is needed 
for your course and what suits your own style.
Format for a journal entry
As well as impromptu entries, such as those listed 
above, you may find it helpful to work to a format 
to explore your progress on current goals. One 
format is given on p. 336. Ideally, this should be 
used in conjunction with an action plan (see p. 
177).
Portfolios
What is a portfolio?
Progress files were described in the Introduction. 
A portfolio or progress file of personal records is 
simply a file where you keep together relevant 
information about yourself. These assist the process 
of reflection. It is useful to keep and update a 
portfolio of information that you can call upon to:
•• go over your reflections
•• monitor your progress
•• keep important documentation together
•• keep feedback in one place
•• use for sessions with tutors, careers advisers and 
support staff
•• help staff write your references
•• write your CV and job applications. See pages 
295–9.
Contents of a portfolio
You may find it useful to include some or all of the 
following in your full portfolio.  
A contents page
Divide the material in your portfolio into sections. 
Number and label these so that you can find 
material and update it easily: see p. 317. Use a 
detailed contents page to direct you to materials.
4	 Share your thoughts with others through a 
blog.
5	 Record all the information you consider 
significant about your learning. This could 
include items such as:
•• the general topics covered
•• exhibitions, placements, visits, field trips, etc.
•• your feelings about the programme, teaching 
methods, students, and your responses to 
these
•• contributions you make in class
•• things you find difficult – and how you 
address those difficulties
•• thoughts about your learning styles and 
habits, and the appropriateness of these for 
you and your learning goals
•• ideas that arise from your study
•• what you find most stimulating in your 
current study
•• how your studies relate to real life
•• how theory covered in class is relevant to 
practical or case work you are undertaking
•• what you are learning about yourself through 
your interactions with others
•• tips and strategies you are gathering
•• what you are learning about how you 
manage your emotions
•• sources of inspiration.
Maintaining a reflective journal
Keeping a reflective journal can be very 
challenging, especially staying motivated to make 
regular entries. It takes determination, good 
planning and a far-sighted approach. It also means 
having a strong sense of responsibility for your 
own development over time. Keeping a journal 
requires the ‘stick-with-it-ness’ Edison referred to 
above (p. 182). The benefits tend to arrive very 
gently and may not be noticeable for a long time. 
Even if you cannot detect them easily, the benefits 
are likely to be there. 
Chapter 8 provides support and guidance on 
developing skills, methods and thought processes 
that underpin reflective practice.
Using your reflective journal
Reflective journals should be easy to use. This 
means:
•• easy to carry around
314
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Personal papers
You may like to include personal material that you 
think relevant to your personal development, such 
as photographs, letters, school reports, poems, 
quotations, job descriptions or articles. These may 
relate to:
•• sources of inspiration
•• things that motivate you
•• charts of your progress to date
•• things that remind you of what you wish to 
achieve
•• things that you find reassuring when stressed. 
Maintaining records for job 
applications
Almost every job application will call for very basic 
information:
•• education and training history
•• employment history.
Although this should be a straightforward matter, 
information is usually scattered over many different 
pieces of paper from employers or across several 
CVs, depending on the nature of the job. It is 
useful to draw all of that information together in 
one place, so that you can access it at a moment’s 
notice if the right job appears. Use one file or box 
to keep all such materials together. Keep a disk/
memory stick of electronic records with your paper 
records.
Education and training history 
At some point you could be asked for all or any of 
the following:
•• Schools you attended (usually the schools where 
you took qualifications after the age of 15 will be 
all that is required). You will need the name and 
address of the school, the date you started and 
the date you left.
•• Qualifications you took, the date, and the result. 
If you are asked for the awarding authority, that 
is usually printed on the certificate. If you are 
offered the job, you will be asked to bring in 
the original certificates, so it is important to be 
accurate when you give these details. 
•• If you took your qualifications in a different 
country from the one where you are now 
studying, or where you intend to work, ensure 
that you gather details of the local equivalent for 
Summary
Include a personal statement or position paper (see 
pages 243–5). Aim to be selective and specific, 
identifying key themes and bringing out what 
you have learnt. The position paper should refer 
precisely, but very briefly, to evidence contained 
within the portfolio.
Formal documents
•• certificates of any qualifications
•• your academic transcript
•• references and testimonials you have received
•• an example of a recent piece of marked work is 
also useful when seeing support tutors. 
Developmental documents
•• completed, dated, self-evaluation questionnaires
•• responses to any activities in this book or similar 
activities
•• feedback from tutors and peers for past 
assignments and your commentary on these.
Planning documents
•• documents you completed about your current 
goals and aspirations, such as what you want to 
achieve from the course, where you see yourself 
in five to ten years’ time, who or what inspires 
you, what motivates you, and what you need to 
do to achieve your goals
•• your updated action plan to achieve academic 
or other goals
•• details of priorities you have set, including 
milestones, targets and deadlines, and how far 
you kept to these. 
Documents relevant to future job applications
•• a profile of vocational, technical, academic and 
other skills you have developed
•• an updated summary of your education and 
training, including school, college, training 
courses and relevant short courses
•• an updated list of all work experience, with 
the dates, addresses of employers, a brief 
job description, main responsibilities, skills or 
qualities demonstrated, and what you learned 
from doing that work which is of value to your 
current aspirations
•• a curriculum vitae (CV) – a Careers Adviser can 
help with this, see pages 295–9
•• examples of experiences that demonstrate 
typical job competences.
315
Maintaining good personal records

•• if there are any gaps in your employment 
record. Employers are likely to ask you about 
any periods of a year or more where no work or 
education is indicated
•• what your job history says about how often you 
change job, how likely you are to stay with the 
company, the kinds of work you have accepted 
in the past, and your career path. If there 
are unusual jumps from one job to another, 
employers may ask you the reasons for this at 
interview. 
For mature students, the employer will probably 
want to see a period of continuity within the work 
history (at least two years). It is expected that 
younger applicants may have a number of short-
contract jobs. This is also true for certain types of 
work that are organised in short contracts. 
You will be required to give information such as: 
•• employer names
•• employer addresses
•• contact details for the employer (telephone, fax, 
email)
•• dates you began and finished work for each 
employer
•• your job title
•• your chief responsibilities
•• previous employers who can act as referees.
all your qualifications. Provide that information 
with your application, as well as details of 
where employers can check this equivalence for 
themselves.
•• Training you undertook as part of a job. Give 
brief details of short courses and the dates of 
these. 
•• Much learning is informal – a colleague may 
have shown you how to use a piece of software, 
for example, or you may have trained yourself in 
using a piece of equipment. Include brief details 
of the outcomes of such informal learning (what 
you can actually do as a result).
You will find it useful to draw all your certificates 
together into one section of your progress file. 
Employment history
Employers will look at your employment history to 
see:
•• whether your work history suggests you have 
the type and level of experience necessary for 
the job they are advertising. It is important to 
check that you use similar wording to that in the 
job description. Slight differences in the wording 
of a job title may mean that your experience or 
response is not relevant

Maintaining good personal records

Skills and personal qualities
It is likely that you will be asked to 
provide details of your skills and personal 
qualities on many different occasions 
such as:
•• applying for jobs
•• applying for promotions
•• applying for voluntary work, roles in 
the community
•• as part of annual review or appraisal
•• for skills sets inventories drawn up by 
businesses, community organisations, 
Boards of Governors and Trustees.
In general, you can expect to do more 
than simply list these. You may be asked 
to describe how you applied those skills 
in particular situations. It is easy to forget 
occasions when we applied particular 
skills well, so updating your records of 
these occasionally can be useful. 
•• The ‘Current skills and personal 
qualities’ sheet in the electronic 
Resource Bank and on page 319 
enables you to identify the range of 
skills and qualities you possess.
•• The ‘Evidence of Skills and Personal 
Qualities’ sheet in the Resource Bank 
and on page 344 enables you to 
analyse one or more skills in more 
depth as preparation for when you 
need to call upon this information. 
Records of education and training 
It is likely that every job you apply for, as well as any future 
courses, will ask about your education, qualifications and 
training. You may be asked to provide one or more of the 
following:
•• your highest level of qualification (e.g. a degree, a 
master’s degree)
•• to confirm that you have particular qualifications 
required for the job and, if you are offered the job, to 
provide the certificates
•• details of all your education from a certain age, such as 
from GCSE (or equivalent) onwards
•• details of training you have undertaken, formal courses 
and informal learning such as on-the-job training 
•• evidence, either through your personal statement 
or at interview, of what you have learnt through 
your education, training and experiences, especially 
experiences of employment.
On the chart in the Resource Bank (page 338), record 
details of your educational history. Order these so that your 
most recent courses and qualifications are at the head of 
the list. 
Record of your work history
You will need accurate records of your work history. This 
could be maintained as an up to date list within your CV. 
If you are not permitted to send in a CV, you can cut and 
paste these details either onto the form the employer sends 
or onto an attachment. If you do the latter, make sure that 
you include all the details that the employer requests. The 
information required varies from one job to another, and 
you may also need this for other purposes. For each job 
and period of employment keep a record of:
•• the exact dates you start and finish
•• the employer name and address
•• the job title
•• key responsibilities of your role
•• the experience you acquired
•• your reason for leaving
•• details of anyone you may want to call on for a 
reference.
Employers tend to require details of the salary of your last 
job and any additional benefits provided by your employer. 
They may also ask you to account for any gaps in your 
work history.

in a set of relevant skills. If you can train or 
advise others in the area, this is usually a sign of 
competence. 
Describing your competence
In interview, you may be asked to give evidence 
of your competence from one of a range of 
different perspectives (see Chapter 10). This can 
often catch people unawares so that they feel they 
have not done themselves justice. Similarly, when 
writing competence-based applications, it is easy 
to omit details for which the selection panel will 
be looking. This can make the difference between 
being selected or not. 
The competences selected for analysis in the 
Resource Bank (pages 333–82) are those frequently 
asked of graduates and others when they apply 
for jobs. A set of competence sheets are provided. 
Select those that are relevant to your employment 
or the types of position that you are likely to apply 
for. Each sheet provides prompts to assist you to 
analyse your competence and identify details of 
your ability to meet the job requirements.
Your records should contain details of some or all 
of the following:
•• the best example(s) of you demonstrating that 
competence
•• brief contextual evidence of the occasion(s) 
when you best demonstrated that competence
•• your level of responsibility (whether you were 
the manager with lead responsibility, or stepping 
in to cover in someone’s absence, or part of a 
small or large team)
•• your personal role or actions: what you did or 
said
•• what was the outcome of your action?
•• what would you do differently, if anything, in 
retrospect?
•• what did you learn that you have been able to 
apply in other situations, or could in the position 
for which you are applying?  
Selecting examples
For written applications, you are likely to be given 
a restricted word limit for listing skills or giving 
details of one example. In interviews, you may be 
given time only to describe one example in detail. 
It is not untypical to hear people say after an 
interview that the wrong example came to mind. 
Critical incident
During job applications, employers often ask if 
you can give details of an important event or 
experience that had a major impact upon your life 
or work. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘critical 
incident’. In particular, they are looking to see 
what kinds of things you regard as important (your 
values), how you managed transition and change, 
or how well you learn from experience.
It is useful to be prepared for this question, and 
the ‘Critical Incident Sheet’ in the Resource Bank, 
p. 345, outlines some of the main themes that are 
worth considering. Even if you are not applying for 
work, this is a useful exercise to work through from 
time to time, either using the same incident, or 
comparing your responses to different incidents.
Responding to competence-based 
questions
When you apply for a graduate job, you will 
receive a ‘person specification’ that outlines 
the qualities required for the post. Increasingly, 
employers are introducing competence-based 
applications. These ask you to give specific 
evidence of your competence under a number 
of headings that they provide. Whether or not 
you are asked details about competences at the 
application stage, it is typical for some or all of a 
job interview to be competence-based. 
Having a set of well-recorded competences 
can significantly boost your confidence in your 
performance during the application process. If 
you store these records electronically, you will find 
that you can save yourself a great deal of time in 
making each application.
What is a ‘competence’?
To be competent means to be able to perform 
an activity reasonably well and on more than one 
occasion. To consider yourself competent at a task, 
you are likely to be able to do what is necessary 
to achieve a successful outcome without having 
to check continually what needs to be done, and 
without supervision. Competence is associated 
with the notion of repeated performance; simply 
doing something once is not usually a sign of 
competence. Competence is often associated with 
well-placed confidence. It requires proficiency 
320
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

responses. You will be required to give very brief 
responses to each question, so your thinking must 
be clear, precise and succinct. 
Employers are looking at your own personal 
involvement and the responsibility you take for 
your own actions. Anything which comes across 
as an excuse or appears to be blaming others for 
a poor outcome will sound unconvincing. Speak 
about your own role and take responsibility for 
what did not work. Identify what you have learnt 
about how you would do things differently in the 
future. 
They will also be interested in knowing the level 
of operation: how high-profile was the work, how 
central were you to events, where did you stand 
in the hierarchy of people involved? Being able 
to contribute to projects led by others may be as 
important as being the leader, as both team work 
and leadership are prized qualities. 
You may find it useful to copy the blank sheets 
before completing them, so that you can use 
them again in the future. Electronic copies are also 
available at www.palgrave.com/studyskills/pdp so 
that you can update them easily.
In completing the records, it is worth taking time 
to jot down all the occasions you can think of 
when you exemplified the competence in action. 
This will give you a full list from which to select 
your best examples. Make use of the responses 
you have made to activities in chapters earlier 
in this book or on your programme. It can help 
to have a friend or relation to prompt you if you 
struggle to find examples. You can call upon the 
same experience for more than one competence, 
but it is useful to refer to at least three separate 
experiences or examples overall. 
Evidence of improvements in personal 
performance
When applying for a position, you may be asked 
questions about how you go about identifying 
areas for improvement, what you have done 
already to improve your performance and what 
the impact was of the action you took. It is likely 
that you will either be asked directly to provide 
one or more concrete examples of how you have 
drawn upon experience in order to improve 
performance, or that it will just be assumed 
For instance, they may have prepared to answer a 
question giving a ‘recent example’ and be asked 
for the ‘best example in relation to the current job’ 
– or vice versa. 
It is useful to update your records so that you are 
clear about:
•• which is your one best example of the 
competence from your experience? Usually 
this will be a recent example but sometimes a 
significant event or achievement may not be 
recent
•• details of all aspects of that best example
•• two other good examples, in brief.
•• what is the most relevant example for the job?
•• what is a recent example?
Building your competence
If you find that you are not able to give good 
examples of competence in any area, you will need 
to decide:
•• Is this a competence that is likely to be required 
for the kinds of jobs that interest you?
•• What opportunities are open to you to develop 
that competence?
Most employers want to see that you have 
experience. It is a frequent complaint that people 
cannot gain experience because they cannot get a 
job and they cannot get a job they want because 
they cannot gain the experience. Students have 
many opportunities to develop experiences that 
are less easy to come by once student life is over. 
Again, this is often not appreciated until the 
chance has passed. See pages 278–9.
Seize the opportunity while you are still a student – 
and ensure you have a good portfolio of skills and 
experience by the time you leave.
Completing the ‘evidence of 
competence’ sheets
The competence sheets in the Resource Bank, 
pages 333–82, can assist you in elaborating your 
personal competences. You may consider that 
very little space is provided for each answer. This 
encourages you to summarise the most salient 
points: it is unlikely that, in applying for jobs, you 
will ever have as much space as is provided by one 
of these sheets, nor time at interview to give fuller 
321
Maintaining good personal records

Closing comments
This chapter provides guidance on developing 
personal resources that can assist in:
•• making effective, well-evidenced, persuasive 
job applications
•• structuring your reflection about your 
experience.
These resources are not for use on a single 
occasion. As you move through your 
programme and as you gain wider experiences 
through life and work, you will find better 
examples to record. At the time, these 
experiences will appear very vivid in your mind 
but you will begin to lose the details over time. 
Write these down while they are still fresh. 
Reflect back upon those same events in a year’s 
time. Often, you will find that you see much 
more significance in the same events after time 
has elapsed. 
•• What did you learn about yourself and your own 
performance through this experience?
•• What did you learn that has general applicability 
(such as to new skills, experience, insights, 
specialist knowledge) especially to the position 
for which you are applying?
The sheet in the Resource Bank on page 334 
enables you to draw together your reflections 
of specific occasions where working on personal 
performance reaped rewards and provided insights 
that can be applied more generally.
that you will incorporate such examples in your 
applications and answers to interview questions. 
You may have to call upon such information as:
•• A brief summary of the context.
•• What needed to be done and why?

Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Introduction
Personal planning is not simply about making 
a ‘plan’ and following it. It is a developmental 
process that each individual moulds to suit their 
own needs and interests over time. It is about 
getting to grips with issues such as: 
•• who you are and the kind of person you want 
to be
•• the life you want to lead and what you want 
from life
•• what matters to you and what you want to 
achieve
•• the steps you will take to achieve your goals
•• recognising changes in your interests and 
charting out a new plan in line with those 
changes.
Good planning involves taking steps to ensure you 
have the information you need at your fingertips 
when you need it. It involves thinking about 
possibilities, some of which may seem far-fetched, 
and starting to put the support and skills in place 
now that might be useful later. 
This chapter offers structured opportunities to 
review your current position, referring back to 
activities undertaken in previous chapters,  
and looking forward to your next step. It looks at 
the process of managing personal development 
planning once you are already embarked on the 
journey of self-discovery and life planning.
Recognising personal changes
Goal inertia
Chapter 1 encouraged you to form a strong vision 
of what you aspire to be or to achieve. However, 
your views may already have changed. Each day, 
our experiences shape us anew. Over time, our 
aims and goals may become out of touch with 
who we have become: this is ‘goal inertia’.
The ‘newer you’ is inspired by fresh ideas, moulded 
by experiences, changed by the knowledge you 
are acquiring, living in an environment that also 
changes each day. Is this ‘newer you’ still inspired 
by plans made one, three or five years ago?
Learning outcomes
This chapter offers opportunities to:
•• recognise personal changes and achievements
•• review your reflections on personal planning
•• update your profile of skills and qualities
•• identify your ‘learning edge’
•• identify emerging personal responsibilities
•• plan your next steps.

Reflection: Change
In your reflective journal consider:
•• What are the most important ways you or your life 
have changed over the last three years?
•• What is the significance of the changes you 
identified above? What do they mean for the 
way you think, feel, act? Have they changed your 
attitudes to life, to people or to what you now find 
important?
•• Have those changes influenced your personal goals 
and targets?
Review your goals 
You may be inspired by the same vision or aims all of your 
life. However, if you feel that your goals are not inspiring 
you anymore, you have probably outgrown them. It 
is worth reviewing your goals from time to time. For 
example:
•• Complete the ‘Dream’ or ‘Long-term vision’ activities 
again (pp. 34–6). Compare your current and previous 
responses.
•• Talk to someone about your goals. Ask them to press 
you into really exploring what you want. 
•• Take a journey to somewhere you have never visited 
before. The change of scene can generate new ideas 
about what you really want.
•• Speak to other people about their goals and interests. 
Broaden your perspective on the options open to you.
Success is a very personal thing. For you, 
success may mean reaching the stars or it 
may mean a particular source of happiness 
that other people would not appreciate.
Reflection: Updating goals 
and targets
•• Has your ‘vision’ changed since you 
completed the activity in Chapter 1?
•• Is it likely to make you happy?
•• How do your goals or targets need to 
change, if at all, to contribute to your 
sense of happiness?
Review your values
Your vision will be strongly influenced by 
your values – either in what you view as 
successful, or in the behaviours and lifestyle 
you find acceptable and desirable. 
Reflection: Updating values
•• In what ways, if any, have your values 
changed since you completed the 
activity on p. 31 in Chapter 1? 
•• Does this have any significance for 
your motivation in achieving your 
long-term goals? 
•• Do you need to review your 
inspiration, sources of motivation or 
your goals in the light of your current 
values?
Using the reflective process    
Monitoring personal progress
Progress can be measured against your 
personal goals or against objective criteria 
such as exam marks. In the grand scheme 
of life, marks given by others count for 
much less than:
•• the depth of your personal awareness
•• your ability to monitor your own 
progress
•• your ability and motivation to take action 
to improve performance without being 
told to do so. 
Success is associated with happiness. Does your vision of 
your life leave you with a feeling of relative happiness? If 
the goals you set for yourself are unappealing, or make 
you feel that you are making more hurdles for yourself in 
life, or seem to be setting you off on paths towards places 
that you no longer find attractive, it is probably time for a 
rethink.

Being a reflective practitioner
Reflective practice is very similar to making New Year 
resolutions. It is easy to start well, but by mid-year 
the resolutions are often long forgotten. Similarly, 
reflection on our goals, performance and personal 
development may start out well. However, reflection 
is often an early casualty when there is pressure on 
our time. You may find that this has been true of you. 
If so, just take up from wherever you left off. If you 
keep doing this, you will find that reflective practice 
becomes a habit. 
Reflection: Developing skills in 
reflective practice
In your reflective journal, jot down your responses 
to the following.
•• What did you gain from taking a reflective and 
self-evaluating approach to your academic, 
personal or professional development?
•• How well do you feel you have developed and 
maintained a reflective approach?
•• What steps could you take to improve your 
reflective practice?
Activity
Building from personal expertise
In your reflective journal, jot down one skill or area 
of expertise which you feel is your strongest point. 
This could be a sub-skill such as organising space 
or drawing up timetables or planning a piece of 
writing. 
•• Take two minutes to brainstorm ways this skill or 
area of expertise might be helpful to your future 
study.
•• Take two minutes to brainstorm ways this skill or 
area of expertise might help in work contexts.
•• Take two minutes to brainstorm ways this skill 
or area of expertise might be helpful to your life 
more generally.
Once you have completed this for one skill, go 
through the same questions with at least two other 
personal strengths. You may find it useful to update 
your competence sheets once you have completed 
this activity.
In order to monitor performance and personal 
change, you need records. A reflective journal, 
maintained for your own purposes, is a key 
tool for monitoring change. If you haven’t read 
through your reflective journal for a while, now 
is a good time to do so.
Reflection: Reviewing your 
reflective journal
Read through ten pages of your reflective 
journal, preferably from at least six months 
ago. 
•• What do you notice about your state of 
mind at the time? How does it differ from 
now?
•• What things had you forgotten were in 
the journal that you are pleased to find? 
•• What things did you mean to do but have 
not yet got round to doing?
•• What else strikes you as interesting from 
your journal?
Identifying change
Keeping a reflective journal provides material 
to help you monitor changes in yourself over 
time. The following activity invites you to look 
back over your reflection and identify themes 
and changes in your responses. 
Activity
Has your thinking 
changed?
•• Select three activities from anywhere in 
this book. Include one you enjoyed and 
one that you found difficult or resisted.
•• Do these again now.
•• Compare your responses with those you 
made previously. 
•• How do you account for any differences 
in your responses?
327
Drawing it together

Activity
Transferring skills
•• Select one of your skills or strengths.
•• Where did you develop this skill?
•• What are the sub-skills and qualities you have 
developed as part of the overall skill?
Now select one context or situation from the 
following list. Choose the context with which you are 
least familiar:
Working with children
Setting up an arts exhibition
Designing an office
Counselling others on a phone line
Raising money for a charity
Making a video
Designing a Web page for a company
Being the first on the scene of a serious accident
Organising a conference
Opening a restaurant.
•• Take five minutes to brainstorm all the ways that 
the sub-skills you identified could be of any use 
at all in the new context you chose. There will be 
ways that are not immediately apparent.
•• In what ways would you need to adapt those sub-
skills so that they fit the new context?
Make the link!
Interconnections between areas of expertise
Very few skills are gained in isolation from others. 
Our development is usually a complex web of newly 
emerging strengths and relative weaknesses. When 
we develop one area of expertise, we usually enhance 
performance in others, even if this is not visible. 
For example, people who sing in choirs develop their 
voices and their musicality. However, they also tend to 
acquire a good sense of timing in their ‘response’ to 
others, which can contribute to their people skills. A vast 
array of other skills can be linked to this one activity, 
such as developing confidence in performing in front 
of others, team work, taking direction, following a 
sequence, attention to detail, sensitivity to mood, etc. 
The same is true of most other areas of expertise. 
The converse is also true. If we are weak in one skill or 
area of expertise, the ramifications of this will be felt in 
a wide range of contexts. For example, if we hate sport, 
Improving performance
Working with our strengths
One way of improving performance is to 
identify current strengths and to build upon 
these. Chapter 2, for example, identified 
ways of using expertise in one area to 
develop understanding in another area. 
Look back through the competence sheets 
and other evaluations of your skills and 
qualities in Chapter 11 to remind yourself 
of your current strengths. Look back over 
your learning goals and the areas that 
you have worked on to improve personal 
performance. Consider how well you drew 
on your personal strengths in order to 
achieve your learning goals. 
Identifying ‘transferable skills’
To transfer skills from one context to 
another, it is usually necessary to:
•• be aware of the skills (and especially sub-
skills) you already use
•• identify which of those skills can be 
adapted to fit the new context. 
The sub-skills are especially important as it is 
usually these that transfer to new contexts. 
For example, if you are good at working 
with numbers, the sub-skills might include 
paying attention to details, sequencing, 
seeing patterns, logical skills, seeing how 
numbers relate to words, having the 
patience to retest all the subsequent stages 
in a problem in order to identify an error, a 
good memory for formulas, etc. 
If you are good at working with people, the 
sub-skills and personal qualities involved 
might include listening skills, coping with 
other people’s anger, seeing things from 
another person’s point of view, being 
very sensitive to your own feelings and 
the impact these have on others, taking 
responsibility for your own mistakes, being 
able to ask for what you need, etc.
328
Employability: enhancing your career prospects

Activity
Making the connections
Make a list of 3–5 themes that you are working 
on at the moment. Then identify various 
sections of the book that can develop relevant 
skills for improving your performance. For 
example:
Your goals and how to achieve them: Chapter 
1, ‘The vision’, and Chapter 6, ‘Successful 
problem-solving and task management’.
Managing your responses when working with 
difficult people: Chapter 4, ‘Successful self-
management’, and Chapter 5, ‘People skills’.
Working on problems and looking for creative 
solutions: Chapter 6, ‘Successful problem-
solving and task management’, and Chapter 7, 
‘Thinking outside the box’.
•• Identify the ways that skills and insights 
developed in one aspect of your life can have 
an effect upon performance in other areas.
Reflection: Note success
Browse through your reflective journal for the 
last year – or since your last review. In your 
journal, note:
•• What goals did you work on during that 
time? 
•• Which ones have you achieved?
•• What are the benefits of having achieved 
these?
Consider what the effects of these 
achievements are. These may be changes in 
your life, successes in your study, the ability 
to manage a particular situation, or a feeling 
of accomplishment. Don’t be modest. Make 
sure you include a list of all the sub-skills you 
developed and your minor achievements as well 
as the more noticeable ones. 
Have you celebrated your achievements? If not: 
make sure you do!
this could impact upon our health, our stamina, 
our opportunities to mix with others, our ability 
to join in certain conversations, the number of 
connections we can make with other people, 
the range of metaphors we have to call upon, 
our understanding of other people’s interest and 
motivations, etc. 
Because of this, the root of difficulties we 
experience in one area of our lives may lie in a 
completely different area. For example, poor 
organisational skills may originate in one of a 
number of areas, such as poor time-management 
skills, low motivation, unhelpful attitudes, an 
inability to say ‘No’ to too many requests for help, 
or a lack of responsibility for our own actions. 
Unless we work on the root cause, the difficulties 
may not go away. 
Raising the game
Recognising your achievements
It may be tempting to feel at times that your 
personal development could now ‘come to an 
end’. That is usually a good signal for raising your 
game, setting new challenges, finding a new 
aspect to stimulate your interest. 
One boost to motivation is reviewing your 
successes. Note what you have achieved so far 
with your own development and consider the 
benefits this has brought you. 
Reflection: Linking skills and 
expertise
•• What is the area where you have developed 
most expertise?
•• What are the wider range of sub-skills and 
qualities that have developed as part of that 
expertise? List at least 20.
•• Which one skill, personal quality or area of 
expertise do you feel you need to improve?
•• How would improving this one area also lead 
to improvements in other skills, qualities, 
attitudes or areas of expertise? 
What do you think is at the root of this area of 
weakness? What can you do to address this?

Interpreting your responses 
Your answers to (a) provide you with a summary of 
the approaches that increase your chances of success 
with new challenges. For example, you may have 
indicated that you need support in order to achieve. If 
this is true of you, you are more likely to be successful 
if you remain open to guidance from others, plan 
carefully and set manageable targets. However, see 
‘The comfort zone’ below.
Your answers to (b) provide you with a summary of 
how highly motivated you are likely to remain even in 
high-risk contexts. If you indicated many ‘Very typical’ 
and ‘Typical’ replies here, your responses suggest you 
are likely to respond well to challenge and risk. You 
appear to be highly motivated and able to manage 
your own path to success very well. However, see ‘The 
comfort zone’ below. 
If your responses to (b) were mostly ‘Not very typical’ 
or ‘Not typical at all’, set yourself challenges that 
avoid most of those circumstances. Your ‘edge’ is 
likely to be working on developing your motivation so 
that you can achieve your goals even when conditions 
are not ideal.
The comfort zone and ‘the working edge’
When we only work to our strengths and preferences, 
we run the risk of not setting sufficient challenges for 
ourselves. The ‘comfort zone’ is where we operate 
when we are running no risks, setting ourselves no 
challenges, ensuring we always have a very strong and 
wide safety net, ensuring we always have more than 
enough support.  A good personal development plan 
will include areas for improvement that challenge us 
to work at our ‘edge’. 
‘The edge’ is the boundary between the comfort zone 
and unnecessary or inappropriate risks. It is different 
for everybody. For one person it might be learning to 
take advice from others; for another person it may be 
learning to work more independently of others. For 
people who avoid risk, the ‘edge’ might be in learning 
to set more adventurous challenges. This might entail 
developing related skills, qualities or attitudes such as 
managing change, seeing mistakes as opportunities 
to learn, developing emotional coping strategies, and 
so forth. For those who take high-risk strategies, the 
‘edge’ might be in developing ways of coping with 
stress, or developing trust in other people, or in living 
without high excitement. 
Working at your ‘edge’
Once you have built your confidence in 
your own success, you are ready to set 
yourself greater challenges. This can also 
mean looking at your approach to challenge 
itself. Do you welcome challenge? Are you 
prepared to take on goals that will stretch 
you?
Attitude to challenge
The greatest barriers to success are usually 
those that derive from our attitudes and 
fears. The challenge may simply be too 
great for us at that time. The challenges we 
set ourselves should be appropriate for our 
current coping skills, support networks, and 
emotional well-being. The activity on p. 330 
gives an indication of the ways in which you 
currently cope with challenge.
Reflection: Using your 
responses for (a)
•• Highlight all the answers to which you 
responded with a ‘Very important’ or 
‘Important’.
•• Write these out in your reflective 
journal, starting: ‘To cope with a new 
challenge, it is important for me that 
…’. 
•• As you write, add details or examples 
from your experience to illustrate how 
you know this is really true of you.
Reflection: Using your 
responses for (b)
•• Highlight all the answers to which you 
responded with a ‘Not very typical’ or 
‘Not typical at all’. 
•• Write these out in your reflective 
journal, starting: ‘I am unlikely to keep 
going with a new challenge if …’. 
•• As you write, add details or examples 
from your experience to illustrate how 
you know this is really true of you.

Closing comments
Congratulations on reaching this stage of 
the book. If you worked through most of the 
chapters and activities, you will have a very 
strong sense of yourself, your strengths and 
what you need to do to achieve your goals.
It is likely that you used the book selectively, 
picking out activities that seemed most relevant 
or to which you were directed by your tutors. 
If there were aspects of this process that 
you at first resisted, found uncomfortable or 
absolutely hated but worked through, you have 
really achieved something. What exactly that 
‘something’ is, is for you to judge.   
We are always a ‘work in progress’:
•• there is always more that we can understand 
about ourselves
•• the range of our knowledge and expertise can 
always be extended
•• there is always an area of our performance 
that can be improved. 
Our personal development is as dynamic a 
process as we choose to make it.  If we use a 
reflective approach on a regular basis, we will 
know ourselves more fully, be more aware of 
our needs and wants, and more able to achieve 
what we really desire.
Seek out that particular mental attitude which 
makes you feel most deeply and vitally alive, 
along with which comes the inner voice which 
says, ‘this is the real me’, and when you have 
found that attitude, follow it.
William James
Sometimes it is hard to acknowledge where the 
edge lies. For example, the kind of advice we 
dislike the most is often an indicator of where our 
personal ‘edge’ lies. We may need guidance on 
how to work at our edge. As with the ‘edge’ of a 
cliff or precipice, we should approach our personal 
limits with due caution and the right support. It 
is good to set challenges – but not to go over the 
edge without a rope.
Reflection: Working at the ‘edge’
•• What do you feel is the ‘edge’ you need to 
work at next?
•• What makes you feel that this is your ‘edge’? 
Who could you speak to about this?
•• How will you take on this new challenge?
•• What support or guidance do you need?

Qualifications are one way of providing evidence of learning. However, employers are often interested in 
seeing what you have valued about your learning, or hearing what you think you have learnt, in order to 
find out how you demonstrate and apply your skills and intelligence. It is useful to be prepared for such 
questions.
What has interested you most about your programme?
What do you feel has been the most important thing you have learnt from your programme?
What do you think you have learnt on your programme that could benefit you in the world of work?
In what way is your subject relevant to the world outside of university/higher education?
What advice would you give to other students embarking upon your programme?

you and reward your achievements.
Lift (Apple and Android) – Lift allows you to 
set goals and monitor progress. It will store 
information on how long you have spent on 
specific tasks or behaviours. This is useful if you 
are trying to develop habits such as reading for 20

– the basic version of this app is free. It runs in 
the background of your phone or computer and

time. If you subscribe to the full version it allows 
you to track time away from the computer, and 
can send you alerts if it thinks you are spending 
too long on an activity.
focus@will – this app selects background music, 
which, it suggests, can improve your ability to 
focus by up to 400%.
Motivational apps
Unstuck (Apple and Android) – as the name 
suggests, Unstuck helps you at moments when you 
feel blocked in addressing a task or issue. The app
