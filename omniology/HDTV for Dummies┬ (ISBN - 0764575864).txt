About the Authors
Danny Briere founded TeleChoice, Inc., a telecommunications con-
sulting company, in 1985 and now serves as CEO of the company.
Widely known throughout the telecommunications and networking
industry, Danny has written more than one thousand articles about
telecommunications topics and has authored or edited ten books,
including Internet Telephony For Dummies, Smart Homes For Dummies
(now in its second edition), Wireless Home Networking For Dummies,
Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004 PC For Dummies, and Home
Theater For Dummies. He is frequently quoted by leading publica-
tions on telecommunications and technology topics and can often
be seen on major TV networks, providing analysis on the latest
communications news and breakthroughs. Danny splits his time
between Mansfield Center, Connecticut, and his island home on
Great Diamond Island, ME, with his wife and four children.
Pat Hurley is Director of research with TeleChoice, Inc. specializing
in emerging telecommunications and digital home technologies, par-
ticularly all the latest consumer electronics, access gear, and home
technologies, including wireless LANs, DSL, cable modems, satellite
services, and home-networking services. Pat frequently consults
with the leading telecommunications carriers, equipment vendors,
consumer goods manufacturers, and other players in the telecommu-
nications and consumer electronics industries. Pat is the coauthor
of Internet Telephony For Dummies, Smart Homes For Dummies,
Wireless Home Networking For Dummies, Windows XP Media Center
Edition 2004 PC For Dummies, and Home Theater For Dummies. He
lives in San Diego, California, with his wife, new baby girl named
Annabel, and two smelly dogs.


Authors’ Acknowledgments
Danny wants to thank his wife for not freaking out when he’s gotten
big TV sets and lots of equipment, and for accepting his bribes of
absolutely everything he could think of to buy the extra time to
research this book. She’s a trooper. However, this “Thank You” is not
about her, but about co-author Pat, who’s been so much fun to work
with on these For Dummies books over the years. While Pat lives on
the other coast of the U.S., and we rarely actually see each other, we
work side by side through videoconferencing, IM, and e-mail, and
(oh, yes) voice calls. I’ve heard his new child’s voice and wife’s pleas
for dinner in the background, and feel I know his house by the loca-
tion of the different devices we so often write about (“I’m IMing you
from the Media Center PC in the living room . . .”). Pat’s wife is used to
Danny calls after hours and on weekends, and has been nice enough
to let those slip by — well at least occasionally — and Danny thanks
her immensely for never chewing him out on the phone (she chews
out Pat instead, I’m sure, but Pat’s too Navy to tell his superior about
that). When Pat went in the hospital in the early stages of the book,
it simply was not as much fun writing a book without Pat’s incessant
rantings about how stupid people are in the marketing of their prod-
ucts, and about how nobody’s Web site is worth a hoot (being a good
former Navy man, he actually never says hoot). These books are
always a pain in the ruckus to do, but are made all the more pleasant
with a co-writer who has a sense of humor (or the smarts to laugh
at his boss’s bad jokes, whichever applies).
Pat dedicates this book to his beautiful little girl, Annabel Stone
Hurley. You’re never too young to enjoy a little TV, Annabel! Now if
they would only start broadcasting Sesame Street in HD! Pat also
profusely thanks his wife Christine, without whom none of this good
stuff (babies, books, and the like) would be possible. Pat also must
give a nod to Dr. Bard Cosman, surgeon par excellence at the U.C.
San Diego Medical Center. Thanks, Dr. Cosman, for getting me back
on my feet to finish this book!
We would also like to thank Jenny Miller at the Consumer Electronics
Association (CEA), for her assistance and guidance.

Introduction
W
elcome to HDTV For Dummies. HDTV is the hottest tech-
nology to hit your local electronics store since the advent
of cell phones. HDTVs are getting bigger, better, cheaper, more
sophisticated, and more useful every day. Since you’ve bought this
book, we figure that not only do you agree with us, you’re already
part of the HDTV movement. To arms, Comrade!
One of the most appealing things about the current crop of HDTVs
is the ease with which you can set up an HDTV-powered home the-
ater, including surround sound and an awesome picture. However,
the rapidly dropping price of HDTVs might be the most attractive
aspect of all — we’ve reached a point in time where you don’t have
to be rich to consider an HDTV for the bedroom, too! Figuring out
which HDTV to buy can be confusing, as there are all sorts of tech-
nologies, sizes, standards, etc. And then, once you’ve decided on
what to buy, making sure it will work with all your other gear —
your DVD, camcorder, VCR, set-top box, and so on — can be even
more confusing. That’s where this book comes in handy. Our aim is
to make sure you get the most bang for your buck (or franc, or
peso, or whatever — even euros!).
About This Book
If you’re thinking of purchasing an HDTV and installing it in your
home, this is the book for you. Even if you’ve already purchased
the HDTV itself, this book will help you install and configure the
HDTV. What’s more, this book helps you get the most out of your
investment after it’s up and running.
With this book in hand, you’ll have all the information that you
need to know about the following topics:
 Planning your HDTV system, including all sorts of accessories
 Evaluating and selecting the right HDTV for your home
 Installing and configuring the HDTV equipment in your home
 Hooking up your HDTV to the right high-definition program-
ming sources
 Adding A/V entertainment gear and accessories to your HDTV

 Playing video games on your Xbox, in high-def splendor
 Accessing your HDTV from around the house over a home
network
 Enhancing your HDTV environment so you can have your own
HDTV theater
Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, we had the perfect excuse to watch a lot of
TV. (“Not now, Honey, I’m working on my book.”) It’s been great.
Still, we already know what we like and what we value in an HDTV.
But we’re writing this book for you! While writing, we ponder all
kinds of questions concerning our readers. Who are you? Where
are you? What did you eat for lunch? Which movies tweak your
interest? How do your HDTV desires line up with your budget?
Queries like that fill our minds constantly, much to the consterna-
tion of our spouses, who prefer more useful thoughts like
“Shouldn’t I take the trash out, or empty the Diaper Genie?”
Because we never get to meet you in person, we end up making a
few assumptions about you and what you want from this book.
Here’s a peek at our thoughts about you:
 You love movies, television shows, or video games — or per-
haps all three.
 You’ve experienced wide screens and surround sound at the
theater, and you liked it.
 For one reason or another, a 19-inch TV set with a single 
built-in speaker doesn’t adequately meet your audio or video
entertainment needs.
 You probably own a computer, or will soon.
 You don’t shy away from high-tech products, but you also aren’t
the first person on the block with the latest electronic goodie.
 The weird technicalities of your A/V system make you dizzier
than a Marilyn Monroe movie.
 You know something about the Internet and the Web.
 You, or someone in your family, enjoy watching movies, listen-
ing to MP3 audio, playing games, and possibly making movies
on your computer.
If that describes you today, in a prior life, or in another personality,
then this book is for you.
HDTV For Dummies

How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into several chapters that are grouped into
eight parts. The chapters are presented in a logical order — flow-
ing from purchasing your HDTV, through all the things you’d want
to hook up to it to exploit its very existence, to some detailed drill-
down discussions about high-definition topics that will help you
get the most out of your HDTV environment. However, you can feel
free to use the book as a reference and read the chapters in any
order that you want. We wrote it that way.
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals
The first part of the book is a primer on HDTV. If you’ve never
owned an advanced level television — much less attempted to
install one — this part of the book provides all the background
information and techno-geek lingo that you need to feel comfort-
able. Chapter 1 presents general HDTV concepts; Chapter 2 dis-
cusses the most popular HDTV technologies and familiarizes you
with high-definition terminology, and also provides guidance on
making buying decisions; and Chapter 3 introduces you to several
popular ports, interfaces, jacks, plugs, cables and the sort —
everything you’ll need to know about connecting your HDTV into
your existing audio/visual environment.
Part II: Love at First Sight
The second part of the book helps you install your HDTV system. It
helps you decide what you will be connecting to the HDTV, how to
enhance your HDTV so that it is tuned perfectly for your use, and
also tells you about a range of little “black boxes” that can help
you optimize all of the non-HDTV signals you send to your HDTV,
making them look better on your HDTV big screen.
Part III: HDTV Channels
Part III discusses all the different forms of high-definition signals
that you can access and/or subscribe to, in order to really take
advantage of your great new investment. In the first chapter of this
part, we talk at a high level about what is available in high-defini-
tion format now, and what’s coming in the near future. Then in the
next three chapters, we dive into each option — over-the-air
broadcasts, cable, and satellite — so you know where you can get
what signals, and which is best (at least in our eyes).
Introduction

Part IV: Movie Machines
The broadcast programming discussed in Part III is nice, but let’s
face it, we all want to watch a lot of other content, too — we’re
talking about all those DVDs and VHS movies you own. In this part,
we talk about the complexities of interfacing your DVD player/
recorders and VHS VCRs with your HDTV. We also delve into the
exciting world of digital video recorders — DVRs or TiVos as some
people call them (referring to one brand on the market generically).
With these devices you can record all sorts of content for later
watching.
Part V: Monitor Madness
After you get your HDTV system installed and running, you will
certainly want to use it for even neater things if you can. Part V
of the book presents many cool things that you can do with your
HDTV, including playing multi-user computer games, connecting
your camcorder to preview your future America’s Funniest Home
Videos submission, and operating various types of smart home
conveniences from the luxury of your bedroom. This part also
describes how to use a home network to connect your HDTV to
other parts of the house and to the Internet — all with the intent
of making your HDTV investment simply more accessible.
Part VI: Sensory Overload
In this part, we spend a lot of time drilling down in a lot of detail
about the nitty-gritty of getting your home HDTV-viewing expe-
rience as good as you can get it. We start with an extensive discus-
sion about audio basics and how they affect your HDTV viewing
experience. We then discuss built-in speaker options versus exter-
nal sound systems, and the advantages of a surround-sound-
powered HDTV experience. We’ll also tell you about how to use
lighting, room treatments, and other nuances in your home to
create a true HDTV theater. Finally, we go into a series of chapters
that delve down into the details of your TV picture, and the various
ways that HDTV can be accomplished, including front and rear 
projection, plasma and LCD screens, and the good old CRT
approach. When you’ve finished this part, you should know 
much more than the average salesperson walking the show 
floor at your local TV store.

Part VII: Geek Stuff
Of course, the more you know, the geekier these topics start to
appear. Before long, you may be dreaming of ultra-high-tech ways
to expand your system’s capabilities. This part of the book
unashamedly encourages that bad habit.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Part VIII provides three top-ten lists that we think you’ll find inter-
esting — ten places to look online and locally to buy an HDTV; ten
devices to connect to your HDTV; and ten frequently asked ques-
tions about HDTV.
Icons Used in This Book
All of us these days are hyper-busy people, with no time to waste.
To help you find the especially useful nuggets of information in this
book, we’ve marked the information with little icons in the margin.
The following icons are used in this book:
As you can probably guess, the Tip icon calls your attention to
information that will save you time or maybe even money. If your
time is really crunched, you might try just skimming through the
book and reading the tips.
The little bomb in the margin should alert you to pay close atten-
tion and tread softly. You don’t want to waste time or money fixing
a problem that could have been avoided in the first place.
This icon is your clue that you should take special note of the
advice that you find there . . . or that this paragraph reinforces
information that has been provided elsewhere in the book. Bottom
line: You will accomplish the task more effectively if you remember
this information.
Face it, HDTVs and home entertainment systems are high-tech toys
that make use of some pretty complicated technology. For the
most part, however, you don’t need to know how it all works. The
Technical Stuff icon identifies the paragraphs that you can simply
skip if you’re in a hurry or you just don’t care to know.

Where to Go from Here
Where you should go next in this book depends on where you are
in the process of planning, buying, installing, configuring, and/or
using your HDTV. If HDTV in particular is totally new to you, we
recommend that you start at the beginning with Part I. If you feel
comfortable with HDTVs and all of its connections, you might just
read Chapter 2 about buying advice. If you’ve already got your
HDTV, you might want to check out how to make sure it’s optimally
configured with the chapters in Part II. If your HDTV is installed
and you want to know more about what you can connect to it,
Parts III, IV, and V all talk about neat things you can channel (oops,
pun) to your HDTV. If you are in the depths of analyzing your
equipment options, Part VI might be the best place to find the
details you are looking for. There’s simply a lot here for whatever
you need to know about HDTV.
Or, if you’re into Fate, you can just open the book to any page and
start reading.
Either way, happy reading!

HDTV Fundamentals

In this part . . .
I
f you ever had the exciting opportunity to go to FAO
Schwarz’s ﬂagship store in New York City before it
closed, you were greeted by a huge fanciful clock, made
even more famous in the movie Big. The song played by
the clock is very appropriate here as we begin to talk
about HDTVs — a chiming “Welcome to our world, wel-
come to our world, welcome to our world of toys!”
Oh boy, are HDTVs fun — and that fun, in Part I, is just
beginning. We’re going to introduce you to the world of
HDTV, our world of toys. In Chapter 1, we’ll introduce you
to the key acronym of the HDTV world, ATSC, and tell you
why you should care about it. We’ll explain the foundations
of HDTV, of things like resolution, scan types, and aspect
ratios. We’ll talk of 480i, 480p, 720p and 1080i, which sound
more like something from I, Robot than from Circuit City.
Don’t worry — we explain what all that means!
We’ll also help you go shopping. In Chapter 2, we talk of
the key buying criteria for HDTVs and how to best match a
TV to your needs, environment, existing audio/video gear,
and other HDTV decision-affecting facets of your life.
And then we’ll wrap up our introduction by making sure
your basis in HDTV technology is sound by talking about the
backs, sides, tops, and other parts of the HDTV systems —
all the places where you’d connect to your HDTV display
other sources and gear, like DVDs, VCRs, camcorders, satel-
lite receivers, video jukeboxes, and yes, even bathtubs.
You’re off on your HDTV adventure if you’re starting with
Part I right away. Be sure to turn off your toys when you
are done playing with them!

Chapter 1
What the Heck Is HDTV?
In This Chapter
 Understanding the acronyms
 Going wide
 Avoiding the pitfalls
S
ince the transition to color TV in the 1950s and ’60s, nothing —
nothing!! — has had as much impact on the TV world as HDTV
(high-definition TV) and digital TV. That’s right, TV is going digital,
following in the footsteps of, well, everything.
We’re in the early days of this transition — a lot of TV programming
is still all-analog, for example — and this stage of the game can be
confusing. In this chapter, we alleviate HDTV anxiety by telling you
what you need to know about HDTV, ATSC, DTV, and a bunch of
other acronyms and tech terms. We also tell you why you’d want to
know these terms and concepts — how great HDTV is, and what an
improvement it is over today’s analog TV (as you’ll see when you
tune in to HDTV). Finally, we guide you through the confusing back
alleys of HDTV and digital TV — making sure you know what’s
HDTV and what’s not.
Oh, Say, Can You ATSC?
A long time ago (over 50 years ago — longer than even Danny
has been alive!), in a galaxy far, far . . . errr, actually right here in
the U.S. . . . a group called the NTSC (National Television System
Committee) put together a group of technical specifications and
standards that define television as we know it today. Sure, there
have been some changes in those 50 years (such as the addition
of color), but today’s analog TVs are built on this NTSC system.
Fifty years is a long time for any technology to dominate. Indeed,
technologies and components used in television-transmission

systems, cameras, recording systems, and display systems (the TVs
themselves) have long been capable of doing something more.
In the 1980s, the ATSC (Advanced Television System Committee)
was formed to move TV forward. Many years later (1996), the
ATSC’s recommendations for a digital-television system were
adopted by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission — the
folks who set standards for TV broadcasts, regulate phone compa-
nies, and fine Howard Stern). ATSC standards use newer-than-1953
technology to give you TV like you’ve never had before:
 Widescreen images like those in the movies
 Greater detail — up to six times more detail
 Sharper images
 Smoother, more filmlike images with no video flicker
 All digital, with none of the “ghosts” and other image prob-
lems found in analog TV
Powerful Performance
HDTV (and digital TV, DTV, in general — there are some digital TV
variants that are not high-definition, and we discuss them in this
section) is all about giving you a bigger and better picture, better
audio, and generally making your TV-watching experience more
like a movie-watching experience. In fact, at its best, HDTV is so
realistic that it’s often described as “looking through a window” —
as if you’re really there, not just watching a program.
Video standards
There are three essential concepts to understand when you are
comparing different video standards:
 Resolution: the number of individual picture elements that
make up a TV image. The higher the resolution, the more
detailed the image, and the sharper the image will appear.
Resolution is defined by one of two factors:
• Lines (the number of left-to-right lines the TV can dis-
play). CRT-based TVs (tube TVs) are rated this way.
• Pixels (the number of pixels across the screen times the
number up and down). Fixed-pixel displays (plasmas,
LCDs, DLPs and the like) are rated this way.
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
10

 Scan Type comes in two forms:
• Interlaced scan: These TV images are created by lighting
up every other row of horizontal lines on the screen in
one instant, and then going back through and lighting up
the remainder of the lines in the next instant. It happens
so fast that your eye can’t really tell it’s happening.
• Progressive scan: These systems light all the horizontal
lines in the same instant, which can make the image
seem “smoother” and more like film (or real life).
 Aspect Ratio (the shape of your TV picture):
• Traditional TVs have a 4:3 aspect ratio (screen shape).
This means that for every 4 units of measure across the
screen, you have 3 units of screen height. For example, if
the screen is 12 inches wide, it will be 9 inches high.
• HDTVs have a 16:9 aspect ratio — which makes the
screen relatively much wider for the same height, com-
pared to a 4:3 TV. Most movies are widescreen (16:9, or
even wider), so HDTVs can display most movies without
the annoying “letterbox” black bars on the top and
bottom of the screen. Figure 1-1 compares aspect ratios.
Figure 1-1: Going widescreen 
with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
We don’t get bogged down in up-front technical explanations of
these concepts. If you want to know all there is to know about such
TV concepts as resolution, pixels, and interlacing, run (don’t walk)
to Chapter 21 right now. We’ll still be here when you come back.
HDTV standards
There isn’t a single “HDTV” standard out there. Instead, ATSC
contains many different TV standards (with different resolutions,
aspect ratios, and scan types) — 18, in fact. Some of these standards
are truly HDTV; most are not. In the real world, you will deal with
four standards when you try to watch TV content on your HDTV.
The two primary HDTV standards are these:
 720p: This provides 720 lines of resolution with progressive
scan (hence the p). By comparison, NTSC has less than 480
lines of resolution. 720p uses a 16:9, a widescreen aspect ratio.
4:3 / 1.33:1
Standard TV
and older movies
16:9 / 1.78:1
US Digital TV
(HDTV)
Chapter 1: What the Heck Is HDTV? 11

 1080i: This variant (the highest resolution within the ATSC
standard) uses interlaced scanning, but provides 1080 lines of
resolution. 1080i is also widescreen, with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
There is actually a higher HDTV variant in the ATSC standard —
1080p, which is a progressive scan variant of 1080i. Only a few
HDTV projectors (in the $40,000 and above price range) can handle
this variant, and we know of no material that is broadcast or other-
wise available as 1080p. So don’t worry about it.
True HDTV performance requires at least 720p performance. If a
TV program, movie, or other content is not at least 720p (either
720p or 1080i), it is not HDTV. If a TV can’t display at least 720 lines
of resolution, it is not HDTV-capable.
If a salesperson tries to tell you that an inexpensive plasma set,
regular DVD, regular digital cable, or regular satellite TV “is” HDTV
just because it’s digital, it’s not so.
Compatible DTV standards
720p and 1080i are the two HDTV standards, but you’ll also find a
lot of digital TV material will be broadcast at lower resolutions that
don’t quite make the grade as HDTV. You can still watch this pro-
gramming on your HDTV — in fact, most HDTVs will make this 
programming look better than it does on a regular TV — but
remember: That stuff is not really HDTV.
 480p (EDTV): This enhanced-definition TV standard provides
higher-than-NTSC resolution, with progressive scan (NTSC is
interlaced). EDTV can be (and often is) 16:9 widescreen, but it
is not required to be widescreen.
 480i (SDTV): This is interlaced, non-widescreen (4:3), standard-
definition TV, equivalent to NTSC analog broadcasts.
Remember these different terms — HDTV, EDTV, and SDTV — when
shopping. They will often be in the product descriptions; you need
to know exactly what you are buying.
Audio standards
The ATSC standard includes big improvements in the audio part
of television — what you hear as part of any movie, video, or TV
show. That’s because ATSC includes Dolby Digital surround sound
capability in the overall standard for digital TV.
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
12

Dolby Digital (which we discuss in greater detail in Chapter 18)
doesn’t always mean surround sound. Some Dolby Digital sound-
tracks are stereo (two channels) or even mono (one channel).
ATSC supports surround sound if a program’s producer and broad-
caster want to include it.
The NTSC broadcast standard supports only stereo audio (two
channels) and not surround sound. Luckily, most DVDs (and some
satellite and digital cable TV channels) include Dolby Digital
soundtracks that can provide true surround sound. You can also
use a home-theater receiver that supports systems like Dolby 
Pro Logic II (see Chapter 18) to create surround sound from 
these sources.
Dolby Digital, and surround sound in general, provides an audio
soundtrack for TV shows and movies that — wait for it! — surrounds
you and provides audio that matches the action on-screen. For
example, surround sound might use speakers mounted in the rear
of the room to reproduce ambient noises of the setting around the
action, or give a 3D sense of space to those creepy footfalls of the
bad guy sneaking up behind the protagonist.
Dolby Digital provides six channels (confusingly called 5.1) of
audio. Here’s what they do:
 A center channel carries the dialogue being spoken by charac-
ters on your HDTV screen.
 Two main front channels handle left and right sound cues
(and the soundtrack music) in stereo.
 Two surround channels (mounted in the rear of the room,
as described earlier) provide a sense of 3D space.
 A Low-Frequency Effects (LFE) channel conveys deep bass
sounds (such as exhausts rumbling and bombs exploding).
The LFE channel is the “.1” in the 5.1 naming scheme for
Dolby Digital. It doesn’t get a whole number because it con-
tains only low-frequency sounds, not the full range of human
hearing.
Figure 1-2 shows a typical Dolby Digital surround-sound layout.
We talk about surround sound in much more detail — including
details on what sort of equipment you need to hear it properly in
your HDTV viewing room — in Chapter 19.

Perplexing Pitfalls
HDTV isn’t the easiest thing in the world to get figured out — we’ve
been dealing with it for years and still run into advertising and
marketing mumbo-jumbo that make us say, “Huh???” The whole
purpose of HDTV For Dummies is to help you wade through the
marketing manure and to get you up to speed on HDTV. So without
further ado, here’s a list of HDTV danger zones:
 Digital confusion: The biggest (and most prevalent) myth we
see in the HDTV world is the notion that any kind of digital TV
signal (such as digital cable, digital satellite, or DVD) is HDTV.
This simply isn’t true — a TV signal must be 720p resolution
or higher to be considered high-definition.
 EDTV confusion: EDTVs are TVs (typically plasma flat-panel
models) that cost a lot and can display progressive-scan
images — but don’t meet the minimum requirement of 720p,
so they don’t display true HDTV signals. There’s nothing
wrong with EDTVs, just don’t be fooled into thinking you’re
getting an HDTV when you’re not.
 Image scaling: We’re starting to see some new marketing
being applied to an old concept — image scalers that can con-
vert video signals from one resolution to another.

These devices are now being marketed as “HDTV upscalers”
(yeah right), with a promise that they make any TV signal into
HDTV. Don’t believe it. Image scalers can improve SDTV and
NTSC images with an HDTV, but they don’t make those images
into HDTV images.
 The DTV tuner: As HDTV (and DTV in general) becomes more
prevalent, DTV tuners will become common. These tuners
(discussed in Chapter 8) let older TVs “watch” DTV broad-
casts. DTV tuners do not turn older analog TVs into HDTVs.
They just convert DTV signals to NTSC for display on an
analog TV.

e’ve all been there — you’re standing in the electronics store
looking at a wall of TVs, all tuned to the same channel, and
they all pretty much look the same. So many TV sets, so little time,
so hard to choose. So you pick the one on sale and leave, happy
that you got “a deal.” Been there, done that. 
But no more. Now we’re more educated. We KNOW that those TV
sets are all misconfigured to appear a certain way in the bright lights
of an electronics show floor. We know to check how many digital
interfaces the box has, and how deep the chassis is, and how . . .
well, lots of “hows.”
Choosing the right HDTV for you is not the easiest thing to do.
Heck, we wrote the book on it and we still argue with each other
about which HDTVs have the best bang for the buck. It’s going to
depend on what you are trying to do, how much money you have,
and what other A/V gear you have or intend to buy. 
In this chapter, we’re going to walk you through a veritable Buyer’s
Guide to HDTVs — what to look for when shopping for just the right
HDTV set for you. You can have too much HDTV (believe it or not)
and the wrong type of TV for your intended use. Before you plunk
down a lot of money on your well-earned HDTV surprise, make sure
you’re the best- informed buyer out there. Read on.

The 50,000-Foot View of HDTV
When you’re trying to pick out the right HDTV for your needs, the
available products break down into three major product groups,
distinguished from each other by their display technology and cab-
inet type. By comparing display technology and cabinet type to
your needs, you can easily rule out a whole bunch of different TVs,
and home in on the likely best ones for you.
HDTVs come in all sorts of different sizes and shapes. Some are
flat-panels that you can hang on the wall; others are projection 
systems much like what you’d find in a movie theater. And, of
course, there are HDTVs based on tubes that look just the way 
TVs have for decades (only with a better picture).
Each form of HDTV has some advantages and disadvantages. In
Chapters 21 through 24, we discuss these pros and cons in much
more detail — here we want to give you just a quick overview to
help you on your way. Skip ahead if you need the details and sup-
porting information.
Flat-panel HDTVs
Flat-panel TVs — the super-thin models that you can literally hang
on the wall — are the sexiest HDTVs available. These are the ones
you see on MTV Cribs and that you might install in your tricked-out
Escalade (yeah right). They’re also good HDTVs. There are two
main display technologies for flat-panel HDTVs:
 Plasma: These are the biggest flat-screens available, using a
layer of gas trapped between two glass screens to create their
images.
• Pros: thin, sexy, good picture, good color
• Cons: not all are HDTV, less-than-perfect black, screen
burn-in, costly
You’ll see us mention “blacks” here. We’re talking about
how well an HDTV screen can reproduce dark tones and
scenes on-screen — how well it creates black rather
than gray colors.
 LCD: These flat-panel TVs use liquid crystal displays, just like
those used in laptop computers.
• Pros: same as plasma, plus no burn-in
• Cons: black is poorest, costly, angle of view
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
18

Projection HDTVs
These are the TVs that project their picture from a smaller image
source (either three small picture tubes, or a digital system known
as a microprojector) onto a screen. The screen can be either part of
the HDTV itself (rear projection) or a separate screen hung on your
wall (front projection).
 Front-Projection HDTVs: These are the HDTV equivalents to
movie theater projectors, with a big screen on the wall, and a
separate projector mounted somewhere across the room.
• Pros: biggest screen, potentially best picture
• Con: expensive, complicated, requires setup/focus/
maintenance
 Rear projection HDTVs: The picture is projected on the back
of a screen that is built into the HDTV itself.
• Pros: best bargain, no burn-in with microprojectors,
near flat-panel thinness for microprojector
• Cons: burn-in for CRT, expense for microprojector, size
for CRT
CRT HDTVs
The final category of HDTVs is based on the good old-fashioned
picture tube — also known as the CRT, or cathode-ray tube.
 Pros: cheapest, great color, great blacks
 Cons: smallest screen, bulky, lower resolution than digital
displays
What’s Important in an HDTV
When looking at HDTVs, we think the following are the most impor-
tant buying criteria for your purchase:
 What’s your budget? We don’t mean just for the TV set, but
also for any attached home theater surround-sound system,
special remote controls, automated drapes, lighting controls,
popcorn poppers, and the like. It makes a big difference if you
are building a home HDTV theater, or just putting a TV on the
bureau in the bedroom.
 What size do you need? No, bigger is not always better. You
can have a TV that’s too large for your space, or too small for
Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 19

your usage. There is an optimal range based on where you
intend to place the TV and where you intend to sit.
These first two items — size and budget — will do a lot to
narrow your choices before you get to any of the technical or
usage criteria, so they are important to nail down first. If you
want to fill an 8-foot wall with an image, unless you have a
bank account the size of Bill Gates’s, you’re not going to do
that with anything but a front-projection system.
 What do you plan to do with it? Are you going to be watching
a lot of sports events? Movies? Video games? Believe it or not,
certain types of HDTVs are better with certain types of con-
tent. Sports fanatics will find a big, bright DLP projection
system better for their tastes, everything else being equal,
while people who watch CNN all day long will want to avoid
plasma-screen displays in a big way, due to the burn-in effects
of static images (more on this later).
 What will you hook up to it? If you already have a decent
investment in A/V gear, then that gear might dictate certain
types (and numbers!) of interfaces or ports on your HDTV
system, like these:
• If you have an entertainment system designed around
centralized video switching — using a receiver to switch
among video sources and destinations — then you’re
going to need a receiver that can switch HDTV content.
That might mean a new receiver, which can be pricey
and cut into your budget.
• Do you need a tuner or just an HDTV-ready display —
meaning you’ll get your HDTV tuner from your cable or
satellite company?
 What neat features do you want? It’s easy to be swayed by
neat features, but in lots of implementations, you can’t access
them for various reasons. For instance, if you set up your
system so all your signals come in over one cable connection,
you might not be able to use your TV’s dual-channel features —
you could rely on your cable or satellite box for that. (We talk
about these issues in Chapter 4.) Still, features are important
to all of us, and we’ll tell you in this chapter about which ones
are the most important.
Budgeting for HDTV
If we all had unlimited funds, we’d simply buy the best of everything.
That’s why there exists a market for super-high-end gear — those
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
20

with the big bucks often just buy the top of the line all the time,
because they can. (And because they hired consultants to tell
them that.)
Most of us are more likely to be working on a budget. Table 2-1,
from our Home Theater For Dummies book (updated for current
rates and an HDTV focus), offers a glance at what you could put in
your HDTV environment to make it really boom (in a good way).

This is the “entry level” for HDTV. For this price you should be
able to buy a CRT (tube TV) HDTV. You’ve got a few choices
here — you could spend the entire $1,000 and get a relatively
big (32-inch) HDTV, or you could go with a smaller one (26-
inch or 27-inch) and add in an inexpensive “Home Theater in
a Box” system with DVD player and surround sound.

$1,000 to $2,500
Here you can begin to move up to bigger HDTVs. For a little
more than $1,000, you can pick up a nice widescreen 34-inch
CRT HDTV; for a bit more, you can start getting into CRT-
based rear-projection HDTVs (see Chapter 22). In this price
range you can also begin to add fancier home-theater audio
solutions, with larger speakers and more amplifier power.
$2,500 to $5,000
This price range is where things start to get fancy! At the
bottom of this price range, you can start getting into 42-inch
or 50-inch microprojector rear projection TVs, like DLP
HDTVs. Near the top of the range, you can be considering
really big microprojector systems (60-inch or even 70-inch),
and you’ll also begin to get into front projection systems
with HUGE pictures. You can also find a few small (42-inch)
plasma TVs in this price range. On the audio side, you can
begin to consider high-end receivers and speakers.
$5,000+
Between $5,000 and $10,000, you can build a truly top-of-the
line HDTV home theater, with a front projector, the biggest
microprojector rear-projection systems, an LCD flat-panel
TV, or a big (50-inch or above) plasma TV. Above $10,000, the
sky is truly the limit: Imagine high-end “separates” audio
equipment, the biggest and best plasma TVs or front projec-
tors, and all the trimmings (including home-theater seating,
specialized remote-control systems, even motorized drapes
and “movie theater” popcorn machines”). 
One thing is for sure: Pricing is changing all the time. Two years
ago, a lot of the gear mentioned in Tables 2-1 and 2-2 actually cost
twice as much as it does currently. As we go to print, Costco
(www.costco.com) was selling a 56-inch rear-projection DLP for
under $2,400. (Wow!)
Go online to places like www.pricegrabber.com to get a sense of
how much the prices have changed since we published this book.
Use that benchmark to mentally adjust pricing throughout the
book.
In deciding how much to spend overall, we can only give you this
advice: Your home entertainment system is probably one of the
most-used parts of your home. It helps define your family, social
life, business relationships, and so on. These are the places where
we personally make a substantial investment because it gets the
most use.
Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 23

Finding the Right Size
We think it’s an outright crime that movie theaters can sell tickets
for those rows up at the front of the cinema, where your head has
to constantly move back and forth (like at a tennis match) to cap-
ture all the action. Likewise, the seats far away at the back are just
as criminal.
So apply that principle to your home HDTV viewing area. You can
be too close to the image (or have the image too large), and you
can be too far away (or have the image too small). You definitely
know you are too close if you can see the individual pixels on the
screen. What you need is “Baby Bear’s Just Right” size.
In general, experts determine the optimal size for your HDTV set
by dividing the distance you are going to sit from the TV set by 2.5
(don’t ask us where they got that number, we haven’t a clue — we
bet by trial and error — actually there’s a lot of science regarding
such technically arcane items as the size of pixels and the average
person’s visual acuity. You really don’t want to know!). Table 2-3
gives you our recommendations for common screen sizes, based
on your distance from the screen. (Table 2-3 is for widescreen —
16:9 — HDTVs. If you’re buying a non-HDTV with the older and nar-
rower 4:3 screen, you can actually sit farther from the screen for
the same diagonal size).

Matching Your HD Needs
You need to match how you intend to use the HDTV with the avail-
able technologies. While any HDTV type can be used for just about
any TV viewing scenario you can think of, certain types of HDTV
are better suited for particular uses. This is basically a technical
issue — different types of HDTVs use different underlying tech-
nologies to create their pictures — which often match up better
with some uses than with others.
For instance, if you pack a lot of friends into a wide room to watch
movies a lot, you may want to consider a plasma or direct-view CRT
(a tube HDTV) display, instead of a CRT rear-projection TV or LCD
flat-panel. That’s because plasma and direct-view CRTs have the
best viewing angle (viewing from the sides). Some other common
examples driven by usage are summarized in Table 2-4.

Connecting the Other Gizmos
Your HDTV doesn’t live in a vacuum. An essential step when choos-
ing an HDTV is to find a model that works within the confines of
your home. That means making sure your HDTV works with these:
Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 25

 Your chosen source of HDTV signals
 Your existing analog (NTSC) TV signal source
 Your existing video-source devices, such as DVD player, VCR,
or home theater
 The new gear you plan to get with your leftover money (yeah
right) to supplement your HDTV-powered home theater
A lot of this is technical stuff — which we cover briefly in this 
chapter, and then refer you on to appropriate chapters later 
in the book with more detailed discussions.
Accessing your HDTV channels
To get the most out of your HDTV, you need to be able to receive
HDTV channels. What you need to make this work depends what
kind of HDTV you have (or are buying):
 HDTV: A true HDTV contains a built-in ATSC tuner, which can
receive over-the-air (OTA) HDTV broadcasts (see Chapter 1
for details on ATSC).
The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) is beginning
to require ATSC tuners in all TVs — phasing it in over time,
beginning with big-screen (36-inch and bigger) TVs in 2005.
So eventually all new TVs will have ATSC tuners — even non-
HDTVs, since the ATSC specification includes standard-
definition digital TV.
 HDTV-ready TVs: These TVs can produce HDTV images on-
screen, but they don’t have an internal ATSC tuner. You’ll need
some sort of external tuner to pick up HDTV broadcasts.
We’re going to use the term HDTV as shorthand for both
HDTVs and HDTV-ready TVs throughout this chapter — and
the entire book. But when you’re shopping, keep in mind that
not all HDTVs have built-in tuners.
So what do you need? Well, for openers . . .
 If you want to watch HDTV from cable or satellite sources,
you’ll need the appropriate cable box or satellite receiver con-
nected to your HDTV. (We talk about cable set-top boxes in
Chapter 9, and satellite receivers in Chapter 10.)
There are some new DCR (digital-cable-ready) HDTVs entering
the market that let you watch HDTV over your cable system
without a cable box. We talk more about these TVs (and the
CableCARD that makes them work) in Chapter 9.
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
26

 If you’re going to watch OTA HDTV channels, you’ll need two
things:
• An HDTV antenna to receive the broadcast signals
• An HDTV tuner (either built into your HDTV, or a 
separate tuner) to tune into the HDTV channels
We discuss OTA HDTV antennas and tuners in Chapter 8.
Sometimes you may want to mix and match these systems. For
example, if you use satellite, you might still use an OTA HDTV
antenna to pick up your local HDTV channels.
Unsure whether you want cable, satellite, or local broadcasts for
HDTV channels? Chapter 7 helps you make the right choice.
Getting your analog channels
Just because you’ve bought an HDTV doesn’t mean you can only
watch HDTV stations with it. That would be too frustrating, given
that there are still plenty of stations that don’t yet broadcast in
HDTV. HDTVs are backward-compatible with NTSC (the old analog
TV system): You can watch the analog channels, and also preserve
your investment in NTSC source devices like DVD players, VCRs,
and laser discs.
Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 27
Going native
Most HDTVs have one level of resolution (or occasionally, a couple of them) con-
sidered native to the TV. That means the HDTV is designed to display images at its
specified resolution(s); any signals of a different resolution must be converted (or
scaled) to the TV’s native resolution. (Check out Chapter 1 if you’re not sure what we
mean by resolution.)
For example, many DLP HDTVs have a native resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels (720p) —
based upon the DLP chip inside these TVs. Your HDTV will probably look its best
when it is fed sources that match the native resolution; but it will still look great
when the image is scaled to match the native resolution.
More important than native resolution is knowing your HDTV’s supported 
resolutions — the resolutions that the TV can actually scale to native. Some HDTVs
won’t do the scaling that converts between resolutions. This can be important to
know when you’re connecting an HDTV and an external ATSC tuner (or cable or
satellite system). If 1080i is not a resolution that your HDTV supports — and that’s
all your tuner puts out — then you won’t get a picture. This is a rare situation, but it
can happen.

You can get an HDTV set now, and then get the HDTV channels later.
In fact, because of a device called a scaler (discussed in Chapter 5),
you might find that your HDTV makes your non-HDTV sources look
better than ever. Most HDTVs have a scaler built in, and you can
also buy external scalers that are even more powerful.
Most HDTVs — whether or not they contain an ATSC tuner — con-
tain an NTSC analog TV tuner. That way you can plug in an antenna
feed and pick up all your local NTSC broadcasts. In the majority of
cases, you can also tune in to analog cable broadcasts with this
NTSC tuner.
Unless you’ve got a DCR HDTV (discussed in the previous section),
you’ll need a set-top box to pick up digital cable broadcasts.
A few HDTVs — mainly flat-panel plasma and LCD HDTVs — contain
no TV tuner at all. Not an ATSC tuner, not an NTSC tuner — nada! If
you’ve got one of these, and you’re not using a cable box or satellite
receiver, you can use the NTSC tuner built into your VCR to pick up
OTA NTSC broadcasts or analog cable.
If you’ve got an external ATSC tuner for OTA HDTV, it probably also
has an NTSC tuner.
Working with your other sources
Chances are very good that you’ll be connecting more than just
HDTV and analog TV broadcasts to your new HDTV. You’ll want to
(we’re guessing) watch DVDs and videotapes, play video games,
and so on.
There are two bits of good news here:
 All HDTVs will be compatible with the NTSC signals that these
devices put out.
 Most HDTVs will include plenty of inputs on the back (or side,
or front) of the HDTV set to accommodate these devices.
Inputs galore! You really don’t have to worry about “will my 1982
Betamax work with my 2005 model HDTV?” It will — as long as that
beautiful old Betamax itself is still operating (and there’s a whole
underground world of Betamax enthusiasts to keep you up and
running!).
The only real question is how you get all these inputs hooked up
and connected to your HDTV. In Chapter 3 we discuss each of the
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
28

input types themselves in more detail. Beyond understanding the
types of inputs, there’s a purely quantitative angle to this problem.
In effect, you need to count the devices you’ve got (or anticipate
getting) and group them together by the type of inputs they use.
Then compare these numbers to the number of inputs on your
HDTV. Here’s a basic list:
 Digital inputs: You’re likely to have only one of these (DVI or
HDMI) on your HDTV; your HDTV tuner/cable box/satellite
receiver or DVD player may use these inputs.
 Component video inputs: You probably have a couple of
these on your HDTV. Your HDTV tuner, DVD player, and game
console (Xbox or PlayStation) can use these.
 S-video inputs: You’ll probably have a bunch of these (but
you’ll need them) on your HDTV; your DVD player, VCR, game
console, digital cable box, satellite receiver, camcorder, and
even PC (yes, PC!) are just a few of the devices that can use
this connection.
 Composite video inputs: You’ll also have a bunch of these;
everything we mention here can use this connection method
as well.
There’s also a qualitative angle at play here. In Chapter 3 we
explain in detail, but in a nutshell, the connections listed here are
shown in order of rank. If you run out of inputs of a certain type
(say, component video) and have to use the next one down the list,
you lose a bit of video quality. Therefore it can be important, if
you’ve got a lot of gear, to choose an HDTV with more digital, com-
ponent video, or S-video connections, if at all possible.
You can get by with fewer inputs on the HDTV if you use a home
theater receiver (see Chapter 19) that provides high-definition
video-switching functionality. Basically, you can route everything
into the back of your receiver, and then use just a couple of cables
to connect the receiver to your HDTV. This is a great way deal with
running out of the proper kind of inputs on your HDTV.
Which Features Matter?
A bunch of features are listed in the description of every HDTV on
the market. Some are important, others are just “bells and whistles”
that we don’t think make a real difference. (We support diversity,
Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 29

however — if you disagree and think a certain feature is very
important, then by all means make that part of your buying 
decision! This is a very subjective area.)
Here’s what we pay attention to:
 Picture adjustments: All HDTVs will give you some degree of
control over the picture settings. What we like are HDTVs that
let you
• Set the picture quality differently for each input on the
back of the TV — so you can adjust the picture individu-
ally for the HDTV tuner, the DVD player, and so on.
• Save multiple different picture settings in memory (like
one for day time and one for night).
 Comb filter: The comb filter is an internal circuit in your TV
that separates out the brightness and color information in an
NTSC signal before it’s displayed on your screen. Look for an
HDTV with a 3D or (even better) a digital (also called 3D Y/C)
comb filter.
 Front-panel inputs: Got a camcorder (a MiniDV model, not
an HDTV camcorder), or a game console that the kids are
always carrying around the house? You’ll want some front-
panel inputs to connect them to so you don’t have to climb
behind the TV.
Look for front-panel inputs that include S-video for better
picture quality.
 Built-in speakers: We’re huge proponents of connecting your
HDTV system to a full-up, external surround-sound audio
system. We’re also fans of low-impact, easy-to-use systems.
So, when we want to just watch the news, or turn on that TiVo
recording of Sesame Street for the kids, we prefer to use the
speakers built into our HDTVs. We mention this because some
HDTVs (mainly plasmas and LCD flat-panels) don’t come with
speakers — you’ll have to fire up the full surround-sound
system for everything you watch.
 Surround-sound decoder: While you need six or more speak-
ers and related amplification systems to get true surround
sound (see Chapter 18), you can get improved sound quality
for the sound system built into your HDTV if it includes a sim-
ulated surround-sound decoder, which can create a richer
sound from your HDTV’s speakers.

Chapter 2: Shopping Smart 31
Service matters!
When you’re buying an HDTV set, you’re spending a relatively serious chunk of
change. Heck, even if you’re loaded, spending $10,000 or more on a front-projector
system starts to move out of the pocket-change realm pretty darned fast.
So, it’s important to get your money’s worth. That doesn’t just mean getting the
lowest price for the particular TV you’ve chosen (though that’s an admirable goal —
one we can definitely get behind); it also means getting decent service to boot.
Now, we’ve all got our own definitions of what good service is, but here’s what we
look for:
 Delivery services: Lots of places (both online and local brick-and-mortar stores)
are offering “white glove” delivery services. This means someone delivers that
huge big-screen TV that wouldn’t fit in the back of your Mini in a million years,
and they don’t just drop it off on the front stoop and boogie on out of there.
Instead they deliver the unit to the room you want it in, get it out of the box,
and even take all the packaging materials with them (no doubt, to be humanely
recycled!). That’s what we want!
 Warranty: We’ve never been huge fans of the “extended warranty” services
offered by many consumer-electronics stores. After all, what’s the point of
paying $30 for a warranty on a $35 cordless phone? But check out the warranty
that comes with your HDTV closely — it’s a major investment after all. And con-
sider an extended warranty if it’s not too expensive. With some types of HDTVs
(such as DLP and LCD projection systems) you may pay back the warranty when
your bulb needs replacement after a few years of heavy usage.

 Dealing with digital video cables
 Sorting through analog video cables
 Coping with copy protection
 Plugging into audio
A
s you pull your shiny new HDTV out of its (probably very
large) box — and consider connecting it to your TV source,
your DVD player, your home theater receiver, and all the other “stuff”
in your family room or media room — you may have a moment of
panic (or at least a small shiver of fear) when you consider how
many different choices you have for cables and connectors.
Never fear, HDTV For Dummies is here to help you. Cables are actu-
ally pretty easy when you think about them in terms of a hierarchy —
some cable/connection types are (almost always) simply better
than others — they give you a better picture or clearer audio. Once
you know this hierarchy, you can quickly examine your connection
options for any piece of equipment attached to your HDTV, choose
your best option, and astound your friends.
In this chapter, we explain analog and digital cable options for audio
and video, and explain their positions within this hierarchy. We also
explain how copy-protection systems may affect your options.
Video Connections
Look at the back of any HDTV (or any DVD player or home-theater
receiver) and you see what scares many folks away from jumping
in to hook up their own HDTVs and audio/video (A/V) equipment.
There are just so darned many choices back there — who could
possibly know which connector to use?
Well, we know.

High-definition video
There’s often a significant difference in the functionality and video
quality of connections. Few cables can handle HDTV signals.
Some DVD players have high-definition connectors. But when this
book was published, none of these were HDTV DVD players. Instead,
a circuit called a scaler (see Chapter 6) converts the standard DVD
picture to work a little better on an HDTV screen. It’s a worthwhile
improvement, but you probably should use all your high-definition
connections for true HDTV components before you use a high-defi-
nition connection on a DVD player.
Digital connections
Digital video connections (such as DVI-D, HDMI and FireWire) are
the best choice for often-used HDTV video connections, such as
the link to your HDTV from a satellite or cable receiver.
Not all HDTV devices use the same digital connections, but it’s usu-
ally worth the trouble to use digital connections when you can,
even if you need an adapter for different digital connections. As the
HDMI connection replaces DVI-D, you may find yourself in a situa-
tion where you need to use an inexpensive (under $50) adapter.
For example, if your HDTV has an HDMI connector and your HDTV
set top box or tuner uses DVI-D, you can connect your devices
through one of these converters.
The first rule of HDTV connections: Use a digital video connection
to connect from a source device to your HDTV, if you can. Digital
connections almost always provide the best picture.
Theoretically, HDMI connections can offer the best picture quality of
any of the digital connections available on HDTVs, simply because
these cables have so much bandwidth that they can offer uncom-
pressed HDTV signal transmission. In the real world, however, any
of these digital connections offers an exceptionally clear and sharp
picture, and HDTV signals are almost always compressed for trans-
mission or storage anyway.
On some pieces of gear (typically HDTV cable set top boxes —
discussed in Chapter 9), some of the digital connections may be
disabled — the connections are physically present, but the soft-
ware within the device that lets them work is turned off. So, for
example, if an HDTV set-top box from your cable company has a
FireWire port, you probably can’t use that FireWire port to connect
a D-VHS recorder. Check with your cable company before spending
money on cables and equipment that use these ports!
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
34

DVI-D
The most common digital-video cable for HDTV is DVI-D. (DVI
stands for digital video interconnect, and the extra D means it’s for
digital TV.) Figure 3-1 shows the DVI-D connector for HDTV.
Figure 3-1: DVI-D your way to high-def video.
If you’re using DVI-D connections, watch out for two problems:
 Not all DVI connectors work with HDTV. Make sure you have
DVI-D cables if you use DVI-D in your HDTV system.
Computers use another type of DVI connector that has a con-
fusingly similar name: DVD-I. The DVD-I connector has five
extra pins (four pins around a central crosshair-shaped pin)
on one side; these send analog video signals from computer
video cards to computer monitors. You typically won’t find
DVI-I in home HDTV systems. (There are some projection sys-
tems that are also used with computers to beam PowerPoint
slides up onto the conference room wall.) You can use an inex-
pensive adapter to connect a DVD-I cable to the DVD-D recep-
tacle on your HDTV — but you’ll only be able to receive
digital video signals that way, not analog.
 DVI-D connections often require the HDCP copy protection
system for true HDTV video performance. If just one of your
HDTV components doesn’t have HDCP, you may not get true
HDTV performance from DVI-D connections. (HDCP is
explained in the sidebar, “No copying!”)
Chapter 3: Cables and Connections 35

DVI-D is the only digital HDTV connection that can’t carry audio.
HDMI
The HDMI system (for High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is spe-
cially designed for HDTV connections. It carries both HDTV video
and digital surround sound. Figure 3-2 shows the business end of an
HDMI cable (the connector, in other words).
Figure 3-2: HDMI: the latest and greatest.
HDMI has a couple of advantages in an HDTV system:
 You need only one HDMI cable to connect both HDTV video
and surround-sound digital audio signals.
 HDMI is an extremely high-bandwidth technology (5 gigabits
per second). It has extra bandwidth to accommodate future
HDTV formats.
HDMI connections often require the HDCP copy-protection system
for true HDTV video performance. If you’re using any HDMI con-
nections, make sure that all your HDTV components support
HDCP. HDCP is explained in the sidebar, “No copying!”
FireWire
FireWire is the least-used HDTV connector. It can transmit both
video and audio. Figure 3-3 shows a FireWire connector.
FireWire is the only two-way connection for HDTV — the same
cable can send HDTV video (and audio) to and from devices. This
two-way connection is great for HDTV recording systems — for
example, one cable fully connects an HDTV with a D-VHS VCR.
We use the name FireWire throughout this book, but the same
system is known by a couple of other names:
 Engineers and nerds call FireWire the IEEE 1394 Standard.
(IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.)
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
36

 Some manufacturers use the name i.LINK instead of FireWire.
Consumer-electronics manufacturers usually prefer a snappy
name like i.LINK or FireWire over something boring like 1394
(not much you can do to liven up that number, huh?).
Figure 3-3: The Wire’s on Fire!
Chapter 3: Cables and Connections 37
No copying!
Film and television studios are worried about people copying their programs and
distributing them to others. HDTV (and DTV in general) is worrisome to the studios
because there may be “perfect” digital copies. (Non-digital copies get worse when
they’re recopied, so they aren’t such a threat.)
These content owners have lobbied the government and manufacturers to include
copy-protection systems in HDTV devices, such as tuners, set-top boxes, satellite
receivers, and HDTVs themselves. These systems can keep you from making copies
(or sometimes even one copy) of any HDTV program.
The most common copy-protection system is HDCP (high-bandwidth digital content
protection) — this system is in new HDMI-equipped devices and many DVI-
equipped devices. HDCP encrypts (scrambles) the content sent between devices
like tuners and TVs. This encryption is a problem if you have a DVI connection where
one piece (like a set top box) uses HDCP, and another (like your HDTV) doesn’t. That’s
because the content owners have rigged the system to downres (down-resolve)
HDTV programs to standard-definition unless HDCP is present at all points in the
system. You could end up unable to get an HDTV signal on your HDTV!
If some but not all of your HDTV devices have HDCP, then component video may be
the only way to get a true HDTV signal between your devices. Component video isn’t
limited by HDCP, because component video isn’t a digital signal.

Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
38
We’re big fans of FireWire, but most HDTVs and HDTV devices use
either DVI-D or HDMI connections instead of FireWire. The most
common place to find FireWire is a D-VHS VCR.
FireWire isn’t part of the HDCP copy-protection system. (HDCP is
explained in the sidebar, “No copying!”). Instead, FireWire uses its
own copy-protection scheme called “5C-DTCP” (or 5-company digital-
television content protection), which provides similar protection of
content that the big TV companies don’t want you to record for
yourself. The 5C system (that’s the industry shorthand for it) basi-
cally acts just like HDCP, letting only authorized (5C-equipped)
equipment make recordings of “flagged” material.
Analog component video
Component video is the only analog video-cable connection that
can handle HDTV or progressive-scan DVD signals.
S-video and composite video don’t carry progressive scan.
Technology
Component video is a set of three analog cables, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
The component video signal is divided into three (you guessed it!)
components:
 Y is the luminance (brightness) signal.
 Pb and Pr each carry part of the picture’s chrominance (color)
information. Your TV uses these two chrominance signals to
create the red, green and blue colors that can be mixed
together to create any color on your display. (Sometimes, Pb
is labeled B-Y and Pr is labeled R-Y.)
Connection
Component video connections use three normal analog cables.
If you already have three standard composite video cables, you can
use those cables instead of a set of “official” component video
cables. There’s no functional difference between the two, though
many folks find it convenient to buy component video cables bun-
dled together (so all the cables are neatly labeled, attached in the
right order, and don’t get lost).

Figure 3-4: The best analog video connection — component video.
If you’re routing all of your video cables through a home theater
receiver (as covered in Chapter 19), check your receiver’s specs
before routing component video connections through it. The
receiver’s component video bandwidth specification should be 
 At least 10 MHz for progressive-scan DVD players
 At least 30 MHz for HDTV connections
Component video may be the only connection that allows a true
HDTV signal in your system if some, but not all, of your HDTV com-
ponents use the HDCP copy-protection system. (HDCP is explained
in the sidebar, “No copying!”)
Traditional video
You’re probably not connecting only HDTV sources into your
spanking-new HDTV. Most of the today’s TV content is standard def-
inition in both broadcast media (over-the-air, cable, and satellite)
and prerecorded media (DVD and VCR).
Most source devices for standard-definition video use one of the
following traditional analog connectors, not the high-definition
video connections mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Pr
Pb
Y
Chapter 3: Cables and Connections 39

S-Video
The best traditional video connection is S-Video. Figure 3-5 shows
the S-Video connector.
If you can use an S-video connection, you should (unless you can
use a high-definition digital or component video connection).
S-video cables transmit the video signal in two separate channels:
 Luminance (brightness data)
 Chrominance (color data)
Separating luminance and chrominance can deliver a better picture
because it bypasses a circuit found within all but the smallest and
cheapest televisions (the comb filter). Because an S-Video cable
already uses separate conductors, your TV doesn’t have to separate
this information out with its own comb filter. Usually this built-in
separation provides a better picture on the TV.
S-video connections often are found on DVD players, game con-
soles (such as Xbox), and many satellite and digital cable receivers
or set-top boxes. Some VCRs also have S-video connections.
Figure 3-5: Use S-Video for non-HDTV or progressive-scan sources.
S VIDEO
OUT
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
40

S-video cables are a bit tricky to connect:
 An S-video plug has four very, very delicate pins and a small
plastic tab. It’s incredibly easy to misalign these pins and
bend them (and even break a pin off). Easy does it. (But you
knew that, right?)
 A properly aligned S-video plug easily slides in. The key is to
line up the small plastic tab with the corresponding slot on the
jack, and gently push. Don’t twist! If you’re pushing hard, it’s
probably not aligned straight (and you’re probably bending
pins). If the plug is hard to push in, stop and realign it.
Composite video
The oldest basic connection for separate video units is composite
video. Composite video cable is a 75-Ohm cable with plugs called
RCA connectors (the same connectors used by most audio cables).
Composite video cables (shown in Figure 3-6) carry the entire
video signal on a single conductor. They don’t carry any audio —
you need separate analog or digital audio cables for that.
Composite video cables can offer a much better picture than a
standard coaxial “antenna” connection. However, composite video
really isn’t the best choice for higher-resolution analog sources,
such as S-VHS-C and Hi8 camcorders, DVD players, and videogame
consoles. Use an S-Video connection when you can.
Figure 3-6: Use composite video for low-resolution video sources.
Coaxial cable
Coaxial video cable (coax — pronounced CO-ax — for short) is the
cable that’s probably either running down from your attic antenna
Chapter 3: Cables and Connections 41

or coming into the side of your house from the cable company or
satellite dish. It carries both video and audio signals.
A video system should only use a coax connection when you are
connecting something directly to an outside feed (an antenna,
satellite dish, or incoming cable line). Whenever you connect a
device to your HDTV, any other video connection (even S-video or
composite video) should give you a better picture than coax video.
The connectors on the ends of coax are F Connectors, as shown in
Figure 3-7. An F connector has a small pin (the conductor) sticking
out of the middle, and a metal barrel around the outside.
Use screw-on F connectors if you can. Screw-on F connectors can
make a much better (tighter) connection than push-on connectors.
Figure 3-7: Use F-connectors to hook up your cable or antenna feeds.

Audio Connections
Audio connections aren’t as complicated as video. There are basi-
cally three choices, and only two deliver digital surround sound.
Every video connection for your HDTV needs separate audio con-
nections except coaxial cable (which you should only use for
incoming feeds from antennas, cable services, and satellite dishes),
HDMI, and FireWire.
Digitizing your audio
Digital audio signals (such as those put out by DVD players and
HDTV tuners) are a digital stream of bits from the source device to
either your receiver or HDTV, which decode this bitstream.
If you have digital connections available between two pieces of
gear, use digital, not analog:
 Some home-theater gear (like DVD players or HDTV tuners)
requires digital audio for the most advanced surround-sound
systems (for example, Dolby Digital). If you use analog, you’ll
revert to a less effective surround-sound standard.
 The longer digital audio stays digital, the better.
The biggest advantages of digital audio are 
 Near immunity to interference
 A “pure” digital signal all the way to the receiver
Digital audio can use either digital coaxial electrical cables or opti-
cal (Toslink) fiber-optic cables.
There’s very little difference in performance between optical and
coaxial digital cables. The decision usually revolves around which
system both your source devices and receiver happen to use.
Digital coaxial
Digital coaxial cables look basically identical to analog audio cables.
They’re made of similar materials, and they use the familiar RCA-
plug connector. The internal construction is different, however —
and coaxial digital-audio cables are designed to provide 75-Ohm
impedance (just like video cables).
Chapter 3: Cables and Connections 43

We’ve tried, and can’t hear the difference, but thought we’d let you
know that some HDTV enthusiasts think coaxial cables sound best.
Optical (Toslink)
Toslink optical cables are made of fiber-optic cabling (usually 
plastic fiber). They transmit the digital audio as pulses of laser-
generated light, not as electrical signals.
Toslink cables are particularly immune to electromagnetic
interference.
The connector on a Toslink cable is quite distinctive, as shown in
Figure 3-8. It looks like nothing else in the world more than the pro-
file of a house, with a small pin (actually the end of the fiber) stick-
ing out of the side.
Figure 3-8: It looks like a house! Toslink audio cables.
The “female” Toslink connector on your equipment may have a
dust cap to keep the optical pickups clean while it isn’t connected.
Remove (and save!) this dust cap before you try to connect.
Attaching analog audio
A couple of familiar audio connections still do a lot of the work in
today’s entertainment systems.
RCA cables
The basic building block of any audio connection is the tried-and-
true analog audio cable (often called the RCA cable), as shown in
Figure 3-9. You’ll find analog audio cables on the back of almost
every source device you connect to your HDTV — ranging from
HDTV tuners to 25-year-old VCRs.
Part I: HDTV Fundamentals 
44

Generally, you should use analog audio connections only if you
can’t make a digital audio connection.
Analog audio cables are used 
 In pairs (for basic stereo sources)
 Alone (for connecting a subwoofer to a receiver)
 In sixes (for connecting either a DVD-A or SACD player to the
receiver, or connecting the external surround-sound decoder
on a DVD player)
Figure 3-9: Analog audio cables.
Headphone and microphone jacks
Some video sources (such as computers and camcorders) have
headphone jacks and microphone jacks instead of RCA-type audio
connections.
If your gadget didn’t come with adapters to connect from these
jacks to an audio component that uses RCA-type connections, the
nearest electronics store usually has the adapter you need.

W
ell, if this were a book about books, we’d say you
can’t judge a book by its cover — but it’s a book
about HDTV, so we have to revise this to say, “You can’t
judge an HDTV by its display.” There’s so much about an
HDTV system that is more than skin deep, and this part of
the book helps you understand how to optimally install,
calibrate, and scale your HDTV system.
We start out with a chapter devoted to using all the connec-
tions we introduce in Chapter 3. We help you ﬁgure out how
to connect your HDTV to over-the-air, cable, and satellite
signals, as well as how to bridge in your DVD, VCR, DVR,
camcorder and other sources of video content. We also tell
you how to send signals out to your home surround sound
stereo system, so you can truly enjoy your HDTV theater.
Then we discuss ways to optimize this system, by making
sure your signal is properly calibrated for your speciﬁc
home environment. As we just mentioned, you can’t judge
an HDTV that’s fresh out of the box by its display, because
most of them are improperly calibrated (the picture’s not
optimally adjusted, in other words).
Then we wrap up the part with a discussion on how to
optimize the signal coming into your HDTV, using video
processors and scalers. Aside from being fast ways to
clean ﬁsh, scalers help you match your input-source sig-
nals to your best HDTV display format. Without a scaler
(either internal or external to your display), the images
coming in from your video sources might not be properly
aligned with the best display characteristics of your HDTV.
By the time you are done with this part, you can rest
assured that your HDTV is just the way it should be.
Isn’t that a comforting feeling!

Hooking Up Your HDTV
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the backside of your HDTV
 Hooking up your most basic antenna and cable connections
 Adding DVDs, VCRs, Camcorders, and other devices
 Going digital, for all it’s worth
 Home entertaining in surround sound
S
etting up your HDTV does not have to be a complicated
process. In fact, you should be able to test and use your HDTV
with minimal setup if you wish — it’s only when you start adding
DVD players and home-theater systems that the connections get a
little spaghetti-like.
In this chapter, we help you open up the box and get the HDTV out
(But of course you really don’t believe that. Oh well. Call Pat —
he’ll come right on over! Kidding.). Okay, so what we really help
you do is understand the overall layout of your HDTV system, and
to understand where the parts fit. We start small and simple, with
just an over the air connection, and work up to your most intense
and complex HDTV home-theater operation.
Throughout this chapter, we refer to all the connections discussed
in Chapter 3. You can flip there for the pros and cons of a particu-
lar cable or interface.
The exact ports, connections, options, and other attributes of your
HDTV set will vary by manufacturer, model, country, and so on.
So we’re going to use a rather generic diagram to illustrate your
HDTV set’s interfaces, as shown in Figure 4-1. In practice, you may
not have all of these, or they might be scattered around on the
sides of your HDTV (as often happens with a plasma) or across the
back (as you’d get with a projector). The key point is what you are
connecting — and with which cables — so don’t sweat it if Figure
4-1 doesn’t look exactly like your TV.

Making Connections
Unless your HDTV has a built-in DVD player or VCR, you need to
make some connections to actually use it — the video signal must
come from somewhere. There’s probably a cluster of input and
output jacks (jack panel) on your HDTV. How you use these jacks
is determined by the devices you connect to your HDTV.
Jack panels
Depending on the cabinet design, there may be jacks on the front,
at the side, or on the back of your set. Figure 4-1 shows the input
and output jacks you’re likely to find on the back of a CRT or pro-
jection HDTV.
DVI-D, composite-video, S-Video, and component-video connections
carry video information only. You need separate audio cables to
carry the corresponding audio signals. Chapter 3 covers these
connections.
Figure 4-1: Your master set of HDTV ports.
Input jacks
Input jacks only receive broadcast signals and programs from your
audio/video devices so you can watch them on your HDTV. You’ll
probably see most or all of the following audio/video input jacks
on your HDTV, as shown in Figure 4-1:

 ANT-IN: Two or more ports for 
• NTSC analog and ATSC off-air signals
These ports only work for ATSC if you’ve got an HDTV
with built-in HDTV (or ATSC) tuner.
• Analog and digital cable-TV signals
These ports only work for digital cable if you’ve got a
DCR (digital-cable-ready) HDTV (see Chapter 8).
 DVI-D/HDCP IN: A digital-video input, usually teamed with
two R/L inputs for audio
DVI-D/HDCP ports can’t plug into cables that are connected to
a PC’s (similar) DVI-I connection.
 Video In: Usually these are in sets with
• Composite and S-Video video inputs
• Standard audio inputs 
Usually these are connected to composite or S-Video-
equipped video systems like VCRs.
Your HDTV may require you to tell it whether you’re connect-
ing to the composite video or S-Video jack. (Check your
owner’s manual.)
 Component Video In: Component video plus standard audio
inputs for accepting signals from component video systems
such as DVD players
 PC inputs: Usually divided into
• PC Audio Input: These audio jacks connect to the audio
output ports on your PC.
• PC Video Input: These video jacks connect to the video
output port on your PC.
Output jacks
Output jacks send signals from your HDTV to your audio/video
devices so you can 
 Record, listen to, or distribute the programs 
 Control other devices
You’ll probably see most or all of the following audio/video output
jacks on your HDTV, as shown in Figure 4-1:
 IR Out: An Infrared port for sending IR signals to control your
attached devices
Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 51

 Audio/video outputs: Usually an HDTV has two kinds of
audio/video outputs that do a range of tasks:
• REC Out: A “record out” connection for recording what
you see on your HDTV to an analog VCR.
• A/V Out: Regular composite video and standard audio
outputs for connecting such devices as a VCR for editing
and dubbing. Usually this output is bridged directly to an
input; whatever is connected to the input jack goes to
this output.
These audio/video outputs usually have a couple of limitations:
• They output a downconverted video signal, not HDTV.
• You can’t adjust the audio volume with the TV remote.
 Audio Only: HDTVs usually have a couple of outputs for send-
ing audio to other devices, such as amplifiers, receivers, and
decoders:
• Digital Audio Out: A digital audio connection (usually
an optical “Toslink” connector) for connecting external
Dolby Digital-enabled amplifiers, receivers, decoders, or
other home-theater systems that receive optical audio. 
• Variable Audio Out: These are standard audio ports for
connecting an analog amplifier with external speakers.
Variable audio allows you to adjust the volume of your
external sound system with your TV remote.
Many TVs have an on/off switch that governs how the onboard
speakers are used. You may be able to switch your speakers so
either
 The internal speakers carry all the normal audio signals.
 The TV’s audio goes directly to the A/V receiver, and either
• The TV’s speakers can be the A/V receiver’s center
speakers for surround sound.
• The TV’s speakers are entirely off.
Bi-directional jacks
Bi-directional jacks both send and receive data. A couple of these
jacks are common on HDTVs, as shown in Figure 4-1. Two types
exist:
 FireWire/IEEE 1394: These ports are for connecting devices
for compressed video and audio signals.
Part II: Love at First Sight 
52

HDTVs with IEEE-1394 FireWire ports don’t always operate
with all the other devices that include such connections. For
instance, usually you can’t hook up a 1394-outfitted Mini DV
camcorder to a TV. Check your manual closely about what can
be connected to this port.
 RS-232 Jack: This is a serial-connection port that can be used
with your PC for data transfer (like firmware upgrades), and
which can also be used with some automation systems.
Connecting basic TV sources
When you get your HDTV home from the store, we know you’ll
want to turn it on and fire it up. You don’t have to connect every-
thing right from the start. The following connections are the most
basic connections you can make with your HDTV.
Throughout this chapter, we deal with VCRs and standalone DVRs
as interchangeable units — they connect to your HDTV in the same
fashion. If you have both, see the section called “Two VCRs for
editing.”
If you want to connect your VCR or DVR right now, skip to “DVR
and VCR connections” later in this chapter.
Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 53
Dealing with the “No Picture” Scenario
Most HDTVs have a fairly large number on inputs on the back (and usually some on
the front too!) that can accept connections from antennas, cable TV feeds, cable
set-top boxes, satellite receivers, DVD players, DVRs and more. Having all of these
connectors is a good thing, but it can occasionally cause a bit of trouble.
So once you connect one of your source devices to your HDTV, you may run into a
situation where you start up your HDTV and expect a picture, and get . . . well . . .
nothing. Don’t panic. Most TVs won’t automatically search amongst all the inputs
you’ve got hooked up to find the one that’s “active”. So read the manual for your
shiny new HDTV, and as a first step — before you learn anything fun (such as how
to operate the picture-in-picture function or the “zoom” function), figure out how to
select the various inputs. 
Some HDTVs have assignable inputs so you can tell your HDTV and remote control
that, for example, Input “1” on the back (which may be a component video con-
nection) belongs to the DVD player and should be activated when you press the
DVD button on your remote, and so on. It takes only a few minutes, and it’s worth get-
ting figured out right away.

Antenna or unscrambled cable
The simplest connection you can make is connecting an antenna
into your HDTV — with no worries about cable boxes, VCRs, DVDs,
home theater receivers or anything else. You use a direct antenna
connection when
 You don’t need an external TV tuner to tune into NTSC or
HDTV channels
 You don’t need a cable box or satellite receiver to unscramble
channels
 You don’t connect a VCR or DVR
If you have cable TV and all your channels are unscrambled —
meaning you don’t need a cable “converter” or set-top box — you
can connect using this same method.
This connection is shown in Figure 4-2.
When you use an antenna to pick up HDTV or standard-definition
broadcasts, it is called using an OTA (or over-the-air) connection.
If you are using an indoor antenna to grab either HDTV or regular,
standard-definition OTA signals, make sure you keep the antenna
away from the TV to avoid noise on the screen.
Cable box
Your best cable-television connection depends on how (or whether)
you need to use a cable box to access cable channels. 
If you don’t need a cable box, follow the instructions in the pre-
ceding section.

Cable set-top box 
This option (Figure 4-3) adds a cable-set-top box (or cable set-top
box) to the equation. You would use this connection plan if
 Your cable company requires a cable set-top box only for
scrambled or digital channels.
 You don’t connect a VCR or DVR.
Even though most cable set-top boxes have an “RF” output that can
connect to the ANT (antenna) input on the back of your HDTV, you’ll
be better off using the composite video or S-Video connections on
your cable box and HDTV, if they’re available. (See Chapter 3 for
more details on these connections.)
Figure 4-3: Cable set-tops and your HDTV.
The HDTV’s internal converter eliminates the need for an external
splitter so you can switch between two options:
 Unscrambled signals come straight into the TV set.
 Scrambled signals come in through the cable set-top box.
Cable set-top box
This option (Figure 4-4) consolidates all your signals over one link
to the HDTV set. You would use this connection option if
 Your cable company scrambles all its channels, requiring you
to have a cable set-top box.

This situation limits how much you can actually use TV-set
features that might allow you to view two channels at once
(that is, picture-in-picture capability). If the cable-set-top box
sends one channel at a time, that’s all you can watch.
 You don’t connect a VCR or DVR. 
If your HDTV is DCR (Digital Cable-Ready), you may be able to
use a CableCARD and skip the cable box. We discuss this
choice in Chapter 8.
Figure 4-4: Going cable all the way, all the time.
Satellite receiver
This option (Figure 4-5) can consolidate all your signals over one
link to the HDTV set if you like. You would use this connection
option if
 You have a satellite service and receiver.
The signal from satellite dish connects to the receiver, which
in turn connects to the HDTV.
 You have an over-the-air antenna.
The antenna cable connects to either 
• The HDTV (via one of its antenna ports) 
• The satellite receiver
 You don’t connect a VCR or DVR.

Most new satellite receivers have component-video connections, in
addition to composite and S-Video connections. Component is
always the best of these three options for this application.

If you have a DVR or VCR, then your connection options increase.
The upcoming subsections describe some potential connection sit-
uations you might encounter.
In this section we cover the DVR and VCR as interchangeable
items — which is exactly what they are, functionally speaking. 
If your cable or satellite set-top boxes or receivers has a built-in
DVRs — you don’t need to make any extra connections at all. All
the connections are internal to the set-top box or the receiver.

VCR with antenna or unscrambled cable 
The most basic VCR option (Figure 4-6) is to run an antenna feed or
cable TV connection to the VCR, and then on to the HDTV. You
would use this connection if either of the following is true:
 You’re using an OTA antenna.
 Your cable company does not scramble its signals (so you
don’t need a set-top box).
If you have both an off-the-air antenna and cable TV, connect the
cable TV to the UHF/VHF (also called ANT 1) jack and the antenna
to the AUX (also called ANT 2) connection. While this might seem
counterintuitive, most TV features are set up to use the UHF/VHF
connection as the primary default. That’s why you’d want your
cable connection on this port.

Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 59

A splitter takes the signal from the cable company and sends iden-
tical signals on two paths: 
 Directly to the TV’s ANT-2/AUX antenna port
 Through the cable set-top box to the TV’s S-Video or com-
posite video inputs
Using two antenna connections lets you use the TV’s tuner on
unscrambled channels for such features as picture-in-picture. The
cable set-top usually only sends one channel at a time, so you can’t
use most of the TV’s multichannel features with it. 
VCR with a satellite receiver
This VCR option (Figure 4-8) is to run a satellite TV connection to the
VCR, and then on to the HDTV. You would use this connection if
 You use a satellite company for your main signals
 You have a VCR
 You have an over-the-air antenna
Most new satellite receivers have component-video connections, in
addition to composite and S-Video connections. Component is
always the best of these three options.
In this arrangement, the VCR can be used to view or record antenna-
based channels, in addition to viewing the antenna channels through
the HDTV.
Other connections
The fun does not have to stop here. You can add more to your
HDTV setup.
DVD player
You can add a DVD player to the cable TV service, antenna, satel-
lite, DVR, VCR or whatever it is you have hooked up to your HDTV
quite easily. In fact, it doesn’t really matter what you’ve got con-
nected to your HDTV — the DVD player (and other source devices
like videogame consoles or laserdisc players) will connect to their
own set of audio and video inputs on your HDTV. The key think to
remember is to remember to use the highest quality video and
audio connection available to you (see Chapter 3 for details on
this). Whenever possible, use component video and digital audio
cables — move down from there based on what’s available on your
HDTV and DVD player.
Part II: Love at First Sight

Figure 4-8: A VCR mated to your satellite receiver and HDTV.
If you have a VCR/DVD combination unit, you probably have to
make separate connections for the DVD player and the VCR, just as
if they were separate devices.
Two VCRs for editing
If you do a lot of taping and editing, then you might have two VCRs
connected together (as in Figure 4-9). You can either
 Connect two VCRs serially:
• The playing VCR’s Line Out (video and audio) ports con-
nect to the Line In ports on the recording VCR. 
• The recording VCR’s Line Out ports send the signal to
the HDTV’s Video and Audio In ports.

Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 61

 Hook up the playing VCR to the Line In ports on the HDTV, and
then connect the recording VCR to the Line Out jacks of the TV. 
On most TVs, the Video Out jack does not output a picture-in-
picture frame, so you can’t record that image.
If you’re connecting two VCRs together for tape editing, you still
cannot edit a tape that has copy protection.
Digital cable or satellite connections
If your set-top box is digital, you most likely have component video
connections — and potentially even DVI/HDCP connections (check
out Figure 4-10). In either case, you have to connect audio cables
separately. The rest of the connections to other devices are the
same as discussed elsewhere in this chapter.

To make sure your DVI/HDCP device resets correctly, we recom-
mend that you turn on the TV first, then power-up the DVI/HDCP
gear — and when you turn them off, shut down the DVI/HDCP
device first.

Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 63
Getting your PC hooked up
If you have a Media Center PC (or a homemade HTPC — home-theater PC), you’ll
definitely want to connect it to your HDTV. How you make this connection depends
upon two things:
 What kind of video card you have in your PC
 What kind of connections are available on your HDTV
The video card determines what kinds of connections are available on the PC; the
back of your HDTV determines the other end of the connection. Some HDTVs can
connect directly to PCs, and have a VGA connection. If you don’t have one of these
connections, you’ll want to use component video or S-Video cables to connect your
video, as well as a pair of analog audio cables.
If you have either a Media Center PC or a PC with DVR software, you can treat your
PC like a VCR or DVR (as described in this chapter).

Camcorder
These days it seems everyone’s got a camcorder. If you’re part of
the “in crowd” and you have a camcorder, you can connect to your
HDTV via S-Video if you have it, composite connector if you don’t.
(Figure 4-11 shows what this setup looks like.)
The audio outputs of your camcorder will connect to a pair of
analog-audio inputs on your HDTV.
Part II: Love at First Sight 
64
Picture-in-picture with cable boxes
When a cable system requires you to use a special cable box (for example, to
access premium, digital, or pay-per-view channels), your TV receives only one
channel at a time from the box. That means you can’t use some of your TV’s special
features — in particular, picture-in-picture. If all your cable channels (or satellite
channels) require the box, then there isn’t much you can do about it. (You may be
able to get a cable or satellite box with these features — a two tuner model — if you
want them.) But if your cable system has some unscrambled channels, you can add
an extra cable input directly to your TV that lets you use all of your TV’s features on
unscrambled channels. (You can set up your system this way with any of the cable-
box connections shown in this chapter.)
This arrangement requires a cable splitter and a couple of extra 75-ohm cables.
Instead of connecting the incoming cable feed directly to the cable box, you con-
nect the incoming feed to the splitter. The extra cables connect the TV and cable box
inputs to the splitter. The following figure shows this extra connection with a cable
box. Note that with this connection, the TV has direct access to any unscrambled
cable channels for such features as picture-in-picture. 
Basic channels are hooked up to an Antenna input on your TV. To tune these chan-
nels in using your TV’s picture-in-picture functionality, just select that antenna input.
You can watch all your channels — basic, unscrambled channels, and premium
channels — through your cable box, which should be connected to your HDTV using
composite or S-Video cables (along with a pair of audio cables).

Most HDTVs have front-panel inputs (usually one for S-Video, one for
composite video, and a pair of analog-audio inputs) designed espe-
cially for connecting camcorders — you don’t have to bend over in
an unflattering way behind the TV to make your connection.

Surround-sound system
You can — and we hope you do — connect your HDTV to a full-
fledged home stereo system. This is shown in Figure 4-12. You
would use this scenario if
 You want full surround sound from your HDTV experience
 You have a home-theater A/V system rated for surround sound

Chapter 4: Hooking Up Your HDTV 65

This is actually quite simple in design — you’re taking the video
and audio out from the TV and using them to drive what comes out
of the stereo system. Note that if you’re using your receiver as a
video switch, then you would instead route the video signals into
the receiver before they go on to the HDTV.
If you plan to use a receiver as a video switch to control the signals
going to your HDTV, know that the cables used to carry HDTV, DVI
and HDMI, are typically not supported by receiver video switching,
so you’ll need to make those connections directly from source to
HDTV, and not use the receiver’s video switching. More on this in
Chapter 19.

W
hen you bring your HDTV home, take it out of the box and
turn it on, it will be in what many experts call torch mode:
the brightness of your picture will be cranked way, way up.
Manufacturers do this because of the retail environment — lots of
bright overhead lights that could “wash out” the picture on the
showroom floor. Manufacturers also crank up the picture bright-
ness because, when ten or twelve HDTVs are lined up next to each
other showing the same video, the brightest picture tends to catch
your eye (so you think, “Must buy that one!”).
In this chapter, we tell you about the different adjustments you can
make to your HDTV’s picture. We also tell you about a series of dif-
ferent inexpensive DVDs (and a pair of D-VHS tapes) you can buy to
really get things set up correctly — just adjusting the picture by eye-
balling it isn’t going to cut it. We even tell you about some free DVD
software that can do most (but not all) of what the other DVDs can
do. Finally, we tell you about the ultimate in HDTV maintenance —
like a spa day for your TV — the professional calibration.
Why You Need to Calibrate
Unfortunately, the “torch” mode your set was adjusted to when it
came out of the box can’t give you the best picture quality when
that HDTV is in your home. In fact, it gives you a lousy picture in

a darkly lit room (which is best for movie-watching). Even in a
normally daytime lit room, the standard picture settings of most
TVs are too bright for best picture quality.
That super-bright mode will also shorten your HDTV’s lifespan (or
at least the lifespan of your light bulb, if you have a microprojector
system) — which really means something if you have a $10,000
plasma that you were planning on using for 10 or 15 years! Even if
you only have to change a bulb (and not replace a tube or buy an
entirely new TV), you’ll still be out a couple of hundred dollars.
Getting Your Settings Right
In order to calibrate (properly configure) your HDTV’s picture, you’ll
need to delve into the TV’s menu system, using your remote con-
trol and the on-screen display (or OSD) that your HDTV provides.
Every HDTV differs, but you’ll most likely end up in a menu called
“Video Settings” to adjust the picture elements we’re about to
discuss.
We probably don’t own the same HDTV as you do. We’ve seen/used/
played with many different sets — enough to recognize that there’s
no way we’re going 100 percent match up to the terms that your
HDTV uses in its menu system for picture quality settings. So keep
that in mind — we’re using the generic terms here.
Here are the most common picture settings:
 Contrast (white level): The control adjusts the white level, or
the amount of whiteness your screen displays:
• If your white level is too high, white areas of your picture
tend to bleed over into the darker areas that surround
them.
• If your white level is too low, whites don’t appear true
white.
Whites and blacks are measured on a scale called IRE (Institute
of Radio Engineers) units. These are percentages between 0 and
100 — 0 percent is black; 100 percent is white.
 Brightness (black level): How’s this for confusing? Your HDTV’s
brightness control adjusts the black level that you see on the
screen. Seems a bit counterintuitive, doesn’t it? If the black
level is set incorrectly, dark scenes on your HDTV will be
indistinguishable — you won’t see the bad guy in the black
suit hiding in the shadows.
Part II: Love at First Sight 
68

 Sharpness: Ever see a fuzzy picture on your screen? The
sharpness control is the likely cause — it adjusts the fine
detail of the picture.
• If the sharpness is set too high, your picture appears
edgy, often with “blobs” around the edges of objects,
instead of clearly defined lines.
• If the sharpness is set too low, you have a fuzzy picture.
(Aha, so that’s why it’s fuzzy!)
 Two adjustments set the balance of colors:
• Color: The color setting is used to adjust the intensity of
the TV’s display of colors — if this is set too low, you’ll
see only black and white (or grayscale); set it too high,
and your colors will bleed together.
If your color setting is too low, images begin to appear
as black and white. If the color level is too high, images
take on a reddish tinge — everyone resembles Bozo the
Clown!
• Tint (hue): On most TVs, this control is labeled tint, but
a few are technically correct and call it hue. This control
adjusts your display’s color only within the range
between red and green.
This is pretty hard to adjust with your eyes alone — we
recommend the calibration systems in the next section
to get it done right.
Many HDTVs come with some picture pre-settings — mix-and-match
combinations of the settings listed here — designed for specific
purposes. For example, Sony HDTVs have settings such as “Vivid”
(which is that showroom “torch” setting), and “Pro” (which often is
pretty close to being well calibrated for viewing movies in a dark
room).
Getting Calibrated
All those video settings discussed in the previous section can be a
bit difficult (we think impossible) to set up properly by just “eye-
balling it.” Unless you have the visual equivalent of perfect pitch,
how can you know when the whites are white enough and the blacks
are black enough (not to mention whether the reds are red enough)?
You can either do it yourself or bring in the professionals.
Chapter 5: Enhancing Your HDTV 69

Doing it yourself
Calibration DVDs and tapes contain a specially designed series of
tests and test patterns that you can follow (along with on-screen
directions) to get the settings right on your HDTV. Calibration sys-
tems provide all the information you need to tune up your HDTV.
If you really have to adjust your video without the aid of a calibra-
tion system, here’s what we recommend (at minimum): 
 Turn down the brightness and contrast until the levels are
about 1⁄3 to 1⁄2, all across your screen.
 Substantially turn down the sharpness control.
Commercial DVDs
Most calibration systems come in the form of DVDs — which means
you won’t be using a high-definition picture to tune up your HDTV.
Yes, this is a less-than-great situation, but the settings are fairly
universal, so an HDTV that’s been well calibrated for a DVD input
will also look good for displaying HDTV.
High-definition DVDs will be here soon (see Chapter 11). Expect to
see high-def versions of the DVDs mentioned here before long.
There are popular calibration DVDs on the market from a couple of
sources. Any of these discs will do a great job helping you get your
HDTV tuned up and calibrated. Each of these discs includes
 A funky blue filter — they usually look like those crazy paper
3D glasses you needed to wear for Jaws 3! The blue filter lets
you properly set up your color and hue settings.
 Audio-calibration tools that will help you get your surround-
sound audio system properly configured (if you have one —
see Chapter 19 to learn about surround sound).
You really can’t go wrong with any of these discs:
 Ovation Software (www.ovationsw.com) distributes a couple
of calibration DVDs with a series of easy-to-follow on-screen
test patterns and signals that let you correctly adjust your TV’s
picture settings:
• Sound and Vision Home Theater Tune-up: Produced in
conjunction with Sound and Vision magazine (one of our
favorites). It’s about $25.
Part II: Love at First Sight 
70

Chapter 5: Enhancing Your HDTV 71
• AVIA: Guide to Home Theater: This disc contains a ton of
great background material about TVs and home theater.
It’s about $50.
AVIA Professional is a seven-DVD set that (as the name
implies) is designed for professional calibrators (see the sec-
tion titled “Bringing in the pros” for more on this).
 Digital Video Essentials (DVE): Found online at
www.videoessentials.com, this is the definitive calibration
disc. It costs about $50. Of all the discs available, DVE has the
most tests and the most calibration settings.
One really cool thing about Video Essentials is the inclusion of
video footage that you can watch to see the results of your
adjustments with actual video, instead of just a test pattern.
THX DVD
If you don’t want to spend the money on a calibration disc, you can
get much of the functionality without spending an extra penny. Just
pick up a movie DVD with the THX Optimizer on board. Like the
commercial calibration discs, the Optimizer walks you through a
series of steps to adjust your display (and your audio system).
Any THX-certified DVD (there were 361 such titles as we wrote this
in the summer of 2004) includes the Optimizer.
To get all you can from the Optimizer, you need a blue filter. You
can get one from THX by filling out the order form online (there’s a
link on the front page of www.thx.com. All you need to pay is 2
bucks for shipping/handling.
High-definition D-VHS
The Video Essentials folks (www.videoessentials.com) have
responded to the HDTV market by coming up with D-VHS videocas-
settes that let you calibrate your HDTV with a true HDTV picture,
instead of an NTSC-quality DVD picture. These tapes are called
Digital Video Essentials — High Definition.
You need a D-VHS VCR to use one of these tapes!
Digital Video Essentials — High Definition is available in two resolu-
tions. Either costs about $90. Choose the version that’s closest to
your TV’s native resolution:
 If you have a direct view CRT or a CRT projection HDTV
system, you probably need the 1080i version.
 If your HDTV doesn’t have a CRT-based display, you probably
need the 720p version.

Bringing in the pros
The absolute best way to get your HDTV properly tuned up is to
hire a pro to come to your home and do a professional calibration.
Two things separate a professional calibration from the one you
perform for yourself at home:
 Training: Your calibration professional should have extensive
training and certification, along with a chunk of real-world
experience with finicky TVs (things you probably don’t have!).
 Equipment: Your calibrator will also have some expensive
equipment that can measure the color and brightness of
images on your TV screen — this gives a much more precise
calibration than using your eyeballs.
A professional calibration usually costs between $200 to $500,
depending on what type of display you have.
If you have a professional calibration done, make sure you choose
someone who has been certified and trained by the Imaging Science
Foundation or ISF. The ISF has trained (and continues to train)
thousands of home-theater dealers in the art of system calibration.
You can find a trained calibration professional near you by search-
ing on ISF’s Web site, at www.imagingscience.com.
Don’t call ISF directly to ask them to calibrate your system. They’d
know how, but that’s not what they do for a living. Their Web site
includes a searchable (by state) listing of the dealers they’ve
trained to perform this service.

T
hroughout HDTV For Dummies, we’ve talked about resolution
(the number of picture elements that make up a video signal).
Analog TV (NTSC) signals have a particular resolution, as do DVDs,
and the various types of VHS videocassettes (VHS, S-VHS and 
D-VHS). And that’s to say nothing about the ATSC digital-TV
standard, which has 18 (count ’em, 18) different resolutions.
HDTV hardware also has a resolution angle. All HDTVs have one
(or a couple) of preferred resolutions at which they will display TV
signals. Many HDTVs are what’s known as fixed-pixel displays —
they can show TV signals (no matter what resolution they are
recorded in) at a single resolution on-screen.
In this chapter, we explain how all these different resolutions of
software (TV programming) and hardware (HDTVs) work together.
We also explain the sophisticated devices that make this coopera-
tion happen. Finally, we talk about how you might choose a scaler
(you don’t have to — your HDTV will have one inside it already —
but some folks like to go above and beyond).
What the Heck’s a 
Video Processor?
Sometimes the stars align and everything just works. For example,
you may tune in to an HDTV broadcast of Law and Order: Special
Victims Unit (which is broadcast as a 1080i signal) with your Samsung

CRT HDTV (which displays HDTV signals in a 1080i mode). Well,
lucky you — the input resolution (the 1080i TV program) and the
display resolution (your 1080i CRT TV) match. All is well in the
world, and good TV is watched.
But what if you had a Sony Grand Wega LCD rear-projection TV?
Those big-screen beauties display HDTV at 720p, not at 1080i!
This TV displays HDTV at 720p because the LCD (like the plasma,
the DLP, and the LCoS) is a fixed-pixel display. In the case of the
Sony Grand Wega, the LCDs that make the display work (see
Chapter 22 for more info) have a resolution of 1386 x 788 pixels —
roughly equivalent to the 1080 x 720 of 720p HDTV.
Well what happens in this case (1080i signal into a 720p display) is
that a brainy bundle of chips and software called a scaler or video
processor gets involved. A scaler converts one resolution to
another, using various mathematical techniques to interpolate
what the video signal would look like at a different resolution.
Going up or going down?
If a scaler is converting a lower resolution to a higher one, the
process is called upconversion. The opposite process is called,
unsurprisingly, downconversion.
Sometimes downconversion is called down-resing because the reso-
lution is moved downward. This term is usually applied in a nega-
tive way — for example, when an onerous copy-protection system
downconverts an HDTV signal to standard-definition simply
because you don’t have the right copy-protection software on all
your components.
The main job of a video-processing system is to up- or downcon-
vert an incoming signal to a different resolution. There are two
main benefits of this process for a scaler working with your HDTV:
 Video signals are matched to the best display resolution for a
particular model of HDTV, regardless of the signal’s original
resolution.
 Standard-definition video signals are upconverted to a higher
resolution to look closer to HDTV than standard-definition.
Don’t buy anyone’s marketing spiel or sales pitch telling you that
his or her scaler will make any TV source into HDTV. Good scalers
can produce something very pleasing to the eye, which is close to
HDTV. But you can’t create something from nothing — real HDTV
Part II: Love at First Sight 
74

signals can have at least six times as many pixels as standard-
definition. In other words, in an upconverted video stream, five out
of every six pixels could be “made up” by the scaler. Even the best
scaler can’t create something as good as the original recording!
Video processors may also perform other tasks — such as 3:2 pull-
down processing (discussed in Chapter 21), which lets you watch
material based on 24-frame-per-second film properly on a 30- or 60-
frame-per-second HDTV display.
De-interlacing your video
The simplest video processors — which actually pre-date HDTV —
are those devices known as line doublers. Line doublers have been
used in high-end home theaters for years, in conjunction with
fancy (and expensive) front-projection systems.
Line doublers are also sometimes called deinterlacers.
The job of a line doubler is pretty simple — it scales the video by
converting an analog (480i) video signal into a progressive scan
(480p). By doing this simple trick (effectively a doubling of the
scan lines in a CRT TV — hence the name), a line doubler greatly
smooths out the picture, and reduces the subtle flicker you nor-
mally get from an interlaced picture.
A line doubler works by saving up both of the fields in an analog 
TV signal frame, and displaying them twice in a 1⁄30-second time
slice. (In analog TV, half of the picture is transmitted every 1⁄60
of a second, which is a field; the whole image is called a frame.
Chapter 21 covers fields and frames.)
You also hear about devices call line quadruplers, which not only
deinterlace video, but also interpolate in between the lines, to
create a picture that’s the equivalent of 960p (twice the resolution
of 480p). Line quadruplers are really high-end devices for use with
the most expensive ($40,000 and up) CRT front-projection HDTVs.
Getting fancy with scaling
The advent of fixed-pixel HDTV displays — plasmas, LCDs, DLPs
and LCoS — created a need for something beyond just a simple
line doubler (not that a line doubler is all that simple!). Many fixed-
pixel displays actually have rather funky native resolutions that
require all incoming video signals to be scaled.
Chapter 6: Magic Black Boxes 75

For example, that Sony Grand Wega TV we used as an example ear-
lier doesn’t have a native resolution of exactly 720p (1280 x 720
pixels); it actually has a resolution of 1386 x 788: Every signal, even
720p signals, must be converted to the higher resolution!
This demand has led to the development of scalers that convert
any incoming video signal (well, any standard incoming video
signal) into a specified output resolution.
Choosing Scalers
We don’t want to make you think about scalers too much. If your
HDTV needs a scaler to operate (and most need at least a deinter-
lacer/line doubler), then it already has one built in.
Let’s repeat that: If your HDTV needs a scaler, that scaler should be
in there already. You don’t need to spend even more money!
There are, however, some limitations to internal scalers.
Sometimes an external scaler offers advantages. Here are three sce-
narios that may call for an external scaler:
 Some HDTVs have internal scalers that accept signals of only
certain resolutions. For example, some HDTVs may accept
only 480i, 480p and 1080i inputs. If your external HDTV tuner
puts out only a 720p signal (admittedly rare), you’re out of
luck.
 Some HDTVs (CRT tube-based TVs, either direct-view or pro-
jection systems, usually) contain an internal scanner that
deinterlaces analog video sources (that is, converts 480i to
480p) but doesn’t upconvert analog signals to a higher resolu-
tion. There’s nothing wrong with this — 480p will probably
look better than analog’s ever looked! — but the picture won’t
be using the full capacity of your HDTV.
 You may just be a person who wants the best! The scalers
built into most HDTVs are good enough for most owners. But,
if you demand those last few percentage points of picture per-
fection from your system, you may want a fancier external
scaler.
Just to give you an idea of what an external scaler is all about, we
mention a popular (and well-reviewed) model: the DVDO iScan HD.
This scaler (which retails for $1,499) can convert any incoming
video signal to any resolution between 480p and 1080p (yes, we
Part II: Love at First Sight 
76

said, 1080p — that is one of the 18 ATSC standards, but it isn’t com-
monly used because almost no HDTVs can display that high a reso-
lution). And, if your display has a funky native resolution, that’s no
problem — the iScan HD can be programmed for custom resolu-
tions, too!
The iScan HD also does a bunch of other cool stuff, too:
 It acts as a video-switching hub, so you can run all of your
source devices through it. (See Chapter 19 for more on video
switching.)
 It switches and routes analog and digital audio signals as well.
 It has a special circuit “Precision AV LipSync” that makes sure
your video and audio are perfectly matched up — even if the
original broadcast isn’t! No more movies that look like poorly
dubbed Kung Fu flicks.
 It includes a computer interface, so you can download soft-
ware upgrades over the Internet to keep your iScan HD up to
date.

f you haven’t ﬁgured it out yet, we’re kind of obsessed.
See, we like to just sit and look at A/V equipment even
when it’s turned off. We just love looking at turned-off
HDTVs, especially the backs where all the many ports and
connectors are located. 
Normal people, like you, probably want to actually look at
an HDTV program, not an inert HDTV. OK, so we can’t fault
you there. A couple of years ago, however, we would have
shaken our heads sadly and told you there were none to be
found. Today, however, there’s an ever-increasing amount
of HDTV programming available — programming that will
elicit the appropriate oohs and ahhs from people visiting
your house.
In this part, we expose you to various ways you can get
high-deﬁnition content onto your HDTV. We start with a
general look at the signals available from the over-the-air
broadcasters, cable companies, and satellite companies.
We reveal why not all signals look the same from these
sources — even if they’re broadcasting the same movie.
Different sources have different compression and trans-
mission capabilities. They all look great. But some will
look greater than others.
Then we drill down on each of the three major originators of
HDTV signals, starting with the over-the-air broadcasters.
We can thank the FCC for prodding the TV stations in the
direction of HDTV, but really thank the HDTV manufacturers
for making displays inexpensive enough to drive HDTVs into
lots of homes — giving the TV stations rationale to move
to more digital programming. We tell you probably more
than you want to know about HDTV antennae, and how to
optimize your connections to the OTA (over-the-air) folks.
Then we do the same with the cable industry, looking
at how the cable ﬁrms are positioning to deliver high-
deﬁnition cable programming. We tell you about the way
HDTV signals are encoded and decoded, and the role of
your analog and digital set top boxes. We also tell you
about the new CableCARD capability that you are going
to start seeing in HDTV devices.
We wrap up the HDTV programming discussion with a look
at satellite programming ﬁrms and what they can offer. In
addition to talking about DirecTV and DISH (the two big
guys), we also explore the latest player in satellite-based
programming, VOOM. We walk you through what’s available,
how to upgrade to HD satellite service if you’re already a
customer, and even how to combine satellite service with
Internet access. Whew, that’s a lot! Aren’t you glad you
came here ﬁrst!

n the vein of “all dressed up and nowhere to go,” HDTVs would
be no good without content to show on them — native, high-
definition content, that is. Hollywood has done its usual: “If there’s
a place to put the content, we’ll come out with it.” And the manufac-
turers have said, “If you make the content, we’ll build the systems.”
Lucky for us, DVDs and higher-definition camcorders have created a
lot of reasons to want higher-resolution TVs, and that has prompted
the broadcasters to follow suit with their own HDTV content.
Broadcast TV stations, for example, are heeding the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) and beginning HDTV broadcasts.
Cable companies are offering at least some HDTV programming
(and usually not just “some” programming but “a lot”) in most of
their major markets. And satellite providers are offering HDTV to
pretty much the entire United States — so almost no one is outside
the “footprint” of HDTV these days.
In this chapter, we take a high-level look at who’s offering HDTV,
what it takes to get the service, and what kind of HDTV content you
can get from the different providers. That last item can be important
to know if, for example, you bought your HDTV specifically to watch
The Final Four (we predict a big Duke run next year!) or for seeing
Tony and Carmela in the utmost detail on The Sopranos.

In the three chapters that follow in this part of the book, we get
into a lot more detail about broadcast, cable, and satellite HDTV —
the programming, its availability, and the equipment requirements.
Consider those discussions in this chapter a quick, up-front
primer — move forward in the book when you’re looking for the
details.
Looking at Who Has HDTV
We’re in the midst of HDTV-mania. If you happened to have a dead
cat handy (and no, we’re not cat haters! We love cats, and don’t
want them dead, unless they’ve been very, very bad kitties), you
wouldn’t be able to swing it very far before you hit an ad for HDTV
sets, HDTV programming, HDTV services from a cable company,
or something HDTV.
This situation makes us happy. We’ve been going to the CES (the
Consumer Electronics Show — the biggest HDTV-related trade show
there is) every year for a long time. And every year we hear, “This
year, this year, is the Year of HDTV!” Well, we’ve finally reached that
point — in what must be the fifth or sixth official “Year of HDTV”
(YOH for short). Thank goodness.
The reason we know that it’s now YOH is the sheer volume of HDTV
programming that’s become available from different sources, and
the profusion of ways the average person can now access that
programming.
Broadcasters
One group of TV providers who have begun to really see the light
is the broadcast networks (such as ABC and CBS) and local affiliate
stations that broadcast the network content over the airwaves.
This hasn’t happened purely because the broadcast folks are being
good TV citizens. It’s because the FCC has mandated a transition
from analog to digital TV. Eventually, all of these broadcasters will
need to turn off their analog signals and send out DTV broadcasts
(note that we said DTV, not HDTV — lower-resolution 480p or even
480i signals can be broadcast).
It’s not all pressure from the FCC, however, that is driving this.
Broadcast networks are increasingly competing with what we’ll call
cable networks — though it’s a bit of a misnomer, we use this term
to describe networks you can only get via cable or satellite (such
as HBO or TNT). Broadcasting in HDTV — especially for big-ticket
Part III: HDTV Channels 
82

items like prime-time shows and major-league sporting events —
gives the broadcast networks a leg up on cable networks (many of
which are still stuck in Analog TV Land).
Four of the five major broadcast networks (that would be ABC,
CBS, NBC, Fox and the WB) are broadcasting at least some HDTV
content. As we write, Fox is the lone holdout, but it promises HDTV
by the time this book hits the shelves.
The best thing about broadcast network HDTV (often called OTA,
or over-the-air) is that it’s free. Free as in free beer. No cost to you
(except maybe having to watch some bad ads). All you need is an
HDTV with a built-in or external tuner, and an antenna. In Chapter 8
we give you some more detail on this.
Cable and satellite networks
The cable networks (the networks you can’t get with a rabbit-ear
antenna) have not been sitting around idly while broadcast net-
works began to send out this free HDTV to their viewers. In fact,
many cable networks have developed and launched their own
high-definition channels — ranging from movie channels (such as
HBO or Showtime High Def) to sports channels like ESPN-HD.
The biggest problem that cable networks have had is finding cable
or satellite networks to carry these channels to customers. To
understand why, skip ahead to the section titled “All HDTV Signals
Are Not Equal.” Go ahead — we’ll wait right here for a moment.
Basically (in case you didn’t skip ahead), cable and satellite sys-
tems have a limited amount of bandwidth (or slots for TV channels)
within their broadcast systems. HDTV uses five to eight times as
much bandwidth per channel as does analog TV — or to reverse
that, you can fit five to eight analog TV channels in the slot occu-
pied by one HDTV channel. So it’s taken a bit of time for cable and
satellite companies to begin to show interest in carrying HDTV
channels — they thought they could make more money off eight
analog channels of fly-fishing and underwater basket-weaving than
they could from one HDTV broadcast of The Final Four.
The good news is that both groups of TV providers have begun to
carry at least a handful of HDTV stations — often more. To get into
these HDTV cable signals, you need the following:
 An HDTV service contract with your cable or satellite com-
pany. Unlike broadcast, this isn’t free — you’ve got to pay
the piper.
Chapter 7: Who’s Showing HDTV? 83

 An HDTV satellite receiver or set-top box (for cable).
In Chapter 9 we discuss digital-cable-ready TVs and
CableCARDs, just now hitting the market, which will let
you skip the set-top box.
Specialized HDTV stations
Existing broadcast and cable networks aren’t the only ones to real-
ize the potential of HDTV. A small flurry of new networks specifi-
cally delivers HDTV channels to cable and satellite providers.
A good example of this is HDNet (www.hd.net), the brainchild of
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. HDNet was launched with the
sole purpose of providing a range of original programming (news,
sports, and series) — along with licensed programming from other
studios (like Andy Richter’s show!) — all in full 1080i HDTV. Danny
is particularly interested in HDNet’s show “Bikini Destinations”
(Pat made that up!). You can get HDNet’s two channels on both of
the major satellite networks, as well as a growing number of cable
provider’s networks.
HDNet was the first, but not the last high-def-only network. For
example, a cable-only network (owned by a consortium of cable
companies) called INHD (www.inhd.com) provides two channels
with a variety of original and licensed programming of sports,
movies and other content (hey, that sounds familiar, huh?).
Making Your Choice
We have some good news and some bad news. The good news is,
you probably have a choice of where you get your HDTV content.
The bad news is — well, you have to choose. This means, if you’re
like us, hours of research and poring over Web sites, trying to
figure out what works best to fit your HDTV needs.
Well, there isn’t a magic bullet for you here in HDTV For Dummies.
Because HDTV availability is highly dependent upon exactly where
you live (we mean right down to the street address — it can differ
even within neighborhoods), we can’t give anything but the most
general advice.
There’s nothing wrong with mixing and matching amongst these
different sources. For example, if you want local HDTV content
along with your satellite-TV source, you need to hook up an
antenna to your dish and pick up the OTA broadcasts — luckily,
most HDTV satellite receivers have a built-in OTA HDTV tuner, so
you don’t need extra equipment (beyond the antenna).
Part III: HDTV Channels 
84

So, given that wishy-washy disclaimer (sorry, but it’s true!), here’s
Pat and Danny’s official advice:
1. Figure out what’s even available. In each of the following
three chapters, we give you some pointers to Web sites and
other resources that will help you find out what you can
get in your house.
2. Look at your budget. Keep in mind the fact that “free”
OTA HDTV may not be free if you have an “HDTV-ready”
system, and need to spend hundreds of dollars on an exter-
nal HDTV tuner. Cable, on the other hand, might include a
monthly fee, but doesn’t require any “up-front” expenses
for tuners or set-top boxes. Many cable companies give
you local HDTV channels free for the price of the set-top-
box rental ($10/month or less, typically). Satellite may
have lower monthly fees than cable, but also requires an
up-front purchase of the receiver.
3. Examine closely the channel lineups available to you.
Remember that quantity and quality are two different
things. For example, the new HDTV satellite company Voom
(www.voom.com, discussed in Chapter 10) offers 35 HDTV
channels — more than anyone else — but you may not be
interested in watching all of them. For example (and this is
a totally made-up example, so please don’t sue us, Voom,
because we love you!), do you really want to spend your
HDTV viewing time watching some nature special on the
mating habits of frogs? Look for the channels you love.
4. Consider the performance. In the following section “All
HDTV Signals Are Not Equal,” we discuss some of the ways
that various TV providers throttle back their HDTV signals
to save bandwidth on their networks.
In the end, you may find something that we haven’t mentioned, or
something less than coldly rational and logical (Mr. Spock to the
bridge!) that makes you decide on an HDTV provider. For example,
for Pat (actually, for his wife, who is a huge baseball fan) it was a
no-brainer — he wanted satellite, but then his local cable company
started broadcasting 100+ San Diego Padres games in HDTV each
year. Case closed — cable it is for Pat.
All HDTV Signals Are Not Equal
Not all HDTV signals are equal across all providers. When the
signal is sent from its source to you, it is usually compressed to
cut costs and bandwidth requirements. How much the signal is
compressed — and what digital encoding scheme is used — 
determines a lot about what you see on your HDTV.
Chapter 7: Who’s Showing HDTV? 85

MPEG-2 is the standard used by digital-TV broadcasters today to
compress, encode, and then ultimately decode the TV programs.
This is necessary because there is not an unlimited amount of
space available on the cable, satellite, and broadcast-TV networks
for transmitting these signals. (See Table 7-1, “Who Has the Most
Room for HDTV?”)

So suppose an over-the-air broadcast TV signal starts out its life at
the central network hub as a 1920-by-1080i signal. This signal can
first be encoded for broadcast at a rate of around 995 Mbps. By the
time it is sent to you over the air, it’s compressed to a mere
18Mbps signal. That’s a lot of compression, but the picture still
looks great.
If the station chooses to compress that signal a little more, say
down to 13 or 14 Mbps to make room for other channels in the
same signal, then the compression is even greater. We can tell you
that the difference between an 18Mbps and a 14Mbps signal is
indeed noticeable, especially when the programming contains a lot
of motion. And don’t forget, once the signal enters your HDTV set,
it will probably encounter another round of downward resolution
as it tries to put the original 1080i image on, say, a 720p TV set.
Satellite providers also have similar compression challenges.
Transponder space (the satellite-located transmission systems) is
so expensive that compression is required for everything. Popular
channels are typically encoded at 15 Mbps or more before they
go to the satellite operators. Depending on the available satellite
bandwidth (could be 24 MHz or 36 MHz, which yields 27 Mbps
and 40.44 Mbps of bandwidth respectively), satellite operators
can compress these 15Mbps signals down to 13.5 Mbps, so they
can cram two or three HDTV streams on these satellite signals,
respectively.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
86

Cable operators have about the same options with the two major
digital-cable modulation schemes in use today — 64QAM, which
offers a max bandwidth of 27.7 Mbps, and 256QAM, which has 38.8
Mbps available. They can compress the signals further, and cram
more channels into each signal, or they can offer higher-quality sig-
nals as a way of competing better in the market. After all, the
38.8Mbps rate of the cable companies is twice the bandwidth per
signal compared to the 19.4Mbps data rate of the broadcast TV
folks — so they can send two HDTV streams for each single HDTV
stream that the over-the-air stations can send.
Cable companies have to deal with the sheer number of places
where the signals are converted from digital to analog and back.
Signals start out as digital, but may be converted to analog com-
posite by the distributor. The signal is converted to a digital com-
posite (that is, component) signal by the recipient cable operator.
Then, as it’s fed into the TV display unit, the signal is converted to
one of several types of video signal: analog component, S-video, or
composite. TVs that take in digital signals via digital interfaces can
reduce some of this conversion — as can improvements in signal
distribution between the broadcasters and the operators.
So, as complicated as this is, what’s it all mean for the average
buyer? Here’s how we can net it out for you:
 Not all HDTV signals are going to be the same. It depends on
how the broadcasters compress the signals for the stations
that you want to watch. Channels with a lot of action (like
sports) tend to get more bandwidth; channels with a lot of
static pixels — like the Home Shopping Network or any cook-
ing channel — can survive more compression.
 If you plan on watching a few channels a lot, do some
research. Your ultimate goal would be to find out how much
bandwidth these channels are using. You can’t (easily) meas-
ure this yourself (and it’s about impossible without installing
the service, if you’re using cable or satellite), but try to find a
local bulletin board or newsgroup online to see what the local
HDTV nerds have to say. For example, Pat spends a lot of time
on http://hdtv.forsandiego.com/, reading about experi-
ences with local HDTV options. You’ll find enthusiastic, smart
folks who have the tools and the know-how to examine HDTV
bit streams, measure them, and come out with concrete evalu-
ations. Also, watch your neighbors’ TVs now and then, and
compare what you can — if it looks different, it probably is.
Chapter 7: Who’s Showing HDTV? 87

Part III: HDTV Channels 
88
Who’s required to do what?
Your over-the-air digital TV broadcaster only has 6 MHz (19.39 Mbps) of bandwidth
over which it can send its TV signals. It can fill this in anyway it chooses, combin-
ing such broadcasts as HDTV, SDTV, weather images, and even FM broadcasts onto
one bandwidth stream. The FCC, through its DTV rules, has said broadcasters must
transmit one standard-definition digital-TV signal — 480i — and has not said any-
thing about requiring HDTV.
So TV stations have to make some economic decisions about how best to use that
signal. In one chunk of 6MHz bandwidth, a broadcaster could send one full-quality,
720p 60-frame-per-second (fps) HDTV program; or, two shows, one (say) for a 720p
or 1080i HDTV show and one 480i SDTV show, both at 30 fps; or, four 480i SDTV 30
fps shows. How a station mixes and matches its signals depends as much on its
technology as its positioning in the market.

n most ways, HDTV is an amazing leap into the future. It’s digi-
tal! It’s high-definition! It’s shiny and new! It’s expensive!
But HDTV does have one aspect that brings us all back to the
olden days of black-and-white TVs — the antenna has reappeared!
And with the antenna comes all the fun of Dad standing on one foot
and twisting the rabbit ears just so to bring in that hard-to-tune
channel.
Okay, so it’s not that bad (most of the time), but it can be challeng-
ing to tune into over-the-air (OTA) broadcast TV. We’re not going to
kid you here — cable-TV or satellite setups are much easier to use
than an antenna.
But OTA HDTV is free. FREE! And nearly every household in
America is in range of at least one of these free HDTV stations 
(99 percent of homes, according to some sources).
In this chapter, we discuss how you can figure out what OTA HDTV
signals are available in your location (there are some great online
tools!). Then we help you pick out the equipment you need (an
antenna and a tuner), and finally we tell you how to get it all set up.

Finding Local HD Broadcasts
Before you do anything else, do your homework. In the case of OTA
HDTV, this involves simply spending a little bit of time online look-
ing for broadcast HDTV channels. Now you don’t have to do this
research online, but if you have Internet access, that’s the best way
to do so.
If you don’t have Internet access, talk to the retailers from whom
you’re buying your HDTV — they probably have firsthand knowl-
edge (or at least anecdotal information) about local HDTV signal
availability. They may also have a kiosk that provides access to 
the same online information we’re going to talk about shortly.
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is the huge (and
hugely influential) trade organization that includes just about every
HDTV manufacturer in the world. So it has a vested interest in get-
ting people to buy HDTVs. This interest is sometimes manifested as
lobbying efforts with the FCC, or efforts to develop marketing and
industry. It also pops its head up in the form direct-to-the-consumer
education efforts.
In the case of HDTV, the CEA had the brilliant idea (we’re not 
being facetious, it really was brilliant!) of providing an extremely
easy-to-use HDTV “signal finder.” In conjunction, with a company
called Decisionmark, the CEA has created this online system
(called TitanTV) that lets you enter your address information,
press a button, and come out the other side with a nice listing of
all your HDTV-channel choices.
Just go to www.titantv.com and follow the on-screen instruc-
tions. You can also access TitanTV at many HDTV retailers, and
come home with a printout of your available stations.
Not only does TitanTV find OTA stations for you, it also comes up
with the cable and satellite stations available to you. You can do a
quick comparison and see what best meets your needs.
The CEA and Decisionmark have also teamed up to provide you with
another way to view a listing of local HDTV broadcasters with their
AntennaWeb.org system, which we discuss later in this chapter, in
the section titled “Choosing the right antenna.” AntennaWeb.org is
basically the same underlying database, optimized to help you
choose an antenna — TitanTV is designed to help you see what
shows are being broadcast.

Tuning In
HDTV breaks the old TV paradigm in many ways. One big differ-
ence is that not all HDTVs have a built-in TV tuner. Back in the
olden days of NTSC and analog TV, this was quite rare — a few
high-end TVs were “monitors” and required an external tuner, but
they were definitely in the minority.
With HDTV and OTA HDTV broadcasts, the situation has been
reversed — at least for the time being (more on that soon). Many
sets sold as HDTVs today are HDTV-ready, but don’t have any elec-
tronics inside them that can pick up an OTA HDTV broadcast (or any
ATSC broadcast, whether high-definition or standard-definition —
and if you have no idea what we’re saying right now, check out
Chapter 1 for a definition of ATSC and NTSC).
The government is requiring TV manufacturers to include built-in
tuners that can pick up OTA HDTV, starting with bigger (36+-inch)
TVs in 2005. Soon this lack of tuners won’t be a problem.
Building on a built-in tuner
If you have an HDTV with a built-in ATSC tuner, you’re just about all
set. All you need to do is find the appropriate antenna (see the fol-
lowing section “Antennas A to Z”), make the connections, and go.
It’s really that simple — or at least it can be.
Just follow the instructions in your HDTV’s manual for tuning in
the HDTV stations — we can’t help you there, since each HDTV 
on-screen setup process is different.
Some HDTVs with built-in ATSC tuners also have special tuners that
can decode QAM-encoded HDTV signals. QAM is the system used 
by most cable-TV networks. This means you may be able to pick up
your local broadcast stations by just plugging in your cable TV con-
nection. Note that this is different from the DCR (digital-cable-ready)
systems we discuss in Chapter 9. And no, this has nothing to do with
using an OTA antenna, but we thought it was a nice morsel of infor-
mation to know in case you’re ever asked this question at a neigh-
borhood BBQ.
Adding on a tuner
If you own an HDTV, chances are good that you won’t have that
built-in ATSC tuner we mentioned in the previous section. Your
Chapter 8: Something’s in the Air 91

HDTV probably has an NTSC tuner — which can pick up analog
broadcasts — but it probably is only HDTV-ready, so you need to
pick up an HDTV tuner box that you can connect between your
antenna feed and your HDTV.
The biggest problem with HDTV tuners (whether they’re in your
TV, or external) has traditionally been an economic one. They are
(or at least were) darned expensive. Even a year or two ago, it was
common to see HDTV tuners that cost $1,000 or more (this effec-
tively explains why so many HDTVs were sold as HDTV-ready: Not
everyone with an HDTV uses the OTA tuner, so why drive the cost
of an already-expensive HDTV through the roof?).
The good news is that prices have come down. Way down. As we
write (summer of 2004), you can buy a name brand (Samsung, in
this case) HDTV tuner for about $350. That’s less than six months’
worth of double espressos at Pat’s favorite café! And the prices are
going nowhere but down.
When you’re choosing an HDTV tuner, here are just a few things
to consider:
 Digital outputs: If it’s at all possible, you should use a digital
cable connection between your tuner and your HDTV —
either DVI-D or HDMI (see Chapter 3) is by far the most
common (1394/FireWire used to be common, but it’s rare
these days). Make sure that the outputs of your tuner match
the inputs of your HDTV.
The newer HDMI system is backward-compatible with DVI-D
with the use of a simple adapter. So you can mix and match
DVI-D and HDMI freely.
If your HDTV tuner’s DVI-D or HDMI output uses the HDCP
copy-protection scheme, make sure the DVI-D or HDMI input
on your HDTV does, too. Otherwise the system may down-res
the signal, giving you a non-HDTV picture.
 Analog outputs: While you’ll want to use your digital outputs,
if possible, it’s handy to have a full set of analog outputs on
the HDTV tuner, for making connections to other devices
(such as a DVR).
 Output resolution: Most HDTV tuners can be adjusted to
match the best resolution for your HDTV. Some HDTVs require
a specific signal resolution (such as 1080i); if yours does, make
sure your tuner can give you output at that resolution.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
92

Chapter 8: Something’s in the Air 93
 Satellite capability: Some OTA HDTV tuners also include satel-
lite-TV receivers (for services like DirecTV or DISH Network,
see Chapter 10). Well, the satellite companies would flip it
around and say their receivers include OTA tuners. Either way,
this can be handy if you’re using a satellite service for premium
HDTV channels (like ESPN-HD and HBO) and using an antenna
to pick up local HDTV channels.
The FCC is requiring TV manufacturers to begin including built-in
ATSC tuners in their TVs, as part of the overall industry transition
to digital TV. By the middle of 2005, all TVs larger than 36 inches
will require an on-board ATSC tuner — over time, this requirement
will filter down to smaller TVs, and even to devices like VCRs
(which have their own NTSC tuners these days).
Antennas A to Z
The other half of the OTA HDTV equation is the antenna. Yep (just
as we said at the beginning of the chapter), the rabbit ears are
back. Well, you probably won’t want to bring back some of those
unwieldy old antennas of years past, because the TV antenna has
gotten in shape for the new millennium.
Choosing the right antenna
You probably could use those old rabbit ears — there’s nothing
that incredibly unique about picking up HDTV broadcasts — but
tuning them in (which is what the HDTV tuner does) is a complex
process. Luckily, there are a lot of great new antennas on the
market that work particularly well with HDTV broadcasts.
Understanding antenna features
There are a few features of an antenna to consider:
 Location: Inside the house or outside? Well . . . 
• Outdoor antennas work better, but they also require
work, space, and access outside your home. 
• Indoor antennas may work well enough for you if you’re
close enough to the transmission towers.
 Direction: Where to point the thing? Look here . . .
• Directional antennas can be aimed toward a specific
point (or within in a certain angular vector).

Directional antennas usually are better at picking up dis-
tant signals, and can reduce multipath distortion (what
happens when the signal bounces off buildings and
other structures — you receive the signal multiple
times).
• Multidirectional antennas pick up signals coming from —
you guessed it — multiple directions.
Multidirectional antennas can be mounted just about
anywhere, and pick up signals from widely dispersed
transmission towers.
 Amplification: Some antennas have a built-in amplifier that
increases the strength of weak broadcast signals before they
get to your tuner.
Amplification is generally a good thing, unless you are close 
to the broadcast antenna — you don’t want to overamplify a
signal.
Making the right choice
It’s really difficult for even a technically savvy person to determine
which antenna is right for a particular home — there’s just a
swarm of variables to figure out.
That’s why we’re so happy that the CEA and Decisionmark (the
folks we mentioned back in the first part of this chapter) have
come up with the AntennaWeb.org system (that is also the URL:
http://antennaweb.org).
AntennaWeb.org is a Web-based database that “knows” your HDTV
situation from your address, the location of HDTV broadcast anten-
nas near you, and some sophisticated software that models HDTV
signal propagation in your area (by looking at various geographical
and demographic data — such as the terrain and the presence of
high-rise buildings). Just go to the Web site, enter your address,
answer a few questions about your surroundings and click the
Submit button.
Up will come up a result like the page shown in Figure 8-1. The
AntennaWeb.org system uses a graphical representation (a pie
chart/color-code system) called the antenna mark to identify seven
different antenna types with unique different colors and coverage
“zones.” The pie chart is sort of like a Trivial Pursuit game piece —
the more slices of the pie you have, the better. The coverage zones
represent the footprint of the antenna based on its designs and
use. All the HDTV broadcasts in your area that you can at least the-
oretically pick up will be shown (as well as the analog stations),
and each will be color-coded.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
94

To find the right antenna for you, simply note the color code for
the stations you want to pick up, and go shopping for an antenna
that matches that color.
Please note how they fill in the antenna-mark pie chart — clock-
wise, starting with the yellow around to the pink. Most antennas
work for all the “lesser” color codes. It’s common to find high-
power directional antennas that also work fine as short-to-medium-
range multidirectional antennas. So if your listed signal sources
require antennae coded yellow and green (the second color after
yellow in the scheme), you can buy a green-code antenna — it will
also pick up the yellow-coded broadcast signals.
Installing your HDTV antenna
When you’ve picked out your HDTV antenna, there’s the simple
matter of installing it. If you’ve selected an outdoor antenna (our
recommendation for most users), you need to mount it.
First of all, follow the directions included with the antenna — par-
ticularly any safety directions regarding such installation proce-
dures as grounding and wiring. We want you to be safe, and not to
burn your house to the ground for the sake of HDTV (not even we
are that fanatical about HDTV).
Figure 8-1: Choosing an antenna at AntennaWeb.org.
Chapter 8: Something’s in the Air 95

If you’ve chosen a directional antenna, part of the mounting
process will be aiming the antenna. The AntennaWeb.org results
page actually includes (as you may have noticed in Figure 8-1) a
compass bearing from your house to the antenna towers. So you
can pull out your handy-dandy Boy or Girl Scout compass and do
some aiming.
You can also use a signal-strength meter — many HDTVs or HDTV
tuners have one built in — to determine how small adjustments in
the antenna’s position or direction affect your channels. Here’s
where it’s handy to have a set of FRS (Family Radio Service) walkie-
talkies, so you can communicate with the person in the living room
who’s viewing the meter while you’re on the roof!
Tuning into HDTV stations is a truly digital experience — either it
works or it doesn’t. For the most part, there’s none of the fuzzy,
half-visible pictures that you might remember from the old antenna
days of analog TV. With the proper antenna, properly aimed, you
might pick up all your local channels right away.
Or you might not — HDTV broadcasts are still a work-in-progress
in many parts of the country. Sometimes it can be a hit-or-miss
proposition — stations that should work don’t, or only work part of
the time.
This situation is getting better every day, as broadcasters fine-tune
their systems, and as HDTV tuners become more sophisticated
and adept at tuning in stations. As HDTV becomes more popular,
many broadcasters are also turning up the power on their trans-
mitters (so far they’ve been keeping the broadcast power down to
save money!).

 Going analog
 Skipping the box altogether
M
ost Americans get their TV (NTSC or ATSC) from their local
cable company — something on the order of two-thirds of
all households subscribe to cable-TV services. Cable companies
(generally referred to as MSOs or multiple-system operators, as most
cable companies own and operate cable systems in dozens — or
hundreds — of different cities) have been extremely aggressive
over the past ten years, rolling out new services like digital cable,
cable modems, voice services (cable telephony), and Video on
Demand (VoD).
Cable companies have, however, taken their sweet time in the HDTV
realm — many cable companies decided to drag their feet (for vari-
ous technical and business reasons) when it came to offering HDTV
to their customers. Luckily, the threat of HDTV from satellite — com-
bined with technical advances and some regulatory agreements —
has given cable TV providers a big burst of HDTV energy. Now we’re
even seeing ads from our local cable companies bragging about how
they have more local HDTV than any satellite company.
In this chapter, we give you the basics on how to get HDTV from
your cable company, and what to expect when you do. We also tell
you about some of the other services you can get from your cable
company (things like digital cable, which are actually the majority
of channels available on your HDTV, even though they aren’t HDTV
themselves). Finally, we talk about an exciting new trend — a new
system of TVs and “smart cards” that let you forgo the cable box
and plug directly into the cable coming out of your wall.

High-Definition Cable
The crème de la crème of cable services is HDTV over cable, and
it’s nearly everywhere. Cable companies are now offering HDTV
services in 83 of the 100 largest markets in the U.S., according to
the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, or NCTA
(www.ncta.com), the largest industry group of cable operators.
Getting on the QAM bandwagon
The biggest difference between HDTV signals on a cable system
and those broadcast over the air (see Chapter 8) revolves around
the system used to modulate an HDTV signal for transmission as
radio-frequency signals across the cable system.
Broadcast HDTV uses a system called 8-VSB (vestigial sideband),
while cable usually uses a system called QAM (quadrature ampli-
tude modulation). What’s the difference? Well the technical specs
are for the engineers — what’s important to HDTV viewers is that
you need a different kind of HDTV tuner to receive QAM signals
than you do to receive 8-VSB (though many newer TVs are now
including a tuner that can tune into both types of signals).
For most people, HDTV cable service will come through an HDTV
set-top box (or cable box) that has a built-in QAM tuner.
Encrypting and decrypting
The other big difference between broadcast and cable HDTV con-
cerns encryption and “premium” cable channels. Broadcast HDTV
channels — over-the-air broadcasts that you pick up with an
antenna — are free for the picking (up). If you receive the channel,
you can watch it.
Many cable TV HDTV channels, on the other hand, are considered
premium or for-pay content — you have to pay extra every month
to receive them. Because of this arrangement, most cable systems
use an encryption system that scrambles the signal (using an
encryption algorithm or formula). This means that even if you have
a QAM tuner (whether built into your HDTV or attached to it), you
won’t be able to watch these programs without some hardware to
decode the encryption (in English translated from Geekese, that’s
unscramble the picture).
Part III: HDTV Channels 
98

In some cable systems, the local broadcast HDTV channels are
transmitted across the cable system unencrypted — if you have
the appropriate tuner, you can view these channels without some
sort of extra decryption hardware.
While a very big exception to this rule is starting to hit the market,
the current situation for most cable HDTV viewers is this: You need
a set-top box from your cable company to view HDTV. This set-top
box handles the QAM tuner duty, connects to your cable company
to authorize you as a paying customer, and does the decryption
and unscrambling of any premium channels. Figure 9-1 shows a
typical HDTV cable set-top box.
Figure 9-1: Pace’s DC-551 HD is the kind of set-top box your cable 
company may provide.
Pricing for HDTV set-top boxes varies widely by cable company.
Some may charge you a monthly rental for the set-top box, but
nothing for your HDTV channels. Others may not charge for the
box rental, but then charge you on a per-channel or package basis
for HDTV channels — others may have a combination of these two
approaches. In many cases, you’re required to get the digital-cable
packages in order to get HDTV channels beyond ABC, CBS and
NBC. (Frankly, it’s a mystery to us what your cable company offers,
pricewise, so check out its Web site.)
Your HDTV cable box will typically also control and enable all the
cool (but non-HDTV) digital cable functions that you’ll want to use
on your HDTV — things like VoD and on-screen program guides.
We are writing this just as a midsummer 2004 deadline is looming
that requires cable companies to provide services to customers
without a set-top box. See the section at the end of this chapter
titled “Going Boxless” for more details on this new development.
Chapter 9: The Cable Guy 99

Digital Cable
The next notch down (picturewise) from cable HDTV is digital
cable. This name has been the source of almost boundless confu-
sion among many smart people we know — simply because the
whole “digital” thing gets people to thinking of DTV — and once
you have DTV in your head, well then, HDTV follows.
So let’s get this out of the way right away. Repeat after us: “Digital
cable is NOT HDTV, digital cable is NOT HDTV . . .”
Defining digital
There, we got it out of our systems (and hopefully yours). Now, we
should hasten to add that in some places, HDTV channels may be
part of (or an optional component of) a digital-cable “package.” But
that’s just marketing.
Digital cable itself means two things:
 Digital transmission and compression: Standard-definition
NTSC analog-TV channels are put through a digital wringer
and come out the far end as digital channels (MPEG-2, typi-
cally, if you care to know the tech stuff) that take up less
space on the cable system (in other words, you can cram
more of them onto the cable system, so you can get the mythi-
cal 500 channels). These digital channels are then digitally
transmitted using a QAM system.
 Two-way communications: Digital cable utilizes two-way com-
munications over the cable system (the set-top box can send
data “upstream” from your home to the cable office). Such
two way communication allows more sophisticated services
like VoD to work — and that’s why most cable companies
began offering both digital cable and cable modems (which
use the same upstream infrastructure) at around the same
time.
Getting the benefits
So what does digital cable offer you (and your HDTV)? A lot 
actually (though, to repeat ourselves, HDTV isn’t part of what’s
offered):
 More channels: Compressing each channel digitally allows
more channels to be sent to your HDTV.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
100

 A high-quality NTSC picture: Because channels are transmit-
ted digitally, they are less prone to suffer from interference
and “noise” than analog cable.
 High-quality audio: Stereo audio is provided with most pro-
grams; some channels may include a Dolby digital surround-
sound audio stream.
 An on-screen program guide: Most cable systems include an
interactive program guide that lets you view a week or so’s
worth of shows, view details about each program, and set up
reminders and timers for recording.
 Access to Pay per view: Unlike old fashioned pay per view
(PPV) programming, you don’t need to call the cable company
to watch a show (like a movie or sporting event) — you can
simply press a button on your remote to order.
 Access to VoD: The flagship service in any digital cable pack-
age is video on demand. This service uses the two-way net-
work and on-screen guide, and allows you to select any movie
or program from a library of programs retained on a server in
the cable company’s network — when you hit Play on your
remote, the program begins streaming down to your set-top
box. You can pause, fast-forward, and rewind, just as you can
with a DVD.
Getting the digital box
Today (though this will change very soon), you need a digital-cable
set-top box in order to take advantage of all these neat digital-cable
services. If you have an HDTV set-top box from your cable com-
pany, you probably already have a box that can take advantage of
digital cable. (There are usually only a few HDTV channels on any
cable system; it makes no sense to build a box for HDTV alone.)
Like the HDTV-specific set-top boxes, digital cable set-top boxes
are rented or leased to you (the customer) in a variety of different
ways — such as a monthly box lease, a monthly service fee, or a
combination of those. Look for set-top boxes that have extra fea-
tures — for example, Pat is currently using a set-top box from
Scientific Atlanta that supports HDTV and digital cable, and has 
a built-in DVR (digital video recorder — see Chapter 12 for more
info).
Chapter 9: The Cable Guy 101

Analog Cable
The easiest cable signals to tune into are analog cable channels.
Depending upon your cable system, all, none, or some of your
cable channels will be analog (the latter case occurs when the first
50 or so channels on your system are analog, and all higher chan-
nels are digital).
Analog cable is nothing more (or less) than NTSC, analog, stan-
dard-definition TV programming sent over cables instead of the air-
waves. With the vast majority of HDTVs (that is, any HDTV that is
not just a monitor, and has an NTSC tuner built-in), you can view
analog-cable programming by simply plugging your cable feed (the
RG6 cable and F-connector — see Chapter 3 for more details on
these cables) into the back of your TV.
If you’re receiving digital cable or HDTV from your cable provider
and are using a set-top box, you don’t need to do anything special
to tune into the analog channels. Your set-top box will automati-
cally tune them in and send them to your TV.
Some plasma TVs (Chapter 23) and most front-projection TV sys-
tems (Chapter 22) don’t have a built-in NTSC tuner. If you’re not
using a set-top box, you can always use the NTSC tuner built into
your VCR (VHS, S-VHS, and D-VHS VCRs all have NTSC tuners built-
in) as your NTSC tuner.
Going Boxless
Like many other electronic devices and services, digital cable (and
HDTV cable) is going plug-and-play. With the help of the govern-
ment and industry organizations (such as the Consumer Electronics
Association), cable TV providers have gotten together with technol-
ogy vendors (TV manufacturers and the folks who build the infra-
structure components of a cable network) to come up with a
system that lets customers kick the cable box to the curb!
As we write this, the first iterations of this “boxless” digital-cable
system are beginning to be announced and trickle onto the market.
We haven’t been able to test them out. We’re sure they work, 
and work well, but sometimes such transitions take longer than
expected — so don’t be surprised if it’s a few years before this
becomes commonplace.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
102

So what’s going on? Two main things are happening:
 TVs are being built as digital-cable-ready (DCR) — just as regu-
lar analog TVs have been built as cable-ready for analog cable
for years. These TVs have a QAM tuner built-in, and also have
a slot for a “smart card” called the CableCARD.
 Cable companies are getting ready to rent these CableCARDs
to their customers. A customer with a CableCARD and a DCR
HDTV can simply plug the CableCARD into the HDTV — the
card basically gives your TV “permission” to unscramble
encrypted premium channels.
This permission-giving process is called conditional access in the
cable business. No, we won’t test you on that. Just thought we’d
share.
With this DCR HDTV and the CableCARD, you simply plug the cable
into the back of your TV and you’re ready to go.
The first generation of CableCARD devices will be one-way only —
so they will let you watch premium channels, but won’t be able to
communicate back “upstream” to the cable company. This means
that the initial CableCARD deployments won’t support digital cable
services such as program guides, pay per view, or VoD. Eventually,
an updated, two-way CableCARD will become available, allowing
DCR HDTVs to access more of these advanced digital-cable features.
Chapter #: Chapter Title 103
So is the set-top box dead?
As the CableCARD system gains widespread acceptance, the need for the set-top
box will decrease. After all, who wants extra devices plugged into their HDTVs (and
sitting on the equipment rack) if they don’t need ’em?
Understandably, cable companies (and the set-top box manufacturers who support
them) don’t see it quite that way. While CableCARDs will be offered (and will be
required by the FCC to be an option for customers), the set-top box probably won’t
disappear completely.
Instead, the set-top box will become even more powerful — adding onto today’s
features like DVR with new features — such as home networking and whole-home
DVRs that can record 6 or more channels and send the recorded programs to any
TV in the home.

Cable companies hate paying for expensive set-top boxes, but they
also like the concept of having a piece of gear in your home that
controls much of your TV viewing (and maybe even your Internet
surfing and phone calls, too!) — so don’t be surprised to see your
cable company still pushing set-top boxes your way, even long
after CableCARD hits the streets.

ell, okay, rockets did have something to do with putting all
those communication satellites up there. But that’s pretty
much where the science ends and the good news begins. Satellite
service providers are not only a great alternative to cable for regu-
lar TV programming, they are also a primo source for HDTV. The
satellite companies were among the first to offer HDTV — using
HDTV as a serious competitive advantage to counteract cable com-
panies’ digital cable offerings, such as video-on-demand (VoD).
With its very small (usually 18- to 24-inch) dishes, Direct Broadcast
Satellite (DBS) allows all but the most remote viewer to receive
HDTV economically. Even author Danny on his island two miles out
at sea.
Planning a Satellite TV System
Getting satellite TV for your HDTV isn’t all that difficult, but it is a
bit more complicated than cable TV (where most of the sophisti-
cated equipment belongs to the cable company, so they handle all
the maintenance and installation).
The first step towards satellite involves picking a provider (imag-
ine that, a choice instead of a monopoly!). Once you’ve picked a
provider, then you can choose the appropriate equipment — a
satellite dish and a receiver.

Service
You must subscribe to a provider if you want HDTV channels from
a satellite. Three TV service providers have significant HDTV 
programming:
 DIRECTV (www.directv.com)
 Dish Networks (www.dishnetwork.com), owned by EchoStar
 Voom (www.voom.com), owned by Cablevision
The last half of this chapter guides you to select a provider for
satellite HDTV.
Equipment
For HDTV (or any TV, for that matter) by satellite, you need equip-
ment to use the satellite signal: a receiver, an antenna, a TV, and
cables to connect them all.
Want more information than that? Can do!
Receiver
Satellite HDTV requires an HDTV receiver (sometimes called a tuner
or set-top box) that works with your DBS provider.
If you already have a DIRECTV or Dish Network receiver, it proba-
bly doesn’t receive HDTV. Check the Web sites for DIRECTV (www.
directv.com) or Dish Network (www.dishnetwork.com) for the
latest HDTV receivers.
Except for special HDTV connections, an HDTV satellite receiver
usually looks and works just like a typical satellite TV receiver.
Most HDTV satellite receivers include two essential items:
 A receiver for satellite-based HDTV channels
 A terrestrial broadcast HDTV tuner so you can pick up local
HDTV channels that aren’t on your satellite lineup
Local HDTV broadcasts are transmitted digitally. Expect any
HDTV satellite system to get a fine picture from local HDTV
broadcast stations unless the local signal has to travel so far
that it’s just too weak when you get it. Chapter 8 gives you the
lowdown on receiving over-the-air broadcasts of local HDTV
channels.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
106

A few TV sets have integrated DBS receivers. Each receiver is for
only one DBS provider, so you need to decide on a provider before
buying an HDTV set with an integrated receiver.
If you want a digital video recorder (DVR) in your HDTV satellite
system, it should be part of the satellite receiver. Later in this
chapter, we tell you about DVRs that are available for DIRECTV 
and Dish Network. Chapter 12 has the whole DVR story.
Antennas
Even if you have a DBS dish, you may need a new dish for HDTV.
DBS providers have launched new satellites to transmit HDTV (and
local channels and other services), because “normal” DBS satel-
lites are pretty much full to the brim with regular TV programming.
The DBS company usually installs two HDTV antennas for you:
 A small broadcast antenna that receives local HDTV channels
 The special HDTV dish for your satellite channels
If you already have DBS service, it’s easy to check whether
you need a new satellite dish to get HDTV satellite channels
from the same DBS provider:
• If you have DIRECTV service, look for a DIRECTV logo on
Channel 99. If you see the logo, you’re set for HDTV from
DIRECTV. Otherwise you’ll need to install a new dish (or
in a few cases, purchase an upgrade kit for your existing
dish).
• With Dish Network, try tuning to channel 9900. If you
receive this channel, you’ve got the right dish — other-
wise you’ll need to install a new dish.
If you need a new satellite dish, let a pro install it. Running
cables and aiming the dish can be pains in the hind end.
There’s no real advantage of doing it yourself, especially if you
can get free installation in a package when you subscribe.
Chapter 10: Rocket Science 107
Why might I need a new dish?
HDTV signals are transmitted in their own orbital slots (from different satellite loca-
tions, in other words). For example, Dish Network broadcasts HDTV from the 110-
degree slot, which many older Dish Network dishes (that’s a mouthful!) can’t tune
in. In those cases, you’ll need a new satellite dish that incorporates low-noise block-
ers (LNBs) that can tune in these new slots before you can receive the HDTV signal.

HDTV-ready TV
Your new HDTV-ready TV connects to the satellite HDTV receiver
the same way it connects to a similar cable box. Chapter 1 and
Chapter 2 guide you to the right HDTV-ready TV for your home.
If you don’t have an HDTV yet, you can use an HDTV satellite
receiver with your existing TV. You won’t see HDTV quality pictures
with such a set-up, but it works. You might do something like this,
for example, if you’re waiting for a specific HDTV, but you’re ready
to install or upgrade your satellite TV system now.
Cabling
An HDTV satellite system needs three kinds of connections:
 Satellite-dish-to-satellite-receiver: When the signal arrives
from outer space, it has to get to the receiver before you can
see it. No rocket science there.
If you already have a DBS system, you probably can use the
old cable to connect your new HDTV dish to your new HDTV
satellite receiver. But let a pro install and aim your dish.
 Local-antenna-to-satellite-receiver: Chapter 8 guides you for
receiving HDTV broadcast stations on HDTV devices.
 Satellite-receiver-to-TV: Chapter 3 covers basic video connec-
tions to an HDTV-ready TV.
Availability
Most U.S. homes can receive HDTV by satellite. Here’s how to make
sure you can receive it:
 The best way to find big problems or special needs is to check
each provider’s Web site. Zip-code-based information portals
can tell you what’s needed for your area.
 If you are in an apartment, condo, or a homeowner’s associa-
tion, check your local rules about dish placement. In the U.S.,
you must be allowed to install a dish (that’s a federal regula-
tion), but the dish must be located in a space that only you
have access to (like a private patio) and not on common
space (like the rooftop). If your permitted placement doesn’t
have a southwestern sky view, you will need to negotiate with
your landlord or condo/homeowner’s association about
installing the dish elsewhere (for example, the roof). Check
out the FCC’s Web site (www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.
html) for the details on this ruling.
Part III: HDTV Channels 
108

 If you are in Alaska or Hawaii, you might need a larger dish.
For example, DIRECTV advises its customers that subscribers
in Anchorage or Fairbanks might have to install an 8-foot dish
to get their signals. (You can probably get by with a 4-foot
dish in Juneau.) If you live to the north and west of these loca-
tions signal strength continues to drop off, but we’re guessing
if you live that far north of the Lower 48, then you probably
know this as a matter of course.
 Special international channels, such as Chinese- or Spanish-
language channels, may come from other satellites. They
require a multi-satellite dish and visibility to all those satellites.
Choosing a DBS Provider
Your home probably can receive all three satellite-HDTV providers.
If you can decide by features and price (most folks who live in
medium-sized and larger cities can decide that way), the trick
becomes sorting through the offers du jour.
At the time this was written, Voom was offering a limited-time free-
equipment-and-installation deal to drum up business, while Dish
Network was packaging an HDTV, HDTV receiver, and its service
for $1,000 installed — and was running a contest to give one lucky
winner all the necessary equipment and a free year of Dish
Network’s HDTV service.
Special deals like the Voom and Dish Network offers discussed in
the previous paragraph come and go, so you need to check with 
all three vendors for their packages when you are ready to buy.
Programming
All the HDTV satellite providers have the common channels you
expect in any cable or satellite system. But actual HDTV channels
vary from provider to provider.
Voom channels
Voom has the most HDTV channels, probably because it was
launched for the explicit purpose of delivering HDTV via satellite.
Voom had 39 HDTV channels at the time this was written (far more
than any other service).
Chapter 10: Rocket Science 109

Voom has the usual HBO, Showtime, and ESPN channels. Some
Voom programming is specifically for Voom’s lineup. These include
such unusual offerings as
 Equator HD, which broadcasts “intriguing and visually stun-
ning sights and sounds that capture the world’s most unique
people and places” — that is, documentaries and other visu-
ally appealing fare
 A channel of beautiful HDTV images and music
 Special events, such as the June 2004 sale of Eric Clapton’s
guitar collection
At Voom, you can also watch Westerns on the Gunslinger channel,
plus classic or epic movies (or epic classics, no doubt!).
Dish Network channels
Dish Network offers eight network HDTV channels (including HBO,
Showtime, TNT, Discovery and ESPN), plus some special HDTV-
only content:
 An HDTV Pay Per View channel, featuring recent movies and
some IMAX films
 HDNet, which carries live sporting events, and a variety of
dramas, documentaries, and other programming
 HDNet Movies, which shows (you guessed it!) movies from
Warner Brothers, Sony Pictures Television, and independent
sources
Part III: HDTV Channels 
110
Voom or poof?
If you are unwilling to take a bit of a risk, Voom might not be the way to go — though
Voom’s current (as we write) offer of free hardware basically eliminates any risk to
you, besides the inconvenience of switching to a different provider. In its first six
months of operation, Voom lost a fifth of the customers who tried the service, accord-
ing to Cablevision’s SEC filings. The company has also decided to go with a bigger
dish to enable subscribers to “see” a new satellite source that will provide capacity
for more programming. The company is replacing its previous dishes for free, which
is likely to increase its already-massive losses (just under $500 million this year) and
depress its chances of succeeding as a spinoff from parent company Cablevision.
It might not hurt to take a leap of faith. Customers who get the service have raved
about the HDTV menu. If Voom fails financially, the company’s assets will likely be
picked up by another company (maybe one of the other two satellite companies).

Chapter 10: Rocket Science 111
DIRECTV channels
DIRECTV offers eight channels of HDTV broadcasts of popular 
networks (including HBO, Showtime, TNT, Discovery, ESPN, and
Spice — use your parental blocking if you need it!), plus a pay-
per-view offering.
DIRECTV sells its HDTV for about $11 a month. The company sells
its equipment through major retailers such as Best Buy and Circuit
City and directs customers to the nearest reseller from its Web
site.
Internet and HDTV with one dish
It may be the industry’s best-kept secret, but it’s possible to get both high-speed
Internet (via DIRECWAY) and DIRECTV’s HDTV service from a single installed dish.
The dual dish comes with three connecting cables:
 A cable to the HDTV satellite receiver.
 Input and output cables for Internet service. The input and output cables con-
nect into a high-speed modem, which then connects into the computer.
You can share DIRECWAY Internet service with more than one computer in your home
by either connecting computers to your DIRECWAY service through a home network
or purchasing a DIRECWAY modem that can connect more than one computer.
DIRECWAY is a godsend for anyone living on an island or remote mountaintop,
where you’d never get any other Internet access (ask Danny — he knows).
Compared to other Internet services, DIRECWAY has a couple of drawbacks:
 DIRECWAY is a fast Internet service, but it adds a delay in all your Internet activ-
ities. Its signals must travel 23,000 miles up to satellites and then the same dis-
tance back down. That adds a half-second to every round trip. The delay isn’t
significant for e-mail, text messaging, and Web-surfing, but you’d notice it if you
play games or use voice over the Internet.
 DIRECTV and DIRECWAY haven’t been offered together as a special deal. (Cable
and telephone companies often give you a discount if they sell you TV and
Internet service together.) But that can change. If you’re considering both
DIRECTV and DIRECWAY, look for combination deals that may have been cre-
ated since this book was published.
If you intend to install DIRECWAY, ask for the dual dish at a DIRECTV retailer.

Digital video recorder (DVR)
Digital video recorders let you do pause, do instant replays, and
time-shift your favorite programming. (We cover DVRs in depth in
Chapter 12.) A DVR is more powerful and easier to use with an HDTV
satellite system if the DVR is included in the satellite receiver.
As of this writing, you have a couple of options if you want an
HDTV satellite system with an integrated DVR. These options have
the same basic capabilities:
 DIRECTV: Its HDTV receiver can come integrated with a TiVo
digital video recorder.
We prefer the TiVo user interface and overall experience.
 Dish Network: Its own DVR (the Dish Player-DVR 921, $999)
doesn’t use TiVo technology.
As of this writing, Voom doesn’t offer a DVR, though the company
has promised one before the end of 2004.

H
ave you noticed everything in HDTV boils down to
acronyms? Well, in this part, we keep up that tradi-
tion, talking about DVDs, DVRs, and VCRs, and we do so
ASAP PDQ!
DVDs are responsible for the boom in digital video content,
just as CDs sparked the boom in digital audio in years past.
The low cost, ubiquitous availability, and sheer massive
storage space of DVDs revolutionize everything from block-
buster to direct-to-DVD movies — it’s even spawned a new
business of getting DVDs in the mail, NetFlix. So we spend
some time looking at DVDs and DVD players in this part,
mainly to bring you up to speed on all this great content
you can use to drive your HDTV experience. We also talk
about the future — great new DVD technology that will
bring true HDTV programs to the DVD format.
We’ll also talk about the latest and greatest thing to hit con-
sumer electronics, the DVR (digital video recorder). Called
TiVo by a lot of people, this product category has trans-
formed how people interact with their TV set. The DVR
lets users watch what they want, when they want, even if
they missed it. Got that? You will. Combine this with the
availability of full season’s worth of popular shows on DVD,
and you’ve totally transformed the way TV is watched.
Finally, the VCR is still alive and kicking. If you are like us,
you’ve got shelves of VHS movies and older VCRs spread
across the house. With new HD camcorders and HDTV
content over the airwaves, you might want to upgrade to
a new digital VHS VCR. We tell you the pros and cons of 
D-VHS options, and what’s available on the market.

VDs probably will be your main source of non-broadcast video
content for HDTV viewing. DVDs have gone from zero to 1,000
miles per hour in no time. More than 70 percent of American house-
holds have adopted the technology in less than seven years.
The biggest questions about DVD don’t have anything to do with
today’s DVDs and DVD players. You can buy a serviceable DVD
player for $30 — if you don’t mind getting trampled at Discount
City — or a high-quality unit for $200. The confusion is about the
next generations of DVDs — the profusion of recordable DVD for-
mats, and the competing high-definition DVD formats.
With a few expensive and rare exceptions, you can’t buy HDTV
DVDs now, but some standard DVD players are better for HDTV.
In this chapter, we start with the basics of standard DVDs and DVD
players, and guide you through the confusing territory of DVD
recorders. We follow with all of the form factors (packages) that
contain DVD players — DVD players are in all sorts of electronics
gear. We finish by putting on our Crystal Ball Spectacles to see
high-definition DVD formats that may be available soon.
Learning about the DVD disc
Digital Video Discs (sometimes they’re called Digital Versatile
Discs — this usage has pretty much disappeared) are simply optical
(laser-readable) storage media — like a CD (compact disc). Like the
CD, the DVD is 12 cm in diameter, and consists of layers — the top

layers protect the DVD, and the inner layers contain tiny pits that
can be detected and “read” by a laser beam.
Today’s DVDs can hold at least 4.7 gigabytes of data on one side
(compared to about 800 megabytes on a CD). That’s enough for
about two hours of standard definition (NTSC) video.
Currently, there are two ways to put more video on a DVD:
 Add a layer: DVDs can be designed with a second layer of
data — basically another layer of pits at a different depth
within the DVD. The laser in a DVD player can focus on this
layer and ignore the other layer entirely.
 Use both sides: DVD data can be on both sides of the disc.
DVDs seldom use both sides of a disc to show different parts
of a movie. Double-sided DVDs usually are seen when
• A 16:9 widescreen version of a movie is on one side.
• A 4:3 pan-and-scan version is on the other side.
DVDs can be both double-layered and double-sided — holding up
to 18 gigabytes of data.
There are a couple of other ways to fit more data onto a DVD. We
cover both of these at the end of the chapter:
 A new blue laser that can use smaller pits
 New data-compression systems
Dealing with today’s DVDs
Today, DVDs usually are the best source for playing prerecorded
movies on an HDTV. Here’s why:
 Distortion-free digital image: It isn’t HDTV, but DVDs offer 
a clear, colorful and sharp picture at higher resolution than
either VHS or PVRs currently offer (with the exception of 
D-VHS VCRs, which are almost impossible to find).
 Progressive scan: With a progressive-scan DVD player, your
progressive-scan HDTV can be fed a non-interlaced picture
(often providing better quality than if your HDTV had to “de-
interlace” the picture itself).
 True widescreen: With discs labeled anamorphic or formatted
for widescreen, you can get a full widescreen 16 x 9 picture for
your HDTV without techniques that reduce the resolution of
the video, such as letterboxing.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
116

There’s a wide range of prices for good DVD players — from well
under $100 up to the thousands for “high-end” models.
Essential features
We insist on all of these features in a DVD player for any HDTV
system. You should be able to find an affordable DVD player with
 Progressive scan (described in Chapter 21)
 3:2 pulldown (described in Chapter 21) 
If your monitor has a good 3:2-pulldown system, you can get
by without it in the DVD player, but you aren’t likely to find a
good DVD player without built-in 3:2 pulldown.
 Component video outputs (described in Chapter 3)
Useful features
Depending on how you use your DVD player, these features can
make your HDTV system more useful and convenient:
 Built-in surround-sound decoder: If your old surround-sound
system doesn’t have a built-in decoder for current formats,
this can add Dolby Digital and DTS (which we cover in
Chapter 18).
 Extra audio formats: All DVD players also play audio CDs, but
some go beyond the call of duty with these audio formats:
• SACD
• DVD-Audio 
• MP3 audio files on homemade CDs
 Multidisc changer: A multidisc changer is handy if you watch
lots of movies (or use it as a CD player for a party).
Single disc players are often more reliable than multi-disc
changers.
 DVI-D output: If your HDTV has an otherwise unused DVI-D
input, you may consider this feature. Some DVD players 
with DVI-D outputs feature an internal scaler (described in
Chapter 6) to better match the DVD output to the HDTV. 
DVI-D is described in Chapter 3.
Deciphering DVD Recorders
If you could travel through time back to (say) 1986, you could really
blow the minds of anyone you met by saying that less than 20 years
Chapter 11: DVDs 117

later, you could make your own CDs at home. It’s like saying you
can make your own jet airliner in the garage. But you can’t even
buy a PC these days without a CD burner built-in.
In less than seven years on the market, the DVD has also become
something you can make yourself:
 Most DVD burners are in personal computers.
Extra capacity makes the DVD format really useful in general
with PCs. As quickly as computer hard drives have grown, an
800-megabyte CD now seems puny.
 You can buy a standalone DVD recorder. It’s an A/V component
that can also be your DVD player.
Recordable DVDs labeled with an “R” can be written (recorded)
once. “RW” discs can be rewritten (changed) thousands of times.
A DVD recorder can’t copy most commercial DVDs, which are 
copy protected. Your DVD recorder can detect signals in the video
stream and prevent copying. You can record TV programs, most
VHS tapes, and homemade content (such as camcorder tapes).
The biggest decision to make when considering a DVD recorder is
the format. The consumer electronics industry (and PC industry)
doesn’t agree on a standard format for recordable DVDs. There are
three competing DVD recording formats (which aren’t always com-
patible with each other):
 DVD-R/RW (“DVD dash”) discs are the most compatible with
other DVD players, so a DVD-R or DVD-RW disc is most likely
to play on your mom’s old DVD player.
 DVD+R/RW (“DVD plus”) discs are essentially as compatible as
DVD- discs (some DVD+ vendors claim more compatibility —
we think it’s about a draw).
DVD+ can record dual-layer discs with double capacity.
 DVD-RAM discs are mainly for computer data storage, and
can be rewritten (like DVD-RW and DVD+RW discs).
DVD-RAM is the least compatible format with other players.
Finding DVDs in Unusual Places
The most common way to buy a DVD player is to get your hands
on a standalone DVD — but that isn’t the only way to get DVD into
Part IV: Movie Machines 
118

your home. DVD players have been slotted into all sorts of differ-
ent home entertainment gear — usually in an effort to save space
and money by creating “all-in-one” devices that can feed different
signals into an HDTV.
Xbox and PlayStation 2 game consoles can be DVD players, too!
Home theater in a box
The most common “all-in-one” DVD sources are the Home Theater
in a Box (or HTIB) systems from just about every major A/V gear
manufacturer. These systems usually include 
 An A/V receiver (see Chapter 18) with a built-in DVD player
 A complete set of surround-sound speakers (including a sub-
woofer) for Dolby Digital sound from DVDs and HDTV
Figure 11-1 shows an HTIB system.
Figure 11-1: Get it all in one box with an HTIB system.
Chapter 19 covers sound systems for HDTV and home theaters.
DVD/VCR
Some manufacturers squeeze a DVD player and a VHS VCR deck
into a single chassis.
Chapter 11: DVDs 119

These devices use one remote control and one power supply, but
usually two sets of video outputs that connect to your HDTV:
 Component video for DVDs (plus S-video and composite)
Avoid DVD/VCR units that don’t have component video for
the DVD player. You really want be able to use component
video to connect the DVD player to your HDTV!
 Composite video for VHS (or S-Video if the VCR portion sup-
ports that system)
You can’t record commercial DVDs onto the VCR in these units,
because of a copy protection system in DVDs.
DVD/PVR
The neatest development we’ve seen recently is the integration of
DVD players (and particularly DVD recorders) and PVR (personal
video recorders — Chapter 12 covers these devices). It’s the latest
and greatest for recording TV shows and watching movies — the
two replacements for the VCR in one chassis!
With a DVD recorder and a PVR in the same box, it’s really easy 
to make archived recordings of TV shows that you’ve recorded on
the PVR. You don’t have to worry about permanently deleting pro-
grams if you can just move them to a recordable DVD.
Peering into the high-def future
Today’s DVDs can’t store or play HDTV movies and video, because
they were designed when standard definition was “good enough.”
Three changes are required for HDTV from a DVD:
 DVD discs need more storage space.
HDTV programming can have up to eight times as much data
as the same show in standard definition.
 DVD players must read these new DVD discs.
 DVD players must output HDTV signals.
Fortunately for HDTV addicts, the major players in the DVD industry
are working furiously to develop high-def systems. Unfortunately,
these companies have taken separate (and incompatible) paths to
DVD HDTV nirvana.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
120

With these competing systems, we expect another VHS versus
Betamax battle in the market. One format probably will end up
“winning” — if you pick the wrong system, you’ll have obsolete
equipment much sooner than you expected. Don’t be the first on
your block to buy one of these machines (unless you’re loaded and
don’t mind losing the investment). Give the market some time to
sort out. We hope that eventually universal players will play both
types of discs.
The battle will be over both technologies and standards.
You need a new DVD player for the following HDTV formats.
However, the promoters of these standards promise their new DVD
players also will be compatible with your old DVDs.
Blue-laser systems
One way to increase DVD capacity is to switch to blue-laser tech-
nology. Blue lasers can read smaller pits in the DVD disc than red
lasers (that’s because a blue laser has a shorter wavelength than
a red laser). Smaller pits mean more pits (and data) fit on a disc.
There are a couple of competing blue-laser standards.
Blu-ray
The largest group of companies supports a blue-laser system
called Blu-ray. The Blu-ray bandwagon includes Sony, Panasonic,
RCA, Pioneer, Philips, Samsung, and LG.
A single-sided Blu-ray disc can hold up to 25 gigabytes of data on a
single layer (50 gigabytes on a dual-layer disc), which is more than
enough to handle most movies in HDTV resolution.
Blu-ray players aren’t widely available as we write. At least one
(very expensive) model is available in Japan.
HD-DVD
High-Definition DVD (HD-DVD) is a blue-laser system supported 
by Toshiba, NEC, and the DVD Forum (an industry group that pro-
moted the original DVD format). HD-DVD systems use a blue laser
with larger pits in the DVD disc than Blu-ray.
Larger pits should make HD-DVD discs easier to manufacture, 
but they hold less data than Blu-ray discs. To make up for it, the
HD-DVD folks use more aggressive video compression technologies
(like Microsoft Windows Media) so longer movies fit on a disc.
Chapter 11: DVDs 121

Compression basically shrinks the amount of storage space
needed by a video by discarding “unnecessary” bits of the video.
This can cause some degradation in picture quality — how much
you lose is subjective, and it depends on which compression
system is used. A good compression system is nearly unnoticeable.
As we write, HD-DVD players aren’t available from any 
manufacturers — they’re still in prototype stage.
Compressed red-laser systems
There are a couple of efforts to use video-compression technology
to fit HDTV signals onto regular red-laser DVDs. The discs would
look like standard DVDs, but a new DVD player would be required
to decode these compression methods.
Compressed red-laser systems can make HDTV DVD movies in
existing factories, without new equipment. It doesn’t make much
difference to you, unless using the same factories lowers what you
pay for HDTV DVDs.
The benefits are for the big studios making the DVDs themselves:
 Time Warner supports a red-laser system called HD-DVD9,
which uses Microsoft Windows Media compression system.
 A group of manufacturers in China is proposing the EVD com-
pressed system.

Getting Into DVRs
In This Chapter
 Throwing away your VCR
 Controlling TV your way
 Going high-def
 Looking into DVR options
B
esides HDTV itself, we think that the rise of the DVR (Digital
Video Recorder — some folks call them PVRs, or Personal
Video Recorders, too) is the single biggest thing to happen to TV 
in our lifetimes. Yeah, we know that sounds like an exaggeration,
but trust us — using a DVR is almost a life-changing experience.
Once you start using a DVR, you’ll never (never ever) think about
TV the same way again!
In this chapter, we give you a good dose of DVR background and
information, then cover the (few) DVRs that can record HDTV sig-
nals. We also discuss DVRs more generally — after all, most features
and “goodies” found on today’s standard-definition DVRs will even-
tually appear again in high-def versions of the same units. Finally, 
we cover some interesting DVR variants (such as the DVR/DVD
recorder combo that Pat finds so compelling).
Most DVRs in this chapter (and most DVRs you can buy today)
can’t record or play HDTV content. A very small number of HDTV-
capable DVRs are available, but we expect that very soon HDTV
DVRs will be common.
DVR 101
A DVR is, at the most basic level, a digital replacement for your
VCR. Just like a VCR, a DVR can record TV programs — instead 
of using a tape for this purpose, a DVR records TV digitally, on a
computer hard drive inside the DVR.

Learning the benefits
If the only benefit of a DVR were the replacement of the tape with a
hard drive, we’d be sold on it. But as they say in the Ginsu knife
commercials —“Wait, there’s more!” DVRs can also
 Pause live TV: Usually, DVRs automatically record about an
hour’s worth of the show you’re currently watching. So you
can hit the pause button, run to the bathroom or kitchen or
answer the phone, and pick up later where you left off.
 Rewind live TV: You can rewind a scene that you missed. This
was done a lot during a certain halftime show (with a certain
“wardrobe malfunction”).
 Record a show you’re watching with one touch: If you must
leave the room suddenly, just press a single button on the
remote to save the whole show (including the part you’ve
already watched).
 Record an entire series: You don’t have to set up separate
recordings for each episode of a series. Just select one episode
and turn on series recording. Your DVR automatically finds
every episode of that show on the programming guide and
records it for you.
All DVRs have a few common elements:
 The hard drive for storing video
 A GUI (graphical user interface) that lets you control the DVR
with your remote control
 An on-screen programming guide for scheduling recordings
(no more need to manually enter dates and times!)
 A telephone or Internet connection for updating the program-
ming guide
The best-known DVRs come from a company called TiVo (www.
tivo.com) and its partners. In fact, the name TiVo is widely used
to refer to DVRs in general — it’s even used as a verb as in, “I
didn’t watch it yet, but I TiVo’d Deadwood.”
Making the connection
Connecting a DVR to your HDTV system is simple. You want 
your DVR to be inline with (connected between) your TV source
(antenna, cable or satellite) and the HDTV itself.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
124

 This is incredibly easy if the DVR is part of the TV source
(either a satellite receiver or cable set-top box).
 If you have a standalone DVR, you connect it to the standard-
definition outputs of your satellite or cable set-top box (or to
your antenna cable) before those signals reach your HDTV.
Today, there aren’t any HDTV standalone DVRs on the 
market — so you have only standard-definition signals on
your DVR. That’s because the common self-contained DVRs
that are most popular today have not yet been converted 
to handle HDTV — manufacturers aren’t yet convinced that
there’s a big enough market for HDTV viewers using over-the-
air antennas.
You could use one of the DBS satellite HD DVRs we discuss in the
section of the chapter that immediately follows to record over-the-
air HDTV signals. In this case, the DVR is also your HDTV tuner. If
you’re not subscribing to a DBS service, this is a really expensive
($1,000) way of getting an HDTV-capable DVR just for broadcast
channels.
Figure 12-1 shows a typical DVR set-up with a satellite or cable set-
top box and a VCR.
HD DVRs
If you own or plan on owning an HDTV (and we assume you do,
since you’re reading HDTV For Dummies), your ultimate DVR
records and displays HDTV programs in their native HDTV resolu-
tions (720p or 1080i). After all, your favorite HDTV shows deserve
the deluxe DVR treatment as much as your standard-definition
favorites.
As we write, there are few HDTV-capable DVRs on the market.
Making a high-def DVR is a cost-engineering challenge, not a techni-
cal challenge. Today, a high-def DVR isn’t easy to build at prices
consumers will pay, because a high-definition DVR requires
 A much bigger hard drive
 A more powerful graphics chip
 More expensive connectors (like DVI-D or component video)
Chapter 12: Getting Into DVRs 125

Figure 12-1: Squeezing a DVR into the picture.
The prices of high-def DVR components are coming down rapidly.
We expect that HDTV DVRs soon will be common and affordable.
If you want an HDTV DVR today, you have a few choices:
 From your cable company: A few cable companies offer digi-
tal cable/HDTV set-top boxes that include HDTV DVR features.

One example of this is Scientific Atlanta’s Explorer 8000HD,
which you can look into at the following site:
www.sciatl.com/products/consumers/Exp8000HD.htm
You can’t buy one of these for yourself, but if you’re lucky,
your cable company will rent you one for a monthly fee. 
The Explorer 8000HD (shown in Figure 12-2) contains a 160
gigabyte hard drive that can record up to 20 hours of HDTV
programming.
Not all cable-company “HDTV” DVRs actually record in 
HDTV — some combine an HDTV tuner with a standard DVR.
This DVR is better than nothing, but know what you’re getting
for your money.
 In your satellite receiver: Each of the major satellite TV
providers have announced deals to provide their customers
with set-top boxes that can record HDTV — for the low, low
price of about $1,000. We talk about the satellite service
providers (DIRECTV, Dish Network, and Voom) in Chapter 10.
Figure 12-2: The Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8000HD can record HDTV.
Standard DVRs
If you are one of the lucky few with the budget, the right HDTV
service provider, and the right alignment of the stars, you might be
Chapter 12: Getting Into DVRs 127

able to get an HDTV-capable DVR right now. For the rest of us, a
standard-definition DVR is the only option until HDTV DVRs
become more widely available (and affordable!).
What to look for
DVRs are made by many manufacturers, and are available at a wide
range of prices. Here are the key things we look for when deciding
which DVR is right for us (these criteria can apply to an HDTV
DVR, too):
 Purchase or rent: Your main question probably is, “How
much is this thing going to cost me?” The answer depends
upon where the DVR comes from. Some units are offered to
consumers for outright purchase; others are rented from a
cable company or other provider on a monthly basis.
Do the math on this — rental is initially cheaper, but may be
more expensive if you keep the DVR for a long time.
 Programming guide fees: Many DVRs require a monthly serv-
ice fee to access the on-screen program guide (it makes the
DVR work, and you should consider it mandatory). Some, like
those rented from a cable company, may not charge for this, or
include this cost in the equipment rental fee. In some cases,
you can save money by purchasing a “lifetime” subscription.
Lifetime subscriptions only are a good deal if the company
that sells them stays in business for the lifetime of your DVR.
DVR manufacturers have gone bankrupt — folks with lifetime
subscriptions weren’t affected, but for a while it wasn’t clear
what would happen. If your DVR vendor goes bust, you and
your subscription could be out in the cold.
 Hard-drive size: The main technical specification to check in
a DVR is hard drive size — often described as hours of pro-
gramming that fit on the hard drive.
Hours can trick you — they depend on video quality. Compare
the same video quality when comparing time.
Check whether the PVR allows for adding external hard drives
to add capacity in the future. Look for a DVR that includes
either FireWire (also called 1394) or USB 2.0 connectors for
this purpose. Read the manual (the fine print!) — some DVRs
have these connectors, but they aren’t “turned on,” so you
can’t use them for this purpose.
 Number of tuners: We recommend a two-tuner DVR, so you
can either record two programs at once or watch one while
recording another.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
128

Some DVRs only have a single TV tuner built-in. You can only
record one program at a time — if this single-tuner DVR is
built into your cable or satellite set-top box, you might be able
to watch only the program you’re recording. 
 Hardware features: The most basic DVRs simply have con-
nections for TVs and TV source signals. Others can connect to
home networks (via Ethernet) or even wireless LANs for shar-
ing content between DVRs within the home.
We recommend Ethernet connections so you can share!
 Software features: Some DVRs (like those made by TiVo or
ReplayTV — www.replaytv.com) are built around very
sophisticated GUIs that can do things like recommend shows
you’d like (based on your viewing habits), display pictures 
or play music that’s stored on your PCs, or even incorporate
Internet content. Others (for example, some of the DVRs
incorporated into cable set-top boxes) are more basic.
If you want all the fancy interface stuff, you’re probably best
off with either a TiVo or ReplayTV-powered DVR.
Finding a DVR that fits
When buying a DVR, you need to consider how it fits into the 
space you want to put it in — its form factor. Some DVRs are self-
contained units — in other words, a chassis with a DVR inside, and
nothing else. Others are incorporated into other devices, providing
a multipurpose device that takes up less room on that equipment
rack under your HDTV.
Among your choices are the following:
 Standalone DVRs: The most popular DVR is a standalone unit,
like the traditional TiVo and ReplayTV models.
These DVRs are best suited for connecting to over-the-air
broadcast TV or analog cable systems, though they can be
used with a digital cable set-top box or satellite receiver.
 Cable and satellite DVRs: If you connect your HDTV primarily
to digital cable or satellite service, you should consider a DVR
that is built into your receiver or set-top box. These DVRs
save space and receive the digital signals used by these serv-
ices (which standalone DVRs can’t do). Note:
• Satellite users usually buy the DVR/receiver.
• Cable users usually rent equipment from the cable 
company.
Chapter 12: Getting Into DVRs 129

 DVR recorder DVRs: Our favorite standalone DVRs have a
built-in DVD recorder. A DVD recorder solves the biggest issue
most DVR owners run into — what to do with all those back
episodes of your favorite show when your hard drive starts to
get full. With a DVD recorder, you “burn” a DVD archive and
clear your hard drive for new recordings.
 Using your PC: There are a couple of ways to use a PC:
• If you have a Windows XP Media Center PC, you have a
DVR. These PCs already have the hardware and software
to record TV programs; the stuff works just like a regular
DVR.
• You can turn a standard PC into a DVR by adding some
inexpensive hardware and software.
Chapter 16 covers the equipment you need if you want to use
a PC as a DVR.
One way TiVo is fighting back is by turning to the Internet. TiVo has
announced that it will offer a new service to its broadband (cable-
or DSL-modem-equipped) customers — an Internet service will
allow customers to download movies, video, and music directly to
their TiVo DVRs. Basically, this service is designed to both supple-
ment and to bypass regular TV sources — providing TiVo with a
compelling service of their own to keep people buying TiVo DVRs
(and to keep them subscribing to TiVo services). Check whether
it’s available at www.tivo.com.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
130
Using your DVR on the Net
TiVo, one of the originators of the whole DVR concept, has been facing an uncer-
tain future as DVRs are built into more and more devices (such as cable services’
set-top boxes and Media Center PCs). Indeed the company faces a bit of a squeeze
as cable and satellite companies develop their own PVRs that may be more con-
venient for cable and satellite customers than using a standalone TiVo.

I
n our collective rush to sift through the $5 DVD bins at Wal-
Mart, it’s easy to overlook the good ol’ VCR that sits precari-
ously atop many of our TV sets at home. DVDs are cooler, packed
with more data, and they’re . . . well . . . digital.
But almost all of us have a lot of investment in the VCR — ranging
from the scores of VHS files purchased over the years, to the
recorded broadcast and home movies that make up our VHS col-
lections. It may not be a big investment, dollarwise, but we often
have an emotional investment in those old tapes! Even in the face
of several generations of higher-quality video options — laser disc,
DVDs, satellite, and now HDTV and DVRs — it’s hard to part with
our dependable VHS VCR.
That’s because the venerable VCR is simply a useful device — and
it has even been remaking itself for this new, high-definition world.
In this chapter, we talk about how to get your old VCR hooked up
to your HDTV so you can dust off those old taped episodes of LA
Law (you ’80s fan, you!); we also discuss some of the (few) new dig-
ital VCR models hitting the market that you might want to investi-
gate to upgrade your taping capabilities.

Checking Out Your Digital Options
If you stroll into your neighborhood electronics store, or surf for
VCRs online, you’ll see three kinds of VCRs available today:
 VHS VCRs: Familiar to all, these are the standard VCRs you’ve
seen in stores for almost 30 years. These VCRs use VHS video-
cassettes and record a low-resolution TV signal — about 240
lines of resolution (a third of the 720 lines you get with HDTV!).
These VHS VCRs can come cheap (less than $50) or expensive
(more than $800); most include stereo audio capabilities (if 
so, they’re labeled HiFi) and analog Dolby surround-sound
capabilities.
 S-VHS VCRs: The S-VHS (or Super VHS) VCR provides a
higher-quality, higher-resolution image — 400 lines, instead of
about 240. In the midst of the craze for more resolution, you’d
be forgiven for guessing that film buffs would have jumped at
the first S-VHS VCRs back when they were introduced, but
they’ve been slow to take off, for several reasons:
• With the early models, you had to buy more expensive
(and harder-to-find), specialized tapes to record in S-VHS
mode.
• You can’t play an S-VHS tape in a regular VCR (but you
can do the reverse).
• S-VHS VCRs themselves have been significantly pricier
than the standard-format VCRs on the market.
• There were very few prerecorded movies available in the
S-VHS format.
Lately, however, S-VHS VCRs have made a bit of a comeback,
driven by lower equipment pricing — S-VHS VCRs start off
at around $120 — and a new technology boost in the form
of S-VHS-ET (Expansion Technology), introduced by JVC. 
S-VHS-ET allows an S-VHS VCR to record a full S-VHS signal on
regular VHS tape. There’s also the fact that higher-resolution
source material from camcorders, satellite and digital cable
transmission — and the ensuing display of recorded tapes
on higher-definition displays — have raised the bar for video
recorders as well. (You really notice poor resolution when it’s
50 inches and 1280 x 720 in front of you!)
There’s very little difference in pricing between a high-quality
VHS VCR and an S-VHS VCR (really cheap VHS VCRs are a lot
cheaper, of course). If you’re already spending 100 bucks or so
for a hi-fi VCR, we think you should find the extra $20 to get
into an S-VHS model.
Part IV: Movie Machines 
132

You’ll also find a few VCRs on the market that are labled
“Quasi-SVHS”. These units will play back S-VHS tapes, but only
at the lower VHS resolution. They’re handy if you don’t care
about the higher resolution, but have some S-VHS (or S-VHS-C
camcorder) tapes that you want to watch.
 D-VHS VCRs: If you’re going whole-hog high-def, then you
want to look at a high-definition VCR — specifically, the D-VHS
VCR. D-VHS VCRs can play and record standard VHS and S-VHS
formats. More importantly D-VHS VCRs can also record and
play back in all the HDTV formats (discussed in Chapter 21),
including 1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i.
To record and play back HDTV, the D-VHS system needs an
FireWire (also called i.LINK or IEEE 1394) connector to con-
nect to an HDTV TV or a standalone HDTV tuner. Many HDTVs
and HDTV tuners don’t have a FireWire connection, however,
because broadcasters and movie studios don’t want you to be
able to record HDTV programs. So be sure of your connection
options before plunking down the cash for a D-VHS VCR.
The D-VHS VCR sounds like a great idea — and indeed, if you
tape a lot, this might be the VCR for you. However, you’re
probably going to be disappointed with its use on a day-to-day
basis, for a couple of reasons:
• D-VHS would be pretty cool, if many people weren’t
restricted from using it for its intended purpose —
recording HDTV shows for later playback. Unfortunately,
there’s a fundemental disconnect between the HDTV
connection provided on D-VHS decks (FireWire), and
that found on the majority of HDTV tuners/set-top boxes
(DVI).
• There are only limited number of movies available on
prerecorded D-VHS videocassettes — truly a small
number (less than a hundred) compared to what you
can get on DVD (tens of thousands).
Many people who used to use VCRs a lot are focusing on DVRs 
(see Chapter 12) or are using DVDs, particularly as HDTV-capable
DVD formats are being announced and heading to market (see
Chapter 11). As a result, D-VHS VCRs have not really taken the
market by storm — and really dropped in price recently as a 
result (they can be had for about $600). The D-VHS VCR category 
is largely heading for Laserdisc status (that is, dead), or at least
confined to a niche market of D-VHS enthusiasts.
Chapter 13: Taping Time 133

What will really nail the coffin of the D-VHS system is the advent of
HDTV-capable DVD systems — particularly when these offer
recording capability to users. Combine a high-def DVR with a
recordable Blu-ray DVD system and you have the best of all
worlds. No tapes to mess with, just pure, digital, skip-right-to-
where-you-want-to-be-without-rewinding bliss.
Given that this is a book on HDTV and not on VCRs (and that the
main high-definition angle to VCRs is D-VHS), we’re going to spend
the rest of this chapter talking about how to hook up your VCR
into your HDTV system for best viewing. We also look at one of the
only D-VHS products actually on the market as we write. If you
want to know more about VCRs in general, try checking out
http://hometheater.about.com.
Connecting VCRs to HDTVs
You often have a choice of connections/cable types to use when
connecting source devices (such as VCRs) to your HDTV (Chapter 3
covers the details). Choosing which of these connections to use can
be (initially) a bit confusing, but they fall into a hierarchy — and
when you get a handle on that, matters get easier: Just pick the best
connection option available on both ends of the connection.
When it comes to VCR connection options, we can make it even
easier for you. You have three choices, depending on what kind of
VCR you own:
 Connecting VHS VCRs: If you have a VHS VCR (not an S-VHS
model), you have only two choices — you can connect using a
composite video cable (and a pair of audio cables), or you can
use the coaxial cable output of the VCR. We recommend that
you use the composite video cable — it delivers a much
better picture than coaxial cable.
 Connecting S-VHS VCRs: These VCRs add an S-video connector
(that’s where the name came from originally — even though 
S-video connections are now found on DVD players, set-top
boxes, game consoles, and other source devices). S-video pro-
vides a much better picture than composite video, so use this
connection (and a pair of audio cables) to connect your S-VHS
videocassette recorder.
 Connecting a D-VHS VCR: You need to use component video
cables to get HDTV signals into an HDTV display. So it should
come as no surprise that the preferred connection method for
Part IV: Movie Machines 
134

the HDTV-capable D-VHS VCR is a triumvirate (yep, there’s a
troika — three — of them) of component video cables. You’ll
also want to use a digital audio cable (optical or coaxial) to
take advantage of the digital surround-sound signals recorded
on D-VHS high-definition recordings.
If you don’t use the component video cable, you can’t view
HDTV recordings in high definition.
In addition to these “playback” connections, which enable you to
view videocassettes played on your VCR, you’ll also want to make
a “recording” connection between your TV source and your VCR.
Your options are many, and depend greatly on a whole host of vari-
ables regarding what else you’ve connected to your HDTV (and
how it’s connected). Here are some general rules to follow:
 If you have a D-VHS deck, and you want to record in HDTV, the
answer is simple. You need to connect your HDTV tuner to the
D-VHS using the FireWire (or iLINK) cable. There is no other
option — which severely limits the usefulness of the D-VHS, 
as few HDTV tuners have functioning FireWire connections
that will make this work.
 For a non-HDTV VCR recording, your options depend on two
things: whether you’ve connected a home-theater receiver as
part of your overall HDTV home-theater system, and whether
you require a set-top box or satellite receiver for non-DTV TV
channels.
• If you’re using a home-theater receiver (discussed 
in Chapter 19), take advantage of this device’s video-
switching capabilities. You can connect all your video
source devices (such as DVD players, cable set-top
boxes, and satellite receivers) into a set of inputs on 
the receiver. Then you can use the outputs on the back 
of the receiver to connect both your HDTV (for viewing)
and your VCR (for recording). This is the best, and most
flexible, way of connecting your VCR for recording.
• If you don’t have a home-theater receiver, you have to
connect your VCR inline between your TV source and
your HDTV. This could be as simple as plugging an
antenna cable into the back of your VCR (to the TV In
connection) and then using another antenna cable
(coaxial cable) to connect the TV Out jack on your VCR
to the Antenna input on your VCR. If you have a set-top
box or satellite receiver, you need an extra set of S-video
or composite-video cables to make this connection.
Figure 13-1 shows a VCR installed inline.

Looking Closer at D-VHS
So if you have high-definition leanings (and why else would you be
reading HDTV For Dummies?), you at least owe it to yourself to con-

 Here’s what you can expect to do with it:
• Record over-the-air broadcasts
• Watch D-VHS prerecorded tapes
• Store HDTV camcorder content to D-VHS
 Here’s what you may not be able to do with it:
• Record cable or satellite broadcasts (many set-top
boxes lack a FireWire port to send digital signals to the
D-VHS, due to copyright concerns — and some that do
have the capability don’t have it enabled by software, so
it’s a useless connection that won’t work).
 Here’s what you can’t do with it:
• Make tapes of your favorite Hollywood DVD movies. 
(A copy-protection system called Macrovision keeps you
from doing so, and it’s built into all DVDs and all VCRs.
Even if you want to copy your favorite movie from DVD
to VHS to play back on a VCR in your vacation home or
somewhere else, you’re just plain out of luck.)
If these benefits and limitations seem reasonable to you, then con-
sider getting a D-VHS VCR. When it comes to playing and recording
high-def signals, you have to go D-VHS or you’re simply not getting
all you can out of your HDTV lifestyle! No other format can match
those high-res images, baby . . .
. . . at least not yet. When high-def DVD discs and players hit the
market (and they’ve been announced as we write, but can’t be
bought in stores yet), their resolutions will equal those of D-VHS.
The D-VHS VCRs use high-capacity D-VHS tapes to record HDTV
broadcasts at their full resolution. They can upconvert or down-
convert HD recordings on playback to match your TV’s display
rate (even when connected to a regular analog TV).
D-VHS VCRs typically can do some other hand things:
 Record/play Digital VHS, Super VHS, Super VHS ET, and stan-
dard VHS formats
 Store (on one DF-420 D-VHS tape) up to 3.5 hours of material
in HS mode (28.2 Mbps), 7 hours in STD mode (14.1 Mbps),
21 hours in LS3 mode (4.7 Mbps) or 35 hours in LS5 mode
(2.8 Mbps)
Chapter 13: Taping Time 137

The higher the bit rate (the preceding Mbps numbers) the less
compressed the video is, and the better it looks.
 Record/play at 1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i resolutions
 Record/play 5.1-channel Dolby Digital and DTS HDTV broad-
casts for surround sound
 Play HiFi stereo VHS and S-VHS for Dolby Pro Logic surround
sound
You’ll find some other VCR features from regular VHS/S-VHS VCRs
that you might recognize. For example, you might find VCR Plus+,
which allows an average human being to record a certain show at 
a certain time more easily. With this system, all you have to do is
punch in a special code that is listed next to the show you want to
record in your paper’s TV listings (or in TV Guide). More advanced
versions of VCR Plus+ (called Silver and Gold) allow you to localize
your VCR Plus+ settings for your area.
VCR Plus+ is handy, but once you’ve used a slick DVR interface
(such as TiVo’s), you’ll never want to go back to using even the
finest VCR system! Of course, you can only record HDTV on a TiVo
if you buy a $1,000 DirecTV TiVo system.
At the time of this writing, we could only find one or two D-VHS
products left on the market (and we looked a lot!). The most popular
and prominent is JVC’s HM-DH4000U (see Figure 13-2). As an indica-
tion of the market acceptance of D-VHS thus far, the list price for
JVC’s only D-VHS model (and JVC invented/promoted the D-VHS!) is
$999.95, but you can get it at Crutchfield (which has competitive but
not hugely discounted prices) for $599.99 — 40 percent off! So if you
want one, we’d advise you to move quickly, because these might not
be around much longer.

ho said HDTVs had to be all about watching DVDs
and high-deﬁnition satellite signals? We sure didn’t.
In fact, there are all sorts of other ways to get high-deﬁnition
signals on and off your HD system — so many that we 
created this special part to talk about them.
We’ll discuss all the high-deﬁnition implications of your
PS2, Xbox, Nintendo, or other gaming console, including
noting which consoles allow you to play DVDs on your
HDTV. (Now, that’s double duty.)
For example, we’ll talk about what to do with your cam-
corder if you want to view your home movies in 1280-x-
720-pixel mode (and what to think about when you crave a
new high-deﬁnition camcorder for those really ﬁne-looking
shots of your kids in pumpkin-head Halloween outﬁts).
Then the fun really begins, as we discuss the wide range of
gadgets that are popping up to accentuate your HDTV pur-
chase. We’ll talk about souped-up PCs designed to support
your HDTV-powered home theater, video jukeboxes that
make watching another movie truly point-and-click, and
how to take a bath with your HDTV (shocking isn’t it . . .
oh, bad pun!).
We wrap with a discussion of how to take advantage of
your HDTV from all over the home, with tips, tricks and
guidance on home networking. Pat and Danny wrote the
book on this, well, actually two books — Smart Homes For
Dummies and Wireless Home Networking For Dummies —
so you get a great introduction to how to access HDTV in
a whole-home way.

ideo game consoles and HDTVs can be great together. The
graphics engines (the chips within the console that create
video images) in today’s video-gaming machines are incredibly
powerful and capable of very high resolutions. While there aren’t 
a lot of games on the market that offer higher than standard-
definition (480 lines) resolution, you can find many widescreen,
progressive-scan games that look awesome on your HDTV screen.
Understanding Consoles
If you’re of a “certain age” (like us), you remember the original
Atari consoles and games like Pong — crude black-and-white
graphics only. If you’ve not kept up with video games since then,
you’d be shocked at the amazingly realistic graphics that today’s
video-game console systems produce.
Today’s market-leading video-game consoles — the Sony
PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, and the Microsoft Xbox —
are actually powerful computers that have been specially config-
ured to play video games. In fact, these consoles are so “computer-
like” that they can be set up (with official or unofficial software) for
such cool non-game functions as surfing the Web, running Linux
programs, and checking e-mail.
Some high-end TV aficionados look down their noses at game con-
soles. Don’t let this attitude (which we think is dying off) bug you
at all. We think game consoles are perfectly fine for HDTV.

These are the key features of the latest game consoles:
 Powerful graphics engines provide true HDTV (such as 1080i
format) — provided the game uses high-resolution video.
 S-Video and component-video connections bring higher-
quality video into your television.
 Optical drives (usually DVD) store game software, which
means more storage space for better graphics.
 Surround-sound formats (such as Dolby Digital) provide a
truly immersive gaming experience.
If an image stays still for too long on-screen, it can cause burn-in —
the phosphor coating on the screen stays illuminated with a certain
image long enough for it to become permanent. (Hey, that’s why
screen-savers were invented.) Susceptible TVs — such as plasma
screens, CRT projection systems and — to a lesser degree — CRT
direct-view TVs — can suffer burn-in from excessive gaming. When
you have burn-in, you always see a “ghost” image on-screen of
whatever has become burned in. Certain images tend to be in the
same place all the time when you play a game (like your race car’s
speedometer, or your ammo indicator), so you could experience
burn-in if you put in lots of gaming time. You can pretty much
avoid this problem by simply
 Setting up your TV properly (brightness down)
 Not gaming for hours and hours every day
LCD (liquid-crystal display) screens, LCD projectors, and DLP TVs
are immune to burn-in. They’ll take as much gaming as you (and
your sore thumbs!) can throw at them.
Meet the Consoles
You may have an older gaming console (or three) lying around the
house — such as an original PlayStation or a Super NES system. By
all means, if you’d like, connect these to your HDTV. You may just
have one old game that you can’t help but pull out and play every
once in a while (for Pat it’s the old Nintendo version of Dr. Mario that
he just can’t give up). Just keep in mind that these older consoles
(typically using an RF modulator or — at best — a composite video
connection) won’t rock your world on an HDTV. Aside from the
primitive graphics, the resolution is limited to standard-definition
specs.
Part V: Monitor Madness
142

We focus our attentions in this chapter on the latest versions of
the major gaming consoles (the Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft con-
soles), because these give you the best results with your HDTV. All
of these consoles have been on the market for a few years, they’ve
become quite affordable (well under $200 each), and there are hun-
dreds of games for each system.
The PlayStation 2
The most popular gaming console — and the one with the most
games available — is Sony’s PlayStation 2. As with all the consoles
we’re discussing, the PS2 (that’s what all the cool kids call it) is
really a powerful computer, based on a 300 MHz CPU (central pro-
cessing unit). 300 MHz may not sound fast (compared to a 3 GHz
Pentium 4 PC), but the PS2 has some other stuff that makes it great
for games, including these goodies:
 A powerful graphics chip: Called the Graphics Synthesizer,
this chip — not the CPU — does all the heavy lifting to create
the gaming images that show up on your HDTV screen.
 32 MB of RAM: Computer memory to hold the actual game
code being executed by the CPU and the Graphics
Synthesizer.
 A DVD-ROM drive: PS2 games are burned onto DVD discs —
you can also use this drive to play regular DVDs and CDs, and
even older PlayStation (the original version) games.
 Ports and connections: The PS2 is loaded with ports and con-
nections for attaching peripherals — including connectors for
game controllers and USB peripherals, a slot for memory
cards, and an i.LINK (FireWire) port for connecting multiple
PS2s together for head-to-head gaming.
 An optional network kit: For the ultimate in PS2ing, you can
buy a network kit that provides an Ethernet interface for con-
necting the PS2 to a home network and the Internet. Online
gaming is the ultimate goal here — the ability to play with
people thousands of miles away! (We talk more about home
networking in Chapter 17.)
The PS2’s graphics capabilities could theoretically support HDTV
resolutions, but the system is designed for lower resolutions. With
the optional component video cables — and a game that supports
it — you can have progressive-scan gaming (480p) on your HDTV.
Chapter 14: Gaming Consoles 143

The PS2 can support Dolby Digital 5.1-channel surround sound (as
long as you use a digital-audio cable to connect the PS2 to your
A/V receiver or surround-sound decoder). Most games, however,
provide only two-channel stereo sound.
The back of a game’s packaging has the Dolby Digital logo if a game
supports Dolby Digital.
Gaming with the Cube
Another popular choice among gamers (particularly the younger
crowd — if you have kids, you probably already know this) is
Nintendo’s GameCube. The GameCube is slightly less powerful
than the PS2 or the Microsoft Xbox, but it makes up for this by
being the cheapest console at $99.99 retail. The GameCube is also
amazingly compact (6 inches or less in all directions).
Nintendo (in what we assume is a cost-saving measure) has, as of
the summer of 2004, removed component-video connection capa-
bility from new GameCubes. Many games support 480p progressive
scan, but you won’t get that through a new GameCube. If progres-
sive scan is important to you, consider looking for a used
GameCube on eBay or elsewhere.
So what’s inside the GameCube? How about all this good stuff
crammed into that small package . . .?
 A powerful graphics processor: Jointly designed by ATI (big
in the PC graphics chip market) and Nintendo, this chip
(codename: Flipper) can crank out up to 12 million polygons
per second — which is a lot of video on-screen.
 40 MB of system memory: For storing gaming code.
 Four ports for gaming controllers: So three friends can come
over and play head to head.
 Two memory card slots: For storing game “state” informa-
tion, so you can start back up where you left off.
 A proprietary optical disc that’s smaller than traditional
DVDs or CDs: In other words, no double duty as a DVD player
for the GameCube.
As we mentioned earlier in this section, many GameCube games
can provide non-HDTV, progressive-scan signals (480p) to your
HDTV — but the hardware (at least in the latest versions) is lack-
ing. If you’ve got an older GameCube, you can take advantage of
this progressive-scan signal by using component-video cables.
Part V: Monitor Madness
144

If you want surround sound with GameCube games, set your A/V
receiver to Dolby Pro Logic II. The GameCube doesn’t have a digital
audio connection to hook up your surround-sound decoder, so
there’s no support for Dolby Digital surround sound.
X (box) marks the spot
The king of the gaming consoles for HDTV is the Microsoft Xbox.
That’s because the Xbox is the only console that
 Supports true HDTV outputs (720p or 1080i):
• Just connect the picture via component-video cables,
choose the right games, and you’re in HDTV gaming
heaven.
• The Xbox supports Dolby Digital 5.1 channel surround
sound, and many games support this directly.
 Has (at least a handful of) games that support HDTV:
Chapter 14: Gaming Consoles 145
Is it a console or a PC?
We’ve mentioned the fact that gaming consoles are really just specialized PCs
dressed up in fancy, living-room-friendly clothing. Well, a company called Apex
Digital (you may not have heard of them, but they are actually one of the world’s
largest manufacturers of DVD players, among other electronic gizmos) has just
announced a new console that’s even more PC than the rest.
The Apex Digital ApeXtreme Media & Game Console, due on the market by the time
you read this, is a special-purpose console designed for playing PC games (not PS2
or Xbox or GameCube games) on your TV instead of on your PC monitor.
Basically, the ApeXtreme console is a combination of a DVR (see Chapter 12), a DVD
player, and a gaming console, all in one slick package. We got to see an early pro-
totype at the Consumer Electronics show and were impressed — we still haven’t
seen the final version, but we’re waiting with bated breath.
The big advantage of this new console is that it plays any PC game (there are tons
and tons) — so you aren’t locked into a certain console type when you go to choose
games. All this for only $499 (list price).
You can find more information about the Media & Game Console on Apex Digital’s
Web site: www.apexdigitalinc.com.

It isn’t just the console that gives you an HDTV gaming experi-
ence — the game software must support HDTV, too. This sup-
port means loads of painstaking work for all the engineers and
artists creating the game, so there are just a few HDTV games
on the market as we write. We expect that this number will
grow — particularly as the next generation of these game 
consoles reaches the market.
The Xbox, more than any other console, is built around a PC-style
architecture. (This probably isn’t surprising, given that Microsoft is
involved.) The heart of the system is a fast CPU from the Pentium III
family. The graphics are handled by a scorchingly fast chip dubbed
the X Chip, built by NVIDIA (another big PC graphics-chip maker).
Other key components of the Xbox include the following:
 A built-in 8GB hard drive: Instead of using relatively small
memory cards, the Xbox has a generous-size hard drive for
saving game-state information. You can also “rip” your own 
CDs onto this hard drive to create your own game soundtracks.
 64MB of high-speed RAM: Not a lot of RAM by PC standards,
but considerably more than PS2 or GameCube for holding
game code.
 A built-in Ethernet port: While networking kits are optional
for the PS2 and GameCube, every Xbox includes this Ethernet
port for connecting to the Internet — and to online gaming via
a home network with a broadband cable or DSL connection.
 A DVD optical drive for games, CDs, and video DVDs: So you
can play DVDs and CDs with your Xbox (keep in mind, how-
ever, that the remote control that enables DVD playback is
optional).
Connecting to Your HDTV
When you connect a gaming console to your HDTV, it’s decision
time. Out of the box, each of these consoles usually has only
 A composite video connection (the yellow connector)
 A pair of analog audio cables (the red and white connectors)
If you’re buying one of the many, many different bundle packages,
you might get some different cables in your box, but it isn’t likely.
Video connections
Most video games come with a yellow composite video connector.
Part V: Monitor Madness
146

If you want to get the most from your gaming console and your
HDTV, consider buying a higher-quality S-Video or component-
video connection, in either of these ways:
 Directly from the manufacturer of your console
 From a third-party cable vendor like Monster Cable (which
sells a wide range of video console cables)
Going with composite
A composite-video connector provides the standard, out-of-the-
box” connection for any of these gaming consoles. A composite-
video connection is also the bottom of the video-connection
hierarchy; it gives you a lower-quality picture than either an 
S-Video or component-video connection.
If you aren’t playing any games that are specifically designed for
HDTVs (that is, no HDTV games on your Xbox, no 480p-resolution
games for any console), then this connection usually is adequate
(though not optimal). But we recommend you consider a better
connection.
An S-Video connection can provide a significant picture boost over
composite video for your console, but if you ever plan on playing
progressive-scan or HDTV games, you should definitely skip over
the composite-video connection and move on up to a component-
video connection.
If you use the composite video connection (maybe you’re just a
casual gamer, or the console is just for the kids and they move it
around a lot and can’t handle the complicated cabling), you can
connect several ways: All these methods work equally well.
 You can run a cable directly into one of the composite-video
inputs on the back of the HDTV set.
 You can use the front-panel input (if your TV has one).
 You can connect through your A/V receiver (if you’re using
one) and use its video-switching facilities.
If the game is for the kids, and they may either move it to the bed-
room TV or take it to a friend’s house, use the front panel connec-
tions on your TV — just to keep the kids from messing around with
any connections on the back of your system.
Stepping up to S-Video
S-Video is a big step up over composite video because it separates
the luminance and the chrominance (the brightness and the color
Chapter 14: Gaming Consoles 147

information in the video signal) onto their own conductors instead
of trying to cram all that information into one signal (on one con-
ductor) and then separate it when it’s inside the TV.
If you aren’t playing 480p or high-def games on your console, you
can probably just use S-Video to connect your console to the TV.
There’s a definite convenience factor at work here — your HDTV 
is bound to have more S-Video connections available than it does
component-video connections. In fact, most HDTV front-panel con-
nections include an S-Video connector, so you can easily plug and
unplug the console whenever you want to move it around.
S-Video connectors are the biggest pain-in-the-you-know-what in
the audio/video world. They’re prone to bent pins. If you’re going
to let the kids make this connection, make sure you teach them
how to line things up correctly before making the connection.
Depending on your equipment, you can connect S-Video the same
three ways as composite video: direct to the back of the TV, to the
front, or through an A/V receiver. Just pick the method that’s most
convenient for you.
Going component
When you really want the best for your HDTV gaming experience,
use component-video cables. They give you progressive-scan video
for games that support it, instead of just relying on your HDTV’s
internal scaler system to convert the game video to progressive
scan. Component-video cables also give you higher-resolution
video (at least on the Xbox) for true HDTV gaming.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, the very newest (as we write)
versions of the Nintendo GameCube console have had their compo-
nent-video support removed in a production change. You can still
use component-video cables with GameCubes built before the
summer of 2004, but not with the newest versions. Yes, we think
this was a stupid move, too!
There’s nothing complicated about using component-video cables
with your console — just buy the appropriate cable system and
plug it in. Keep in mind a couple of things:
 Most HDTVs don’t have component-video connections on the
front panel, so you must connect to the rear of the TV.
 Most HDTVs have few component-video connections (often
only one set), so you may have to decide whether to connect
your game, cable box, or DVD player to your HDTV.

If you don’t have enough component-video inputs on your TV,
you can route your game console through an A/V receiver’s
component-video switching system.
If you run component video through your A/V receiver, and you
want to get progressive scan (480p), make sure that your receiver’s
video switching has at least 10 MHz of bandwidth; to get HDTV, you
need at least 30 MHz of bandwidth. You can find out how much
bandwidth your video switch has by reading your A/V receiver’s
manual.
When you get your component-video connection set up, don’t
throw away that composite-video connector that came with your
console. We’ve heard that some combinations of HDTV and con-
soles play through component-video cables (and work well!) but
require a composite-video cable for some setup work in the con-
sole’s built-in menus and controls.
Dealing with audio
Your game system probably has two connectors (red and white)
for analog stereo sound. If your system has digital surround sound,
you may be able to connect it to your home-theater audio system
for wall-to-wall sound.
Analog audio
With analog audio cables, you can get some nice stereo sound from
your HDTV or A/V receiver. You can even — if your A/V receiver
supports Dolby Pro Logic II — get some synthesized (that is to say,
fake) surround sound.
Analog audio cables don’t have the true surround sound that’s
encoded in an increasing number of games. So you’ll miss out on
some fun audio effects (like the sounds of the bad guys creeping
up behind you — literally!).
Digital audio
To get true surround sound from a PS2 or Xbox console, you must
upgrade to a digital audio cable. This connection is made using a
Toslink optical cable — often sold as part of a package with the
component-video cables.
There’s no option for digital audio with the GameCube.
Usually, you connect this Toslink cable to one of the “digital audio
in” connectors on the back of an A/V receiver. Very few HDTVs
accept this connection directly to their own built-in audio systems.
Chapter 14: Gaming Consoles 149

For real surround sound, we highly recommend using a separate
A/V receiver and speaker system. This approach gives you use of
your five front, center, and rear speakers, plus a subwoofer — so
you can really feel those explosions rock the room.
What systems do we have? Pat loves his Xbox, and Danny’s kids
stick with their PS2 . . . all connected with component-video and
Toslink cables into our HDTVs. Nice, very nice.

 Checking out HD camcorders for the first time
 Looking at the world’s first consumer-HD camcorder
M
ost of our friends make the big camcorder purchase deci-
sion when they have their first child. There’s some sort of
parental angst about not having home movies of your kid’s first
views of the world.
Well don’t look now, but for people with an HDTV, the ante was just
upped, as the first HDTV camcorders are starting to hit the market.
That’s right, now you can start capturing live and in vivid HDTV
color anything you want. (While your guests might be bored with
the home movies, at least they’ll appreciate that they’ve got won-
derful high-definition clarity!).
Going HDTV for a camcorder will cost you — at the time of this
writing, there was only one consumer HDTV camcorder on the
market, the JVC (www.jvc.com) GR HD1, and that model runs
about $3,500. Still, we expect the natural progression of HDTV into
camcorders to continue; soon there will be lots more choice in the
marketplace.
In this chapter, we explore how standard SD camcorders fit into
your HDTV system, and then go into what distinguishes an HDTV
camcorder from this standard off-the-shelf fare, using the JVC GR
HD1 as a case study.

Part V: Monitor Madness 
152
Your Run-of-the-Mill SD Camcorder
Most of the concepts covered elsewhere in this book — in terms
of SD resolution, viewing SD images on your HDTV, connecting SD
devices to your HDTV, and the like — also apply to SD camcorders.
Whether you are using 8mm, VHS, DV, or some other analog or digi-
tal format, you can view it on your HDTV.
Connecting your camcorder 
to your HDTV
If you think back to Chapter 3, you have an idea about a concept
we strongly believe in: a hierarchy among the many connection
options available on most video sources (including camcorders).
That is to say, there’s a definite good-better-best rank order among
these connections.
 Going digital: If your HDTV has a FireWire (1394) input, you
may be able to use the FireWire connection on your camcorder
(found on most miniDV camcorders) to connect digitally. If this
works with your camcorder (and it doesn’t always work), it pro-
duces the best-quality picture on your HDTV. We expect to see
digital connections (either FireWire, DVI or HDMI) to become
available on more and more camcorders.
Even if both your HDTV and your camcorder have FireWire
connections, you may not be able to use them to connect the
two together. Check your camcorder’s manual — many times
you can only use FireWire for connecting to a PC.
You can use the FireWire connection to send your video to your
PC, edit it (using iMovie on a Mac, or Windows Movie Maker on
Windows XP), and then burn your own DVD or copy to your
D-VHS recorder (see Chapter 13). This gives you a very high-
quality video source for HDTV based on your home movies.
 Go with S-Video: Most modern camcorders (particularly
miniDV models) include an S-Video output. The S-Video con-
nection provides a better picture by separating the color and
brightness portions of your video onto separate cables —
allowing your HDTV to display them without having to use
the comb filter to separate these picture elements.
 The composite solution: The least attractive solution for con-
necting your camcorder to your HDTV is to use the yellow
composite-video connection. We always recommend using 
S-Video over composite video, but some older camcorders
simply don’t give you that option.

Some day in the future, we expect that non-HDTV camcorders will
also offer the component-video cable connection method — this will
make sense as more camcorders become capable of dealing with 
progressive-scan video. Right now, only HDTV camcorders can use
this connection method. In terms of our hierarchy, we place compo-
nent video below the digital connection methods, and above S-Video.
So while you may not know it, merely buying this book is helping
get more HDTV camcorders to market! Thanks for helping out.
Enter HD Camcorders
So if you can link your SD camcorder to your regular TV, what’s
the big deal with HD versions? Lots of pixels, for one thing — three
times as many pixels as the best offered by NTSC versions, encoded
as a standard MPEG-2 stream.
Ever wonder why the SD camcorders look so poor on your HDTV?
It’s simply a reflection of the lower resolution of the SD stream when
scaled up and viewed on your HD screen — the two were simply not
meant for each other.
But lots of pixels mean lots of megabytes, too. An uncompressed
1280 x 720 BMP file can be almost 3 megabytes in size — that’s just
a single frame of video (1/30th or 1/60th of a second’s worth of video!).
That’s the price of high-definition.
Of course, HD camcorders use a ton of computer horsepower to
compress these video frames down so they use less storage space —
but HDTV video still uses a ton!
Chapter 15: Camcorders 153
Why the wait for HDTV camcorders?
If you’ve been waiting for HDTV to come to your camcorder, it’s only been recently
that this has been made possible, for largely two reasons:
 It’s only been recently that the digital signal processors (DSPs) have become small
and smart enough to be able to handle the immense volume of data created by
the high-definition CCD imaging sensors in your camcorder. Each frame offers a
megapixel of resolution or more, and this has to be processed and recorded in
real time to digital video tape.
 It’s only been recently that consumers have cared! As the 4:3 television sets get
replaced by 16:9 sets, people can see HDTV in its native mode, and that means
a bigger market for the camcorder manufacturers to sell to.

Camcorders that record in HD formats are called HDV camcorders,
after the standard they use for recording (similar to the way many
standard definition camcorders are called MiniDV or Super8).
But with an HD camcorder, you’ll have lots of recording and play-
back modes that you can choose from.
 480i: Just like any 480 interlaced digital-video camcorder on the
market, you can create regular 4:3 30-frame-per-second video
streams, with the same old standard PCM 32 kHz 4-channel
(or 48 kHz stereo) audio.
 480p: A step up is 480 progressive-scan video at 60 frames per
second (fps). Here the camera records at double the frame rate.
 720p: This widescreen 16:9 HD format is what you buy an
HD camcorder for. Current camcorders are providing 30 fps
for 720p video, but we expect in the future we’ll see full
60 fps 720p.
 1080i: HDTV camcorders may also be capable of converting
their 720p video to 1080i. This could be useful if you’re connect-
ing your camcorder to an HDTV that expects (and requires) a
1080i input — some CRT-based HDTVs work this way.
If you’re confused by all the FPS and progressive/interlaced infor-
mation, check out Chapter 21, where we explain it all in detail!
When dealing with the higher resolution and more detailed image
of a high-definition camcorder movie and its display, everything is
more noticeable. Errors such as shaky handheld shots, too much
panning, and zooming too fast can make people dizzy (if not nause-
ated) when viewed on large display. Think about using a tripod
more or bracing yourself more securely when making videos.
Other than the resolution, much of the camcorder will look familiar
to you — expect the same high-speed interfaces (such as FireWire)
and the same tape formats (such as DV).
Checking Out the First 
HDV Camcorder
While there have been specialty camcorders that offer HD, and for
some time (see sidebar, “Live from outer space — in HDTV”), the
first consumer-oriented and -priced product came from JVC: the
GR-HD1 camcorder, which retails around $3,500 but can be had on
the street (or Internet) for $2,700 or less. Figure 15-1 shows this
HDTV beauty.
Part V: Monitor Madness 
154

Figure 15-1: Record in high-def with the GR-HD1.
The GR-HD1 camcorder gives you a way to get your personally
recorded 1280-by-720-pixel content to your HDTV system and even
archived on your D-VHS VCRs (discussed in Chapter 13), which are
also sold by JVC and can play back prerecorded D-Theater HDTV
movies. JVC includes a FireWire interface and software with the
camcorder that converts 720-lines-of-resolution, progressive-scan
HD footage (720p) into progressive-scan, anamorphic widescreen
DVDs using your PC — that’s cool! Material recorded either in DV
or HD format can be downconverted or upconverted as needed for
playback (depending upon what format your HDTV requires).
If you have a Macintosh, you’re going to be disappointed. Editing
with the JVC is done in the Windows XP environment with bundled
software. There are also a couple of manufacturers that sell a plug-
in for HDV editing with Final Cut Pro.
You can record at 480i, 480p, or 720p, depending on your prefer-
ences. JVC supports 720p at 30 fps (actually 29.97fps, but who’s
counting?), and some people prefer filming at the 60fps of 480p in
order to get a smoother flow of the action. The 480p format is lower
in resolution, but looks smoother due to the higher frame rate, and
retains the 16:9 widescreen format — so it’s great for creating DVDs
(which can’t handle 720p anyway).
Note that when shooting video with the JVC camcorder in standard
480 DV mode, you can record to the DV tape in both SP and LP
modes — as you can with your existing SD camcorder. But when
you shift to recording in either the 1080i or 720p mode, the unit
shoots only in SP mode. This limits how much you can tape in HD
mode to a one-hour maximum per tape.
Chapter 15: Camcorders 155

Audio is recorded using MPEG-2 compression at 384 Kbps for both
the 480p and 720p modes. Unfortunately, the GR-HD1 does not sup-
port four-channel audio or audio overdub, as does standard DV.
To get the best possible quality, play back your high-definition
recordings on a high-definition monitor. On the JVC GR-HD1, this
is possible only through an analog component-video or FireWire
output interface. The recorder hooks up to computers and other
devices via FireWire.
One great thing about the JVC is that they did not complicate the
move to an HDTV camcorder by introducing a new tape format, too
(and the last thing we need is another gaggle of tape formats). The
JVC uses standard Mini DV tapes to store HDTV content. If you look
at Table 15-1, you can see that nothing is compromised, though by
using DV tapes — there is more than enough space on the tape for a
19.7-megabit HD content stream. You’re using three times the pixels
of a standard NTSC DVD stream when you’re in 720p mode with a
speed of 30 fps; naturally you need three times the bandwidth.

While JVC is the first with a consumer HDTV-capable camcorder, it’s not the only big
consumer electronics company to get into the act. As we were finishing HDTV For
Dummies, Sony announced the HDR-FX1 – a new three-CCD design (meaning it has
a separate chip for recording red, green, and blue images). The HDR-FX1 isn’t on
the market yet, but will retail for 400,000 yen on the Japanese market. The HDR-FX1
is expected to be available outside Japan by the end of 2004.

Live from outer space — in HDTV
We’re used to having ultra-nice pictures from space of the Earth in all its glory, but we
bet you’d never guess that HDTV was involved. That’s right, even the space shuttle
crew is into HDTV camcorders. HDTV equipment flew as early as STS-95 (1998), and
included a Sony HDW-700A high-definition television camcorder, wide-angle lens,
battery packs, and video recording tapes.
NASA is using the high-resolution images to provide clearer pictures about life on
the Space Station and to improve the documentation of space exploration. 
The system is enhancing the capability of NASA scientists, researchers, and engi-
neers to conduct their research, monitor experiments, and record the data visually.
HDTV also allows the public to experience NASA’s explorations more realistically by
making the footage available over NASA TV.
So here’s a tip from those who learned the hard way: Next time you’re in space, watch
out for space radiation — it can cause degradation in your Charge Coupled Device
(CCD) image sensor (the silicon chip inside the camera — a rectangular array of
light-sensitive cells). The degradation showed up on NASA pictures early on, as a
loss of several pixels on images taken on board. The camera lost between 5 and 15
pixels per day. So they created a self-correcting camera that replaces the bad pixels
with an average of the luminance and chroma from adjacent pixels. Problem solved.
(That’s your tax money at work!)

W
e love gadgets. If you are getting into HDTV, we expect
you’re no different from us (or the rest of the world).
In this chapter, we cover cool HDTV gadgets that can act as direct
sources of content to enhance your video oasis. Whether it’s a high-
powered home-theater PC or specialty gear destined to connect to
your HDTV, you can really boost your HDTV’s usage with just the
right accenting gear.
HDTV technology itself is only slowly starting to infiltrate the gadg-
ets that you’d use with your HDTV system — in other words, most
of the stuff in this chapter doesn’t send an HDTV signal to your
HDTV. There aren’t many true HDTV gadgets out there yet, but we
tell you what’s available today and where to find it.
Home Theater PCs
While nearly all of today’s PCs are multimedia-capable (they can
display pictures, play sounds, and show video), a select few PCs
can be considered Home Theater PCs (HTPCs) that can feed video
(and surround sound audio) into an HDTV.
HTPCs are simply high-powered PCs running the Windows, Linux
or Mac operating system (the majority use Windows), which have
been specially configured with hardware and software that lets them
operate as the DVD player, TV tuner, or even DVR (see Chapter 12)
source for your HDTV.

No rigid set of rules defines what makes a regular PC into a HTPC,
but here’s what we recommend:
 Video card: Perhaps the most important item in an HTPC (par-
ticularly one that feeds video into an HDTV) is the video card.
This specialized set of computer chips spares the computer’s
CPU from most of the “heavy lifting” of video processing. Both
ATI’s Radeon series (www.ati.com) and NVIDIA’s GeForce series
(www.nvidia.com) include high-end video cards that can sup-
port HDTV resolutions and support HTPC applications.
 Audio card: If you want to support the surround sound
(Dolby Digital and other systems like DTS) found in HDTV
broadcasts and on DVDs, you need a relatively high-end audio
card in your PC. A card like the Sound Blaster Audigy or
Audigy 2 (www.soundblaster.com) is a good choice.
 CPU: There isn’t a hard-and-fast rule here, but you build an
HTPC around a PC with a fast processor. Look for either
• A 2.8GHz or faster Pentium 4 processor
Microsoft requires a 3GHz Pentium 4 for full 1080i HDTV
playback with Windows Media.
• An AMD Athlon 64 3200+ processor
 Hard drive: You need a decent-size hard drive on any media-
centric PC. Media take up room; you need enough to store
such data as MP3 and other music files.
If you want an HTPC as a DVR feeding your HDTV, go for
• At least 200 gigabytes of hard drive space
• Plenty of FireWire jacks for attaching more hard drives
 TV tuner: If you want to use the HTPC as a DVR, a TV tuner
card is essential. Most of the DVR hardware/software kits on
the market include a TV tuner.
If you just want the PC for playing DVDs or Internet content, a
TV tuner card inside your HTPC might not be important.
 Software: There’s a wide range of software you might eventu-
ally want for your HTPC — such as software that turns your
PC into a PVR or organizes your media library.
The most important software may be a video-utility application
such as Powerstrip (http://entechtaiwan.net/util/
ps.shtm) that helps you perfectly match the resolution of
your video card output to your HDTV.
Part V: Monitor Madness 
160

A great place to get advice, see the results of people’s projects,
and generally dig into the topic of HTPCs is on the AVS Forum
Web site (www.avsforum.com). Check out the section titled
“Video Processors and HTPC” for all the info you could ever want.
An easy way to get into the HTPC game is to buy a new Media
Center PC with the Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition
operating system. Media Center PCs meet stringent minimum 
hardware requirements that allow them to work as HTPCs right
out of the box. The big advantage of an MCE PC (besides having
the hardware checklist all “X’d” off) is the software — the Media
Center software provides a really nicely integrated experience for
such home-theater functions as DVD playback, DVR functionality,
and TV-watching.
MCE PCs are optimized for connections to widescreen HDTV sets,
but not all MCE PC functions (such as the DVR function) support
HDTV resolutions today. We expect that HDTV will be an even bigger
part of the experience in future MCE PCs.
If you’re interested in a lot more information about MCE PCs, check
out another one of our books — Windows XP Media Center 2004 PCs

Hi-definition fun
If you’ve never visited AtomFilms (atomfilms.shockwave.com), you are miss-
ing out on one the greatest sites on the Web. Atom Films, which was bought by
Shockwave, specializes in creating and buying all sorts of animated and live-action
independent film shorts and making them available on its site. Under each section,
you can find the top five shorts for that genre. Be sure to check out the comedy sec-
tion. The most popular comedy when we visited was Survivin’ the Island, a funny look
at what happens to Survivor stars when they return from the island.
But what’s really distinctive about AtomFilms is its new Hi-Def service (http://
atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/spotlight/collections/hidef/). Hi-
Def is a free service that really brings together broadband and HDTV. It automatically
delivers AtomFilms hits to your computer for near-DVD quality viewing on your HDTV.
Each week, Hi-Def will deliver three cool films using the idle bandwidth on your
computer system. Films arrive automatically — all you have to do is sit back and
enjoy them in their full-screen, Hi-Def glory. Films are yours to watch as many times
as you want until they expire two weeks later. When older films expire, new films
automatically appear to take their place. This is simply too much fun.

Video Jukeboxes
It isn’t unusual to find movie junkies with thousands of DVDs.
Organizing and accessing these DVDs can be troublesome at best,
and the more you have, the harder it is to find one movie that you
really wanted to watch. Enter video jukeboxes, gallantly riding to
the rescue.
Jukebox 101
A DVD video jukebox does what you’d think — stores massive
numbers of DVDs so that you can watch them on your HDTV in
a more organized and accessible way (which is great when you
want to watch movies all over the house).
The entry-level video jukebox is the megachanger, also called a DVD
carousel. These DVD devices can store 300 or more DVDs and play
any of them (usually one at a time). Some DVD changers can even
control a second changer (doubling the capacity, for example, from
400 discs to 800)!
A DVD jukebox needs the following features (which become more
and more essential the as the jukeboxes get bigger):
 A library function that can keep track of what disc is in
which slot
 An easy way to access that library function, such as 
• An OSD (on-screen display) that you see on your HDTV
• An LCD screen display on the jukebox itself
 An easy way to feed information into the library
The easiest way to enter information is a PC keyboard, not the
remote control. Depending on the jukebox, you connect a key-
board in one of two ways: 
• Directly to the jukebox
• By linking to a PC (usually a USB connection)
Check whether the device automatically looks up disc-title
information on the Internet — it can save you a ton of data-
entry time.
A video jukebox needs the same basic DVD player features that we
cover in Chapter 11, such as
Part V: Monitor Madness 
162

 Progressive scan
 Support for other disc formats, such as CD-R and MP3 CDs
 Support for new audio formats such as SACD or DVD-A
 A full range of digital audio outputs and HDTV-friendly video
outputs (such as component video)
Jukebox 301
For advanced students (okay, for those with more advanced budg-
ets!), you can leave behind the DVD jukebox, and move into the
hard-drive-based video jukebox.
These devices are really more properly classified as media servers —
computer-based devices that store various media (such as video,
audio, and photos) on a hard drive.
Media Mogul
A company named Molino (www.molinonetworks.com) is launching
a pair of these souped-up video jukebox servers: the Molino Media
Mogul and Media Mogul TB. These servers use large hard drives
(a terabyte in the case of the Mogul TB — 1,000 gigabytes — you
know, large!), and a sophisticated user interface (UI) designed by
Molino to control the system.
Media Mogul servers can “import” content from these sources:
 Any DVD (or CD) you own. The hard drive saves a perfect
copy (including any special menu items) that you can play
whenever you want, without needing to find the DVD itself.
 Digital pictures from your digital camera and home video from
your camcorder (via USB or FireWire cable connections — see
Chapter 3 for more on these connections).
The Moguls can connect to your HDTV via DVI video connections
(as well as standard analog video connections) — keep in mind,
however, that the DVDs you copy onto the Media Mogul aren’t
HDTV sources! The 300-gigabyte version of the Media Mogul costs
$995, and the 1-terabyte version costs $2,995.
Kaleidescape
The Kaleidescape System is a truly high-end media server solution
(www.kaleidescape.com).
Chapter 16: Gadgets 163

The big advantage of the Kaleidescape system is its modular, multi-
room support — but you’ll pay accordingly. A Kaleidescape system
can start at over $27,000 for the base system.
The Kaleidescape System is similar in functionality to the Media
Mogul systems, only everything is cranked up a bit. In particular,
the Kaleidescape is high-definition-ready, and supports 720p and
1080i HDTV. This multiroom system consists of
 A central server with interchangeable hard-drive cartridges
 A movie player that connects to your HDTV
As you expand your budget and desires, you can add movie
players connected to HDTVs (or any TV) in other rooms.
 A DVD reader
The whole system connects via Ethernet cabling (see Chapter 17
for details on Ethernet LANs). It can use a broadband (cable or
DSL modem) connection to the Internet to update content (like
the movie-guide service) and upgrade the system’s software.
Do the Roku
Roku Labs (www.rokulabs.com) has a fabulous product, the
HD1000 ($299). It’s an ultra-sleek, high-definition, digital media
player that’s the first to support HDTV. You can use the Roku
HD1000 to view stunning digital photos, music, video, and art on
your HDTV. Tired of having all your relatives crammed around
your PC monitor to see your latest pictures? Show them the
snaps on your HDTV. Want to show your artistic side during a
party? Why not display the latest art gallery quality photos of
Renaissance art? What a Renaissance man (or woman) you are!
The HD1000 is simply a worthwhile addition to your HDTV, even if
just for access to the Art Packs.
The HD1000 is better than standard non-HDTV digital media 
players, hands down. The Roku HD1000, unlike standard video
players, does two things to ensure that the image quality is not
compromised:
 It shows the image at HD output resolution. Its 1080i resolution
is equivalent to about 2 megapixels, which is a huge improve-
ment over the 1⁄3-megapixel output of standard non-HDTV digital
media players.
Part V: Monitor Madness 
164

A standard media player, when it displays photos from your
digital camera on your TV, scales down the picture by drop-
ping out information to fit the standard-definition format of
720 x 480 pixels. On a practical basis, this reduces the quality
of a picture from your 3- or 4-megapixel camera to a mere
1⁄3 megapixel — a huge reduction in quality. This is why stan-
dard-definition media players always make your pictures look
wimpy, even if they’re hooked up to a high-definition display.
 It stores all the pixels of the source image so you can zoom
and pan the image without losing clarity.
The Roku HD1000 also plays digital music files over your home 
network, so you can finally enjoy that growing MP3 library on your
home stereo system.
But what shakes Danny’s cerebrum is the Gallery Collection Art
Pack, which includes images of famous art and compelling photos
to turn your HDTV into a showcase. Roku offers themes like The
Classics, Nature, Aquarium, Space, Holiday and Clocks on Compact
Flash and CD-ROM. Way cool!
To hook up the HD1000 to your HDTV, just run a video cable from
the HD1000 to your TV (Component cables are included; VGA,
S Video, and composite are also supported). You can connect to
your home LAN via an Ethernet port. It even supports Wi-Fi to get
to your Internet connection too, if you’d like to get there that way.
We find nothing to complain about with this product.
There are a lot of other cool media-adapter products on the market
(like the Prismiq Media Player, found at www.prismiq.com, or the
Omnifi, found at www.omnifi.com) that can bridge the gap between
your PC and any TV so you can send audio, video, and photos. Not
much to say about these here; none of the popular models currently
support HDTV.

Making HDTV Wonderful
If you’re looking to build an HDTV-capable HTPC, one step you can take is to invest
in ATI’s new HDTV WONDER video card (http://www.ati.com/products/hdtvwonder/
index.html), or one of ATI’s ALL-IN-WONDER systems. The HDTV WONDER is an
add-on to your existing graphics card, and for just $199 it gives you all you need to
turn your desktop PC into an HDTV receiver — including a QAM/VSB tuner that can
pick up any of the over-the-air digital TV formats (both high-def and plain old digi-
tal TV) as well as old-fashioned analog TV broadcasts and non-scrambled cable TV
channels. The system also includes software that lets the system function as a PVR
(for both analog and high-def TV shows!), a remote and even an antenna for pick-
ing up HDTV broadcasts.
If your system doesn’t have a powerful enough graphics card (you need at least 64
Mbytes of RAM and DirectX 9.0 support), you can also consider one of the ATI ALL-
IN-WONDER packages, which combine the HDTV wonder with one of ATI’s graph-
ics cards.

W
e have a saying, “No HDTV is an island.” Okay, so that isn’t
really true — we don’t actually have a saying, but if we did
have one, that would be it. Why? Because your HDTV is too big an
investment not to get the most you can from it.
Indeed, that’s a major theme throughout this and the other books
we’ve written — if you are going to spend so much money on your
entertainment system, at least make sure you can access it from
elsewhere in the home to get the full return on your investment.
Your HDTV investment is not just the HDTV itself, but also your
A/V receiver, DVD, DVR, CD jukebox, and all your other audio/video
gear. That’s a lot of money.
In this chapter, we start with an introduction to the concept of home
networks, and give you an overview of the different physical kinds of
networks you may have (or want to install) in your home. Then we
get into detail about how home networks can complement HDTV —
by feeding media into your HDTV from the rest of the home, and by
providing a “backbone” that lets you access all the video “source”
devices located in your home theater or HDTV viewing room, using
a TV located anywhere in your home.

Layering Your House
The ideal HDTV-ready Home of Tomorrow (or maybe Next Thursday)
has several of these communications networks that you can use
with your HDTV:
 Telephone lines that bring your telephone service into the
house and distribute it to outlets in multiple rooms
 Coaxial cable that distributes cable or satellite TV
 Home computer networks — known to techies as local-area
networks or LANs — that connect computers to a shared
Internet connection and devices (such as printers)
Home computer networks can use wired or wireless 
technologies.
 Security networks that link such devices as smoke detectors
and infrared receivers to protect your home from fire and
break-ins
 Electrical power distribution to outlets throughout the house
may not dispense with wires, but you don’t have to add any . . .
“Wait,” you say, “That isn’t a communications network, is it?”
But yes, Watson, it can be — we explain in this chapter.
Building a home network in your home is all about these logical
communications layers in your home, and being able to hop from
one layer (such as your computer network) to another layer (such
as your coaxial cable network). You can use these different home
network elements (like a computer LAN) to get content to and from
your HDTV viewing room and the rest of your house, too!
The Center of Your HDTV Net
If you’re planning to hop from one layer to the other, it’s best to have
a central point where all your in-home networks come together. We
call this the wiring hub.
Usually, the wiring hub is where such communication paths as your
telephone line, cable connection, and alarm system enter the home.
What sort of connections might you have at your wiring hub? Well,
try these on for size:
 RG6 coaxial cabling — for cable and satellite signals
 Cat-5e/6 UTP cabling — for telephone and data signals
Part V: Monitor Madness 
168

 Wireless (2.4/5.8GHz) — wireless backbone for voice, data,
security, and other applications
 Audio cabling — for your whole home audio system
 Intercom cabling — for your whole home-intercom system
 Remote-control wiring — for your whole-home remote-
infrared network, so you can use your remote controls around
the house. (Many newer, RF-based remotes forego such wiring
requirements.)
 Home-automation wiring — for your X10 and other home-
control protocols over electrical or specialty wiring
 Alarm wiring — for your fire and burglary detectors and alarms 
At the wiring hub, you are best served to install a distribution
panel. A distribution panel is a cabling nirvana where you can
 Connect all your home’s cables
 Distribute signals throughout the home
Distribution panels are common in new homes. More than 80 per-
cent of new homes have such systems. If you don’t have one, 
consider it. In most instances, you can wire your home for
next generation services for $2,000 to $5,000, and really get the
most from your home’s computing and entertainment investment.
If you’re considering building out your home network, you need
our other books on these essential topics for any digital home:
 Smart Homes For Dummies covers how to design the infra-
structure in your home to move all these digital bits from
point A to point HDTV.
 Wireless Home Networking For Dummies applies the latest
wireless network technologies to your home network.
Getting Signals to Your HDTV
Half the HDTV home-networking equation revolves around getting
video content from different parts of your home into your HDTV.
This could mean bringing in content from the Internet, playing 
content that’s stored on your PC’s hard drive, or simply getting
TV signals from an antenna, satellite dish or cable-TV feeder line
into the room where your HDTV lives. Heck, you could even be like
Danny and hook up a wireless (Wi-Fi) camera to your system and
keep an eye on the kids in the backyard on your HDTV.
Chapter 17: Home Networking 169

Tapping into PC/Internet content
PCs can be great sources of video content (and content created
as other media, such as still pictures and music) for your HDTV
system. This content can come from a couple of sources:
 Within your own home — such as home movies from your
camcorder, content you’ve copied onto your PC from CDs
and DVDs, and pictures from your digital camera
 Online sources via your Internet connection
In either case, you need two network elements to get media from
your PC into your HDTV:
 A media adapter. It connects to your home network, “reads”
media stored on your PC, and converts the media it finds to
a format that your HDTV can read.
 A computer network or LAN (local-area network) connection
between the PC and the media adapter.
Chapter 16 covers PCs, media adapters, and other PC-related gear
that helps you get computer content into your HDTV.
Using a wired LAN
The traditional way to create a home LAN is the “wired” 
alternative — stringing together a LAN with a special type of
cabling known as UTP (unshielded twisted-pair).
UTP cables are basically souped-up phone cables. Eight individual
conductors are twisted together inside a single cable jacket.
UTP cables are classified by their capabilities — these classifica-
tions are known as “category” classifications. You should choose
UTP cables classified as either Category-5e or Category-6.
A LAN using this kind of cabling is often called an Ethernet network
(Ethernet is the protocol, or underlying logic, that makes the network
work). Ethernet NICs (or network interface cards) are pretty much
standard in all desktop and laptop PCs, and can also be found in
media adapters and other devices that help connect PCs and HDTVs.
Wiring up an Ethernet LAN is really pretty simple — at least the
logical layout of how wires are connected is pretty simple. The
hard part is getting the wires inside your walls. At the center of
your network is a device known as a hub or switch that connects
Part V: Monitor Madness 
170

each “leg” of your network together. These legs of the network con-
sist of individual lengths of UTP cabling, connecting a PC or other
device on the network back to the hub or switch.
Most home LAN builders use a device that combines a switch and a
router (which can receive and distribute Internet communications
to computers and devices attached to the network). These handy
widgets are known as home routers or broadband routers.
Figure 17-1 shows a simple wired LAN.
Figure 17-1: Connecting devices to a wired Ethernet LAN.
Using a Wi-Fi network
A wired LAN is a great way to connect PCs into your HDTV, but it
isn’t always a convenient way to make that connection. Running
wires from your den or home office (or wherever the PC is located)
to your HDTV viewing room isn’t easy (unless you’re building a
new home and have open walls).
The best way to get around running these wires is to use a wireless
LAN system. These systems use radio transmitters and receivers
to send packets of Ethernet data over the airwaves instead over
wires.

Chapter 17: Home Networking 171

When you go shopping for a wireless LAN (or Wi-Fi, short for 
wireless fidelity) system, you see more than one kind of Wi-Fi net-
work. There are three common, standardized systems for Wi-Fi
(standardized meaning that equipment from different vendors can
work together, as long as its design is within the same standard).
Wi-Fi gear is labeled with one or another variant of the “802.11”
standard — there is a letter after the “.11” that designates which
standard is which. Table 17-1 summarizes each of the three stan-
dards and their uses in a home LAN.

802.11b is the most common system, but the two faster systems
are rapidly supplanting it. Which system to choose depends on
two factors:
 The big advantage of 802.11g is that it is “backward-compatible”
with 802.11b.
 802.11a is common, but it’s less susceptible to interference
because it uses a different, less crowded radio frequency.
Revving up your RF distribution
Most homes have some minimal system of coaxial cables in the
walls carrying HDTV (and standard-definition) programming from
your antenna, satellite dish, or cable-TV feed.
Running an extra RG-6 coaxial cable into the room where your HDTV
is located (as in Figure 17-2) can pay big dividends. You can use an
extra coaxial cable to create your own “in-house” TV stations that
let you access all the gear that feeds into your HDTV from other
parts of the house (we explain the details later in the chapter).
If you’re installing a distribution panel or buying a home that has
one, make sure that the panel can handle HDTV. Over-the-air DTV
broadcasts use higher frequencies and have larger variations in
Part V: Monitor Madness 
172

signal strengths than do regular broadcast and cable TV stations.
HDTV requires a high-quality distribution panel and amplifiers that
are rated for HDTV. Panels that handle higher-frequency DTV signals
are clearly marked — usually with an official DTV logo authorized
by the Consumer Electronics Association (www.ce.org). Com-
panies such as Channel Plus (www.channelplus.com) or Leviton
(www.leviton.com) offer such amplifiers and distribution panels.

Sharing Signals in Your House
Getting video content into your HDTV from other parts of the house
is just half of what home networking can do for you. You can also
use a home network to share all the “local” sources that are sitting
next to your HDTV.
In other words, you can use your home network to connect video
source devices (such as DVRs, DVD jukeboxes, or satellite receivers)
with your HDTV (and any other TV in the house).
Most of the source devices we’re talking about here aren’t HDTV-
capable. They’re standard-definition source devices. If you have an
HDTV source device, you need a separate HDTV source device for
every HDTV you own. (We expect this to change by mid-2005 when
HDTV-sharing wireless set-top boxes will be common.) Today’s
home-networking systems don’t let you share HDTV easily between
rooms in your home.
Using coaxial cables
If you have an extra coaxial RG-6 cable running into your HDTV
viewing room, you can use this cable to create your own TV channel
(viewable from any other TV in the home) that can be used to share
any video-source device connected to your HDTV.
The device that makes this possible is known as a modulator. You’re
probably already familiar with modulators — any VCR or older video
game that connects to your TV via an antenna cable and is viewed
on Channel 3 or 4 uses a built-in modulator. Standalone modulators
can be much more flexible — while the really cheap ones only work
on Channels 3 or 4, fancier models (known as frequency-agile modu-
lators) can be tuned to broadcast on any channel you might have
available.
HDTV modulators aren’t available yet — you can only send 
standard-definition NTSC signals over a modulator.
Using a modulator is pretty simple — simply connect the outputs
of the source device (such as a DVR or DVD player) to the inputs of
the modulator (using S-video or composite-video cables and analog
audio cables), and connect the RF output of the modulator to your
extra RG-6 cable.
Back at your coax distribution panel (discussed in the earlier sec-
tion “Revving up your RF distribution”), connect the far end of this
extra RG-6 cable to the “modulator in” input. Figure 17-3 shows a
Part V: Monitor Madness 
174

modulator in action. When you have everything is connected, you
simply follow the modulator’s instructions to tune it to an “empty”
(or unused) channel on your local channel lineup.
Figure 17-3: Connecting a source device to a modulator.
When your modulator is connected and tuned, you can then simply
dial into the channel you’ve selected using any TV in the house, and
watch your new “local” TV channel.
Using wireless systems
If you don’t have extra RG-6 cabling, you can use a wireless system
to distribute a video source throughout your home. Wireless video-
distribution systems typically do not use Wi-Fi networking, but
instead connect using their own proprietary wireless systems
(which means you can’t mix and match between vendors).
Many of the media adapters we discussed in Chapter 16 use wire-
less technologies (Wi-Fi) to connect PCs and Internet connections
to your HDTV. These systems, however, don’t send signals back
from your HDTV source gear to other parts of the house.
You can find wireless video-distribution systems at any major 
consumer-electronics vendor (either brick-and-mortar or online).
These systems aren’t very expensive — for example, Terk’s
LeapFrog System (www.terk.com) is under $100 at online retailers.

Using UTP cabling
If you’ve got a Category-5e or Category-6 cable system installed in
the room with your HDTV, you can use this cable to distribute high-
quality audio and video (including HDTV signals, in some cases)
throughout your house via a UTP-based video distribution system.
These systems aren’t compatible with an Ethernet network — so if
you also have an Ethernet network running into your HDTV viewing
room, you need a separate run of UTP cabling to connect a video-
distribution system.
UTP-based video-distribution systems range pretty widely in terms
of their costs and capabilities:
 For $500 (list price) you can get the ChannelPlus SVC-10 system,
which can distribute standard-definition (NTSC) S-video (and
related audio signals) up to 1,000 feet over CAT-5e cabling.
This system is point-to-point, meaning it can send one source
device’s video to only one other location.
 In the “if you have to ask, you can’t afford it” category, you
can find systems like Crestron’s CNX-PVID8x3 “professional
video-distribution system” — which uses the same kind of
cabling, but can distribute up to 48 different sources, includ-
ing component video HDTV signals, to up to 24 rooms!
Crestron (www.crestron.com) is the king of custom instal-
lations of audio/video and control systems. The average
installation exceeds $50,000. But if you’ve got the money, this
can distribute your HDTV sources to any room in the home.

Sensory Overload

In this part . . .
T
here’s a lot to a good HDTV experience besides just
a great TV set. Now, don’t get us wrong, you want to
start with a great TV set. And in the last three chapters of
this part, we talk all about the different options you have
for which great TV set to choose. We talk about front- and
rear-projection systems, plasma and LCD ﬂat panels, and
CRT-powered TV sets — and the pros and cons of each
approach. Despite what the salesperson in your local elec-
tronics store has told you, “everyone” does not buy the
same model, much less the same type of HDTV. There are
different types for different applications, and we help you
ﬁgure that out in this part.
But before we get to that, we lay the groundwork for your
overall HDTV adventure by talking about some of the other
components (ohhh, that one’s rich with punning) that drive
your HDTV atmosphere. 
First, we delve into the whole audio experience, both with
the built-in speakers in your HDTV and with a home-theater
surround-audio system. We argue vehemently that the whole
point of going HDTV is to create a total immersion in the
content, and you can’t do that without real surround sound,
and you can’t have real surround sound with two Left/Right
speakers built into the side of a high-deﬁnition monitor —
no matter how good the speakers are. (Are we showing our
biases yet?)
Then we’ll talk about your HDTV room — nay, your HDTV
theater — and how you can optimize that for the video and
audio that comes with high-deﬁnition content. We’ll advise
you on placement, construction, wall coverings, lighting,
and the like. Think of any Austin Powers movie and the
atmosphere he creates with any swinging ‘60s party, and
you get the idea — light and sound complement the video.
After that, we’ll talk about the details of television engineer-
ing that will allow us ultimately to compare your HDTV set
options.  We’ll make sure you are well founded in concepts
like interlacing and 3:2 pulldown (and no, that’s not a World
Wrestling Foundation move).

O
f course, the picture — especially the big-screen picture —
provided by HDTV content shown on HDTV-capable displays
is the number-one, numero-uno attraction. But — and we think this is
a big but — high-quality audio reproduction comes in a close second
when it comes to making HDTV more of a “you’re-there” experience.
In other words, good audio (particularly, good surround-sound audio)
lets you become more immersed in the HDTV experience — the
audio helps make your HDTV viewing seem more like that prover-
bial window on the world.
In this chapter, we give you good, quick info on the confusing speci-
fications and terms that you’ll deal with when trying to understand
the capabilities of an audio system. Some audio manufacturers fling
bovine byproducts when they describe (dare we say overstate?)
their audio capabilities, so you need some knowledge about what’s
actually what in your audio systems.
We also help you dig through the maze of surround-sound stan-
dards, to understand which speakers perform what function. We
also cover the built-in audio systems found on most HDTVs.
Chapter 19 covers external surround-sound systems. They’re the
best option for a great HDTV system. Most built-in HDTV sound
systems are okay for casual viewing, but not so good when you
really want to get into a movie.

Grasping Audio Basics
Before we get into any specifics about particular systems or audio
components, indulge us by reading a few paragraphs about audio
specifications.
Yes, we know, reading the specs themselves is bad enough — now
we want you to read about reading the specs? Yikes! Trust us,
though; we have a method underlying our madness.
Audio specs are some of the most misused numbers in the world.
There isn’t really any enforced standardization in how manufactur-
ers measure and report the numbers behind their audio — we’re
talking mainly about audio power specs (watts).
For example, two manufacturers may both claim that their systems
put out 50 watts per channel (a decent amount). Neither manufac-
turer is actually lying when it states this specification — but one
system may be much more powerful than the other.
How is this possible? Well, the simple answer is that there are differ-
ent ways of measuring the same thing (watts, in this case). Brand X’s
watts may not equal Brand Y’s. Here’s an explanation:
 Watts: The most basic measurement of an audio system — the
number that gives you some idea of how loud the system is —
is the power rating in watts. All else being equal, a system with
a higher wattage rating should be able to play more loudly.
Wattage is measured in watts per channel (or speaker).
Keep in mind that it takes a large increase in watts to make a
truly noticeable difference in volume. To make a system play
twice as loud, you have to increase the wattage by approxi-
mately four or more times.
 THD: Audio-system wattage is measured at a certain level of
distortion (noise introduced by the audio amplifier system)
called THD (total harmonic distortion). As audio systems are
pushed closer to their limits (in terms of volume), they tend to
produce greater amounts of distortion. Manufacturers can make
a system seem more powerful “on paper” by measuring watts
at a higher THD. Look for receivers that meet your wattage
requirement when measured at low THDs, like .02 percent,
rather than higher ones like 0.2 percent or even 1.0 percent.
 Full-bandwidth power ratings: Another gray area in power rat-
ings is the frequency range at which watts are measured. The
human ear can hear audio signals between 20 and 20,000 kHz.
It’s best if the system’s power is measured across this entire
range. Some manufacturers provide wattage ratings at only one
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
180

frequency (such as 1000 kHz), which can create an artificially
high power rating. Try to find specifications that cover the full
20-to-20,000-kHz range to make true comparisons.
 Ohms: The number of watts a system can produce is also
affected by the impedance (or resistance) of the speaker
being driven. Manufacturers generally measure impedance at
8 Ohms, but sometimes you’ll see wattage measured at lower
impedances, such as 4 or 2 Ohms. It’s good that a receiver can
drive speakers with such low impedances (not all can), but
the wattage measured at 4 Ohms is higher, so it shouldn’t be
compared directly to wattage measured at 8 Ohms.
 Power handling: This rating (also measured in watts) relates
to the speakers in an audio system, not the amplifiers. This is
simply a measure of how many watts the speakers can take
before they start to shred themselves into confetti.
Power handling is not — we repeat, not — in any way a measure
of how loud the system is. The main speaker measurement
regarding loudness is the sensitivity of the speakers — a meas-
ure of how much volume the speakers put out with a certain
wattage of input from the amplifier.
The bottom line here is to make sure that you’re comparing apples
to apples as you look at audio systems — either built into an HDTV,
or in a separate home theater receiver system. To go back to our
earlier example, two manufacturers may have 50-watt systems, but
one may be measured at a limited bandwidth, at a high THD, and on
a lower-Ohm impedance — and may be significantly less powerful
than the other.
Surround-Sound Mania
The profusion of surround-sound standards is a confusing area in
the audio arena. Surround sound is multichannel audio designed
to produce spatial audio cues — sounds from all around you, in
other words — relating to action on the HDTV’s screen. It’s usually
described by the number of channels (or speakers) that a particular
system uses to envelop you in sound:
 5.1- audio actually has six channels:
• A center-channel speaker (located directly above/below
your HDTV) that reproduces dialogue on your screen.
• Two front (or main-channel) speakers, which reproduce
most of the musical soundtrack, plus left and right spatial
cues (like someone walking into the room from one side
or the other).
Chapter 18: Understanding Audio 181

• Two surround speakers, located on the rear side walls
of the room, that produce spatial cues behind you, and
also provide diffuse (not easily locatable) sounds to help
create an audio atmosphere.
• An LFE (or low-frequency effects) channel that uses
your system’s subwoofer (if you have one) to reproduce
the very deep bass notes and sounds (like cannons
exploding).
The LFE channel, because it contains only a small por-
tion of the full spectrum of audio frequencies humans
can hear, is the “.1” of 5.1 (or any x.1 system).
 6.1-channel systems add one extra speaker — a rear surround
that is usually located on the back wall of your HDTV viewing
room, and that provides an extra level of surround-sound
detail.
 7.1-channel systems that add two extra speakers, mounted on

 It can be encoded in a DVD or HDTV program discretely (each
individual channel is recorded on its own channel within the
audio soundtrack). This is the best way to accurately produce
surround sound — when the director wants you to hear that
spooky footstep right there, discrete surround sound gives you
the best chance of hearing it there!
 It can be matrixed in along with other audio channels. Typically,
matrixed surround-sound signals are mixed into normal two-
channel stereo soundtracks. If you’re listening in stereo, you
don’t even hear the surround-sound cues, but if you’ve got a
surround-sound system, these “hidden” tracks are extracted
from the stereo soundtrack.
 Sometimes there is no surround sound (discrete or matrixed)
for an HDTV program. Perhaps the movie was filmed in 1942,
when there wasn’t even stereo! Well, surround-sound hardware
can often create its own best guesstimate of surround sound,
using a regular two-channel stereo input.
If you’ve got a piece of physical media (such as a DVD), you can
usually figure out which surround-sound format (or system) is
being used by looking for labels (we’ll discuss the different formats
in the following section). If you’re watching a broadcast (HDTV or
standard-definition), you might see a label or description on an
onscreen program guide (or in the paper or TV Guide). Luckily
your surround-sound decoder — the device that “reads” the
encoded surround-sound signals and turns them into sounds you
can hear — usually detects surround-sound formats automatically.
Introducing the formats
Two companies dominate the surround-sound system market:
Dolby Labs (www.dolby.com) and DTS (www.dts.com). Dolby
is the market leader, but both are common on DVDs and other
source material. These are the most common surround formats:
 Dolby Digital/AC-3: The most common surround-sound format,
Dolby Digital (also called AC-3) is part of the HDTV standard
itself! Dolby Digital is a 5.1-channel, discrete surround-sound
format, and in addition to HDTV programming, it can be
found on most DVDs, and some digital cable and satellite
TV programming.
Dolby Digital doesn’t have to be 5.1 channels. It’s possible
to use Dolby Digital for two-channel stereo or even mono
(one-channel) soundtracks — which is often the case for older
material filmed/recorded before the advent of surround sound.
Chapter 18: Understanding Audio 183

 Dolby Digital EX: As Dolby’s 6.1-channel solution (with the
extra “rear-surround” channel added in), Dolby Digital EX pro-
vides 5.1 channels of discrete surround sound, but then uses a
matrixed system for the rear surround.
 Dolby Pro Logic II/IIx: Pro Logic II (a newer version named
Pro Logic IIx is starting to appear on some audio/video gear)
is Dolby’s system for decoding the matrixed surround sound
found on some older TV sources — like VHS VCR tapes and
some stereo NTSC TV broadcasts. Pro Logic II/IIx can also
create relatively realistic-sounding surround sound from true
two-channel sources like CDs or stereo TV broadcasts.
 DTS: DTS is DTS’s equivalent to Dolby Digital — a 5.1-channel
surround-sound format. You mainly find DTS on DVDs.
 DTS-ES: DTS-ES is DTS’s equivalent to Dolby Digital EX; a 
6.1-channel system. Found on DVDs, DTS-ES differs from
Dolby Digital EX in that at least some DTS-ES soundtracks
use a discrete rear-surround channel. Not all do, however —
look for the DTS-ES Discrete logo on the DVD case, otherwise
assume you’ve got a matrixed DTS-ES soundtrack.
 DTS NEO:6: Not content to have equivalents to only Dolby
Digital and Dolby Digital EX, DTS also has a system equivalent
to Dolby Pro Logic II — DTS NEO. DTS NEO:6 takes two-
channel audio input and magically creates multichannel 5.1
(or even 6.1 or 7.1) surround-sound soundtracks.
 Proprietary encoders: Some HDTVs (and other surround-
sound gear) have a surround-sound system from someone
other than Dolby or DTS — these systems typically provide
functionality similar to Pro Logic II or NEO:6, creating multi-
channel audio output from two-channel input.
So why should you care? Well, you have two issues here:
 Be sure your system can decode the right audio formats.
 Buy the versions of audio that are most compatible with your
system (or else know what you aren’t getting when you buy).
In an ideal world, your audio-playback capability would support
all these formats, but you want at least Dolby Digital. Most systems
support both Dolby Digital and DTS. As far as the 6.1 or 7.1-channel
systems go, that’s a matter of personal taste — there’s very little
content out there for them, so they aren’t requirements.
You can tell what encoding was used to create the audio by looking
on the back of the DVD or CD.

Dealing with Built-in Audio
Most — but not all! — HDTVs have a built-in audio system. TV audio
systems have never been known for their audio fidelity, but you’d be
amazed at how good some of these built-in audio speakers sound.
Even if you have a fancy home-theater audio system, you might
find that the built-in audio system on your TV is good enough for
casual viewing — such as watching the evening news, or listening
in to The Today Show while cooking breakfast in the kitchen. In fact,
there are times like this when it’s probably preferable to just fire
up the HDTV and use its built-in speakers, rather than warming up
the mondo complicated home-theater system. When using the TV
with a surround-sound system on, the TV’s speakers usually
assume the role of a center front speaker.
Here’s what we think you should look for when you evaluate the
built-in audio in an HDTV system:
 Amp power: While amplifier power ratings for TVs are some-
times all but useless (see the following tips), you should look
for a system that puts out 10 to 20 watts per channel, if you’re
going to rely only on the TV’s audio system.
Check out the THD (see the preceding section, “Grasping Audio
Basics” if you aren’t familiar with THD) and other power rating
factors when you examine this number. TV wattage ratings are
often measured at significantly higher THD levels than “real”
audio equipment is. So that “50-watt” TV system may be equiv-
alent to a 10-watt home-theater receiver, powerwise.
Some manufacturers claim “x” watts, but they aren’t talking
about individual channels, but the sum total of all amplifier
totals. You certainly can’t compare this number to the watts-
per-channel rating of an external audio system.
 Number of speakers: Most HDTVs include two speakers — left
and right, in other words. A few have some additional speakers
that you can place throughout the room — but this feature is
increasingly rare, particularly in light of the low prices of home-
theater systems these days.
 External speaker attachments: Some HDTVs don’t have extra
speakers, but have amplifiers that can power external speakers.
In this case, you attach your own speakers to the back of your
TV with some standard speaker cables. (Another rare option.)
 Built-in surround-sound decoder: True HDTVs — those with
built-in HDTV tuners — include a surround-sound decoder that
can decode the Dolby Digital signal used by HDTV broadcasts.
Chapter 18: Understanding Audio 185

Most HDTVs only have two speakers, so they won’t create 
surround sound from an HDTV broadcast. The decoder is
just there so the HDTV can turn the surround sound into 
two-channel audio, or feed surround channels to an external
system.
 Special two-channel surround modes: Many HDTVs include
special audio circuits that can help create the illusion of sur-
round sound from the two speakers built into the TV. (See the
sidebar titled “Creating surround sound from thin air!”)
 Connectivity to home-theater receivers: If (when, in our 
opinions) you decide to move beyond the two speakers built
into your HDTV, you’ll want to connect your TV to a home 
theater receiver. If you have an HDTV with a built-in HDTV
tuner, it needs a digital audio output to connect to your
receiver. (Chapter 3 covers digital audio outputs.)
This connection is almost standard equipment for any true
HDTV, but you should make sure. Look for either Toslink
(optical) output or coaxial digital output.
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
186
Creating surround sound from thin air!
You need at least 5 (.1!) speakers for real surround sound in a viewing room, but your
brain can think you’re surrounded by speakers when you aren’t.
For example, the folks at Dolby Labs have a couple of systems (which you may find
in some HDTVs’ audio systems) that make two speakers sound like 5.1 or more!
These systems (like Dolby Headphone, which reproduces surround sound for head-
phones, or Dolby Virtual Speaker, which does the same with two conventional
speakers) use computer horsepower to modify the sound going to your two speak-
ers (or headphone transducers) by adding echoes and delays. These echoes and
delays are designed to reach your listening position so your brain is fooled into think-
ing that there are more than two speakers.
Are these systems any good? They aren’t bad. Dolby Virtual Speaker and SRS Labs’
TruSurround can do a good job of fooling you. If you aren’t installing a real surround-
sound system, look for an HDTV with a system like these.
We don’t think you can substitute these “virtual” surround-sound systems for even
a small, inexpensive “real” surround-sound system (such as a $200 “Home Theater
in a Box” system). But if you don’t have the room or budget for 5.1 speakers, give vir-
tual surround sound a whirl and see what you think.

I
n the previous chapter (Chapter 18) we talked about 
surround-sound audio. Surround sound is an integral — we
think, essential — part of HDTV. And the best way to get real sur-
round sound is to leave behind the built-in HDTV sound system
(the speakers that came installed in your HDTV, in other words)
and connect a home-theater audio system to your HDTV.
In this chapter, we discuss some options for adding an external
surround-sound system to your HDTV “theater.” First, we talk you
through the popular, all-in-one “Home Theater in a Box” solutions
that include the speakers, amplification, surround-sound decoding,
and often a DVD player, all in one box. These solutions are the easi-
est way to add surround sound to your HDTV.
We also talk about build-it-yourself systems with separate speakers
and home-theater receivers. These systems take a bit more work
on your part to assemble, but potentially offer better sound, since
you can mix and match the “best-of-breed” pieces and parts from
different manufacturers.
Boxing Up Your Home Theater
Home Theater in a Box (HTIB) systems are the simplest, quickest,
and easiest way of adding surround sound to your HDTV. With HTIB,
you go to the store (or shop online) and bring home a single box.
Everything you need — usually including all the cables and wires
that connect everything together — is right in that box, ready to go.

HTIB systems are pre-matched, preconfigured and prepared for
quick and easy installation. The price you pay for this convenience
is a lack of flexibility — you don’t get to pick and choose individual
components on their merits. HTIB systems can sound very good,
but fall a bit short of slightly more expensive systems where you
choose your own components (such as speakers, receivers, and
DVD players).
Typically, a HTIB contains the following:
 Amplifiers for at least five channels: The amplifiers take the
low-level audio signals recorded in an HDTV program or on a
DVD soundtrack and amplify them electrically so that they
drive your speakers. Look for at least 50 watts per channel.
 Surround-sound decoders: The surround-sound decoder
extracts multiple audio channels from the soundtrack of an
HDTV broadcast or DVD (or any audio source) and directs
the audio signals to the appropriate amplifier channels.
 An AM/FM tuner: For tuning in radio broadcasts.
Together, these first three items make up a home-theater
receiver (discussed in the next section, “Receiving Home-
Theater Sounds”).
 A DVD/CD player: Most HTIBs include a DVD player, either in
the same chassis as the amplifier and surround-sound decoders,
or in a separate chassis that connects via standard audio and
video cables. Check out Chapter 11 to learn more about DVD
player features and specifications.
 Five or more speakers: HTIB systems typically include five
small satellite speakers (they’re called satellites because they
hang around your subwoofer like Sputnik orbiting the earth).
For 6.1- or 7.1-channel HTIB systems, expect an extra one or
two speakers.
 A subwoofer: This speaker — usually the largest in your HTIB
system — handles the lowest of the low-end frequencies in
your surround-sound system.
 Wires and cables: Here’s where HTIB makes things really
easy — most systems include all the cables you need, and
they’re usually very clearly labeled, so it takes absolutely no
brain power to hook things up.
In the section that follows, we discuss a variety of features to 
consider when choosing a home-theater receiver. Most of these
features also apply when choosing a HTIB system.
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
188

Receiving Home-Theater Sounds
HTIB systems can be great, and they sure are convenient, but the
fact is, the companies that are best at making receivers are usually
not the best at creating speaker systems. Sure, those really huge
consumer-electronics manufacturers have a lot of talented engineers
on staff, but we tend to prefer speakers from specialist companies
who focus solely on speaker design and manufacture. Going with
your own components lets you do this mix-and-match thing.
The centerpiece of a surround-sound audio system is the home-
theater receiver (also called an AV receiver or just a surround-sound
receiver). The receiver is the centerpiece of a home-theater system.
Among the receiver’s many duties are the following:
 Decoding surround-sound signals from DVDs and other sources
 Amplifying audio signals and sending them to the speakers
 Switching between different audio and video sources
 Adjusting audio volume and tones
 Tuning in radio broadcasts, and (most importantly)
 Acting as the main “user interface” to the home theater
There are literally hundreds of home-theater receivers on the
market these days — ranging from under $200 to well over $4,000.
When we’re shopping for a receiver, here are the items we make
sure to check off on our list:
 Power: We like to look for receivers with at least 70 watts per
channel, 90 or 100 if our HDTV is in a larger room.
 Number of channels: All home-theater receivers can support
5 channels of audio (see Chapter 18 for details on surround-
sound channels); some support 6 or 7 channels for a 6.1 or
7.1 system.
 Surround-sound modes: Dolby Digital and DTS support is
pretty much the baseline system; many receivers also support
6.1/7.1 systems such as DTS-ES. We also like to look for Dolby
Pro Logic II support in a receiver, for providing simulated sur-
round sound for mono and stereo content (such as older TV
shows).
 Video switching: Video switching allows the receiver to act as
the traffic cop for your HDTV system — taking all video source
signals and routing them appropriately. Having a receiver that
Chapter 19: Home Theater Audio 189

can do video switching is a big plus if you have more compo-
nents to connect to your HDTV than you have connections
available on the TV itself.
 Component video support: As we discussed in Chapter 3,
HDTV signals require at least component video connections —
but not all home-theater receivers support component video
switching. Look for a receiver with component video band-
width of at least 30 MHz if you want to run HDTV through the
receiver.
The other cables used to carry HDTV, DVI and HDMI, are typi-
cally not supported by receiver video switching, so you need
to make those connections directly from source to HDTV, and
not use the receiver’s video switching.
 Video upconversion: You’ll probably have a variety of different
video sources feeding into your HDTV through your receiver.
Some use component video, others S-video, and still others
composite video (such as a VHS VCR). Video upconversion
takes all those sources and converts them to be carried over a
single cable or set of cables to your TV. For example, compo-
nent video upconversion allows you to send all your video to
the HDTV using a single set of component video cables. Such a
set up makes it easier to connect your HDTV to your receiver
(you need less cables), and makes it easier to set up your
remote control and HDTV itself, since all video comes in over
a single set of cables.
 Number of inputs: You should take a look at the back of your
home-theater receiver (see Figure 19-1 for a typical view) and
count up the number of inputs (both audio and video — we
describe each type in Chapter 3). The key here is to make sure
that your receiver has enough of these inputs to accommodate
all the gear you might want to connect to your HDTV system.
It’s sometimes useful to have a set of inputs on the front of your
receiver, for quick connections to devices such as camcorders.
You may also have front inputs directly on your HDTV; if you
have a flat-panel unit (see Chapter 23), you probably don’t.
 Assignable inputs: One really cool feature found on an
increasing number of receivers is assignable inputs. Instead
of rigidly matching the receiver’s digital-audio inputs to a 
particular video input, assignable inputs can be used with
any video input on your system. This just makes things a
whole lot more flexible when you’re trying to connect mul-
tiple devices that use digital audio (and there are many, such
as HDTV tuners, DVD players, D-VHS VCRs, and even game
consoles such as Xbox).
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
190

Figure 19-1: It’s a jungle back here — receiver inputs/outputs.
The biggest disadvantage of skipping over the HTIB solutions
(and going with a separate receiver/DVD/speaker systems) is that
you have to spend a little bit more time shopping for gear (you have
to pick out that receiver, a DVD player, and a set of speakers). We
personally don’t find this too much of a hassle (heck, we even wrote
another book, Home Theater For Dummies on just that subject!). If
you do find it a hassle, check out the HTIB systems — they pack a
surprising bang for the buck.
CAUTION
Chapter 19: Home Theater Audio 191
Going with separates
Moving from a HTIB solution to your own set of surround-sound speakers and home-
theater receiver is a step up, providing (potentially at least) better sound quality.
The next step is to move from a home-theater receiver to separates.
In a separate system, the functions of the home-theater receiver are divided up
among — no surprise here — separate components. A separates system usually
includes the following:
 Power amplifiers:These devices provide the actual audio signal amplification that
“drives” the speakers in the surround-sound system. The power amps are the
brawn of the system.
 Surround-sound controller/preamp: The controller/preamp handles all audio
and video switching — sending audio/video inputs to the HDTV. The controller
also decodes surround-sound formats and “steers” audio signals to the correct
channel of the amplifier (and therefore to the correct speaker). The controller is
the brains of the system.
 AM/FM tuner: If you want all the functions of a home-theater receiver, you have
to add a separate AM/FM radio tuner. Nope, this has nothing to do with HDTV, but
we just thought we’d be complete!
(continued)

Part VI: Sensory Overload 
192
So why are separates an improvement over all-in-one receivers? Well the difference
is subtle, but there some things that separates are better at:
 Carrying the amplification and control/preamplification tasks in a separate chassis
can be a benefit all in itself. Keeping these functions electrically separate — and
using independent power supplies for each — reduces the risk of interference
and noise getting into your surround sound. This is, however, a subtle difference.
 Separates allow you to choose the system that works best for you. Need more
power (for a large room)? Get a bigger power amp. More concerned with a feature
such as video upconversion? Get a fancier preamplifier/processor.
 Separates make it easier for you to upgrade over time (for example, when a new
surround-sound format hits the market). We know lots of people who are con-
stantly upgrading their systems on eBay, selling their old stuff, and buying some-
one else’s newer old stuff.

W
hen you go to the movies at your local cinema, you can’t
help but notice the little things they do to try to create a
certain atmosphere. There are dimmed ceiling lights, moving cur-
tains, aisle side lighting accents, and nice seats — all the creature
comforts you need to watch the, er, creature feature.
However, there’s a lot more going on there than you might think.
The large video screens, surround-sound audio, tiered chair 
placement . . . these are painstakingly planned to give you an 
uninterrupted view of the movie content. By minimizing things
that would remind you that you’re in a theater, movie-theater 
planners create a grand illusion that you are right up there on
the screen with the characters, in the thick of the action.
Buying an HDTV can be simply about taking the TV out of the box,
plugging it in, and then watching the great picture. But why stop
there — your HDTV experience could be a whole lot more exciting
with the right equipment placement, lighting, sound treatments,
and other nice touches that turn a living room or spare den into
your true HDTV theater.
Choosing Your HDTV’s Home
Turning your HDTV room into a HDTV theater is all about trying
to optimize that same sense of illusion found in the movie theater.
There are definitely wrong places to put your HDTV, even if you had
your heart set on a particular spot next to the ficus plant. Here’s a
list of things to think about as you locate your HDTV:

 Room layout: You tend to get more awkward sound patterns
in perfectly square rooms. The best place to put your HDTV is
along the short wall of a rectangular room, preferably a wall
without windows or doors on it. Fully enclosed rooms are
best for sound. If you must use a room that’s open to another
room, consider pulling heavy curtains across an open wall
when you’re watching films in your HDTV theater.
 Seating layout: Many place a couch against a wall, with the
HDTV in front of it. With a surround-sound-enabled HDTV the-
ater, you want enough space behind you so the sound can get
in back of you and truly surround you. So the ideal position for
your HDTV seating is a location more central to the room.
 Stray lighting and noise: Stray light in a room, day or night,
can substantially affect the HDTV viewing experience. The
same is true for stray noise. Think about how lights from
other rooms or street lighting might affect the ambience of
the whole room. Listen closely to your room for regular inter-
fering sounds, such as a clock ticking or a fish-tank pump
whirring. Consider moving these devices if you can. And if
the light or sound is coming externally (say, from a floodlight
or a dryer or washer), consider some cheap absorptive wall
coverings to shield and muffle them.
 Distance to the picture: There’s a correct viewing distance
and maximum viewing angle for HDTVs. (We explain it later
in the chapter.) 
A TV can be too big or too small for your room, and you
should sit within its best angle of viewing.
 Reflected sound and light: Think about how video and audio
signals behave in your HDTV room. Muted wall colors or irreg-
ular wall coverings — bookcases are ideal — absorb stray
light. A dark gray or black room is best, or one with heavy,
colored drapes. (Now you know why you see all those drapes
and carpeted walls in theaters!)
Avoid mirrors, picture frames and brightly colored gloss
paint. They reflect light that creates light ghosts on the sides
of the screen.
Bare tile or wood on the floor causes acoustical reflections
that mess up your sound field (the total sound “picture”).
A good rug can absorb stray sounds that would otherwise
muffle the crispness of your sound system.
It’s okay for the back wall to be a little reflective — it helps
build a general sound field behind your seating area.
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
194

Creating the right atmosphere for your HDTV can be pretty expen-
sive, but only if you want it to be so. In the rest of this chapter,
we expose you to some simple lighting, sound, automation, and
comfort concepts. Some of this is easier to do if you are building a
room for your HDTV theater from scratch, versus merely sprucing
up an existing room. In all instances, there’s a wide spectrum of
money you can spend, from the very inexpensive treatments to
very involved construction. You can choose your pain.
Sounds Right?
Most people who shop for audio gear for their HDTV setup focus on
how many watts this one puts out, how many interfaces that one
has, and so on. What most people don’t realize is that sound qual-
ity has at least as much to do with room acoustics as with the gear.
Chapter 20: Setting the Mood 195
The right distance from the picture
Obviously, where you sit to watch your HDTV is a very subjective thing, but it’s a topic
that some people have spent a lot of time thinking about. (What’s the title on their busi-
ness cards? “Deep TV-Distance Thinker”?)
HDTV screens are very different from regular TVs in one big way — because they have
such high resolution, it’s harder to discern the visibility of the scan lines, so you can
move in closer to the screens if you want to. Crutchfield (www.crutchfield.com),
always a good source for audio and video information, recommends the following
distances from your HDTV:

The shape of the room, floor and wall coverings, and furniture all
have a massive impact on the quality of sound from your HDTV
theater. The sound is getting from point A (the speakers) to point Z
(your ears) through a number of intermediate points — including
some sound-reflecting surfaces throughout the room.
Because you are likely to put your HDTV in an existing space,
you’re probably starting at a decisive disadvantage when it comes
to optimizing a room for sound. We often see an HDTV in a living
room that opens into the kitchen or dining room in the rear — so
there is no rear wall to reflect sound. This substantially affects the
aural sound field in a surround-sound system.
We’re talking about sound a lot here — that’s because we think one
of the biggest advantages of HDTV is the built-in Dolby Digital sur-
round sound. The picture is most important, of course, but surround
sound really makes a difference in creating the “illusion of being
there” that HDTV can offer.
The biggest thing to look for is vibration. Everything vibrates to a
degree, including such structures as walls, ductwork, light fixtures,
and woodwork. When your subwoofer belches out a low-frequency
sound wave that is absorbed by the room’s elements, they vibrate
in reaction and establish the room’s own special interpretation of
the sound wave. Ultimately, the direct sound coming from the
speakers combines with the secondary sounds coming from all
this vibration around you; that total effect creates your acoustic
summary of the action on the screen.
Half the job is simply securing everything around the room, and 
listening for things that add noise. Subwoofers can shake things
up too much; get inexpensive isolation pads for the subwoofer’s
feet. If you are using an HDTV projector, consider a special mount-
ing for it that contains the noise it adds to the equation (remem-
ber not to block the projector’s fan and airflow; it puts off a lot of
heat, too).
Try to avoid showing off your gear. Many enthusiasts feel an urge
to put all their equipment out in the open where people can see
their investment — but this merely adds more noise and heat
to your room — which has to be compensated for with cooling
fans and more soundproofing. Tuck away as much of this stuff
as you can — out of sight, out of sound range (if possible), and
away from dust. People are here to see the HDTV, not your shiny
new amps!

Controlling sound in your theater
To get the most from that great digital surround sound your HDTV
system is capable of putting out, take a few steps to optimize your
HDTV theater room’s audio “environment.” Try to control two
major killers of surround-sound goodness:
 Sounds coming into the room from other sources
 Unwanted sound reflections and refractions as the sound
waves from your speakers interact with the room
Building from scratch (or doing a major renovation)
If you are building a new home from scratch or doing a renovation,
you’re lucky, because you can “optimize your environment” a lot
at the structural level. You basically can design your own isolation
chamber that helps preserve the impact of the HDTV content.
A few steps can optimize your new HDTV space for your theatrical
presentations:
 Build a new room within a room: A room within a room can
isolate and control the impact of the sound system’s signals on
the room itself. This room would have its own walls, flooring
and ceiling to optimize the HDTV experience.
 Get some distance: When building the walls, make sure the
studs of two adjacent walls (the new inside one and the existing
home walls) don’t touch each other. This cuts off a main path
for sound to travel into and out of the room.
 Add more material: Unwanted vibrations (and what else is
sound?) can be reduced by adding either (or both)
• A second layer of sheetrock to your wall
• More insulation inside the wall
 Soundproof the walls: Soundproofing is easy to install between
the studs and your drywall. It should reduce both
• Sounds traveling into and out of the room
• Vibrations from the drywall against the studs
Acoustiblok (www.acoustiblok.com) has a helpful tarpaper-
like sound-barrier material that you just tack onto the studs.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when you apply sound-
proofing. Most manufacturers tell you to install soundproofing
material somewhat loosely so vibrations can be dissipated in
the material itself.
Chapter 20: Setting the Mood 197

 If you can, soundproof the floor: If you have the luxury of
installing an additional floor, it acts to separate the theater
environment from the floor, in the same way we just discussed
creating a wall within a wall. It’s usually three layers:
• The bottom layer usually is sponge glued to the floor.
• The middle layer is plasterboard.
• The top layer is tongue-and-groove chipboard.
Truly advanced plans call for laying a new floor foundation
with the same sort of soundproofing we discussed for the
walls. If you can do that, then you have a really understanding
spouse!
If you are putting studs onto a concrete floor, consider adding
some isolators that cushion the studs from the concrete,
keeping the resonance of the sound within the flooring on
“your side” of the room. An example are Acoustic Innovations’
IsoBloc Isolators (www.acousticinnovations.com), which
raise standard studs (such as 2x4, 2x6, and 2x8) a quarter
of an inch off the floor, for more tactile bass effects with the
lower frequencies.
 Remember the ceiling: If you have (or plan) a suspended 
ceiling, check into special spring mounts so your ceiling 
doesn’t rattle. Companies such as Kinetics Noise Control
(www.kineticsnoise.com) have special kits for suspension
ceilings to isolate sound.
If you skip this step, you’ll regret it the first time you play any
movie involving earthquakes or explosions.
If your HDTV home theater is in a basement with a concrete floor,
consider adding a moisture barrier coating between the concrete
and your flooring surface (such as a rug).
Upgrading your existing room for HDTV
If you aren’t rebuilding your home, there are still lots of ways you
can provide a much higher-quality sound experience within your
existing infrastructure.
The following ideas apply whether you are building from scratch
or just prettying up a room for your HDTV:
 Apply wall sound control panels: With your drywalls complete,
you can mount sound-control panels on the walls to help con-
trol refracted and reflected sounds. Excessive reflected sound
tends to blur the sound image and mar the intelligibility of voice
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
198

tracks. Sound-control treatments cut down on the amount of
sound bouncing around the room, enhancing low-level dialogue
and environmental effects delivered over today’s high-quality
audio systems. You typically place these at your speakers’ first
reflection points (typically the sidewall boundaries and rear
wall behind the main listening position).
Speaker reflection points are easy to find: Have your spouse or
a friend move a mirror along each side wall while you are sit-
ting in the spot where your couch or theater seats will go.
When you can see the speaker through the mirror, this is your
first reflection point, and a great spot for absorptive material.
Acoustic Innovations (www.acousticinnovations.com) has
really nice solid hardwood frames in mahogany, cherry, walnut,
and oak stains for its Maestro line of panels. Kinetics Noise
Control (www.kineticsnoise.com) offers a Home Theater
Absorption Kit that also contains special midwall decorative
and absorptive panels that take care of sound reverberation.
Consider the corners of the room: Kinetics also makes 
special triangular corner panels engineered to absorb the 
low-frequency bass sound that tends to gather in corners.
Acoustic Sciences (www.acousticsciences.com) has a neat
product called the Acoustical Soffit, which plays the dual role:
It helps control low-end bass response while it hides wiring
inside a hidden raceway. If you don’t have space to run wiring,
you can kill two birds with one stone with products such as
the Acoustical Soffit.
 Remember your open spaces: If you have open areas in your
space such as a big entryway on one side of the room, or large
glass windows or mirrors, consider putting heavy sound-
absorbing drapery to cover these — this can help even out
the sound field in the room. You can make your own draperies
using heavy velvet or other drapery material from your local
crafts shop, or buy some online at any of the home-theater
supply sites. In a pinch, any drapes are better than nothing.
Other companies also offer lines of acoustical suppression and
enhancement gear. Check offerings from companies such as Auralex
(www.auralex.com) and Owens Corning (www.owenscorning.com).
You can spend as much as you want to soundproof your HDTV
environs, from a couple hundred dollars to more than $50,000. You
should add at least some soundproofing, especially if this is a new
space without much else in the room. There are some very reason-
able soundproofing treatment packages for your room; they also
add a professional look to the finished room.

Lights Everyone, Action!
As with the sound in your room, controlling lighting is critical to
maintaining the right atmosphere for your HDTV environment. Too
much here, too little there, stray light on one side of the room — any
and all of it is noticeable once you start using your HDTV enough.
You can spend as much or as little as you want on home-theater
lighting. We cover $5 dimmer switches and the $300 lighting sys-
tems, but what you do is merely a reflection (no pun intended) of
what you want to spend on your HDTV viewing room.
Controlling lighting in 
your HDTV theater
Adding lighting to your room is the type of project that you can get
carried away with, we’ll warn you right now. Unlike the preceding
sound treatments, lighting can get fancy — for example, fiber-optic
starfields on the ceiling (see sidebar, “The stars at night are big and
bright . . .”) — and it can be fun — like your own pre-show, er, show!
We’ll start with the low-investment options upfront. For $5, you can
get a dimmer switch from Lowes, Sears Hardware, or Al’s Corner
Drugstore. If your room has a central light, you can create the same
low-light theater you encounter at the cinema; you can see where
you’re putting your soda and popcorn, but keep the aura of a theater.
For now a heck of a lot more, though, usually around $200 to $300,
a lighting control system can give you control of lights within your
HDTV room (and the whole rest of the house). These have a wall-
mounted keypad, a remote control, or both; you can turn on, turn
off, brighten, dim, or otherwise control each light in the room. Some
packages use radio-frequency signals to communicate with the light
jacks; others use X10 (see the sidebar “What’s X10?”).
While it’s not impossible to find dimmer systems that work with
halogen or fluorescent lights, any dimming light control will work
with standard incandescent bulbs.
Why would you want anything more elaborate than a dimmer
switch? Well, think about this scenario: When your guests arrive to
watch a movie or the NBA finals in HDTV, your lighting is in Arrival
mode (“house” lights are up, the bar is brightly lit, accent lights are
Part VI: Sensory Overload 
200

on). When the show is ready to begin, you hit a button to enter a
flashing-light period, then lighting highlights the seating and walk-
ing paths. When you’re ready to start watching the movie, another
button dims the lighting altogether while highlighting on the
screen — then it fades, the curtains part, and the show starts.
We talk more about how to do things like this in Smart Homes For
Dummies and Home Theater For Dummies, but without too much
effort or construction, you can add some very effective and profes-
sional lighting effects to your home.
You can get single-room lighting systems from players such as
Leviton, Lightolier Controls (www.lolcontrols.com), LiteTouch
(www.home-touch.com), Lutron (www.lutron.com), Powerline
Control Systems (www.pcslighting.com), Vantage (www.vantage
inc.com), and X10 (the company @md www.X10.com).

“The stars at night are big and bright . . .”
You don’t have to be deep in the heart of Texas to see stars on your HDTV room’s ceil-
ing. In fact, you can buy neat fiber optic kits to add all sorts of effects to your HDTV
theater. Companies such as Acoustic Innovations (www.acousticinnovations.
com) offer fiber optic kits to:
 Cover your ceiling: To make your ceiling look like a nighttime sky, you can apply
fiber optic starfield ceiling panels to your existing ceiling. The panels both make
your ceiling more fun and offer acoustical correction.
 Cover your walls: You can install infinite starfield panels that are made of multiple
polycarbonate mirrors and fiber optic lighting and create an illusion of infinite
depth. Pretty neat if you are into psychedelic midnight shows!
 Cover your floor: You can get fiber optic carpeting that’s filled with tiny points of
light (50 fiber optic points per square foot, to be precise).
 Cover your windows: You can get classic, velvety, fiber-optic curtains that can
twinkle, too.
Heck, if you put all these in one room, you can probably think about charging admis-
sion for the room itself, not to mention the movie!
Each of the fiber-optic kits come with a dimmer, speed control for twinkle, and an on/off
switch. You even get to choose between a twinkle or color-change wheel. Gosh, if
these were the only decisions we had to make in life!

Lutron, for example, has a Home Theater Package geared for existing
homes; it includes four dimmers, a tabletop master control, and an
infrared receiver so users can control lights from their favorite uni-
versal or learning IR transmitter. Lutron also has a more expensive

What’s X10?
X10 is important if you’re talking about installing lighting control in your home without
having to run a lot of new wiring. X10 is the dominant protocol for controlling (turning
on, turning off, and dimming) electrical devices such as lights and appliances —
through your home’s electrical lines. You can find X10 gear from a bunch of compa-
nies, including Leviton (www.leviton.com) and Stanley (www.stanleyworks.
com), and X10 Wireless Technologies (www.X10.com).
Using X10 could not be simpler. You basically plug in an X10 wall module — a small,
box-shaped device no bigger than the “wall-wart” AC transformers that power tele-
phones and answering machines — right into the wall outlet. Then the appliance
(a lamp, for example) plugs into the module.
X10 controllers send their control signals from the controller over your power lines to
every outlet in the house. When the controller finds the module it wants, it changes
that module to the desired state (such as “Off”). The following figure shows a limited
X10 network.

system that sports RadioRA, a wireless, whole-home lighting-control
system that uses radio frequency technology instead of power lines
for signal communication. With either of these packages, you can
create the lighting scenarios mentioned earlier in this section. These
packages range in price from $1,000 to $1,500.
The motorized shade/drape kits for your HDTV screen or win-
dows are simple to install — if you have ever installed a drapery
rod, such a kit is basically the same thing with a motor. One kit is
the Makita Motorized Drape System ($600, www.smarthome.com)
is a self-contained system for your HDTV theater drapes. It comes
with the tracks and mounting for the system — you just add the
drapes. You can also get motorized window-treatment hardware
from manufacturers such as BTX (www.btxinc.com), Hunter Douglas
(www.hunterdouglas.com), Lutron (www.lutron.com/sivoia),
and Somfy (www.somfysystems.com).
A great resource for ideas about lighting and room control 
systems — and your home theater in general — is the magazine
Electronic House (www.electronichouse.com). It’s inexpensive,
available on newsstands, and has helpful hints about how to
approach your projects from lots of different angles (including
lots of home-theater-specific articles).

B
ack in Chapter 1 we gave you a 20,000-foot fly-by view of HDTV
(and TV technology in general). The deeper you get into the
HDTV world, the more complex and complicated the whole techni-
cal shebang gets — you go from HDTV-versus-analog into arcane
discussions of lines of resolution, pixels, scanning systems, fixed-
pixel displays, scaling systems, and more.
It’s enough to make your head spin, trust us. So, in this chapter, we
give you the deeper details that we glossed over back in Chapter 1.
We explain the similarities (and differences) between lines and pixels,
and we give you a firm grasp of horizontal-versus-vertical (it’s not
as easy as it sounds, believe it or not). We also provide more details
about interlaced and progressive-scan pictures, and give you a
primer on frames, fields and film-versus-video. It’ll be fun, so read on!
Lines and Pixels
Okay, we admit it. When we first got into the whole video/TV/HDTV
thing, we thought we had a good grip on the concept of “lines of
resolution” (or “scan lines”) — and pixels, and any other metric
used to describe resolution — the level of clarity and fine picture
detail on your screen.
But we were wrong — all the horizontal this and vertical that, and
lines and pixels were just too much to keep up with at times. Add
to this the fact that horizontal resolutions can sometimes refer to
lines that run vertically, and vice versa. It’s a big mess.

Going with lines
The oldest, and most common, way of describing a TV’s resolution
comes from the world of CRTs (cathode-ray tubes — see Chapter 24)
TVs. These TVs create an image by shooting an electron beam at the
screen and moving (scanning) from left to right and top to bottom.
The lines that result are referred to as scan lines.
We’re talking about the capabilities of the TV itself here — program
images have their own resolutions. For example, an HDTV program
may be 720p or 1080i — numbers that refer to the total scan lines
contained in the program material.
A TV’s vertical resolution (the metric most commonly referred to) is
the number of lines that the TV can display in the vertical direction.
Think of a stack of pancakes (with each pancake representing a line
moving — horizontally; yes, it’s confusing — across the screen).
The total number of pancakes in the stack (lines on-screen) that
the TV can display is its vertical resolution. See Figure 21-1 for a
picture that represents this.
Don’t forget! Vertical resolution measures the number of lines that
run horizontally across your screen!
Figure 21-1: Vertical resolution — think of pancakes (but don’t get 
too hungry).
For Vertical resolution,
count the lines that run
across the screen (left to
right)
Note: lines continue all the
way across the screen,

Part VII: Geek Stuff 
208

We’re sort of breaking the rules by describing “scan lines” and ver-
tical lines of resolution as being the same thing. They’re related,
they’re similar, they look/feel/smell alike, but technically scan lines
are the lines within a TV program — and vertical resolution refers
to how many lines the TV hardware can show. We think it’s a lot
easier to envision if you think of that electron gun scanning across
the screen first, so we presented it that way.
If a TV can’t display at least 720 vertical lines of resolution (720 deli-
cious pancakes), then it isn’t an HDTV-capable TV.
Now take a single one of those lines/pancakes, and look across it
horizontally. Each TV can display a limited number of individual
picture elements (for example, dots of alternating colors) along
that line and still keep it legible. This limit is the horizontal resolu-
tion of the TV. Figure 21-2 demonstrates horizontal resolution.
Figure 21-2: Counting horizontally to get horizontal resolution.
Picking pixels
While scanning and lines are the gist of what happens in an old-
fashioned CRT TV (even a fancy HDTV version of a CRT TV), many
newer TV technologies are fixed-pixel displays. What this means is
that these TVs, by nature of their physical design, don’t have an
electron beam moving across a screen, but instead have thousands

that run up and down on
the screen (top to bottom)

Chapter 21: TV Engineering 101 209

(or millions) of individual picture elements (pixels) that light up to
create the picture. These displays are “fixed” because (unlike a CRT)
they won’t let you change the number of pixels in the display by 
re-aiming or refocusing an electron beam.
LCD and plasma flat-panel TVs (Chapter 23), and LCD, LCOS and
DLP projection TVs (Chapter 22) are all fixed-pixel displays.
In a fixed-pixel display, resolution is determined by simply counting
up the number of pixels in a vertical stack (from top to bottom or
vice versa) — this is the vertical resolution — and across the screen
(left to right or vice versa) for horizontal resolution.
The resolution of a fixed-pixel display is usually written out or 
referenced as “horizontal resolution x vertical resolution.” For
example, Pat’s favorite Sony LCD rear projection TV has a resolu-
tion of 1386 x 788 pixels — 1386 pixels in the horizontal direction,
and 788 vertically.
If you’re used to setting up the resolution of a computer screen,
you’ve already got this concept down. 1024 x 768 (the most
common PC-monitor resolution setting) is just 1024 horizontal
pixels x 768 vertical pixels.
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
210
The magic million (or so)
Instead of just comparing vertical (or horizontal) lines of resolution, it can be very
instructive to compare HDTV to other TV sources (such as DVD or analog NTSC
broadcasts) by comparing total pixels. That is to say, by doing the math, and multi-
plying horizontal by vertical.
A typical analog NTSC broadcast, for example, might show 330 horizontal pixels by
480 vertical pixels, for a total 158,400 pixels. An anamorphic widescreen DVD zooms
up to 345,600 pixels. But even this number pales next to the potential of over two
million pixels in a 1080i HDTV picture. Even the lower resolution 720p HDTV picture
hits 921,600 pixels.
If you haven’t seen it yet, you’ll be simply amazed at what a million (give or take) pixels
on-screen means! It’s a huge difference from even the best DVD picture.
Remember that pixels aren’t the only determinant of picture quality — things like screen
size (and therefore how close together the pixels are), pixel shape, color accuracy,
brightness, and more all work together to determine picture quality. But resolution
is perhaps the most important factor, and HDTV really rules when it comes to res!

As with the lines of resolution, it’s the vertical number of pixels
that is most commonly referred to, and which is essential when
deciding if a TV can be called an HDTV. A fixed-pixel display must
have at least 720 vertical pixels to be called HDTV-capable.
The horizontal and vertical resolution in a fixed-pixel display is
that display’s native resolution. A TV signal (whether from broad-
cast or a recording) must be converted to this native resolution to
be displayed on the fixed-pixel screen. The device that performs
this task is the scaler, which we describe in detail in Chapter 6.
Defining standard and 
high resolutions
Knowing all these lines of resolutions and numbers of pixels can be
an interesting intellectual exercise (if you simply gotta know all the
stats of your HDTV), but you really need some sort of frame of ref-
erence to understand what’s good and what’s not.
We’ve already mentioned here that 720 vertical lines of resolution
(or pixels) is the baseline requirement to reaching HDTV nirvana,
but you probably want to know more details (otherwise, you’d
have skipped this “techie” chapter, right?).
Table 21-1 shows the most common types of TV signals, and the TV
resolutions required to show them in full detail.
If you’re not familiar with the i and p suffixes in Table 21-1, we
explain them in the following section, “Scanning and Interlacing.”

Vertical resolution gets all the attention, but horizontal resolution
is important, too — it’s not like your eyes can’t see sideways as
well as they can up and down, right? The whole HDTV industry,
however, is a bit “looser” with horizontal resolution than it is with
vertical — very few HDTVs can reproduce the full 1920 horizontal
pixels/lines that 1080i HDTV signals can reproduce, so horizontal
resolution is often de-emphasized in marketing materials and in
articles about HDTV. You do want as much horizontal resolution
as you can get, but you shouldn’t dismiss an HDTV just because it
can’t reproduce 1920 horizontal lines of resolution.
Scanning and Interlacing
Resolution doesn’t fully define and explain HDTV. HDTV signals
(and HDTV TV hardware requirements) are also defined by their
scan type. Traditional analog CRT monitors, designed for NTSC pro-
gramming, use interlaced scanning; many (more modern) HDTV
designs — including many CRT-based HDTVs — use a system
called progressive scanning.
Fixed-pixel displays are inherently progressive — that’s just the way
they work. If an interlaced signal is fed into a fixed-pixel display, the
display uses its internal scaler (Chapter 6) to convert this signal to
a progressive-scan one.
Fields, frames, and your TV
Before we get into details about interlaced-versus-progressive-scan,
there are two key concepts to understand:
 Frames: Frames are complete, full-screen images that make up
an instantaneous portion of the HDTV picture. In other words, in
a 720p HDTV signal, a frame is all 720 lines of the picture. NTSC
images are transmitted at 30 frames per second, while HDTV
images are transmitted at either 30 or 60 frames per second.
 Fields: Fields are simply half of a frame — the first field within
a frame consists of the odd numbered scan lines (1, 3, 5, and
so on), while the second field consists of the even numbered
scan lines. 
When a TV signal (whether it’s NTSC or HDTV) is transmitted
one field at a time, that signal is interlaced. Interlaced TV video
has 60 fields per second (actually 59.94 fields per second, but every-
one rounds up!) — these 60 fields are equivalent to 30 frames per
second (fps). Figure 21-3 shows how a frame is divided into fields. 
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
212

Figure 21-3: Frames and fields, oh my!
In a progressive-scan signal, both fields that make up a frame are
sent simultaneously, allowing the TV to create the entire frame at
once. In an interlaced system, only half of the picture is “drawn”
on the screen at once, but the short time period between fields
(60 fields per second!) means that your eyes see the two fields
as one.
So what’s better, interlace or progressive? Well, first we should
answer by saying that there’s nothing really wrong with inter-
laced video — it’s not an inherently bad thing. Having said that,
progressive-scan video has a smoother, more natural appearance.
Interlaced video tends to have a slightly flickery appearance, at
least when compared head to head with progressive-scan video.
Doing the pulldown
ATSC TV signals (standard- and high-definition) operate at either
30 or 60 fps. The film cameras that most movies (and some TV
shows) are shot on operate at 24 fps.
These differing frame rates make it a difficult to convert movies to
DVDs (or other formats) for standard-definition television viewing —
there’s not an easy way to evenly divide 24 and 30. The answer is to
create an interlaced video recording (such as a DVD) that alternately
Odd lines (short in this illustration)
are Field 1, Even lines are Field 2.

Frame. In progressive scan, all lines are
drawn simultaneously

purposes

Chapter 21: TV Engineering 101 213

repeats half the frames of video as 3 fields and the others as 2. This
process, called 3:2 pulldown turns the 24 film frames into 30 TV
video frames.
3:2 pulldown is a clever bit of math, but it can lead to artifacts
(flaws in the image), because sometimes two fields from different
frames are combined into a single frame — these frames may not
be identical, so you may end up with a jagged picture.
Why are we talking about this? Mainly because many HDTVs
include a circuit called something like “reverse 3:2 pulldown” or
“3:2 pulldown processing”. This circuit examines a TV signal and
recognizes 3:2 pulldown in action — then it does some wizardry
and removes the artifacts that 3:2 pulldown creates.

W
hen most people think of HDTV, they think (in a Homer
Simpsonesque interior-monologue voice), “Mmmmmmmmm,
big screens.” And when most people think big screens, they think
of projection TV systems. Projection TVs offer the most bang for
the buck in the HDTV world (and in the TV world in general) — the
biggest screen for the fewest bucks.
In the past, projection TVs (or at least most of them) also offered a
lousy picture. But fear not, those days are behind us now. Projection
TVs can also offer world-class HDTV pictures to go along with their
large screens and relatively low price tags.
In this chapter, we talk about the two main kinds of projection 
systems (front-projection systems, which use a separate screen,
and all-in-one rear-projection TVs). We get into the underlying
technology — many different systems used to actually project the
picture in a projection TV, each with pros and cons. Finally, we give
you the lowdown on screen systems for front-projection TVs.
Projection HDTV Design
As we’ve already hinted, there are two distinct formats for projec-
tion HDTVs:
 Rear-projection systems encapsulate the projection system
and the screen into a single chassis. These systems beam the
TV picture onto the back of the screen.

 Front-projection systems consist of two pieces: the projector
itself, and a separate screen. A front-projection system beams
the image onto the front side of the screen.
Rear projection
Most projection HDTVs sold today are rear-projection TVs (RPTVs).
The biggest advantage of the RPTV (compared to front-projection
systems) is simplicity — all the pieces and parts are in one chassis,
just as they are in an old-fashioned CRT (tube) TV (see Chapter 24
for more detail on these TVs). So with a RPTV, there’s no lens adjust-
ing and focusing of the picture on the screen. In fact, with the most
modern RPTV systems (such as DLP and LCD RPTVs — discussed
in the section titled “Projection TV Systems”), there’s not even any
need to “align” or aim the picture to avoid those awful “ghosty”
images you may have seen on older RPTVs. Figure 22-1 shows a
typical RPTV.
Figure 22-1: The high-def, big-screen bargain: the RPTV.
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
216

Compared to a front-projection HDTV, an RPTV
 Has a large (but relatively smaller) screen. RPTVs typically
range from 42 to 70 inches diagonally (they can get bigger, 
but those are the most common sizes), while front-projection
systems can fill up screens 100 inches or larger.
 Is generally less expensive. The most expensive RPTVs cost
more than entry-level front projectors, but you can expect to
pay $3,000 or less for an HDTV RPTV, while most HD-capable
front projectors start at about $5,000 or more.
 Is easier to install and set up. Most RPTVs can be plugged
in, turned on, and that’s it. Even the easiest-to-install front-
projection system requires adjustment in the placement of
lens and chassis to focus the picture to the right size on your
screen.
As far as picture quality is concerned, RPTVs (such as front pro-
jectors) can have extraordinary picture quality. The biggest factor,
when it comes to picture quality, isn’t so much RPTV-versus-front-
projector as it is the type of projection system — and the quality of
the individual projector.
The biggest picture shortcoming with most RPTVs revolves around
the viewing angle of the RPTV — this describes how far from perpen-
dicular to the screen a viewer can be and still see the picture clearly.
Some RPTVs have poor viewing angles, so they’re less than best
when viewers are seated far to either side of the HDTV. Figure 22-2
demonstrates viewing angle.

The other potential shortcoming of RPTVs is their size — not in
terms of screen size, but rather in terms of bulkiness. RPTVs based
on traditional CRT (tube) technologies can be humungous — taking
more of your room than you may be willing to allow.
The newest RPTVs, which use microdisplay technologies such as
DLP, are actually quite slim — barely thicker than flat-panel TVs
such as plasmas.
We think that these microdisplay RPTVs are perhaps the best buy
in HDTVs, combining a large screen with a slim overall package,
and a picture as good as plasma at less than half the price.
Front projection
When you’ve really got to have a big, BIG screen for your HDTV,
there’s only one choice — a front-projection system. A front projec-
tor system is really a lot like being at the movies, because there’s a
(possibly silver) screen in front of you, and a projector behind you.
In fact, some movie theaters have begun to give up film, and install
DLP projectors that are really just souped-up versions of the same
projectors you can buy for your home HDTV use.
Figure 22-3 shows a front-projection projector.
Figure 22-3: Bring the movie theater to your home.
Because you are projecting the image across the room and onto a
separate screen, theoretically there’s almost no limit to the size of
your screen (and picture). (Check out Chapter 26, where we talk
about projecting a 10-foot-by-20-foot image outdoors!)
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
218

The only real limit revolves around the brightness of image put out
by the projector — because a projector must be further away from
a bigger screen (and because it is lighting up a larger physical area),
it needs to put out a brighter picture than it would with a smaller
screen. Projector brightness is measured using a unit called ANSI
Lumens — projectors with 500 or so are best on smaller screens
(or in darker rooms), while projectors with 1,000 or more lumens
are considered quite bright. Some projectors (usually those
designed for PC use) are really bright, throwing out 2,000 or more
ANSI lumens. These super bright projectors have been designed
for use in brightly lit rooms, but can do double duty as projectors
for very large screens.
Many front-projection TVs have no built-in TV tuner — neither
HDTV/ATSC nor standard-definition/NTSC. So you need to use an
external tuner, set-top box or satellite receiver to watch TV.
Projection TV Systems
When you’re evaluating projection TV systems, you not only must
choose between front and rear projection, you also much choose a
projection technology. There are two types of projection systems:
 Traditional projectors based on CRT (cathode ray tube) 
projectors. These CRTs are specialized versions of the same
tubes found in traditional TVs to generate the light projected
onto the screen.
 Microdisplay projectors. These use microelectronic systems
such as LCDs and DLP chips, in conjunction with a powerful
light bulb, to project images on the screen.
Generally speaking, CRT-based systems create the best-looking 
picture — there’s life in the old tubes yet! — but they do this at the
expense of ease of use, size, and overall brightness (which relates
to screen size and the kind of room a projector is used in). Micro-
display projectors trade off a little bit in ultimate picture quality
(just a bit, though), but gain in ease of use (pull ’em out of the box
and turn ’em on), brightness and compactness (saving floor space
in your viewing room).
CRT
The granddaddy of projection TV systems is the CRT projection TV.
The CRT tubes in these projection TVs are similar to those used in
direct-view tube televisions (discussed in Chapter 24 — these are
the regular old TVs), but with one major difference: while a direct
Chapter 22: Projecting a Good Image 219

view HDTV has a single tube, a projection CRT HDTV has three
tubes, one each for red, green and blue colors.
Available in both rear and front-projection systems, the CRT is
simultaneously a pain in the neck and the highest-quality projection
TV you can buy. The three tubes account for the pain-in-the-neck
quality — getting the picture from these three tubes properly
aligned on the screen can be anywhere from slightly to madden-
ingly difficult to do, and accounts for many of the awful projection
TV images you’ve seen in the past.
This process is called setting convergence. Some CRT RPTVs have
automatic convergence systems that do a great job of setting this
up for you — if you have to do it manually, it’s quite difficult, and
best done by a pro.
Tubes have some definite picture advantages over other systems
though, as well as some additional negatives. For example:
 Pro: best black-level reproduction. Blacks are essential when
you’re watching a scene on TV with dark (or no) lighting and
lots of shadows. CRTs are the best of all systems at reproducing
black colors on screen.
 Pro: excellent color reproduction. Many microdisplay sys-
tems have a particular color that they can’t reproduce as well
as others — CRT systems don’t usually face this issue.
 Con: reduced brightness. Compared to microdisplays (which
use an intensely bright bulb to create light on the screen),
CRTs put out fewer lumens.
 Con: limited tube lifespan. While your CRT projection TV
should last years, the tubes do wear out, slowly and continu-
ously over time.
 Con: susceptible to burn-in. CRTs create a picture when elec-
trons hit a layer of phosphor (which lights up when struck by
these electrons). Images that don’t move (such as those in video
games or even stock tickers) can create a permanent “ghost”
image in these phosphors — effectively ruining your screen.
CRT projection TVs are the most susceptible HDTV for burn-in.
The finest CRT projection TVs (and the most expensive) are some
of the really high-end front-projection systems. The key factor in a
front-projection system is the size of the CRTs — generally speaking,
the bigger the better. Most projectors have 7- or 8-inch CRTs, but a
few mega-dollar units (often costing $40,000 or more) have 9-inch
CRTs. These are the projectors you find in dedicated home-theater
rooms of the truly rich and famous.
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
220

Rear-projection CRT-based HDTVs, on the other hand, are a relative
bargain. You can easily find a high-quality, HDTV-capable RPTV with
a big 50-plus-inch screen for just a hair over $1,000 — less than half
of the cost of a similar-size microdisplay RPTV.
The biggest disadvantage of CRT-based RPTVs is their sheer size —
these things are the behemoths of the HDTV world, particularly
when it comes to the depth of the unit (how far it sticks out from
the wall behind the TV). Because of the size of the tubes and the
complicated mirror systems required to get the image onto the
screen, some CRT RPTVs are as deep as 3 feet or more.
LCD
If you’ve ever used a laptop computer, cell phone, PDA, or just about
any kind of electronic device with a screen, then you’ve used an LCD
(or liquid-crystal display). LCDs range in size from tiny, sub-1-inch
models to huge 40-plus-inch versions (check out Chapter 23 for
examples of these).
LCD projection TVs tend to use LCDs from the smaller end of this
continuum, often as small as 1 inch or less. Like CRT RPTVs, LCD
RPTVs use not one, but three image sources — an individual LCD
each for red, green and blue. Unlike CRTs, however, these LCDs
don’t require periodic alignment (convergence), which makes
owning an LCD RPTV a much easier task for those of us who don’t
specialize in TV maintenance.
The small size of these LCDs accounts for what we think is the
biggest advantage of the LCD RPTV when compared to a CRT
model — LCD models are simply much thinner, closer to a flat-
panel TV than a traditional RPTV in depth. So they can fit into
your tight family room better than an older-tech CRT TV.
There are a couple of disadvantages of LCD projectors, however,
including the following:
 Screen doors: LCD screens consist of a large number of sharply
defined, square-shaped pixels that make up the image. When
blown up to big-screen size (generally speaking, 50 inches or
greater), these pixels can become visible. You’ll notice this
when you feel like you’re looking out your home’s screen door.
Better LCD HDTVs avoid this syndrome, but it can show up on
even the best projectors for very large images.
 Poor black reproduction: LCDs are a transmissive technology —
light shines through the LCD. It’s hard for LCDs to become
totally black (some light leaks though), so dark scenes look
Chapter 22: Projecting a Good Image 221

more like dark gray than true black. Better LCD HDTVs have
better black levels, but none match a CRT projector.
 Dead pixels: This is a huge deal for some folks — others won’t
even notice it. There are literally millions of pixels between the
three LCDs found in an LCD-projection HDTV. Occasionally one
of these pixels malfunctions or becomes “stuck,” resulting in
a visible dark or bright spot on your HDTV’s screen. The real
problem is that many manufacturers won’t fix or replace your
HDTV if you only have a few of these malfunctioning pixels —
so if this sort of thing really drives you crazy, check out the
warranty terms before you buy!
 Lamp death: The super-bright lamp that powers an LCD 
projector system has a limited lifespan — usually after a few
thousand hours of use, the bulbs either dim to below usable
levels or burn out altogether. While changing a bulb isn’t too
hard or too expensive in most cases (usually less than a couple
of hundred dollars), it is a bit of a pain.
DLP
LCD isn’t the only microdisplay technology vying for your projec-
tor dollars. Texas Instruments (of calculator and chip fame) has
developed a system called digital light processing (or DLP), which
is perhaps the hottest projector technology available today.
DLP systems are based on micromirror technology — a DLP chip
(the basis of the projector) is an optical semiconductor with mil-
lions of tiny mirrors controlled by the logic portion of the chip.
Basically these tiny little mirrors are individually controlled and
tilted to reflect an amount of light corresponding to the picture
brightness required for a single pixel of video. The angle of the
mirror is changed to move from black (or close to black) — where
no light is reflected onto the screen — through a whole range of
grays right on up to white. Figure 22-4 shows a DLP chip.
Figure 22-4: DLP chips contain millions of tiny mirrors!
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
222

With a DLP, color is added with a separate device known as the color
wheel — a set of red, green and blue filters arranged in a wheel
that is located in the path of light reflecting off the mirrors in the
DLP chip — these three colors mixed together produce the colors
found in your HDTV’s source material.
Some really expensive DLP projectors (like those used in movie
theaters) use three DLP chips (one each for red, green and blue)
instead of a color wheel. This system reproduces an even greater
number of colors and tends to provide a smoother image on-screen.
DLP-projection TVs are, as we mentioned, about the hottest
thing on the market today. They are very thin (some less than 
6 or 7 inches — nearly in plasma territory), produce a bright, 
beautiful picture, with better than LCD black reproduction, and
excellent color reproduction.
When you’re choosing a DLP-based projection system, be sure to
read the fine print. Not all DLP systems are HDTVs — some inex-
pensive projectors (mainly front-projection systems) use older
DLP chips that don’t reach HDTV resolutions. The latest DLP chip
(as we write this) is the HD2+, which provides 1,280-by-720 resolu-
tion (this perfectly matches 720p resolution requirements).
Most people don’t notice, but we should warn you about a situa-
tion with DLPs called the rainbow effect. This is caused by the 
spinning color wheel, and can cause a very small percentage of
the population to feel dizzy, or get a headache, while watching
DLP — particularly when moving their heads, or during rapidly
moving scenes on-screen.
Most people don’t have any problem with this rainbow effect —
and most people who own DLP HDTVs love them and never deal
with this problem at all!
LCOS
The newest projector technology on the block is called liquid crystal
on silicon (or LCOS). Only a few LCOS HDTVs are available on the
market today, but a very, very large company — none other than
Pentium chip maker Intel — has plunged into the LCOS market and
intends to put its vast scale and manufacturing expertise behind
the technology in a big way.
The LCOS (which combines liquid-crystal technology — like an
LCD — in a reflective instead of transmissive system) is designed to
be a cheaper way of getting to really high-definition HDTVs. While
Chapter 22: Projecting a Good Image 223

most LCD and DLP systems are limited to 720p resolutions (they
convert 1080i signals to 720p for playback on screen), some LCOS
systems can display the full resolution of 1080i. That means that an
LCOS system can display 1920 x 1080 pixels — something no other
consumer HDTV system can do.
There are a handful of LCOS projection TVs available on the market
today (mainly from Philips, www.philips.com), but Intel is making
a huge push to get its chips into a lot of new TVs soon. We expect
that LCOS projectors will be very common by the end of 2005.
Screens
While RPTVs have a built-in screen, front-projection TVs require
a separate screen system for displaying the image. There’s a wide
range of what you can use for a screen — some people just use a
white-painted wall or a tautly hung white bedsheet, for example —
but most people choose a commercially built TV screen.
You can find screens that are fixed (permanently mounted) — these
are usually the best value and the best performers. Unless you have
a dedicated home-theater room for your HDTV projector, you might
want a retractable screen (like the ones in your fifth-grade classroom,
only these are often electrically powered) or tripod screen (that you
can fold up and put in the closet when not using).
Even more important than the form are the technical characteris-
tics of the screen. The big three are the following:
 Gain: Gain is a measure of how reflective the screen is —
how much of the projector’s light gets bounced back to your
eyeballs. There’s a standard industry reference for gain, and
systems that have exactly as much gain as that reference are
rated at a gain of 1. More reflective (high-gain) screens are rated
greater than 1 (say 1.2), while less reflective (low-gain) screens
are rated below 1 (many are rated at 0.8). If you have a CRT
projector, get a high-gain screen (between 1 and 1.3, though
you can go higher if needed). Microdisplay projectors can use
a low-gain screen (0.8 or higher) due to their brightness.
 Viewing angle: Most display systems have a limited angle
(from perpendicular) in which they look best. Sit outside that
angle, and the picture becomes very dim. Viewing angle is
inversely proportional to gain. In other words, higher-gain
screens have smaller viewing angles. For this reason, you are
best off choosing the lowest-gain screen that works with your
projector in your room. Microdisplay projectors have light to
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
224

spare, so a low-gain screen is worthwhile to gain (pardon the
pun) a bigger viewing angle. Viewing angles are usually listed
in a number of degrees (say, 90). Your viewing angle is half
this amount (45, in this case) on either side of perpendicular.
 Aspect ratio: Screens are available in either the 16:9 widescreen
or 4:3 aspect ratios. You should of course, choose the same
aspect ratio as that of your projector — which, with any HDTV,
is 16:9. You may want to buy “masks” that can be placed on
the sides of your screen when you’re watching 4:3 material
(such as older, standard-def TV shows). These masks — similar
to mattes for a picture frame — can help avoid any “leakage”
of light beyond the edges of your picture.

F
lat-panel TV technology — super-thin HDTVs that you can hang
on the wall like a painting — have really taken a prime place in
the popular zeitgeist. A big-screen, flat-panel plasma or LCD TV has
become the status symbol of the ’00s — not just in the living room,
but in hotel lobbies, retail stores, and even in the back of cars.
There’s a good reason for this mania — flat panels provide a large
viewing area with almost no intrusion into your HDTV viewing room.
If that was all they did, they’d be pretty cool — but they can offer a
very high-quality HDTV picture as well.
In this chapter we talk about flat panels, and specifically about
plasma HDTVs and LCD flat-panel HDTVs. We also discuss the pros
and cons of each type, and compare them to other more traditional
HDTVs.
Many flat-panel displays ship as monitors only — with neither an
HDTV nor an NTSC tuner included as part of the display. Remember
that you need some sort of external HDTV and NTSC tuner (or a
cable set-top box or satellite receiver) to view TV on these flat-panel
displays.
Loving Your LCD
We are willing to bet that you’re already familiar with the LCD dis-
play. If you have a flat-panel display for your PC, a laptop PC, a PDA,
a cell phone, a GameBoy — or just about any digital device with a
display, you have an LCD. LCDs have been around for decades,

mainly in lower-resolution formats and smaller sizes (such as phone
screens), but they are getting larger all the time — and growing
sharper in resolution.
We’re talking about direct view LCDs here — in other words, LCD
HDTVs where you look at the LCD display itself. In Chapter 22, we
talk about projectors with LCD microdisplays — teeny tiny LCDs
that are used to project a bigger image on a screen. Figure 23-1
shows an LCD HDTV.
Figure 23-1: Liquid crystals put the HD in your TV.
Even as they get bigger, however, LCDs tend to be the smallest
HDTVs available on the market (so they may not be big enough for
a true home-theater environment). The process of “growing” LCD
crystals is a manufacturing challenge, and bigger LCDs are harder to
make because they have lower yields (or percentage of LCD crys-
tals that can be used for HDTVs). Because of this, most LCD HDTVs
on the market are smaller than 30 or 32 inches — smaller, in other
words, than projectors or plasmas (discussed in the second half of
this chapter), and smaller than many tube-based CRT HDTVs.
There are a few large-screen LCD HDTVs on the market these
days — such as Samsung’s 40-inch model — and we’ve seen
announcements (but not yet actual products) of 50-inch and
larger LCD HDTVs. Typically, however, LCD gives way to plasma
once you hit the 40-inch mark, for thin TV displays.
Advances in LCD manufacturing, as well as new technologies, such
as O-LED (Organic LED) and SED (Surface-conduction Electron-
emitter Displays), promise LCD-like displays in ever-bigger sizes in
the future. In the long run, LCD displays will be huge!
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
228

Not only will LCD HDTVs grow to huge dimensions, they’ll also be
huge sellers. A few reasons why include the following:
We’re not including the “super-skinny-hang-it-on-the-wall” attribute
here, because we think that’s obvious. We can’t resist mentioning it
again anyway, just because it’s so cool.
 Excellent color: LCDs can display millions of colors, and do so
accurately (meaning the color coming off the screen is faithful
to the color in your broadcast or recording). Not all flat-panel
TVs (or HDTVs in general) can duplicate this color accuracy.
 PC-monitor-capable: Many LCD HDTVs can also be used as big
(huge!) PC monitors. This trick is especially cool if you have
one of those neat Media Center PCs we discuss in Chapter 16.
 No burn-in: HDTVs that rely upon phosphors, such as CRTs
and plasmas, can, under certain circumstances, experience
burn-in, where ghost images are permanently burned into the
screen. LCDs are immune from this phenomenon — so feel
free to play video games, watch the CNBC stock ticker, and so
on with no fear.
 Inherently progressive: Unlike tube (CRT) TVs, LCDs don’t rely
on a scanning “gun” and interlaced scanning (see Chapter 21).
Instead, LCDs use millions of tiny transistors that can be indi-
vidually controlled by the “brains” inside the display. This
means that LCDs can easily handle progressive-scan sources,
such as progressive-scan DVD and HDTV.
Besides the size limitation we discuss earlier in this section, you
might want to consider a few other issues before you choose an
LCD HDTV:
 Expensive for their size: LCD HDTVs are great, but they’re not
cheap. Of course, all flat-panel TVs are relatively pricey, but
LCD HDTVs typically cost more, per inch, than do plasmas.
In the summer of 2004, you can expect to pay about $1,800
for an HDTV-ready, 22-inch LCD display. By comparison, an
HDTV-ready, 32-inch direct-view set can be found for about
half of that amount!
 Poor reproduction of blacks: Black images are among the
hardest for most TVs to reproduce (CRT TVs are best at this).
LCD TVs tend to produce grays, not blacks — LCD HDTVs lose
out, in this regard, to both CRT and plasma TVs.
 Limited viewing angle: LCDs typically have a poor viewing
angle — the angle you can sit away from perpendicular and
still see a clear image on-screen. Manufacturers have been
Chapter 23: Thin Is In 229

working diligently to improve this characteristic (with some
success). Check the specs before you buy — most LCD HDTVs
will have viewing angles listed in their specifications.
There are not only horizontal (left to right), but also vertical
(top to bottom) viewing angles. If you’re hanging an LCD HDTV
on the wall, the vertical viewing angle may be more important
to you than the horizontal — most people only pay attention
to the horizontal viewing angle.
 Slow pixel response time: Another area that LCD HDTV makers
are working overtime to improve is the pixel response time of
their TVs. Basically, the individual pixels within an LCD HDTV
take a slight amount of time to change color and intensity. For
really fast-moving video content (particularly in a 720p picture,
where every pixel can change as many as 60 times per second),
an LCD TV can end up with some artifacts (visible flaws) where
the picture from a previous frame is still slightly visible on-
screen as the new one is being drawn. Typically, this isn’t a
huge and noticeable deal, but it’s not beyond the realm of 
possibility that you might notice it.
 Limited brightness: The LCD is a transmissive system — light
is shined through the liquid crystals — some of that light gets
absorbed or reflected back away from the viewer. This means
that LCD displays are not as bright as CRT, plasma and even
some projection TVs (DLP, for example) — this could be a
factor in a brightly lit room.
Everyone’s Crazy About Plasma
The really hot spot in the HDTV technology market is the plasma TV.
Plasma TVs combine a thin, compact chassis with a truly large (even
huge) screen size, and then add beautiful high-definition pictures to
the mix. For many potential HDTV buyers, plasmas really fit the bill.
A plasma screen contains literally millions of gas-filled cells (each
one acting as a single image pixel) trapped between two pieces of
glass. An electrical grid zaps these cells and causes the gases to
ionize (and ionized gas is plasma — hence the name). The ionized
gases, in turn, cause a layer of phosphor on the viewer’s side layer
of glass to light up (just as the electron gun in a CRT causes the
phosphor to light up on the front of the tube). 
Despite their compact dimensions (in the “depth” direction at
least — many plasmas are only about 4 inches deep), plasma
HDTVs are available in 42-, 50-, and even 60-plus-inch sizes. Imagine
a 4- or 5-inch-deep HDTV that spans 5 feet diagonally, and you can
see the instant appeal of plasma.
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
230

Other benefits of plasma displays include these:
 Excellent brightness: Plasma HDTVs are second only to CRT
direct-view TVs (discussed in Chapter 24) in terms of picture
brightness — plasmas don’t rely on a light bulb shining through
or reflecting off of something (as an LCD or DLP system does).
In some ways, plasma brightness is even better than CRT’s
because the picture is uncannily evenly bright across the entire
screen. In a CRT, on the other hand, there always is some slight
(or not so slight) difference in brightness as the electron beam
reaches different parts of the screen.
 High resolution: HDTV plasma TVs can often reach higher
horizontal resolutions that CRT-based direct-view sets just
can’t match. The finest plasma TVs have such high resolutions
(and such smooth images) that they look like nothing more
than beautiful film images.
Just because it’s plasma and it costs $3,000 or more doesn’t
make it an HDTV. We don’t know of any sub-$3,500 plasma that
isn’t an EDTV rather than an HDTV. This will change eventually,
but for now, “cheaper” plasmas will be EDTVs.
 Progressive by nature: Like LCD displays, plasma systems
don’t use a scanning electron beam to create a picture.
Instead, all the pixels on the screen are lit up simultaneously.
Progressive HDTV sources (such as 720p) and non-HDTV
sources (such as progressive-scan DVD players) are displayed
to full advantage on a plasma HDTV.
 A wide viewing angle: Unlike LCDs (which often have prob-
lems in this regard), plasma displays have a good picture even
when you’re sitting “off axis” (not perpendicular to the screen
surface). This is a huge benefit for smaller rooms, where view-
ers may sit relatively far off to the sides of the screen, at wider
angles.
Plasma’s not perfect, of course:
 Susceptible to burn-in: Any system that uses a phosphor
screen to display video can fall victim to the phosphor burn-in
mentioned earlier in this chapter. If the Xbox is a primary HDTV
source in your home, consider something besides a plasma —
maybe an LCD HDTV or a rear-projection microdisplay HDTV.
You can minimize burn-in on any display by calibrating the set
properly and reducing the brightness from its (usually too-
high) factory setting.
 Shorter lifespan: Another phenomenon of any phosphor-based
display system is that eventually the phosphors “wear out” or
lose their brightness. This is a subtle and slow process, but it
Chapter 23: Thin Is In 231

inevitably happens. If you’ve saved up to buy an HDTV to last
you a lifetime, well, don’t get a plasma unless your personal
actuary tells you that you’re close to the end of your rope.
Before you buy, check the manufacturer’s specifications on
hours to half brightness (the point at which the display is only
half as bright as it was when new). For example, if this specifi-
cation is 20,000 hours, and you watch the set for 6 hours a day,
it will be effectively worn out in about 9 years. If you have kids,
keep in mind that 6 hours a day is (comparatively) not a lot of
time for the TV to be on every day.
 Less-than-perfect color reproduction: Although plasma dis-
plays are capable of producing a breathtaking array of colors, all
the sets built to date have had an unfortunate tendency to make
red colors look more orange than true red. If you’re a huge fan
of slasher horror flicks, this might take away some of your fun!
 Poor reproduction of black: Although plasma displays are a
near equal to CRT sets in terms of absolute brightness, they fall
short in the realm of reproducing black images. Most plasmas
do slightly better job than LCD TVs at black reproduction, they
fall short of CRTs and some projection systems (such as DLP).
Keep in mind that every type of HDTV has its pros and cons. We’re
certainly not trying to talk you out of going the plasma route (if
your budget can handle it), just making sure that you’re informed.
We doubt that you’ll find anything to dislike about the picture and
performance of the best HDTV plasma sets — with the possible
exception of the price tag!
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
232
Taking a plasma uphill
Plasma TVs rely upon a thin layer of gas (which gets ionized and turns — eventually —
into the picture you see). If you think back to your chemistry classes in high school and
college, you may start remembering . . . well, let’s not go there. You may also, how-
ever, recall concepts like the ideal gas law (PV=nRT), which basically says that (all
else being equal) the volume of a gas is inversely related to its pressure. Which is
a nice way of saying that if the atmospheric pressure goes down (as it does at high
elevations), a gas expands.
As some folks living in high-altitude cites have discovered, this expanding gas can
cause the glass screen in a plasma to “bow” outward, and potentially vibrate and make
an annoying noise. If you live some place high (say a mile or higher), check with the
manufacturer’s specs before buying a plasma set. Many manufacturers have begun
to make specific design changes in reaction to this situation, and have begun selling
plasmas that won’t get altitude sickness.

e’ve all seen (and watched) CRT (cathode-ray-tube) TVs —
these are the traditional “tube” TVs that are in hundreds of
millions of homes around the world. CRT is an “old-school” tech-
nology that’s been used for TVs for more than 60 years, but that
doesn’t mean that there isn’t still some life left in that old box.
In fact, CRTs in many ways offer the best pictures available in the
HDTV world. They aren’t the biggest, they aren’t always the highest
in absolute resolution, and they’re certainly not the slimmest or
thinnest HDTVs, but just about nothing can beat a CRT HDTV when
it comes to brightness, reproduction of colors, and the ability to
show darkly lit scenes (black reproduction).
In this chapter, we start with an overview of how CRT TVs work and
what they are. We follow with the pros and cons of the CRT as an
HDTV. We finish with aspect ratios. (CRTs are the one kind of HDTV
screen where you often find 4:3 aspect ratios. We tell you why that
is, and what you should consider if you’re buying a CRT HDTV.)
All About CRTs
The CRT consists of three major elements (sure, there are a bunch
of other small and significant parts — the ones listed here are the
key parts):

 The vacuum tube: This is why they call a TV “the tube.” The
major structure inside a CRT HDTV is a large glass vacuum
tube. You may also hear these referred to as direct view TVs —
direct view as opposed to projection, meaning you watch the
image directly. This tube is what makes a CRT HDTV simulta-
neously heavy and fragile.
 Phosphor coating: On the inside of this vacuum tube, on the
opposite side of the screen from where you view the TV, is a
coating of phosphors. These molecules emit light when they
are hit with electrons — this light is the picture you see.
 An electron gun: This device at the back (or neck) of the tube,
is the source of the electrons that pummel the phosphors on
the front (screen) side of the tube. The electron gun controls
this beam of electrons by aiming them (electromagnetically)
into a series of scan lines that run across the screen.
A color CRT actually has three electron guns — one each for color of
red, green, and blue. This combination of colors (often called RGB)
can be combined to produce any color on the screen.
CRT Pros and Cons
Because CRT TVs are a mature technology, lots of folks don’t give
them a second (or first!) thought when they’re shopping for a new
HDTV. We think it makes sense to at least consider a CRT HDTV.
Some reasons include the following:
 Best at black: When it comes to producing video that accu-
rately reproduces dark scenes (such as the shadows in a
horror movie when the bad guy is sneaking up on the nubile
teenage girls with this chainsaw/axe/etc.). Most other HDTVs
can only produce grays that approximate black — CRTs can
give you something like inky black!
 Work well in a bright room: CRT tubes really blast out the
light. Some of them are so bright they could almost replace the
fresnel lens in a lighthouse (well, not really). What this means
is that CRT HDTVs are perhaps the most suitable of all types for
use in a brightly lit room. So if you’re mainly watching sports
in a family room with floor-to-ceiling windows, consider CRT.
 Easy on the wallet: Because the factories and machines and
technologies behind CRT are old (though constantly refined),
CRTs are rather inexpensive to build. HDTV CRT TVs are, of
course, more expensive than their analog bretheren, but still
releatively cheap. You can find a 32-inch CRT HDTV for well
under $1,000 — under $700 for smaller, bedroom-sized models.
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
234

You’re simply not going to find a plasma, LCD or projector
HDTV for that little cash (unless you’re talking about a really,
really tiny LCD TV).
Nothing’s perfect, CRTs have some downsides, too. These are
some that get us in a lather:
 Size does matter: That is to say, if you want a really big screen
TV, CRT may not be for you. It’s a lot easier, as an engineering
and manufacturing challenge, to create a big screen TV using
a projector system, or even a plasma or LCD system, than it is
using a CRT. Huge vacuum tubes aren’t easy to design, and
they’re even harder to build. If you’re going to be sitting more
than 10 feet from your HDTV, you should consider something
besides a CRT.
Another problem with big CRT TVs is making sure that the
electron beam can be accurately aimed the right places on the
screen — the bigger the screen the harder it is to keep the pic-
ture consistent across the entire screen. This is just a matter
of geometry — the edges of the screen are further away, and
at a more obtuse angle from the gun(s) than is the center of
the screen.
 Portly TVs: We’re sure you’ve seen (and probably lifted)
enough CRT TVs (be they HDTVs or just analog sets) to know
this one by heart. CRT TVs, especially once their size moves
beyond the 30+ inch mark, are really heavy. We mean REALLY
heavy — back-breakingly, “Hey ma where’s my hernia belt”
heavy. They’re also fat — the geometries required by the tube
require a lot of depth. You’ll never hang a CRT on the wall (at
least not without some huge bridge girder-like stand), and it’ll
never be slim and sexy like a plasma or microdisplay projector
system. So to give you an example, the Zenith C32V37 Direct
View Integrated HDTV Television is 27 in x 36.4 in x 22.4 in
(HxWxD) and 158.07 lbs ... that’s typical.
The reason big CRT HDTVs are so heavy has to do with the
vacuum tube. To get the tube so big without having it break
under it’s own weight, the glass must be extra thick, and extra
thick in this case means extra heavy.
 Lower resolution: While CRT HDTVs can have extremely high
resolutions, most don’t reach the levels of resolution found
in the best LCD or LCOS systems, or even to the resolution
that the most expensive CRT-based front-projection TVs
reach. Where direct view CRTs fall a bit short is in the hori-
zontal resolution — the number of pixels running across the
screen from left to right. 1080i, for example, can use up to
1920 pixels in this direction; very few CRT systems can focus
in on that large a number of distinct pixels horizontally.
Chapter 24: Good Ol’ Tubes 235

If you can spend some extra money, you might consider checking
out a CRT-based projection TV, discussed in Chapter 22. These sys-
tems cost more, and take some extra work in terms of setup and
ongoing maintenance, but they provide the picture benefits of a
CRT HDTV with the big screen advantages of a projection system.
Many CRT HDTVs display images either as 480p (standard-definition)
or 1080i (HDTV!). Some accept any sort of HDTV signal (such as
720p) and convert it to 1080i, but other sets require you to send a
1080i signal into the back of your HDTV. Make sure you know what
your CRT HDTV requires, and make sure that your HDTV tuner, set-
top box or satellite receiver can be configured to output 1080i —
even when the program itself is broadcast in 720p. If your CRT HDTV
has a built-in HDTV tuner, you can ignore this advice!
Navigating the CRT Jungle
If you decide to go with a CRT HDTV, you have to decide among a
couple of features and attributes.
Dealing with aspect ratios
Most other types of HDTVs are available in only one aspect ratio —
and that is the widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio (we discuss aspect
ratio in detail in Chapter 21). Direct view CRTs differ in this regard
because HDTV-capable TVs are widely available in both 4:3 and 16:9
aspect ratios.
Which to choose
In the past (and we’re talking about the recent past — just a year
or two ago) we often recommended that CRT HDTV buyers spend
their money on 4:3 HDTVs with anamorphic squeeze functionality
built in (see the next section, “Doing the squeeze”). But that was
then, this is now, and we’re changing with the changing times.
See, one of the big reasons we recommended 4:3 CRT HDTVs was
because there simply weren’t a lot of choices otherwise. But CRT
manufacturers have tooled up their factory floors to produce more
16:9 tubes, and now a whole bunch of TV brands are offering 30-inch
and 34-inch widescreen CRT HDTVs.
The other thing that has helped change our minds is the fact that
there’s simply more widescreen content available these days (and
more arrives almost daily, it seems).
Part VII: Geek Stuff 
236

What we’re getting at here is that we now generally recommend at
16:9 CRT HDTV over a 4:3 model for most people. We still like 4:3
models for a couple of reasons:
 They’re cheaper — always a good reason if your budget
(like most people’s) is a bit tight.
 For the same size, you get more screen area on a 4:3 TV. This is
just a matter of math: height times width = area. A 32-inch 4:3
set (which costs less) has 1 square inch more picture area than
a 34-inch 16:9 model, and probably costs 20 percent less to boot!
We recommend you get a 4:3 HDTV only if it has the anamorphic
squeeze function we’re about to discuss. Fortunately, just about
every model we know of today does have this function.
Doing the squeeze
If you do choose a 4:3 television, you really should make sure that
you choose one with a feature called anamorphic squeeze (also
called raster squeeze or 16:9 mode). This function allows you to
watch full-resolution widescreen content (HDTV or DVD-based) on
a 4:3 HDTV screen.
Here’s what the squeeze function does: While you’re watching
widescreen HDTV or DVD content, your HDTV re-aims its electron
gun, so that the gun beams scan lines onto the screen phosphors
in a 16:9 window on the screen. This re-aimed picture looks, at first
glance, exactly like the traditional “letterboxed” picture that old-
fashioned analog TVs use to display widescreen content — with
the black bars on the bottom and top of the picture. The difference
is this: With a letterboxed picture, your TV actually wastes some of
its scan lines to “draw” those black bars on the screen — so your
actual picture resolution is decreased, because not all of the scan
lines are used to draw the picture. When an HDTV uses the squeeze
function, all scan lines (usually 1080 of them) are used for the pic-
ture. The black bars are simply unlit parts of the screen. The result
is a clearer, sharper picture.
Some displays have an automatic system for detecting 16:9 sources
and turning on this mode, and others have a button on the remote
to activate it. We like the ones with the automatic mode, of course.
We’re lazy.
This concept wouldn’t work with most other displays — which are
fixed-pixel displays, with a set number of pixels in each direction
(horizontally and vertically). The pixels (and scan lines) on a CRT,
on the other hand, aren’t determined by the shape of the screen,
Chapter 24: Good Ol’ Tubes 237

but are instead controlled by the electron gun — which itself can be
controlled and can change how it aims its beam. In a fixed-pixel dis-
play, you can change between 16:9 and 4:3, but not without leaving
some pixels unused (leaving, in other words, some of your resolu-
tion on the table).
If your HDTV has this mode, make sure you’ve set your DVD player
to “think” it’s connected to a 16:9 TV. Otherwise you don’t get any-
thing from your display’s anamorphic squeeze function, because
the DVD player plays widescreen movies in letterbox mode, not
anamorphic. (If all this anamorphic talk confuses you, check out
Chapter 11, where we discuss it in more detail.)
Getting flat
CRT HDTVs will never be flat-panel TVs like plasmas and LCDs —
there’s simply too much going on behind the scenes (or in the back
of the tube) to make a CRT that hangs on the wall and leaves you
room for a nice game of Nerf hoops in the family room. But CRT
TVs can be flat-screen TVs.
That is to say, the very front surface of the TV tube — the screen
itself — can be manufactured so that it is truly flat.
Older CRTs (and, in fact, most CRTs still sold today) had curved
screen surfaces — which made it a bit easier to design the electron
gun and such. A flat screen surface, however, has the distinct advan-
tage of not picking up nearly as many reflections or as much glare
from light sources in your viewing room.
A flat screen doesn’t make your picture better per se — it just
makes it easier for you to enjoy that picture because you aren’t
squinting through some awful glare to see what’s on the screen.

In this section, we suggest ten great places to go looking
for your HDTV, from highly rated on-line superstores, to
really informative and consultative specialty sites, to your
local electronics store. There are pros and cons to buying
at various places so read this before you buy anything.

B
uying an HDTV is like buying any other major piece of new
electronic equipment: It can be extremely nerve-racking to try
to balance the desire for the best possible features and systems with
the innate fear of finding out, too late, that you’ve paid too much
or bought something that is instantly obsolete.
Complicating this situation is the wide variety of sources and
prices for HDTV systems, making simple comparisons difficult
to find. HDTV systems can come packaged with other services,
such as cable or satellite service. HDTVs can be sold along with
a computer system or sold separately on auction sites. They are
easily accessible through online buying services as well as at the
traditional electronics stores. HDTV is everywhere.
There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach — there
is no single answer to fit every consumer, any more than there is
one HDTV to fit every living room. The good news is that with so
many options, one will fit your needs, regardless of where you live.
Speaking of geography, it should be noted that our top-ten list
doesn’t include regional electronics mega-stores, even though these
are often good places to kick the tires and do the actual purchase.
Finally, a word of warning for the first-time HDTV shopper: Be sure
you know what you are buying. Many HDTVs don’t come with actual
HDTV receivers or tuners, meaning they are only HDTV-ready, and
you’ll have to buy a separate device to get HDTV programming. In
some instances, a content provider such as a cable or satellite com-
pany provides the necessary tuner or receiver for free — so it helps
to know where your content is coming from before you plunk down
your hard-earned cash.

Crutchfield
Crutchfield (www.crutchfield.com) — an online retailer — stands
head and shoulders above others for multiple reasons. In addition
to the fact it is unique in offering shipping for $30 or less, free return
shipping, and a 30-day trial of all equipment, Crutchfield also has a
wide selection of HDTV options, organized for easy browsing. If you
get to this site knowing what you want, you can get in and get out
quickly.

242
The pitfalls of online ordering
Ordering online is, in most ways, much easier than buying from a brick-and-mortar
store. It is simply much easier to find the models you are seeking and to do oranges-
to-oranges price comparisons. Even if you don’t wind up buying a system online, there
are online price-comparison engines, such as the How Stuff Works site at http://
howstuffworks.shopping.com/xGS-hdtv~linkin_id-3055268 or the
excellent PriceGrabber site (www.pricegrabber.com). What’s more, you can often
avoid paying sales tax — which adds up very quickly on a multi-thousand-dollar item.
But there are a couple of issues that any consumer must consider when attempt-
ing to order HDTV equipment online:
Shipping costs: These can wipe out savings, especially if the online vendor charges
by weight instead of imposing a flat fee. Expect to pay a significant shipping fee. Most
online vendors also expect you to pay return shipping, if needed, and many charge
you a restocking fee if you return the unit. Most require that you return the system
in its original packing and that you call and get return authorization before shipping
it back. There is also a variation among vendors as to the available forms of ship-
ping, which can drive up cost.
Installation: Installing an HDTV system may not be rocket science, but it can be a
headache to non-technical buyers — and a backache to the supergeek. Remember:
An online vendor simply ships the system to your house — but doesn’t carry the
unit inside and set it up. Some retail stores (and a few online vendors) handle setup,
but that adds to system cost.
Warranty: Some manufacturers with in-home service warranties won’t let you return
the item after you’ve signed for it — it has to be repaired on premises. So check your
box very carefully before you sign for the item.
Are they legit? This is, perhaps, the most important consideration. HDTV equipment
makers want to make sure that only authorized online vendors sell their gear. The
smart thing to do, before making a purchase, is to check the equipment maker’s
Web site to make sure your online vendor is authorized to sell that specific piece of
equipment. Otherwise you could wind up without a legitimate warranty on the
system — which could cost you big bucks down the road.

If you get to this site still uncertain as to what you want to buy, there
is plenty of information to help you make up your mind. The site
includes glossaries, background information, and an option for live
online chat to get a second opinion.
Above all, Crutchfield has a great reputation for knowing everything
there is to know about what it sells, and helping the customer
through the whole life cycle of the purchase. This consultative
approach has won legions of repeat customers. Crutchfield accepts
most credit cards and checks. Orders are filled promptly, and there
is online order tracking. Customer responsiveness is high, and
Crutchfield also offers technical support for life — which, for
newer technology such as HDTV, can be critical.
Gateway
Gateway Computers entered the home-entertainment market in
some attention-getting ways. It was the first major retailer to offer
a plasma-screen TV for less than $3K. It also has led the market in
its launch of home-entertainment gear built around computers.
All this would be moot if Gateway didn’t have a strong HDTV path,
which it does. The sets connect to a PC (as mentioned), but they
require separate HDTV receivers. Gateway is playing at the high end
of the market versus the down-and-dirty connect-your-computer
end. The company is known for solid customer support, but its
return policies are similar to those of other online merchants —
return authorization is required, the customer forfeits the original
shipping charge and must pay return shipping, and a restocking fee
is charged. The company offers extended warranty options — which
might be appealing (especially to the accident-prone); the more
expensive option includes on-site repairs and/or replacement for
accidental damage to the TV set — and even to the remote.
One great benefit of buying from Gateway or another computer
company is that it’s easier to convince the accounting department
that this is a valid business expense. We’re not kidding. We know
one guy (shhhh!) who had a $5K use-or-lose department budget
for computer gear. He basically bought a $1K computer and a $4K
“computer screen.” You oughta see his presentations . . . 
Other computer makers are getting into the act, as the distinction
between monitors and TVs are blurring — after all, a TV is just a
monitor with some fancy innards for a tuner and some interfaces.
As the tuner has moved out of the TV and into set-top boxes and
PCs, the bulk of what is left is a monitor. Large-screen LCDs and
plasma displays are increasingly common, as well as home-priced,
Chapter 25: Ten Places to Buy an HDTV 243

business-class HDTV-capable projectors. So check bundled offer-
ings from such computer dealers as Dell (www.dell.com), HP
(www.HP.com), and ViewSonic (www.viewsonic.com).

What to look for when shopping online
To even a trained eye, all online shopping storefronts can look alike. How can you
make sure you don’t get ripped off? Well you can never be 100 percent certain, but
here are some things to look for when trying to ascertain whether a site is “real” or
not. You want a site that meets these criteria:
 Accepts major credit cards
 Has visible and understandable policies for privacy, returning items, for when
credit cards are charged, and for getting in touch with the company
 Lists a physical address of some sort on the site
 Has a shopping-cart interface for taking and totaling orders
 Offers a secure server for the transaction (look for a lock in the lower-right
corner of your browser to show that a secure transaction is underway)
 Has product-specific pages so you can make sure you are truly buying exactly
what you ordered
Check out a seller’s reputation. Cnet.com is a good source for this sort of information.
Whenever you click on the button to Check the latest prices on Cnet, you see a listing
of pricing by vendor — the “CNET certified” column tells you how well the company
stacks up on Cnet’s ratings, and you can click on the Store Profile listed under each
store logo in order to find out specifically what is driving each company’s ratings.
(We never buy from any store that has received less than 85-percent positive feed-
back from Cnet’s users. For a benchmark example, check out Crutchfield’s ratings at
http://reviews.cnet.com/4011-5_7-278703.html?tag=mlpmerch.)
Consider — seriously — using a service like Escrow.com to hold your money until
the product arrives in one piece. Escrow.com is easy to use:
1. The buyer and seller agree to the terms and details of the transaction.
2. The buyer sends payment to Escrow.com. Payment is verified and deposited into
a trust account.
3. The seller ships the merchandise to the buyer, knowing that the buyer’s payment
is secured.
4. The buyer accepts the merchandise after having the opportunity to inspect it.
5. Escrow.com pays the seller after all conditions of the transaction are met.

Many online shopping sites (such as Amazon.com) also sell HDTV-
ready sets bearing the familiar computermakers’ logos, so don’t be
surprised if you run across those brands in those venues. However,
we recommend that you always visit the manufacturer’s home site,
so you can see what special deals and bundles it’s offering.
Chapter 25: Ten Places to Buy an HDTV 245
What about Amazon.com, eBay.com, 
and Cnet.com?
When you think about buying anything online, Amazon.com and eBay.com certainly
come to mind. For those of us with a more technical slant, Cnet.com comes to mind as
well. These sites have expanded their horizons immensely from their book, auction,
and technical roots, to encompass a huge legion of sellers of all sorts of goods —
including HDTVs. With the exception of some models shown on Amazon, these sites
mostly serve as price-comparison engines, showing you where you can buy the
units displayed for the least cash.
Amazon.com has a special section for buying HDTVs, located by navigating to
Electronics➪Categories➪Audio & Video ➪TVs & HDTVs➪HDTVs. There you can see
direct deals that Amazon has for selling the items under its own storefront, as well as
links to major vendors like Best Buy and Crutchfield. As with most of Amazon’s entries,
you get detailed information about the product, customer reviews, and (here’s what
we like) what other items people looked at when they were looking at this product.
As far as eBay is concerned, this is a more unpredictable adventure. We priced one
60-inch plasma on eBay and found pricing for the system — brand new, in the box —
ranged from $2,200 to $17,999. It’s hard to explain such a price range, but definitely think
twice before you send that much money to someone on eBay (or any stranger). Be
aware that many of these vendors may not be authorized vendors — and (as we
mentioned earlier in the chapter) that could mean a voided warranty. Still, there are
valid, great deals to be found on eBay, as with many of the other items sold on the site.
Caveat emptor, especially with newer vendors who don’t have a long track record.
Cnet (www.cnet.com) has really emerged as a powerful force in comparison shopping
as well, with content deals with all the major players to show pricing and inventory on
the Cnet site. Cnet does not sell anything itself, making Cnet a truly independent source
of information. What’s powerful about Cnet is that it offers its own reviews of each prod-
uct, and reflects users’ opinions as well. Cnet.com should be a stop on your HDTV hunt.

DISH Network
DISH Network — the satellite TV service provider — bundles HDTV
systems with its satellite receivers as part of an all-in-one service
that takes the guesswork out of much of this process. Where DISH
shines is in bundling an HDTV system at a very attractive price,
albeit one that comes with quality limitations and a requirement
to become a DISH subscriber for a monthly fee.
That’s not all bad — the bundle enables you to immediately set up
an entire system and then tap into HDTV content, but it also can
mean (in some areas) setting up a separate antenna system to
receive broadcast channels. The DISH system comes with an HDTV
receiver and a choice of television sets. Be aware, however, that
the company announces a package ahead of its actual availability,
so don’t plan on acting immediately on the latest offering.
This is also less attractive option if you live beyond the reach of
broadcast HD channels; you can’t get those channels over this
system. Before going in this direction, check out the DISH Network
HDTV offerings to make sure they match what you want to watch.
Otherwise the savings on the system won’t be worth the tradeoffs. 
At this writing, other satellite companies offer HDTV receivers
and either appropriate satellite receivers or upgrades to existing
receivers to get HDTV. Voom (www.voom.com) offers professional
installation of its satellite service and either outright purchase or
monthly rental of the HDTV receiver, to be paired with an HDTV-
ready television set. DIRECTV (www.directv.com) has the same.
Circuit City
Circuit City (www.circuitcity.com) combines online ordering
with in-store sales and does a pretty good job on both fronts. Circuit
City online boasts a wide range of products, but availability is deter-
mined by zip code. These products can be compared (up to five
items) in a side-by-side format on the Circuit City site.
One major bonus is that the company offers free delivery and setup,
and for an extra fee, even connects other video devices within your
home to the HDTV system. The vendor also offers immediate advice
on the Web site about which accessories are required for which
systems, making that part of the purchase easier as well. Customer
ratings are provided along with the listings of the HDTV units, but
don’t seem to vary too much from set to set.

More detailed discussion of HDTV is found in its Learning Center on
HDTV, found on the main Televisions page (at Home➪Televisions).
Here you can find an HDTV FAQ, glossary, and a bunch of articles
about HDTV (which you’re less likely to need since you were smart
enough to buy HDTV For Dummies!).
Circuit City also offers in-stores sales of HDTV units, which presents
a perfect opportunity to see in advance what you are buying, if you
are close to a Circuit City store. Circuit City only accepts credit card
payments online and is sometimes coy with its pricing, asking you to
put an item in your shopping cart before divulging the “secret” dis-
count price. On the plus side, you can order online and pick up the
system at the nearest Circuit City store and return it there if need be. 
Best Buy
Like Circuit City, Best Buy (www.bestbuy.com) also combines fea-
tures of a brick-and-mortar store and an online service, capable of
price and feature comparisons. Best Buy’s online interface offers
the option of comparing related systems by features and price.
Whether you can buy the system online is tied to your Zip code —
not all systems are available even in sites close to Best Buy store
locations.
Best Buy has an extensive selection of HDTV systems. The company
offers free shipping, but it’s more narrowly defined than Circuit City’s
similar option. You must confirm an address that falls within the free
shipping area, and the option doesn’t cover all items. If a free ship-
ping option isn’t designated, the only way to know whether you
qualify is to put the item in your shopping cart, enter the appropri-
ate information and see what Best Buy says. You can pick up the
item at a Best Buy store and return it there. Best Buy lists the
required accessories, and often offers a discount on these items
with the HDTV system.
ClubMac
ClubMac (www.clubmac.com) originally opened to sell — guess
what — Apple Mac products. It has expanded its mission to a wide
variety of other electronics. So don’t be fooled by the Mac-dominated
home page. The store meets all the baseline characteristics for online
selling. It also offers the widest possible selection of delivery and
payment options (including C.O.D.), as well as an 800-number for
Chapter 25: Ten Places to Buy an HDTV 247

customer service and online order tracking. The company’s HDTV
selection includes a variety of manufacturers and pricing options,
as well as an extensive set of cables and accessories. ClubMac
charges a 30-percent restocking fee if you return the HDTV set.
Super Warehouse
As an online vendor, Super Warehouse (www.superwarehouse.com)
is rock-solid on site security, customer service, response, site clarity
and ease of use, promptness of order processing and fulfillment, and
on-time delivery. It also has an exceptional variety of HDTV choices,
in many price ranges. The vendor allows for 20-day product review
and doesn’t charge a restocking fee, but won’t pay for return ship-
ping. Payment options include the usual credit cards, purchase
orders, and checks.
Best Digital Online
Best Digital Online meets the table-stakes requirements for an online
retailer, providing a secure site that is reasonably easy to navigate,
clearly stated policies for customers and well-expressed product
descriptions, strong customer service and quick problem resolution
and prompt order delivery. It is one of the merchants that charges
a restocking fee, although 15 percent is as low as those fees go. It
has a wide range of both delivery and payment options, and a wide
assortment of both HDTV systems and required accessories. Best
Digital Online also provides live customer support representatives
to walk you through the purchase process.
Microsoft
With the convergence of the PC and entertainment, Microsoft is
not going to be left out of the action. Microsoft’s online catalog
(www.microsoft.com/windows/catalog/default.aspx) includes
information about vendors of cards that enable a personal computer
to become an HDTV receiver. These receivers connect to the PC via
USB ports or through internal cards that convert a PC to a receiver.
This is cutting-edge stuff and not for the technically skittish. The
PC option isn’t extremely costly at this stage, if you can actually
find the available products. At the writing, for example, the “Where
to Buy” section of the Sasem Web site is under construction.

Sony Electronics
This option is a limited one — the company has large retail stores in
New York and San Francisco, and smaller ones in Chicago, Southern
California and Boston. But Sony has indicated plans to expand its
retail reach into top U.S. markets, and it is specifically focusing on
high-end items such as HDTV units for its retail push. This will prob-
ably not be the cheapest option.

encounter the Tyrannosaurus Rex for the first time, in the unse-
cured open terrain of the park — who can forget the cup of water
vibrating to the footfall of the beast? Scary!
In the movie theater, we all felt that through the incredible bass
management of the speaker systems. And in most of our home audio
systems, the special effects audio channel on the DVD drives some
of that through the subwoofer, too.
But none of that compares to what you can get with audio trans-
ducers from companies such as Clark Synthesis (www.clark
synthesis.com) and The Guitammer Company Inc. (www.the
buttkicker.com). With these transducers, you can get one-giant-
T.-Rex-step closer to the ultimate HDTV theater!

Transducers are marketed under many names — bass shakers, tac-
tile transducers, or as one vendor calls them, buttkickers. The units
are screwed onto the bottom of your furniture or into the frames
of your floorboards. They are better than subwoofer-based effects,
because they can be very localized — only your couch shakes, for
instance, if they are attached to the couch’s underframing. (Your
neighbors will be happy about that!)
If you live in a house that has a lot of concrete, stone, and brick-
work, you may definitely want to look at adding a transducer to your
furniture, because these homebuilding materials do not conduct
the bass very well. Even if you have a great subwoofer, you won’t
get as much low-frequency effect because of the room’s materials.
Spend the extra dollars on a transducer in these instances.
As with most parts of your HDTV system, you can spend a lot or a
little on transducers. One aspect depends on how many you install.
You can one, two or three transducers to a couch, and get an
increasingly better effect. With three across the bottom of your
sofa, you could power the signal for the middle transducer from
the LFE/subwoofer out of the processor-receiver, and drive the two
side ones from the left and right front channels, respectively. This
gives you feedback across the range of the front speakers. If you
are watching Black Hawk Down, when there’s an explosion on the
left, you hear the sound from the right channel as well as feel the
lower frequencies from the transducer. If a tank rumbles across the
screen, it rumbles across the couch as well.
There’s a fairly decent price difference between the lower-budget ver-
sions, around $60 for decent Aura Bass Shakers (www.aurasound.
com), which do a fairly good job, to the higher-end versions — which
have more power and precision — such as the Clark Synthesis or
Guitammer Buttkicker models, which can run from $200 to $500
(www.smarthome.com).
There is considerable difference among the units as to how high a
frequency they support (that is, for how high a frequency they will
react to by vibrating). Some products support frequencies up to
800 Hz. We advise that you keep your frequency range on the lower
end — between 5 Hz and 200 Hz. Otherwise, it seems the transducer
is always rumbling along in the background, and that gets annoying
after a while. You can control the frequency sent to your transducer
via an equalizer, such as the $120 Audio Source EQ.
If you mount transducers directly to your furniture, you can get
rubberized, molded mounts for your chair or couch legs that iso-
late the noise and vibration to your furniture.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
252

Read the manufacturer’s recommendations closely for info on
how to power each unit. We recommend you use one amplifier
per transducer. Lower-end models might not need anything more
than a 20-watt amplifier; higher-end versions might need an ampli-
fier of at least 100 watts. Often, transducers come bundled with an
amplifier (active transducers); consider getting one of these if you
have questions. Look for amps that have their own volume control
so that you can tune the effect relative to the audio level. (Don’t
worry about whether it’s a high-quality amplifier — its use in this
application is not high fidelity.)
Motion Simulators
Now shaking things up with Buttkickers and the like is fun, but the
rides at Disney World have progressed quite beyond mere shaking
your groove thing — you move up, down, left, right, forward, and
backward — all the while it shakes you up.
For the vast majority of us — that is, for those who don’t have mil-
lions to splurge on their own amusement parks with Disney-World-
like rides — such an intense experience has been out of our reach.
Until the D-Box.
Unlike bass shakers, which provide only vibration or “shaking” in
response to the audio track and are in reality merely transducers
that vibrate rather than move air, the Odyssee motion simulator
from D-Box (www.d-box.com) is a sophisticated motion simulation
system that lifts seating and occupants on an X-Y-Z axis (pitch, roll,
and yaw) at up to 2Gs (think F-14 at full throttle) of acceleration.
Odyssee provides dramatic motion that is precisely synchronized
with on-screen action, which draws in viewers even more by allow-
ing them to accurately experience the accelerations, turns, and
jumps that they could previously only imagine. When a car rounds
a corner in a 007 chase scene, turn with it. If the Top Gun jet fighter
suddenly moves into a climb, climb with it.
Here’s how it works: The basic system includes an Odyssee
Controller and a set of Odyssee Actuators. The controller manages
the translation of motion cues from the DVD’s content to the motion
of the actuators. The controller’s microprocessors direct the verti-
cal and horizontal movement of the actuators. Not all movies are
supported by the system; codes must be programmed for each
specific movie. More than 200 movies are supported now (see the
list at www.d-box.com/en/codes/index.html), with more coming
each month.
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) HDTV Accessories 253

Just about everyone who’s tried this system loves it, but the price
tag will set you back. An entry-level system runs $15,000, with the
manufacturers shooting to drop the cost of the system even more
over the next few years.
Power Conditioner
Most people don’t know it, but the electrical power in your home
fluctuates all over the place. Every time your refrigerator or air con-
ditioner turns on, there’s a surge in the power line to compensate.
As devices turn on and off in the house (and in the neighborhood),
power levels likewise ebb and flow with the current.
The bottom line is that this affects your HDTV gear. As we mention
in Chapter 3, you absolutely must protect your HDTV system with
some form of surge protection. But surge protection only protects
you from major changes in your electrical lines — you still could
have issues with the consistency of the current level going to your
expensive gear. For example, if your voltage drops, it may actually
lower your amplifier’s output. Ground issues can cause hums in
your audio and lines on your video display.
Consider buying a power conditioner, which improves and stabilizes
the AC power for your HDTV system. Power conditioners use vari-
ous techniques to restore your AC power to a true 60 Hz, 120-volt
signal, which can offer better audio and video performance.
Many of the major wiring vendors offer power conditioners. One of
the better-known vendors is Monster Cable, which sells some really
cool (and cool-looking) Home Theater Power Centers (www.monster
cable.com/power). These products provide surge protection,
voltage stabilization, and noise filtering. The more expensive ones
even have a neat digital voltmeter readout on the front. (We insist
on cool readouts on all our gear!) Expect to typically spend from
$100 to $500, to potentially upwards of $1,000, for a power condi-
tioner. Protect your system — get one.
DVD Changer Controllers
If you are anywhere near the movie aficionados that we are, you’ve
got hundreds of videotapes and discs littering your home. What
used to be a contest for bragging rights with the neighbor over
who bought the most discs at Wal-Mart, has grown into a mess.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
254

The DVD changers we discuss in Chapter 11 are great for smaller
collections, but what do you do with the larger collections that you
want to be able to access centrally from anywhere in your home?
From the same company that makes the best audio server in the
industry comes a video option based on the same technologies.
ReQuest Multimedia’s VideoReQuest (www.request.com) enables
you to control up to four Sony DVP-CX777ES 400 disc DVD changers
through a simple on-HDTV-screen interface. Imagine being able to
instantly select from any of 1,600 DVD discs in a collection with a
simple, intuitive, on-screen user interface.
You can Access DVD movies by title, genre, MPAA rating, actor, and
director. The VideoReQuest provides for automatic discovery of
DVD information using Internet lookup, too — so no more pecking
at a keyboard entering videodisc titles (what a pain!). Just load the
DVD into the system, and the VideoReQuest takes it from there.
What’s more, as with the AudioReQuest, you can integrate your
VideoReQuest into your home control network so you can start
movies from touchscreens located throughout the home. If you have
a home integration system (like Crestron or Elan), VideoReQuest
can connect via RS-232 or Ethernet interfaces. The system outputs
to any VGA, Component, S-Video, and Composite Video ports.
Simple. Functional. Clean. A perfect solution to a growing problem.
The VideoReQuest retails for about $2,500. (But we also highly rec-
ommend having an AudioReQuest in your audio system as well to
store all your CDs. Check those out at www.request.com.)
Show HDTV Outdoors
There’s nothing like an outdoor HDTV movie. Starry skies, fresh
popcorn, a 10-foot-by-20-foot screen, and lots of friends and blan-
kets. It’s easy to do, using common items found at Home Depot
and your nearest party tent vendor.
In our experience, the issues with HDTV outdoors are less about
having a pristine audio and video experience, as they are about
being able to show a huge screen with audio everyone can hear —
and picking a good movie. The sheer fun far outweighs any issues
that are much more noticeable in an enclosed room built specifi-
cally to be a theater.
Your outdoor experience requires these basics:
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) HDTV Accessories 255

 A video projector that you can take out to the backyard:
Because of the greater amount of ambient light, look for pro-
jectors with at least 1,200 lumens, preferably as much as 2,000
lumens. Aside from that specification, we’ve had great luck with
the Toshiba TLP-S70 that sells on the street for around $1,200.
 A video source: You can use either a portable DVD player or a
wireless link back to your HDTV system.
 Speakers: You can just run long speaker cables from your
source, or pick up some wireless speakers to go the distance.
We’ve used some off-the-shelf 5.8GHz speakers from Radio
Shack that work just fine — it changes models occasionally but
usually it has a pair that costs around $200. Soon, you’ll be able
to get 802.11-standard gear in most major computer stores.
 Screen: You can make an outdoor video screen with the same
stuff that party companies use. You can make a screen for $300
to $500 (everything but the pipe on the following list totals for
about $100):
• About 30 10-foot pieces of 1-inch EMT pipe from a home
store
This pipe usually totals at $200 to $400.
• A 10-foot-by-20-foot party-tent tarp
• Party-tent junction points for the corners
• A bunch of ball bungee cords to mount the tarp
If you’re showing video outdoors in the summer, cover your gear
with a blanket before the show — the evening dew can damage
your electronics.
If you have a lot of outdoor shows, consider buying a projector
that’s optimized to go outdoors. You can get pretty good projectors
for less than $1,500. When it isn’t in the backyard, you can project
it against a screen in your living room or your office. You can check
out the latest models ideal for the outdoor experience — as well
as ideas for how to do this — at our outdoor home-theater site at
www.digitaldummies.com/projects/outdoor.asp.
Creature Double Feature in 3D
Most of us have rather private experiences with 3D, dating back to
drive-in movies when we were kids, or relating to some of the stun-
ning latter-day movies from IMAX. Some people have been on the
T2: 3D “ride” at the Universal Studios theme park, or the Honey 
I Shrunk the Kids exhibit at EPCOT in Disney World.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
256

Regardless of your experience, it’s hardly been a common part of
your entertainment regimen.
For years, the most common 3D technique used has been the
anaglyph, a means of creating a single image from two color-coded
images that are superimposed on one another, giving you the sen-
sation of depth perception. The red/blue cheap cardboard glasses
are the anaglyph experience that many of us equate to 3D.
However a smart Canadian firm called Sensio (www.sensio.tv) has
taken a different path and created the industry’s only high-quality
3-D system. Sensio uses a method wherein glasses with electronic
LCD shutters alternate left and right, allowing each eye to view the
screen every other sixtieth of a second. Each eye only sees its cor-
responding image (left eye only sees the left angle images) on the
screen. The Sensio S3D-100 system is a base unit that is another
component in your system. The base unit is connected between
your DVD player and your display device. You put in your special
Sensio-encoded DVD in your DVD player. The S3D-100 reads the
signal coming from the DVD player and transmits alternative (left
and right) progressive image to the screen and also sends a signal
over an IR emitter to the wireless IR-driven glasses. The IR has a
range of 20 to 30 feet in a room.
You can’t use the Sensio box with just any TV, DVD player, or DVD.
You need a special DVD that carries the Sensio encoding (there are
almost two dozen such movies now). You also need something that
can take in a VGA connector — the S3D-100’s output is analog RGB
via a VGA connector, which is common on most video projectors.
Most HDTV sets have component video on board — you can handle
these with a VGA-to-component converter such as one from Key
Digital (the $150 KD-VTCA3).
You also need a DVD player with component video outputs. The
Sensio processor requires an NTSC signal, which means you must
set a progressive-scan DVD player’s output to interlace mode. (If you
need to know more about progressive and interlace mode, check
out Chapter 21).
You won’t be able to use the Sensio with a plasma TV because the
plasma screens emit a great deal of infrared, which interferes with
the glasses’ interpretation of the sync signal from the emitter.
Currently, Sensio is trying to expand its cadre of 3D movies. The
250+ 3D movies have been made since about 1915 were displayed
using the anaglyph process, meaning that to watch those, you need
a special set of anaglyph glasses to watch them; they are useless on
a Sensio system. Sensio is presently talking to the major Hollywood
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) HDTV Accessories 257

Studio to convert those movies in the Sensio 3D format. The popu-
larity of some more recent movies — Ghost of The Abyss (Titanic),
Shrek 4D, Spy Kids 3D, and other 3D movies — gives 3D fans like us
hope for the future. At $3000 per box, we think the Sensio system is
a must-have HDTV accompaniment.
Since the glasses shutter on and off rapidly, Sensio warns that folks
who are prone to seizures should avoid wearing the glasses.
Wireless Headphones
There’s nothing like a great action-packed movie such as The Italian
Job screaming over the HDTV. That is, until your spouse leans over
and asks you to turn it down in no uncertain terms! Wireless head-
phones not only help you hear your HDTV as loud as you want it,
but they also save marriages, too!
Wireless headphones also give you mobility — you can get up and
let the dog out, and not miss any action.
These aren’t hard to install or use. Wireless headsets use radio to
connect to a base station that’s connected to your audio receiver.
There’s a huge variance in headphones on the market. Some that
your whole ear and others fit in your ear. Some headphones deal
with ambient noise and use DSPs to process Dolby Digital 5.1.
Look for Dolby Headphones support in your HDTV system gear.
Dolby has done wonders with this technology application. See, no
matter how many channels or speakers you have in your HDTV
setup, you still have just two ears through which all the audio is
processed. Dolby Headphone (www.dolby.com/dolbyheadphone/)
tries to reproduce what is arriving at your ears by using digital
signal processors to simulate Dolby Digital 5.1 over the two head-
phone channels. Dolby Headphone offers three listening modes,
each based on acoustic measurements of real rooms. DH1, or Studio,
is a small, well-damped room appropriate for both movies and
music-only recordings. DH2 (Cinema) is a more acoustically “live”
room, especially suited for music but also great for movies. DH3
(Hall) is a larger room, more like a concert hall or movie theater.
All products equipped with Dolby Headphone include DH2. On
those offering two or all three environments, you can easily switch
between modes to suit the material and your own preferences. So,
if you plan on using headphones a lot, see if your receiver supports
Dolby Headphone encoding. We highly recommend it.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
258

What headphones do we use? A lot of the wireless headphones
geared for the television are outright lousy. The only decent wire-
less headphones we’ve run into are made by Sennheiser (www.
sennheiserusa.com), specifically the RS65 ($190) and the RS85
($250). The RS85 sports a high-performance noise-reduction circuit
that gives it better performance at the edge of its operating range.
Though pricey, both models work great, and their signals really
travel far in a home. What’s more, you can get an extra headphone
for each of the models, so Mom and Dad can both watch loud
movies while the kids sleep (Kill that, Bill!).
Check out a great online resource/store — HeadRoom, at www.
headphone.com — for the latest and greatest in headphones,
including some good reviews and information. That’s where we
shop for ’phones (no one paid us to say that either!).
In Search of That Great 
Remote Control
There are soooo many remote controls on the market, it’s daunting
just to talk about a few. Remote controls have evolved a lot since
the earliest universal remote controls hit the market, allowing you
to control multiple devices from one remote control.
A quick scan of HDTV Web sites today shows all sorts of remote-
control options: tiny, large, color, touch-sensitive, voice-controlled,
time-controlled, and on and on. You can spend $12 on a great
remote, or $4,000. You can keep it confined to your HDTV theater
or go whole-home.
Types of remotes
Typically, remotes fall into the following categories, presented here
in increasing order of functionality and desirability:
 Standard/dedicated remotes: These are the device-specific
remotes that come with each device.
 Brand-based remotes that come with a component: Brand-
based remotes are those that work with all sorts of devices
from the same manufacturer.
 Third-party universal remote controls: Universal remote con-
trols are designed to work with any electronics device by way
of on-board code databases.
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) HDTV Accessories 259

 Learning remotes: Learning remotes can learn codes from your
existing remote controls. You simply point your remotes at
each other, go through a listing of commands, and the remote
codes are transferred from one to the other.
 Programmable remotes: Programmable remotes allow you to
create macros, sequential code combinations that do a lot of
things at once.
 Computer-based remotes: Computer-based remotes take
advantage of the growing number of computing devices around
the home to provide remote-control capabilities. This category
includes PDAs, Web tablets, portable touchscreens, and PCs.
 Proprietary systems: A number of closed-system control
devices enable you to integrate control of all your home-theater
devices on a single control system. Companies such as Niles
Audio (www.nilesaudio.com) and Crestron (www.crestron.
com) are renowned for their control systems.
Remote controls can use infrared (IR) or radio frequency (RF) to
communicate with their base device(s). Some remote-control sys-
tems use either tabletop or wall-mounted touchscreen displays.
Two new classes of remotes include two-way operation and voice
control. With two-way operation, higher-end remotes can interact
with the controlled unit to determine its state, so you can determine
whether a unit is on, or if the input is already set to Video1, before
changing that state. And with two-way operation, you can check
your actions to make sure they were carried out, too.
Voice control enables you to talk to your remote control to effect
changes in your HDTV environment. Want the lights dimmed and
curtains opened? Why not just say, “Start the show,” and a preset
sequence of activities begins.
More and more remotes have a docking cradle where your remote
can get charged up, or access the Internet for revised programming
schedules or to update its internal code databases.
Sexy remotes
The more you spend on your entertainment system, the more
you’ll probably spend on your remote controls.
These are some of the best remotes on the market:
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
260

 Pronto (Philips; $199 to $1,400; www.pronto.philips.com)
Philips has a solid line of remote controls that have defined
the leading edge of home-theater remotes in a lot of ways.
The $1,400 fully programmable and learning Pronto Pro TSi6400
wireless home control panel combines the best of two infotain-
ment worlds: home-theater system control and 802.11b wire-
less broadband Internet access. Turn on your HDTV system,
check out the programming guide, and then browse the Web.
With an optional IR/radio frequency capability, the unit allows
you to control infrared devices in cabinets or in other rooms
with the simple addition of a Philips RF receiver.
 Harmony (Logitech; $199 to $299; www.logitech.com/
harmony)
Harmony has been leading the pack toward intelligent, learning,
and programmable remotes. Its $299 Harmony SST-768 Remote
Control helps you control different actions, such as listening to
a baseball game or watching a video. Harmony’s remote has a
LCD screen and links to your PC via a USB connection to pro-
gram the remote to tie together multiple actions at once, in
order. So you can turn on the TV, the receiver, and the amplifier,
and set them all to the correct settings, with one click. Very
nice. Harmony was bought by Logitech in 2004, and we LOVE
Logitech’s gear.
 weemote (Fobis; $24.95; www.weemote.com)
This is a remote designed just for kids ages 3 to 8, so you can
limit the channels they watch and make them responsible for
their own remotes (in other words, keep their paws off yours).
 Your PDA as a remote control: A couple of solutions are out
there. Philips has a ProntoLITE ($19.95) for turning Palm-based
PDAs into a universal remote control. There are several low-
cost Palm OS and Pocket PC OS programs from small shareware
developers, too — check out ZDNet’s Mobile Downloads area
for the latest products (downloads-zdnet.com.com).
 Touchscreens galore around the house: Crestron (www.
crestron.com) rules the upper end of touchscreen options.
Crestron’s color touchpad systems are to die for, or at least
second mortgage for. Other options include HAI’s OmniTouch
(www.homeauto.com).
Remote control technology advanced quickly. For remote-control
options, visit Remote Central (www.remotecentral.com). It has
great reviews and tracks the newest remotes.
Chapter 26: Ten (or so) HDTV Accessories 261

Bring Hollywood Home
If you really want to show off your HDTV, you can build out your
HDTV setup with all the accoutrements of a true theater:
 Popcorn machines: Complete with the swing-down popping
bucket, these $500-to-$900 machines give you freshly popped
popcorn and that movie-theater smell. Check out www.popcorn
popper.com for some cool models.
 Candy stands: You can get fully lit concession stands for your
home theater, just like the ones found in real theaters. You can
also get concession signs and candy bins. Check out places
such as www.candyfavorites.com.
 Personalized DVD intro: Open up each showing with your
own customized one-minute video, just like those in the the-
aters (your DVD player must be able to play DVD-R). For $200
or so from www.htmarket.com, you can personalize one of six
home-theater intros, from an awards-night theme to a classic
popcorn theme. How fun is that?
 Furniture: From full-sized ticket booths to Roaring ’20s-style
bar furniture, you can recreate almost any environment in your
HDTV theater. The sky’s the limit on pricing for these items. A
ticket booth costs $2,000.
 Theater-style roping: You can get that velour-rope-and-
stainless-steel-post look if you want — expect to spend
around $300 a post and $100 a rope. Think about being able
to make your mother-in-law wait in line to see the movie at
your new house!
 Themed carpet: You can buy carpeting that’s festooned with
images of cinema stars, film reels, popcorn, and other themes.
You can expect to pay up to $50 per square yard or more (as
with any carpeting, this can vary greatly).
 Themed theater lighting: Cool wall sconces, tabletop lights,
and standing lights add the theater look. Budget about $200
for each of these.
 Film posters: Complement your HDTV room with the latest
movie posters. These are usually a standard 27-by-40-inch
size, and cost about $10 to $20 for current films. Go online at
www.allposters.com for current films, or get vintage posters
at places such as www.moviemarket.com.
You can find these items and more at places such as www.home
theaterdecor.com and www.htmarket.com.
