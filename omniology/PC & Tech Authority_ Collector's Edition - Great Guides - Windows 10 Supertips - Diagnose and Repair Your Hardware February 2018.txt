T 
inkering. Sometimes you have to, 
sometimes you just want to. I think 
it’s fair to say that pretty much all 
PC & Tech Authority readers enjoy 
delving into the almost limitless capabilities 
of their PCs. It’s just who we are.
In part, we do it to personalise a 
machine to suit our needs, whether it’s a 
simple theme change, or a registry edit to 
automates tasks that we each may do more 
of than other people. 
Or, we may need to fi x 
something that just isn’t 
working the way it should. 
While this is thankfully 
rare these days within the 
highly evolved PC ecosystem, things can 
always be improved, and it’s the versatility 
and fl exibility of the PC that makes this 
possible.
Some tweaks we put off, but shouldn’t. 
Are your backups as secure as they could 
be? Are you even backing up in the fi rst 
place? Many don’t, I know. Probably in part 
due the fuss and complexity involved – but 
it needn’t be this way. Do you put all your 
faith in Windows Defender for security? 
Or even one of the better paid security 
products? In general that’s fi ne, but there’s 
always more that can be done – and that 
includes how you behave online. 
There is always a better way, and staying 
on top of all that can be challenging and 
immensely time consuming, which is why 
we’re here with this how-to special.
For many of us, myself included, we 
tweak because it’s fun and satisfying. It’s 
our hobby! The appeal of the PC is that 
it’s a base-level platform that offers almost 
limitless opportunities for tuning to a 
particular task. We can have a PC that does 
many things well, and for those of us who 
have very specifi c needs, we can create a 
machine that excels at a narrower range of 
duties. 
No job is too small or large for the PC, and 
equally, there’s nothing a PC does that can’t 
be improved. 
Which is what this special issue of PC & 
Tech Authority is all about. Now, we don’t 
do specials very often, and this is the fi rst 
in many years. But, I think, well overdue. I 
want you to hang on to this issue. Keep it 
because one day you will need the expertise 
within on a particular topic. I also want 
you to go hard proactively and thoroughly 
go through what is contained within with 
a view to auditing your PC settings. Don’t 
make it hard work, just a quick scan of 
the pages is hopefully 
enough for a few things 
to jump out at you and 
maybe help you decide 
that now is the time to 
tackle the maintenance or 
enhancements you might have been putting 
off.
I want you to benefi t from, and leverage, 
the expertise you have at your disposal here. 
The PC & TA editorial team is the best in 
the business and I’m not just talking about 
the depths of their knowledge, but also their 
talent in communicating often complex 
topics clearly and in a way that encourages 
you to get in amongst it. We’ve reached 
out and brought in some specialists, too, 
to help compile this guide. It’s a powerful 
tool oozing with potential – just like the PC 
itself.

TABLET TIME
INBOX
In the December issue our Labs was all about tablets. In 
the intro I wondered if the honeymoon was indeed over for 
tablets, and asked you what use they have in the real world. 
Amusingly, I did not foresee the irony at play here, that 
these letters would sit on a page at the bottom which we are 
spruiking our tablet editions... Here are some of your replies, 
thanks to all for writing in!
BEN
PHONES, PHABLETS AND TABLETS
Personally, I am fruitlessly searching for an Android 
tablet that has a screen size of about 13in so I can 
properly surf the net and read magazines on it. I 
also want to be able to write on the screen to take 
notes, preferably with the option of converting my 
handwriting to text.
I initially didn’t think it would be that hard, but 
unless I spend a grand and go Apple there is nothing 
out there (that I can fi nd anyway) that is over 10in in 
screen size. The fact people are paying a fortune for a 
6in (or close to) phone and then more money for a 8-9in 
tablet makes no sense at all!
So, if you know of an Android tablet that is decent 
quality and 13in in size please let me know! The closest 
I’ve found is a no-name branded tablet from Kogan 
with low specs, and even at just $350 I’m not keen on 
taking a risk with it.
I think phones selling for over $1,000 is absolutely 
mad. Why wouldn’t you buy a tablet instead for the 
same money? I really enjoyed your article!
CRAIG
IT’S ABOUT THE VERSATILITY
A tablet, be it ever so ‘umble, can be very useful.
I received my Samsung SM-T330 as a freebie with 
a newspaper subscription, and it is perfect for the 
task. Regularly updated content, formatted into three 
readable columns; it is light, fi ts my hand and only 
needs charging once a week.
If you prefer to enjoy PC & Tech Authority via your iPad or Android 
tablet, you can! Each issue is just $6.49 for iPad and $4.99 for 
Android, and has all the content that you’ll find in the magazine.

The tablet sits in the remotes rack 
next to my favourite TV-watching 
chair. If I need the reading light 
on or off, a tap on the Wemo app 
does the job. Watching TV, I can 
background programs with Google 
searches, Maps or Earth. When 
an advertisement comes on, I can 
resume my game of Freecell.
I found Netfl ix keeps all your 
past and half-watched programs 
open, and it is easy to kill them 
through my Netfl ix account with 
the Tablet.  Netfl ix on the TV cleans 
up soon after.
If my watch buzzes to advise of 
a new email and I want to read it, I 
open Gmail on the tablet.
As I’m writing this, I’m listening 
to the tablet streaming Spotify 
via Bluetooth through my Google 
Home Assistant which has a better 
speaker. Now it has just beeped to 
remind me it is exercise time!
I appreciated the comment in 
the article that they can be a laptop 
replacement. Defi nitely a hat in the 
ring when my aged Acer dies.

NEWS & ENTERTAINMENT
I’m 67, my wife 75. We have two 
iPad airs and an iPad 3. The 3 sits 
by my lounge in front of the TV, 
my wife’s Air on the microwave 
and my air by my bed. I read 
newspapers on them every day, use 
them every day for email, YouTube, 
Zinio, Kindle and eBay. I take the 
air that has a SIM card on holidays 
and download movies and TV 
series for the same reason as you 
(fear of a broken entertainment 
system) as well as experience of a 
poor vid selection on some fl ights.
I’m an Android convert but love 
the IOS sealed eco system, the 
range of apps and the ease with 
which I can read newspapers and 
magazines.

A FAD THAT’S PASSED
Interesting title to your article 
for “ïn the Labs”. I have a tablet 
and my wife has a Sony Xperia.  
Neither are used. Yes they went 
through a phase of use at the 
beginning but just didn’t work for 
us long term. I have a Dell XPS13 
which has the power I need plus 
the same apps as my desktop and 
she uses a Dell XPS15 now as her 
desktop and portable machine. In 
my case, I touch type and fi nd a 
tablet irritating as I cannot touch 
type on it with my big hands. My 
wife’s issue is more about using 
a different operating system and 
apps than those she is familiar 
with. Bottom line. For us it was a 
great fad but just not practical. My 
phone will do if I need to access the 
net urgently somewhere. A tablet 
sits somewhere in the middle and 
has just been squeezed out. I won’t 
be getting another tablet.

O 
ptus will compensate 
more than 8700 of its 
customers who were 
misled about maximum 
speeds on certain NBN plans. The 
telco advertised a range of speed 
plans on its NBN services between 
1 September 2015 and 30 June 2017, 
including a “Boost Max” offering 
which advertised maximum 
download speeds of up to 100 
megabits per second (Mbps) and 
maximum upload speeds of up to 
40 Mbps (100/40 Mbps).
However, due to technical 
limitations of the NBN’s fi bre to 
the node (FTTN) or fi bre to the 
building (FTTB) connections 
meant that the speeds advertised 
were not achievable. “Optus 
is the second major internet 
provider we have taken action 
against for selling broadband 
speeds they could not deliver 
to their customers,”  Australian 
Competition and Consumer 
Commission chairman Rod Sims 
said. “Worryingly, many affected 
Optus FTTN customers could 
not even receive the maximum 
speed of a lower-tier plan. This is 
a concerning trend we have seen 
throughout the industry and we 
are working to fi x this.”
The issue affected three of 
Optus’ tiered speed plans, which 
includes customers on the 50/20 
Mbps and 25/5 Mbps plans. The 
ACCC said 5430 Optus FTTN 
consumers on a 100/40 Mbps plan 
could not receive 100/40 Mbps, and 
2337 of those consumers could not 
receive 50/20 Mbps. Meanwhile, 
1519 consumers on a 50/20 Mbps 
plan could not receive 50/20 Mbps, 
while 1381 consumers on a 25/5 
Mbps plan could not receive 25/5 
Mbps. “Affected customers should 
carefully consider the remedies 
Optus is offering them to assess 
which best suits their needs,” Sims 
said. “In some cases, consumers 
may consider it preferable to 
simply exit their contract with a 
refund rather than accept a service 
that does not meet their needs.”
The ACCC said Optus admitted 
that by promoting and offering 
speed plans that could not be 
delivered, it likely contravened 
the Australian Consumer Law 
(ACL) by engaging in misleading 
or deceptive conduct and 
making false or misleading 
representations.
The regulator added that Optus 
provided a court-enforceable 
undertaking to the ACCC detailing 
the remedies it will provide to 
affected customers, including 
refunds, moving speed plans, 
discounted speed plans, and exit 
from contracts without a fee.
Optus will contact affected 
consumers on or before 2 March 
2018 by email or letter. The 
court-enforceable undertaking 
also requires Optus to check 
within four weeks of connecting 
a customer to a new NBN speed 
plan that they are getting the 
advertised speeds they are paying 
for. If it is below the advertised 
speed, Optus will notify the 
customer and offer remedies.  
In November, Telstra agreed to 
compensate 42,000 NBN customers 
also for advertising misleading 
maximum speeds.

1 GOOGLE DOCS GLITCH LOCKS 
USERS OUT OF PROJECTS 
Google was forced to apologise for a glitch that highlighted 
the dangers of relying on its Docs service, when it 
temporarily locked out users from their critical ﬁ les.
Users received a warning saying their documents were 
blocked due to “abusive content” after Google’s document 
scanning technology went rogue and declared the most 
benign projects as breaching the company’s terms.

PREMIUM SERVICES
Microsoft is once again shaking up 
its consumer email services, with the 
closure of its Outlook.com Premium 
service. New customers are instead being directed to the 
company’s Offi  ce 365 subscriptions. 
The free Outlook.com service – with ads – is set to 
continue, and current subscribers that have paid up will 
still be able to access the service, while subscribers to 365 
will automatically receive the beneﬁ ts of the old paid-for

3 QUALCOMM PLAYING HARD TO GET 
IN BROADCOM ROM-COM
Chipmakers Broadcom and Qualcomm 
were looked in a battle of wills over 
Broadcom’s $130 billion takeover bid 
over for its rival, which could end up being 
the biggest tech industry deal in history. 
Broadcom is conﬁ dent that its bid will eventually be 
accepted, although it might need to increase its off er and 
supplant several Qualcomm board members with its own 
people to push through the deal.
4 APPLE ISSUES FIX FOR 
AUTOCORRECT BUG
Apple was forced to issue an 
embarrassing ﬁ x after users reported that 
multiple devices in its range had started 
autocorrecting the letter “i” to either “A” 
or other random symbols, leaving users of 
their expensive handsets looking illiterate. 
Apple blamed the glitch on a problem 
within the auto-correct feature in the 11.1 version of 
iOS, which appeared to aff ect random users.
5 FIREFOX AIMS TO RECAPTURE RELEVANCE
The Firefox browser is hoping to recapture its lost followers 
with the release of Firefox Quantum, a complete overhaul 
that involved editing 5 million lines of code.
According to Mozilla, the 57th version of the browser is 
its fastest yet and has less of an impact on memory than its 
main rivals when multiple tabs are open. It  also represents 
a less corporate alternative to Google and Apple.

ou know, I think I will always be 
thankful for putting my money 
behind Star Citizen. There 
are three equally entertaining 
outcomes to the investment: the single-
player Squadron 42 and its much more 
ambitious counterpart will either one day 
release, and be an absolute revelation of PC 
gaming supremacy; it will be at best the most 
mediocre, and therefore, terrible, game ever 
made; or it will never, ever see the light of 
day as a complete product.
Either way, I will be able to tell my 
forebears that I was there. That fans would 
tell me to quit my job or even send death 
threats just for having the temerity to 
mention the game in anything less than 
hushed and reverent tones.
What an exciting time to be alive indeed.
The excitement’s also ramped up recently, 
with news breaking this morning that Crytek 
- makers of the CryEngine 3D platform, is 
fi ling a lawsuit against both Cloud Imperium 
Games and Roberts Space 
Industries. The lawsuit claims that 
both companies are continuing 
to us the CryEngine in a manner 
which breaches the original contract 
in a number of ways. The full text of 
the suit  is long, but the tl;dr version 
is that CIG and RSI are using the 
engine with proper attribution, and 
that the engine is being used across 
two distinct games.
The counterargument, from is 
that neither game has used the 
CryEngine for a while. The game 
- or games - now utilise Amazon’s 
Lumberyard platform. 
Crytek is seeking damages both 
direct and indirect, as well as an

injunction preventing Star Citizen from 
continuing to use CryEngine. 
Where will it end? Who the hell knows 
- we’re game writers not lawyers. RSI is 
certainly taking it seriously, having removed 
all associated discussion threads from the 
Star Citizen forums throughout the day.
But wherever it does end up, it is sure to be 
another gripping instalment in the metagame 
of watching Star Citizen’s sprawling 
development.
FAR CRY 5 PUSHED 
BACK TO MARCH 
2018 RELEASE 
AND THE CREW 2 ALSO PUSHES BACK 
INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018
I’m not looking forward to The Crew 2 quite 
as much as I am Far Cry 2, but Ubisoft’s just 
announced a release delay for both games. 
Far Cry 5 has been pushed back to a March 27 
release, while The Crew 2 has a more vague 
outlook of the ﬁ rst half of 2018. Here’s what Ubi 
had to say about the decision:
“For Far Cry 5, the extra time will allow 
the team at Ubisoft Montreal to make some 
additional improvements that will bring the 
best, most ambitious Far Cry experience in line 
with the team’s original vision. We’re excited 
for fans to join the Resistance in Hope County, 
Montana against the Project at Eden’s Gate cult. 
Tune in to the Ubiblog to get the newest look at 
Far Cry 5. Meanwhile, The Crew 2 development

experience that meets the team’s and our

IS THERE SUCH A THING AS TOO MANY TITANS? INTEL CONSPIRACY? SILENT PRODUCT  
CRIPPLING? MARK WILLIAMS COVERS A PUZZLING MONTH OF CHIP NEWS
RYZEN TO KEEP RISING IN 2018
Ryzen 2, the sequel, is coming! Due around 
March, AMD’s roadmap is confirming a 
node shrink to 12nm for its next generation 
processor line-up. This should help 
immensely with power consumption and 
of course the all-important clock speeds 
and overclockability that AMD is slightly 
hampered by with Ryzen. It’s important to 
note that this won’t be the Zen 2 architecture 
update, just a refresh called Zen+.
This should better unleash Zen’s true 
potential now that AMD has had time 
to tweak their new architecture and 
manufacturing processes.
8TH-GEN CONSPIRACY
When Intel released its 8th generation Core 
processors that utilized the same 1151 socket 
as the 7th generation, they clearly 
said 8th gen Coffee Lake based 
CPUs would require a new (Z370 
based) chipset to work and weren’t 
backwards compatible with Z270 
motherboards due to differing 
pinouts, primarily to do with power 
delivery.
Despite having largely, the 
same architecture and using the 
same socket, we all groaned and 
eventually moved on.
However, someone decided 
otherwise and began tinkering. 
A Chinese enthusiast using 
MSI’s Z170A Xpower Titanium 
motherboard (that’s right, from two 
generations ago!) after hacking away 
at the BIOS and microcode managed 
to boot an i3-8350K into Windows.
Admittedly there are some major 
issues, like the IGP not functioning 
and the PCI Express lanes form 
the CPU not being available, but 
otherwise, it’s proof of concept. 
Asus representatives later 
confirmed that Z170 motherboards 
can theoretically support Coffee 
Lake processors, but that they were 
directed by Intel to not pursue it for 
BIOS updates.
With reports that 6th and 7th 
generation CPU’s have been made 
to work in Z370 motherboards, one 
must conclude that Intel has been 
twisting the truth on the matter all 
along just to wring more sales out of 
consumers.

YET ANOTHER TITAN
Nvidia has gone Titan crazy of late. After 
the original Titan for the Pascal architecture 
launched, known simply as Titan X, after 
the GTX 1080 Ti (which matches the Titan X 
performance) Nvidia launched an improved 
version with all the GP102 shader cores 
unlocked and dubbed it Titan Xp.
Recently Nvidia released a limited run of 
two Star Wars Rebellion and Empire themed 
Titan Xp cards, with glowing light sabre like 
lighting to match the cards theme.
Now Nvidia is launching it’s fifth Titan 
in seventeen months, called Titan V. Except 
this one is different. The V stands for Volta, 
Nvidia’s new GPU architecture. This card is 
basically a cheaper version of the enterprise 
grade Tesla V100 accelerator. The only 
difference appears to be that the Titan V 
drops its HBM2 capacity by 4GB for 12GB 
total on a 3072-bit bus. This still leaves it 
with a consumer market leading memory 
bandwidth rating of over 650GB/s.
Then there’s the GPU itself. With the 
same fully unlocked V100 chip as 
the Tesla it has 5120 CUDA cores 
(compared to 3840 on the previous 
Titan Xp) giving it 33% more off 
the bat. Then there’s the fact it has 
dedicated FP64 cores and “Tensor” 
cores for AI deep learning, this chip 
is a compute beast.
At US$3,000 a pop, this is not 
meant for gamers. Although 
early benchmarks have shown 
between 10% and 30% speedups in 
benchmarks, for a GPU that’s not 
driver optimised for gaming yet, 
and with a core running 100MHz to 
200MHz slower than the Titan Xp, 
the Titan V is giving us a glimpse 
into the future of Nvidia’s next 
generation. Take the Tensor cores 
out, remove FP64 support, throw 
in a few more shaders and switch 
HBM2 for GDDR6 and you’ve got 
the potential recipe for what will 
could be called the GTX 1180 Ti.
RX 560 WARNING
Thinking of buying an AMD RX 
560? Beware that AMD has silently 
started selling RX 560 units with 
less stream processors than at 
launch. The regular RX 560 has 16 
CUs (compute units) providing 1024 
stream processors, the cut down 
version only offers 14 CUs for 896 
processors, effectively making it 
an RX 460, or RX 560D if you live 
in China. After consumer uproar, 
AMD has acknowledged the issue 
and has said it is working with 
partners to make sure product 
advertising and descriptions clearly 
state the CU count of each product.

RADIUS MOZZIE REPELLER
There is a reasonable amount of evidence 
to suggest that mosquitoes are responsible 
for half of all human deaths since the Stone 
Age. Half. You might blame Malaria, but we 
know the real criminals. So we must bend the 
latest in Lithium-Ion portability to the task of 
destroying all mozzies. Or at least repelling 
them.
MOST WANTED: This compact unit uses a 
chrysanthemum-derived “super pyrethroid” 
which it heats gently and sprays out in a 
discreet jet every few minutes. It’s not as, um, 
fragrant as a traditional coil and supposedly 
lasts longer than a citronella candle.
NOT WANTED: The Radius might be 
effective at a radius (oh, now we get it) of 1.5 
metres, but it doesn’t actually murder the little 
buzzers. We’d love to see this combined with a 
bug zapper or maybe Taser.

EMERGENCE AS8 SPEAKERS
Active stereo speaker systems usually adhere to fairly 
traditional design parameter. Two satellite speakers 
and a sub-woofer. Here’s something a bit different. The 
point of those weird satellites? A more “realistic” sound 
through something called, we kid you not, Acoustic 3D.
MOST WANTED: The... thing on top of each speaker is 
a specially designed reflector that supposedly channels 
all acoustic energy directly at the listener instead of 
just dispersing it everywhere. The result is noticeable: 
clearer sound, more detail. 
NOT WANTED: You may get tired of people asking you 
what the hell these things are and why you have them 
in your home. Also, at their $999 price-point, this design 
is more “as good as” similar active system, rather than 
superior. And the Bluetooth dongle is an external box 
which is... odd

MOST WANTED TECHDESK
HMAS VAMPIRE (I) 
A game like World of Warships - where players duke it out in 
multi-thousand-tonne destroyers and cruisers and battleships in 
real time - shouldn’t really work. But it does. Like all games these 
days, it’s possible to buy individual ships to customise your fl eet, 
and Australia’s venerable Vampire from 1917 is one of the newest 
additions.
MOST WANTED: Look, Australia rarely gets a mention in 
massively multipler wargames, and the RAN even less so, so this 
is a source of Aussie pride if nothing else. Developer Wargaming 
says Vampire is a “Tier 3 destroyer” in the game, which means less 
fi repower but more “nimble” handling.
NOT WANTED: Of course, this isn’t the Vampire that most Aussies 
know from Darling Harbour in Sydney. That’s Vampire (II), an 
altogether more modern ship. As an older vessel, Vampire (I) is 
unlikely to ever become the key to victory in the game. But who 
knows... you gotta be in it to win it.
HANSY HYBRID SYNTHESISER
Apparently, not everyone in the entire universe loves analogue 
synthesisers. Who knew? We certainly cannot imagine not wanting 
to endlessly twiddle knobs to create the weirdest, most sci-fi  sounds 
possible. But we also get that analogue is just one type of sound. Digital 
has value in... certain contexts. Hansy combines the best of both worlds.
MOST WANTED: Well, this synth had us at the orange casing, but it 
combines all the trad analogue stages - three LFOs, phase distortion, 
envelope generators etc - with a digital sequencer, aftertouch and its 
own DAW for PC.
NOT WANTED: Look, we know you can just plug in a MIDI keyboard 
and you probably have a really awesome MIDI keyboard and wanting a 
keyboard on a synth like this is dumb but... we want a keyboard, okay?

other hipster-friendly pot plants (strictly no pot

AFTER REALISING HOW FAR THEY’VE COME, MARK WILLIAMS THINKS 
NAS DEVICES SHOULD BE AT THE DIGITAL HEART OF EVERY HOME
F 
or many years I’ve been running a 
little fi le server at home that I built 
myself. A low powered CPU system 
so it can remain on constantly 
without being a burden on the power bills 
combined with a bunch of hard drives 
connected to the LAN. Nothing fancy but it 
does the job well.
Over the years it’s grown in its duties, from 
simply storing the family photo albums, 
software and game installer fi le repositories 
(all necessary back before cloud storage was 
a thing and ISP monthly quotas were still of 
major concern), to now also being a media, 
web and backups server.
Having seen some of the latest Network 
Attached Storage (NAS) devices in action it’s 
amazing to see how far these devices have 
come, and I came to the realisation that I’d 
built my own NAS device years before they 
hit the market!
Initially NAS devices were simple boxes 
you shoved hard drives in and they presented 
them to the network as a fi le share, and 
that was it. They still are if you look at it 
simplistically, but NAS device vendors 
have over the years layered so much more 
functionality and fl exibility into them they 
can legitimately do the job of several business 
level servers all in one.
They support most RAID levels with some 
even sporting fancy ZFS fi lesystems, meaning 
redundancy and safety of your stored data in 
SHOP TALK 
WHAT IS YOUR MOST COMMONLY SOLD 
NAS BRAND? WHAT FEATURES DO YOU 
RECOMMEND YOUR CUSTOMERS SHOULD 
LOOK FOR IN A NAS?
JAIMIE, LEADER COMPUTERS:
“We sell a lot of Thecus NAS at Leader, and 
the ones that get rave reports from our SMB 
customers are the Windows based models with 
Storage server built in. Very versatile models 
with the ﬂ exibility and familiarity of a Microsoft 
environment instead of Linux. They even have 
a separate 60GB SSD that hosts the Windows 
environment!” 
JOHN, TI COMPUTERS:
“We think the Synology DiskStation DS218+ is the 
best home NAS for most people. It’s the fastest 
model we’ve tested. It has a modern dual-core 
2.0 GHz Intel Celeron processor and 2GB of RAM, 
which you can expand to 6GB. With unencrypted 
write speeds between 102 MB/s and 109 MB, the 
DS218+ supports media playback through its 
own apps or Plex Media Server, supports RAID 
1 drive mirroring, alerts you to drive failure. You 
can use the DS218+ as a home backup device, a 
media streamer, a mail server, a website-hosting 
device, a BitTorrent box, or a video-surveillance 
recorder—nearly anything you can do with a Linux 
computer.” 
TERENCE, MWAVE:
“Synology DS918+ (good CPU power, RAID 
function, supports 4k video transcoding, powerful 
DVR function -- albeit a camera license is required 
per camera when using more than two cameras).
Customers should always look for RAID 1 or higher 
for data redundancy as NAS holds a lot of data, 
and you don’t want to lose the data in the event 
of a catastrophic HDD failure”
the case of a hard drive failure 
is not a problem.
Then there’s the app stores. 
Yes, like your smart phone. 
Want DVR functionality to record 
your IP camera footage? There’s 
an app for that. Want a BitTorrent 
client? There’s an app for that. Want 
to host a website with a database? 
Yep, there’s a one click install to do 
that too. Anything is possible. From 
mail servers and Plex media servers 
through to OwnCloud installs. The 
possibilities are endless and easily 
achieved at the click of a button. 
They’re cheap too, from just $120 
(excluding hard drives).
Sure, having network attached 
storage at home might seem a little 
redundant in the era of NBN and 
4G/5G internet connectivity speeds 
and cloud storage, why bother 
right?
Just keep in mind that anything 
you store in the cloud can disappear 
without warning. Either through 
some error or fault at the Cloud 
storage providers end or your 
account gets hacked and everything 
gets deleted. Cloud storage 
providers aren’t that 
obliged to provide 
data security or 
backups in the event 
of data loss in the 
cloud. Chances are 
it’s not even stored 
in the same country 
as you!
NAS devices 
offer an easy way 
to control, share 
and store your data 
the way you see fi t. 
There’s an old saying 
in the IT business, 
“they can legitimately 
do the job of several 
business servers”
“it’s not a backup unless there’s three copies 
of it”. If you’ve valuable documents, photos 
and fi les, a NAS can give you an easy backup 
option and so much more.
  A NAS like this Synology DS218+ is an affordable 
yet powerful solution

INFINITY GAMING SYSTEM

This is the perfect gaming system. Once 
you get past the mesmerizing front facia, 
the innards of this beast are perfectly 
appointed. Despite being just a hexa-core 
compared to AMD’s octa-cores, Intel’s 
latest top of the line processor enjoys 
higher IPC and MHz which is lapped 
up by current games, especially with 
its 4.7GHz turbo clock. Sitting under a water 
cooler, enthusiasts can expect to push it to 5GHz and beyond.
Married to this is the top performing graphics card of the 
moment. Capable of 4K gaming, expect smooth gameplay at 
lower resolutions with all details at maximum. 32GB of memory 
is very generous. It’ll go mostly unused with current titles but 
leaves room for future game title requirements creep or more 
intensive productivity work.

Wanting a top tier gaming PC without going overboard? This 
could be for you. Sporting the same top end graphics card as this 
month’s PCCG system, this system shaves upwards of $1,200 off 
the price by using the outgoing quad-core champ, the i7 7700K 
CPU. It also has a lower 16GB (and slower) memory capacity 
which is still the perfect size for current triple-A game 
titles, and a smaller 1TB HDD.
The rest of the system is fairly 
similar with a 500GB SSD, a capable 
power supply, and water cooling to 
elicit overclocking should the desire 
strike. The tempered glass endowed 
chassis keeps things classy (glassy?) 
and with RGB fans, power supply, 
cooler and LED strips inside it’ll glow, 
flash and pulse (or not).

Who says you need a 
large box for a PC? NUC’s 
in many instances can 
fulfil the needs for most 
tasks general purpose 
tasks. Case in point is this 
unit. The CPU is a peppy dual core 
hyperthreaded unit that can turbo up to 4.0GHz. 8GB of RAM is 
the sweet spot for a non-gaming PC, so ticks the box there.
Then there’s the 250GB SSD which will keep the system 
responsive while giving a reasonable amount of storage. It’s only 
a SATA type M.2 SSD but that’s good enough for this machine. 
Of course, the neat thing about this system is its size. It takes 
up less desk space than most smart phones. And if disk space 
is a premium or you just want to hide it completely, use a VESA 
mount to attach it onto the back of your monitor!

I
t’s an old story. Someone goes to 
a local store and buys an item. 
They get it home, set it 
up and it all looks 
perfect. But a few weeks 
or months later – we’ll 
within the item’s expected 
lifetime – it fails and the 
customer heads back to 
the retailer for a refund or 
replacement.
That’s what happened with 
reader Bram Taylor. He purchased 
a Samsung Evo 500GB SSD for his 
computer in August, only for the 
drive to die a couple of months later. 
He had his computer checked by a 
local tech who confirmed the failure 
of the drive.
As the drive failed to boot, and his 
backup strategy let him down, he 
was not in a great place. Fortunately, 
he was able to use a data recovery 
tool to recover much of his lost data 
from another drive which had been 
accidentally overwritten.
Bram purchased the drive from 
a reputable bricks-and-mortar 
dealer and not some fly-by-night 
online mob. But, rather than going 
back to them initially, he contacted 
Samsung who said they would send 
a satchel for him to send back the 
defective drive before dispatching a 
replacement.
I put in a call to Samsung, putting 
them in direct contact with Bram. At 
the time of writing the matter wasn’t 
resolved but I’ll keep you posted in 
next month’s column.
SOME LESSONS
Under Australian consumer law, 
Bram could have, perhaps should 
have, gone directly back to the 
retailer he purchased the SSD from 
THE RETAILER, 
MANUFACTURER  
AND CUSTOMER SHUFFLE
WHEN YOU JUST WANT A REPLACEMENT FOR A FAULTY PART
rather than Samsung. Local 
rules obligate the retailer to carry 
out the remediation action, whether 
that’s a refund, repair or issuing 
a replacement. All of those are 
legitimate remedies.
For significant problems – and 
I’d expect the failure of an SSD 
to qualify as significant – the 
replacement must identical type 
to the product originally supplied 
or a refund should be the same 
amount paid in the same form as 
the original payment.
The ACCC describes what a 
major problem is so it’s easy to 
communicate issues with resellers. 
Your first port of call for any 
warranty problems should be the 
point of purchase. It’s one of the 
benefits of dealing with a physical 
store; you can walk in and discuss 
the matter.
Make sure you have read the 
information regarding consumer 
law and warranties on the ACCC 
web site so you are fully aware of 
your rights as a consumer. It’s also 
worth searching the ACCC’s website 
for any notices regarding any 
retailer you plan to make a major 
purchase through to ensure they 
have been fulfilling their obligations 
under consumer law.
The ACCC has recently taken 
action against tech 
retailers who 
don’t live up to 
their warranty 
obligations, fining 
MSY Technology 
significantly and 
forcing them to put 
a notice on their website 
detailing their offences.
In my experience, a new piece 
of hardware is likely to fail either 
very early in its life or after years of 
faithful service. For example, I have 
some hard drives running in a NAS 
that are into their eighth year. But 
some new drives in a more recent 
storage device reported bad sectors 
after a week.
When replacing a hard drive, it 
is critical to make sure your backup 
strategy is robust (I like the 3-2-1 
system; three copies on two different 
media with at least one stored 
remotely) and tested. Bram’s issues 
were exacerbated by a breakdown in 
his backup strategy. 
It’s been said that there are two 
types of hard drives; those that have 
failed and those that will fail. And 
that applies to new and old storage 
devices alike. Having a solid backup 
strategy and not letting your guard 
down when you get a new drive are 
critical to protecting your data.

T
he desire to create 
artificial intelligence, and 
artificial life, is as old as 
our imagination. But it’s 
only recently that we’ve seen AI 
technologies explode -- largely as a 
function of computing power, data, 
and of course algorithms.
And while we’ve seen it applied 
to everything from smartphone 
assistants and autonomous cars to 
medicine, finance, and law, as a race 
we don’t tend to have the best track 
record of looking before we leap.
Earlier in the year a story made 
the rounds on the value of human 
life with respect to autonomous 
vehicles: faced with killing a 
pedestrian, or swerving to save the 
pedestrian but hit a wall and killing 
the occupant, what should the car 
choose?
It’s not just an excellent question, 
it’s an ethical one. It points to an 
inevitable reality: as we build 
machines that can make decisions 
that impact human lives, we need 
more than just the engineers and 
computer scientists. We need a 
subset of wider stakeholders, 
including those with an ethical 
oversight.
Because the above question isn’t 
as simple as it seems. What if it 
was two pedestrians? Or three? 
What about if the pedestrian was a 
pregnant woman? Or a single child? 
HOW 
DEEP  
THE 
RABBIT 
HOLE 
AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BEGINS TO 
MAKE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LIVES, 
WILL THEY BE UNBIASED AND ETHICAL ONES 
AND HOW ARE THESE DEFINED?
Or two old men at the end of the 
lives? If the original decision was to 
save the driver, then at what point 
does this value judgement change, 
and why?
HOW DO YOU VALUE 
HUMAN LIFE? AND 
FINALLY, IMPORTANTLY, 
WHO GETS TO DECIDE?
To complicate matters, another part 
of the problem is the data: machine 
learning systems are built and 
trained with large volumes of it. By 
this very nature then, their output 
will be a reflection of the data. 
We know this will lead to biases 
where data is weighted one way or 
another, and this can be accounted 
for. The problem is the biases that 
are so ingrained we can’t see them 
– a good example here was Google’s 
image recognition in its Photos 
app when it tagged black people as 
‘gorillas’. There was no intended 
malice here, the problem was the 
data that trained the system.
It doesn’t help that there aren’t 
many freely available anonymised 
open data sets that can be used to 
train these systems. In some cases, 
programmers have resorted to 
skimming sites like Facebook to 
harvest vast volumes of data for 
tasks like text or image recognition 
-- all without permission. It’s for 
science, after all!
And then there’s regulation, or 
lack thereof. Laws and regulation 
have always trailed technological 
advances, but with machine 
learning and AI we’re going at an 
ever faster pace across vast swathes 
of industries.
A video released last month via 
autonomousweapons.org titled [i]
Slaughterbots[/i], and purportedly 
backed by Elon Musk, is a slick flick 
demonstrating a possible future 
taking current advances to their 
logical conclusion. And it’s not a 
pretty one.
While I think it leans too much 
on the fear factor, the extrapolation 
of combined drones with machine 
learning and weapons is not only 
easy to see, it’s all but assured. 
The potential is too great not to do 
so for a variety of organisations, 
especially police and military.
Law making and regulation 
isn’t likely to prevent this kind of 
future (when has this ever stopped 
humankind?) but it doesn’t mean 
this wouldn’t have an effect on the 
development of AI technologies 
that are less obviously dangerous 
and more widely implemented 
– be it autonomous cars, digital 
assistants, virtual doctors and 
more. Anywhere that AI decisions 
will impact people.
We are peering into a deep rabbit 
hole with AI that we’re only just 
learning has many tunnels and 
many miles to explore. That we 
now have Google’s DeepMind 
training itself without human 
interaction, and machine learning 
systems so complex not even their 
authors understand how they 
work, is perhaps a sign that we 
might want to integrate responsible 
frameworks in AI development 
now to ensure unbiased ethical 
products make it to market.
Or learn the hard way when we 
don’t.

D
aniel Arnold in Ipswich 
sent a Facebook message 
through over the 
weekend, thanking our 
business for manufacturing one of 
our IP Surveillance cameras.
It caught my attention because, 
despite selling lots of great solutions 
and products to the public via our 
retail and reseller network every 
month, it isn’t that often that we get 
a thank you message from a user, 
because obviously they are designed 
to work, on and on for years. It’s 
sort of expected. On reading this 
message though, I can see why 
Daniel was feeling so happy with 
his purchase and why he wanted to 
drop us a line. 
You see, Daniel and his 11-year 
old daughter, Cadence, were robbed 
whilst they were away from their 
home in early December, and all 
of their presents were stolen from 
under their Christmas tree, along 
with Cadence’s pocket money from 
her room, and other bits and pieces. 
The thief broke into the house 
via Cadence’s bedroom window, 
and proceeded to go through the 
house, including into the garage 
armed with a fl ashlight, looking 
for whatever he could pilfer from 
the family. The thief was wearing 
a white baseball cap, and a grey 
Nautica sweater, with a hoodie over 
his head and cap.
Daniel looks after Cadence 
as a single parent, and she has 
Asperger Syndrome, which 
affects one’s ability to effectively 
socialise and communicate, so it 
was heartbreaking to see him and 
Cadence the following evening on 
7News in Brisbane sharing their 
story, and seeing the distress that she 
felt about their presents being taken, 
and her concern for going to sleep in 
the house again after the break-in.
Why did Daniel send us a post 
though? Well, he was so happy that 
one of our IP Surveillance cameras 
had taken some great quality 
images of the offender whilst he was 
walking, in pitch blackness, through 
his house with just a fl ashlight. 
Daniel has passed these onto Police, 
and been given permission to share 
them on Facebook. As of writing, 
which is less than 22 hours since 
the post, there are over 36,000 views 
and more than 100 comments across 
both his original post as well as on 
the 7News post on the story, many 
of which are kind-hearted people 
offering to send gifts to them to 
replace the ones that had been 
stolen, as well as our own offer for 
some free spending in our online 
store. 
On one hand I fi nd it upsetting 
that we need cameras to protect 
ourselves, our homes or properties, 
and for governments to record 
footage of crowds and streets where 
people frequent when they wish to 
go out to a restaurant or into the city 
for a night out, but unfortunately, 
that’s the way the world is right now. 
I remember fondly when the back 
door was always open, just in case 
the neighbours needed anything, 
or friends popped in, and you felt 
perfectly safe and trusting. Those 
days are long gone in many, if not 
most parts of Australia now.
At my home I have 5 cameras 
set up, two outside, and 3 inside, 
recording continuously to a NAS on 
some, and on motion detection on 
others to save some storage space. 
I can easily go back via a simple 
navigation screen on an App to 
certain times or events to see what 
happened around the property at 
any time, wherever I happen to be. 
I have to admit, one of the inside 
cameras points right towards a 
lounge where my kids often play 
on the Xbox One, and where most 
of the fi ghts in our house occur. It’s 
great to have ‘evidence’ when one 
child comes down crying or upset 
and the others are attempting to 
slightly embellish or distort the real 
truth of what occurred!
In Daniel and Cadence’s case, 
whilst the Police haven’t caught 
the offender as of the time of 
writing, I’m sure they will, and 
more importantly, through the 
communities’ generosity, they will 
undoubtedly have a wonderful 
Christmas due to the caring people 
that have seen their plight, and are 
doing something about it.
As we rapidly approach the festive 
season, I’d like to wish each one of 
our readers a very Merry Christmas, 
and look forward to hearing more of 
your letters and comments in 2018!

O&O DISKIMAGE 11
REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7, 8, 10 32/64-bit 
• 200MB hard drive space
LIMITATIONS: Registration required.
www.oo-software.com/en/
Anyone who’s ever experienced the shock of 
data loss, or had to spend hours recovering 
their system, will know the importance of 
backing up. Having a fall-back copy of both 
Windows – including all your favourite apps 
and painstakingly crafted settings – and 
your irreplaceable documents, media and 
other files is a no-brainer, but what is the 
best way to go out doing it?
O&O DiskImage Professional provides 
you with all the tools you need for backing 
up both individual data such as selected 
files and folders, plus take drive images 
of entire partitions and drives. While’s it’s 
still not a tool for complete beginners, it 
does provide some hints and tips to guide 
you towards protecting your data, and the 
latest version attempts to make things even 
easier with a revamped sort-of Windows 
10-style interface. After installing, you’ll 
choose the function you need by clicking on 
the appropriate tile: “Start drive imaging”, 
“Start file backup”, “Create one-click image” 
or maybe “Create bootable disk”. Pick the 
imaging option and you’re able to create 
images of all your drives with a click.
Alternatively, select a source drive or 
volume, click “Start drive imaging” and you 
can run a backup using the default settings.
You can also opt to back up individual 
files and folders with O&O DiskImage – this 
is a simple case of browsing a file explorer 
window for items to back up, ticking folders 
and files as you go. There are similar options 
to run complete, incremental or differential 
backups, compress or encrypt your archives, 
and more.

password manager where you can save 
your logins, bank account details, credit 
card information, even “Private Favourites”, 
URLs you’d like to keep handy, but not make 
entirely public.
An Email Encryption module can encrypt

ASHAMPOO MUSIC STUDIO 2018
REQUIREMENTS: Windows 7, 8, 10 32/64-bit 
• 200MB hard drive space
LIMITATIONS: Registration required.
www.ashampoo.com/en/aud
Ashampoo Music Studio 2018 is a capable 
collection of tools which makes it easy 
to build, manage and share your music 
collection.
You might start by ripping some tracks 
from CDs, for instance, and saving them 
as WMA, OGG or WAV audio fi les. But the 
program can also record fi les directly from 
a microphone, or the line-in of your sound 
card. And it can even strip the soundtrack 
from a video, saving it as a more convenient 
audio fi le.
If you already have plenty of music fi les, 
you might prefer Ashampoo Music Studio 
2018’s ability to edit them (cut, trim, copy, 
paste, fade and more). The Normalize 
tool helps you keep a consistent volume 
level across a set of audio fi les, while the 
Conversion option will convert particular 
fi les into a more usable format.
And there’s plenty more. An Organize 
function will rename and relocate your fi les 
into a logical folder structure, so they’re 
easier to fi nd. There’s a built-in tool for 
burning audio and MP3 CDs, and you even 
get a tool to help you design disc covers.
There are plenty of features to explore, 
then, but a well-designed interface ensures 
the program is very easy to use. The various 
functions are divided into logical categories 
(“Record”, “Burn”, “Edit Cover”); hovering 
your mouse cursor over an icon displays 
a tooltip with more details, and a series of 
helpful wizards help out as you go.
STARTUPSTAR 2018
Booting your PC may look simple - turn it 
on, and Windows starts - but there’s an extra 
step which isn’t so obvious. As Windows 
launches it also automatically runs a host 
of startup programs, many of which are 
unnecessary, and that can signifi cantly 
extend your PC’s boot time.
Fortunately you don’t have to live with 
this situation. Install StartupStar and you’ll 
have all the tools you need to manage your 
PC’s startup process, get it back under 
your control, and then make sure it stays 
that way. The process starts by reviewing 
your current setup. Clicking “Startup 
Entries” displays everything which is set 
up to launch when Windows starts. Scroll 
the list to take a look, and if you’re sure 
there are some entries you don’t need, then 
StartupStar can help you to get rid of them.
If you spot an unnecessary startup 
program, for instance, then just check the 
box to its left, and click “Delete selected 
entries” to remove it. Or if you’re not 
sure whether it’s necessary or not, try the 
“Deactivate...” option. The program won’t 
launch when you next reboot, but it’ll 
still appear in the startup list and can be 
restored later.
StartupStar also includes a “Startup 
Firewall”, which runs in the background 
and warns you when a program is being 
confi gured to run at boot time.

CAN HYPERLOOP BE BUILT OR IS THE IDEA 
JUST SILICON VALLEY HYPE? NICOLE 
KOBIE REVEALS WHY THE SUPERFAST 
TRAINS MAY BE POSSIBLE – AND WHY 
THEY MAY BE WORTH THE EFFORT EVEN IF 
THEY FAIL
M 
elbourne to Adelaide in 50 
minutes. Global mass transport 
that’s as fast as planes without 
chewing up fossil fuels and 
spewing out emissions. And all backed 
by the billionaire enthusiast who pushed 
electric cars to the forefront and wants to 
take humans to Mars. 
But is Hyperloop actually possible? Even 
the experts aren’t sure – some say it’s a 
matter of time and money (lots of money), 
but others say it’s nothing more than a high-
speed folly. 
The latest to jump on the superfast 
bandwagon of the future is Virgin, which 
chucked enough money at leading developer 
Hyperloop One that it’s been rebranded – to 
the catchy Virgin Hyperloop One. But others 
disagree, citing concerns about the ability to 
maintain a low-pressure environment over 
long periods or the infrastructure required: 
think long tunnels or in-the-air tubes. Then 
there’s the small matter of jump-starting 
and halting the pods without too much 
discomfort or, you know, death. And the 
costs required to pull it all together. Will 
such challenges derail Hyperloop? 
HISTORY OF HYPERLOOPS
The idea of a levitating train whooshing 
through a near-vacuum tunnel isn’t actually 
new. British inventor George Medhurst has a 
patent on one version of the idea – although 
it’s a bit out of date, having been approved 
in 1799. Another version was actually 
developed in London to shuttle letters and 
parcels in the 1860s with the Pneumatic 
Despatch Railway, and in New York in 1870 
with the Beach Pneumatic Transit line. And 
“maglev” – magnetic levitation – 
trains are already zooming around 
Japan and South Korea. 
All these offerings differ from 
Elon Musk’s version, dubbed 
Hyperloop Alpha, which he 
offered up as an “open-source 
transportation concept” via a 57-
page PDF back in 2013.
Musk’s initial plans involved 
a low-air-pressure tube with 
a motor on the levitating pod 
boosting it every 70 miles or so to 
overcome the much-reduced but 
still problematic friction. Power is 
supplied by solar panels along the 
top of the tube. That tube would 
be built above ground on pillars 
or pylons, following motorways 
where possible to avoid having to 
buy more land, with small pods 
carrying 28 people each leaving 
every 30 seconds and travelling 
at 1,220km/h. Musk predicted 
it would cost US$6 billion to 
build such a design between San

Francisco and LA. 
Several companies are 
developing their own versions 
of the idea. The two leading 
contenders are Hyperloop One 
and Hyperloop Transportation 
Technologies; the former has 
actually run tests, while the latter 
has shown off little more than a 
stack of agreements with countries, 
including the UAE. Smaller rivals 
include Canadian TransPod and 

TROLLING TECH FUTURES
PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   31 
Dutch university 
spin-out Hardt 
Global Mobility, 
both of which are 
still working on 
approval and funds 
for test tracks. The 
other company 
to watch is 
Musk’s own 
tunnelling 
startup, The Boring Company, after 
the Silicon Valley pioneer tweeted 
that he has “verbal” government 
approval to build a Hyperloop in a 
tunnel connecting New York and 
Washington, DC. 
While Musk’s own efforts are 
always worth keeping an eye on, 
Hyperloop One is currently the 
one to watch. Hyperloop One 
ran its second major test over the 
summer, at a 500m track in the 
Nevada desert. The pod reached a 
top speed of 309km/h – a far cry 
from the 1,220km/h promised by 
Musk, but a clear step forward from 
early tests. “When you hear the 
sound of the Hyperloop One, you 
hear the sound of the future,” said 
Hyperloop One co-founder Shervin 
Pishevar. 
CRITICISM ABOUNDS
However, Hyperloop sounds like 
something other than the future 
to many industry and academic 
experts. 
The criticism usually centres on 
these key points: creating a vacuum 
or low-pressure environment of 
such scale is diffi cult, as the tubes 
will expand from heat 
and consequently 
crack, shift and leak; 
the infrastructure 
– whether above-
ground tubes 
or tunnels – is 
diffi cult to build and 
maintain to the level 
needed to handle 
such forces; the 
trip would be 
uncomfortable 
and any accidents 
would be violently fatal; and the 
costs are much higher than Musk 
claims. 
Whether a Hyperloop-style train 
is possible also depends on exactly 
what you mean. Musk’s fi rst plans 
involved a tube set resting in the 
air on pylons, while his The Boring 
Company is naturally looking 
to tunnels; plus, the eventual 
Hyperloop could be slower than 
those promised speeds, reducing 
some of the concerns around heat 
and comfort. The plans are likely 
to change further throughout 
development, so even if the general 
idea eventually comes to fruition, 
it may not look very much like 
Musk’s original sketch opposite. 
TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
There’s no question that designing 
and building Hyperloop will 
be diffi cult from a technical 
standpoint, but Dr Hugh Hunt, 
senior lecturer in mechanics at 
the department of engineering 
at the University of Cambridge, 
argues there are no “showstoppers” 
preventing it from eventually 
working. The other three experts 
we spoke to – who are a mix of 
critics and proponents of the 
idea – all agreed that, technically 
speaking, Hyperloop is possible, 
though challenging. “We have yet to fi nd 
anything that makes it not valid,” said Emil 
Hansen, technical director at HypED, a 
University of Edinburgh spin-off developing 
a pod for a SpaceX Hyperloop competition. 
“It is quite a big leap in technology to make 
it happen, but all the separate technologies 
already exist. It’s just a question of improving 
quality, reducing the cost, and reducing the 
risk involved.” 
Professor Herbert Einstein, of MIT’s Civil 
and Environmental Engineering de`partment, 
said one of the most pressing issues is 
maintaining a vacuum over a long distance. 
“We’re talking about building the largest 
vacuum chamber in the world by quite a 
large margin,” added Hansen. “But it’s still 
the same technology that’s worked for a very 
long time.”
Einstein is a tunnelling expert and he 
doesn’t “see much of a problem” from that 
point of view, as boring costs have continued 
to fall. That’s convenient, as the track needs to 
be straight or very close to it, Hunt notes, and 
that’s harder above ground. “It’s like when 
you’re driving fast on a motorway, you don’t 
want sharp bends,” he explained, noting 
that’s not easy as the earth moves – even in 
places not prone to earthquakes. “To keep the 
track straight, it needs to be readjusted. We 
do that with railways already, so I suspect to 
keep Hyperloop tracks straight, we have to 
do it better and more often.” 
For that reason, quake-prone California 
may not be the best place to trial the in-the-
air pylon version of Hyperloop. “The ideal 
place to start is wide open and fl at with not 
too many things in the way,” Hunt said, 
suggesting the Abu Dhabi project could well 
be ideal for the fi rst Hyperloop. 
Einstein adds that such technical problems 
are all solvable, and frankly, that’s what 
Musk is good at. “That’s one of the things 
Musk does,” he said. “He is very skilled and 
intelligent about using existing technologies 
and making them practically useful. Electric 
vehicles existed for a long time, but he 
brought it up to practical use.”
CUSTOMER COMFORT
One of the most high-profi le criticisms 
regards security for these high-profi le trains, 
  University of Edinburgh 
spin-off HypED is 
developing a pod for a 
Hyperloop competition
  Elon Musk’s tunnelling firm, The Boring 
Company, has already unveiled its drill, 
dubbed Godot
“Musk tweeted that he has 
‘verbal’ approval to build 
a Hyperloop in a tunnel 
connecting New York and 
Washington, DC”

32  WWW.PCAUTHORITY.COM.AU
  Hyperloop One’s test 
track in the Nevada 
desert mimics Musk’s 
original idea…
with critics pointing out that a single hole in 
a Hyperloop tube could cause a catastrophic 
failure, killing everyone in the pod. That 
means a terrorist could very easily do real 
damage without having to hop onboard first, 
as it’s difficult to secure the entire length 
of the tube. However, again, underground 
tunnels could help here. 
But intentional violence and high-speed 
accidents aside, Hyperloop also requires 
accelerating to high speeds for several 
minutes. We’re used to that for a shorter 
period on planes, but passengers will feel 
such forces for much longer on Hyperloop. “It 
won’t be comfortable, we would have to get 
used to it,” explained Hunt. 
Moreover, Hansen notes, air travel 
has plenty of other discomforts: intense 
security screening, long loading times and 
airport locations far out of cities. In theory, 
Hyperloop’s train-style infrastructure will 
slash some of that faff. 
CUTTING COSTS
Assuming the technical hurdles can be 
cleanly leapt, costs alone could derail the 
idea. “Hyperloop, meaning a high-speed 
transport device enclosed in a tube and 
propelled by electric power, is technically 
possible,” said Genevieve Giuliano, chair 
in effective local government and director 
of METRANS transportation centre at the 
University of Southern California. “[But] 
I don’t see Hyperloop as a feasible passenger 
transport mode, simply because it would be 
very difficult to compete with air transport, 
and the high speeds will not translate into 
markedly shorter trips.”
She notes that as Hyperloop is an 
independent system, goods and people need 
to be transferred to other transport at each 
end, cutting into speeds and adding cost, just 
as air travel does, with as much time spent 
getting to the airport and boarding the plane 
as the actual flight for shorter journeys. 
“Because it must be built from scratch, 
it will be costly to build, and it has to have 
right-of-way,” she added. “In order to cover 
the costs of construction and operation, it 
would need a lot of traffic. The question is 
where is a sufficiently strong market for such 
a service.”
Of course, until a Hyperloop is actually 
built, it’s difficult to tot up the costs: a NASA 
paper claims Hyperloop is faster and cheaper 
than short-haul flights, but academics at the 
University of Queensland suggest Musk’s 
estimates are a tenth of what they should be. 
It will be expensive, but hey – that’s why we 
have billionaires like 
Musk and Branson, 
after all. 
However, why chuck 
billions at pods that 
so far only go 300km/h 
when we already have 
trains topping speeds of 
360km/h and planes to take 
us further distances? Is it worth 
spending billions to go faster or to 
compete with air travel?
“Hyperloop is selling speed, so 
it is competing with air transport,” 
noted Professor Giuliano. “The 
air system is a dense network 
that takes you or your packages 
anywhere you want to go. Typically 
proponents of new technology 
don’t think about the potential for 
competition from old technology. 
We should not expect that the air 
cargo industry will not innovate 
and figure out ways to compete.”
WHY IT’S A GOOD IDEA
Assuming the technical hurdles 
can be traversed successfully, there 
are plenty of good reasons to build 
Hyperloop trains – including their 
environmental credentials. 
Rather than asking if Hyperloop 
is technically possible, 
we should be asking a 
different question, said 
Hunt. “Is carrying on burning 
fossil fuels technically possible – 
well, it obviously is, but it’s a really 
stupid idea,” he said. “So if we’re 
not going to be burning fossil fuels 
to fly, then what are we going to 
do instead of long distance flying? 
What I like about Hyperloop is it’s 
one of the few serious attempts at 
addressing that problem.”
Analysis by the US Department 
of Transportation suggests 
Hyperloop is six times more energy 
efficient than air travel, while 
academics at Helmut Schmidt 
University in Hamburg calculated a 
Hyperloop could cut 140,000 tonnes 
of carbon emissions by keeping 
freight off motorways. 
Alongside that, Musk’s latest 
project – whether it’s built by The 
Boring Company or rivals – is 
rather inspiring. “I think it’s really 
exciting,” said Hunt. “The more 
we get young people interested 
in wacky engineering ideas, the 
better, really.” He added: “If we 
only ever try to do things where we 
can already see how it would work, 
then I suspect we won’t really be 
ever coming up with particularly 
exciting new ideas. Let’s push 
ourselves outside our comfortable 
boundaries, and who knows what 
we’ll come up with.” 
  …and in tests last summer, the XP-1 pod hit 
respectable speeds of 309km/h

WE TRY BEFORE YOU BUY
IN THE LABS
D 
you run a NAS? In my non-scientific anecdotal experience 
talking around the place with readers (usually at our 
Upgrade Australia events, which is when I enjoy hours of 
satisfying personal time with those of you who are there), there 
are two camps. There’s those who enthusiastically run a NAS and 
use it a lot, and those who don’t see a need. There’s little middle 
ground, by which I mean pseudo-NAS products like the WD My 
Cloud, the latest version of which is reviewed in this issue, on 
page 47, or use instead a simple portable external hard drive.
In the last PCTA reader survey (which we ran almost two years 
ago), 42% of you said you intended to purchase a NAS in the next 
year. Alas, we didn’t ask how many of you already have a NAS, 
but it’s fair to assume that it’s a bit more than 42% because many 
of you will have a NAS you’re perfectly happy with and don’t 
intend to upgrade. 
But, still, not everyone does. Some just don’t need to. It may be 
that the PC has limited tasks, like for just gaming as an example. 
Some people may use the cloud for storage and backups. Some of 
you may not yet have set up a media library to stream around the 
house, and world. Or ever intend to. PCs used for work, though, 
should. There’s no substitute for having a physical copy right 
there in the home or office.
I’d never suggest that a NAS alone is all you need, with cloud 
being so cheap (or free) and quick that’s another essential layer to 
have.
Media streamers may use a simpler solution like a Chromecast, 
or even just a smart TV networked to an always-on PC.
It’s these myriad of uses and solutions that make a NAS so 
hard to pigeonhole. The only thing I know to be absolutely true 
is that when someone gets their first NAS there’s no going back. 
You might have just a single reason to get one, but not long after 
you start to play with the expanded versatility new worlds open. 
Let’s not overlook the huge variety of NAS apps that do cool stuff. 
If you’re in the Synology or Qnap ecosystems you know exactly 
what I’m talking about. It’s app-overload for most of us, but those 
companies keep on innovating and, really, what they offer is 
not far off being an operating system itself. Perhaps even to the 
point where all those features work against the appeal of a NAS

2D TESTS
Desktop PCs and laptops are tested using our own custom bench testing suite, which has 
been carefully designed to test all aspects of a system and rate them in a way that’s useful 
to you. Our benchtesting cover three main tests: a typical video editing test, a demanding 
4K video editing test and a multitasking test that stresses all aspects of the system. We 
look at the time it takes for each test to run, which is then compared to our reference PC to 
produce a normalised result. This score is shown on a graph, and to help you understand 
just where the PC we’re reviewing sits in the grand scheme of things, we will often include 
other system’s scores. 
On occasion we will run publically available bench testing software, predominantly PCMark 
10 from Futuremark. This is run in the Home setting, in Accelerated mode. You can get 
PCMark 10 as well as 3DMark (below) from www.futuremark.com
3D TESTS
For video cards, as well as Integrated Graphics Processing Units, we use:
• 3DMARK FIRESTRIKE
• RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER
• TOTAL WAR: WARHAMMER 2
• GHOST RECON WILDLANDS
3DMark is designed specifically to test video cards, and you can download and run the same 
tool as us to help you gauge where your own GPU ranks compared to what we are reviewing. 
The games were selected because they are relatively well balanced in performance 
between AMD and Nvidia, favouring neither. Rise of the Tomb Raider supports DX12. Ghost 
Recon Wildlands is a cutting edge 3D engine and can be optimised to stress either the CPU 
or GPU, while Total War: Warhammer is particularly good at stressing CPUs, and has beta 
DX12 support.
Tests are run using three resolution ranges, depending on where the GPU sits in the 
market:
ENTRY LEVEL: 1920 X 1080
MID-RANGE: 1920 X 1080 – 2560 X 1440
HIGH-END: 4K
BATTERY TESTS
Screen brightness is set to 120cd/m2,

A 
MD themselves hyped up its Vega GPU 
to the point where it was anticipated 
as being a GTX 1080 Ti killer. Sadly 
this was not the case, and the reference card 
underwhelmed. Still, when looking at the 
underlying architecture, Vega has much to 
offer, particularly now that we are seeing the 
fi rst custom models arriving that address the 
biggest weakness: the cooling. We are keen 
to see what Vega is really capable of with the 
Asus ROG Strix RX Vega 64. 
VEGA DONE RIGHT
At fi rst glance, you get the impression that 
this is a serious graphics card. It’s effectively 
a triple slot design so consideration is needed 
when choosing accompanying components. 
Asus have improved on the reference card 
in every way. Gone is the overburdened 
reference blower cooler. The Asus Strix is 
cooler and quieter thanks to its triple dust 
resistant fan implementation, much larger fi n 
surface area and lapped base for maximum 
contact. The fans don’t spin until GPU hits 55c, 
leaving the card completely silent when not 
under heavy load. Cooling is only a part of it 
though. The PCB is massively improved over 
ASUS ROG 
STRIX RX VEGA 64
the reference card, with a 12 phase 
power delivery system fed by dual 
8 pin power connectors. Frankly it 
is needed in order to cope with any 
meaningful overclocking.
Of course it wouldn’t be a gamer 
oriented product without RGB 
onboard, and Asus have included 
RGB lighting on the back plate and 
on the shroud of the card. There’s 
also a supplemental RGB header 
that supports Asus Aura Sync for 
matching the colours to the rest 
of the system. The card has a total 
of fi ve video outputs consisting of 
two DP v1.4, two HDMI 2.0b and 
one DVI-D port. This means all 
bases are covered with the latest 
video capabilities. One of the 
little things we really like is the 
inclusion of a pair of fan headers 
that can synchronize with the card 
for optimal cooling. For example, 
an adjacent case fan can ramp up 
to push additional air towards the 
card while under heavy load. The 
Asus GPU Tweak software has been 
updated with easy to set OC profi les 
in addition to full manual control 
for the more advanced tweaker.
Performance is pretty good and 
it trades blows with the GTX 1080, 
which is good to see, but that’s 
  Asus has done its 
best with their RX 
Vega 64. The card is 
sort-of-cool, quiet and 
about as fast as you’ll 
get from an air cooled

the minimum we’d expect given 
the GTX 1080 has been around 
for 18 months and uses much less 
power. Perhaps AMD can fi nd some 
performance gains over the life of 
the card, in DirectX 12 or Vulkan 
games that can make full use of the 
Vega feature set. 
In our testing the card got up to 
83c, which is high but not horrible. 
Thankfully noise levels are well 
under control. The huge Strix cooler 
does a great job. Unfortunately 
you can pretty much forget about 
overclocking. Increasing the power 
levels and setting a higher core clock 
leads to throttling quite quickly 
which defeats the purpose.
THAT POWER USAGE 
THOUGH…
At the end of the day there’s a lot 
to like about the Vega architecture 
and its advanced features. Asus has 
done the best they could with what 
it is. If you have a Freesync monitor 
or just love team red, then the Asus 
Strix Vega 64 will serve you well. It 
competes well against the GTX 1080 
but a 300 watt+ power consumption 
is tough to overlook. 
One of the enduring problems 
for AMD is availability due to the 
mining craze. When you combine 
this with the scarcity of the HBM2 
memory, we are looking at potential 
stock shortages and vastly infl ated 
prices. This makes the card much 
more diffi cult to recommend. Asus 
have indicated the launch RRP will 
be $1,139. At this price the GTX 1080 
is clearly the superior choice. We 
are hopeful that street prices will be 
lower to make the Asus ROG Strix 
Vega 64 a more compelling option.

I 
n early November Nvidia introduced 
what is likely to be the fi nal GTX 10 
series graphics card. The GTX 1070 
Ti fi lled a gap in the Nvidia lineup that 
became acutely apparent with AMD’s 
release of the RX Vega 56. While the 1070 
Ti doesn’t bring anything revolutionary 
to the table, it is still a fi ne GPU that 
sits between the well-known GTX 1070 
and GTX 1080 stalwarts. The 1070 Ti 
offers low power consumption, excellent 
performance and in the case of the 
Founders Edition, adequate cooling. 
This last point is addressed with the 
subsequent release of custom models 
from all the major manufacturers. In 
our labs we have models from Asus, 
Gigabyte, MSI and Zotac, each of which 
are unique in their own ways as we’ll see.
Nvidia is obviously worried that 
the 1070 Ti is a little close in 
performance to the 1080, so it 
has locked the BIOS level clock 
speeds across all models, at 
least for now. This doesn’t mean they 
can’t overclock, and several vendors have 
easy to use software tools that can set the 
card to a higher clock that is guaranteed 
to work out of the box. All our testing 
was done with the cards set to their OC 
modes where applicable. 
All GTX 1070 Ti’s are good cards, so 
which one you prefer comes down to 
personal criteria. Price? Dimensions? 
Cooling? Performance? All the tested 
models have their strengths and 
weaknesses. Whatever model you 
choose, you’re going to be getting plenty 
of gaming goodness with lashings of eye 
candy.

he Asus 1070 Ti Strix Gaming is the 
most feature packed variant in our 
test. It’s no surprise that it comes with 
the highest price, too. It has the joint highest 
overclock of the bunch, along with the 
MSI card, with a 1683MHz base clock and 
1759MHz boost clock. 
The Strix cooler is very effective with a huge 
surface area. When you pick it up you know 
it’s a serious piece of kit with its excellent 
build quality and rigidity.  It’s a 2.5 slot card, 
which you may need to take into consideration 
if space is limited. It delivered the coolest 
temperatures of the roundup and was second 
only to the MSI in fan noise, though the

igabyte’s GTX 1070 Ti Gaming 8G 
strikes a good balance of performance 
and affordability. It is positioned in 
the budget segment of the 1070 Ti market. Its 
overclock mode sets the card at 1632MHz base 
clock with a 1721MHz boost clock.
It uses the well regarded Windforce 3X 
cooler which does an acceptable job, but it 
does feel a touch lightweight compared to 
the cooler found on the high end Gigabyte & 
Aorus Xtreme cards. The cooler is certainly 
capable enough, but does give up some surface 
area when compared to the Asus and MSI 
cards, which means a maximum boost clocks 
are a touch lower and noise levels are higher, 
though not as high as the Zotac Mini.
The Gigabyte Gaming 8G comes with a

difference is minimal in reality.
The Asus comes with unique 
features including a pair of fan 
headers suitable for controlling 
adjacent system fans. The card is fed 
by a single 8-pin power connector 
and is the only card in the test to 
feature a pair of HDMI 2.0b ports 
in addition to a pair of DP 1.4 ports 
and a DVI-D port. The Asus is a real 
looker too with the side logos, back 
plate and shroud decked out with 
RGB lighting controlled by the Asus 
Aura Sync app. If you like your PC 
to have a healthy dose of bling, this 
is the card you’ll want.
The Asus Strix delivered the 
fastest results in our testing, and 
was easily able to hold its boost 
clocks above 1900 MHz when set to 
OC mode with the GPU Tweak App. 
Temperatures never went above 70c 
in our open test bench. Impressive! 
Though it’s the most expensive 
card in our test, it delivered the 
best performance and has the best 
feature set. It’s a great choice if you 
need an impromptu murder weapon 
as well as a GPU. It’s a true beast of 
a card!
good feature set, including clock 
profi les that can be activated via 
the simple to use Aorus Graphics 
Engine. This app also controls the 
RBG functionality of the Gigabyte 
logo and fan stop indicator on the 
side of the card. The card has a nice 
looking subtle back plate, too. Video 
outputs consist of a single DVI-D 
port, three DP 1.4 ports and a single 
HDMI 2.0b port. The card is fed via 
a single 8-pin power connector.
Surprisingly, the Gigabyte was 
often matched by the Zotac card 
despite its overclock advantage. This 
indicates that Gigabyte focused on 
minimizing noise at the expense 
of maximum boost clock, which is 
the right way to go. Admittedly, the 
differences between all models are 
small though.
The Gigabyte Gaming 8G is 
a good all-rounder with a good 
blend of affordable price, attractive 
features and cooling ability. Though 
it lacks the overall polish of the more 
premium MSI and Asus cards, it’s 
still a very good card at its core. Like 
all the cards in the roundup, it will 
do its job and save you a few bucks.

he MSI GTX 1070 Ti Gaming 8G is 
another 1070 Ti that impresses with its 
cooler and build quality, along with its 
competitive pricing. Its overclock mode is set 
at an impressive 1683MHz base clock and 1759

The MSI 1070 Ti uses the stalwart Twin 
Frozr V cooler that is used across almost all 
of MSI’s high end graphics cards, so it’s no 
surprise to see it used here. The card is built 
like a battleship with a solid back plate and 
additional metal heatsinks for cooling the

for the MSI logo on the side, though its 
usefulness is limited with a clashing set of red

sole mini card of the 1070 Ti launch, and also 
the only one not to offer an overclock profi le -- 
though of course you can manually overclock 
it if you wish. The little Zotac is obviously 
ideally suited to a small form factor build. It’s 
also the cheapest card in the test by quite a

in the test. This should provide 
an additional bit of headroom for 
serious overclockers.
The MSI comes with several 
utilities including the popular 
Afterburner program along with the 
Gaming app that allows one click 
clock profi les. 
The MSI card is the quietest card 
of the roundup at the expense of 
slightly higher temperatures and 
hence a drop in boost clock here and 
there compared to the Asus. Still, 
the card was able to hold clocks well 
over 1900MHz, just a few MHz shy 
of the Asus, so it’s still very fast.
MSI rarely misstep with its 
high end GPUs and the Gaming 
8G is a compelling choice with its 
competitive price and excellent 
cooler. If noise levels are your 
number one priority, this is the card 
for you.
1683 MHz boost clocks. There’s 
a standard set of three DP 1.4 
ports, one HDMI 2.0b port and a 
DVI-D port. There’s a single 8-pin 
power connector. Clock and fan 
adjustments can be made through 
the capable Zotac Firestorm App. 
The overall build quality is quite 
good with a solid shroud and back 
plate giving the card a rigid and 
solid feel.
One of the surprises of the test 
was just how competitive the 
Zotac was in the benchmarks 
despite its lack of an auto-
overclock. This was apparent 
when monitoring the boost clock 
during a stress test. The fan ramp 
is quite aggressive, allowing the 
little Zotac to hold boost clocks in 
the mid-1800MHz range, though this 
comes at the expense of fan noise 
which is the highest in the test, not 
unexpectedly given the relatively 
diminutive cooler.
The Zotac Mini is clearly best for 
those who want a small size as their 
number one priority. The compact 
design in addition to the attractive 
price and competitive performance 
make this a compelling card if you 
can live with the fact that you’ll be 
able to hear it when pushed.

he LG 43UD79 is a huge ultra HD 
monitor. At 43-inches diagonally, it is 
larger than many people’s living room 
televisions. Everyone who saw this monitor 
whilst it was being reviewed thought it was 
a television. When it was explained to them 
it’s a monitor, their minds were blown and 
inevitably, the topic of “who needs a monitor 
that big?!”, was raised.
It’s a great question - who does need a 
monitor this large? Well, if you’re the sort of 
person that wants multiple windows open at 
once on your computer, but doesn’t want to, or 
can’t connect multiple monitors, then the LG 
43UD79 is right up your alley. The effective 
desktop resolution and screen size is the same 
as having four 21.5-inch 1080p monitors glued 
together with no bezels distorting the image. 
The UHD resolution is perfect for placing 
a browser window, a double-page spread 
PDF, a programming 
IDE and a command-line 
terminal on screen, all at 
once. No more fl icking 
through trying to fi nd the 
app you wanted, they’re 
all open and viewable 
simultaneously – boosting 
your productivity. 
Specs wise, the LG 
43UD79 has an anti-
glare IPS panel with 
a 3840x2160 resolution

and a 178-degree viewing angle. 
Colour accuracy is average, with 
a basic 72% coverage of the NTSC 
gamut. Brightness and contrast are 
adequate at 350cm/m2 and 1000:1 
(native) respectively. Response 
time is on the high end at 8ms GTG 
and refresh rates are maxed out 
at 60Hz due to the limitations of 
DisplayPort’s bandwidth. Despite 
AMD FreeSync support, the LG 
43UD79 isn’t a gaming monitor. 
On the rear, there’s a DisplayPort 
v1.2 socket and four HDMI ports 
- two of them support HDMI v1.4 
and the other two HDMI v2.0. Two 
USB 3.1 Gen1 ports are awkwardly 
placed at the bottom-rear of the 
monitor. There’s also a headphone 
socket and an RS-232 port if you 
want to connect the LG 43UD79 up 
to an automation 
setup.
Rounding out 
connectivity is a 
USB-C connector that 
supports DisplayPort, 
however, it only 
provides 5V/1A 
of power delivery. 
Whilst that’s useful 
for smartphone 
users, LG missed a great 
opportunity to please laptop users 
by offering full power delivery 
capabilities, as well as displaying an 
image.
Included with the LG 43UD79 is 
a remote control that works just like 
a TV remote with volume, power 
and input selection, but without all 
the other useless buttons. On it are 
options to fl ick between picture-in 
and picture-beside picture modes, 
as well as enabling game mode 
for reduced input lag. LG also 
provide basic window management 
software that makes life with this 
behemoth easier.
In use, the LG 43UD79 is 
awkward because it’s so damn 
big. Placing the screen at an 
ergonomically recommended 
arm’s length away means you’re 
constantly moving your head 
around to focus on something. If 
the window you want to focus on 
isn’t at eye level, your neck is stuck 
on a funny angle that will lead to 
soreness long term.
If you sit further back to prevent 
moving your neck around, the text 
at the LG 43UD79’s native resolution 
becomes too small to read. Increase 
the DPI in Windows to compensate 
and you start sacrifi cing all that 
beautiful desktop real estate. The 
LG 43UD79 sits in a bit of a catch-22 
area. It’s great because it’s big, but 
because it’s so big, you can’t enjoy 
the full UHD resolution and all the 
benefi ts that provides. 
Is the LG 43UD79 the most colour 
accurate monitor on the market? 
Nope, but it still looks great. Has 
it got amazing response times and 
refresh rates that gamers will love? 
Not really, but anyone but the most 
hard-core gamer won’t even notice. 
But if you want a huge monitor 
with loads of pixels to have loads of 
windows open simultaneously, then 
you should get the LG 43UD79, as 
that’s exactly what it’s designed for.

For games without G-Sync 
built-in, the PG27VQ also supports 
ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur), 
which some people prefer to G-Sync. 
Either way, whichever mode your 
eyes enjoy, the PG27VQ supports 
them both. Another feather in the 
PG27VQ’s cap is Nvidia 3D Vision 
support. With optional stereoscopic 
glasses, movies and photos can be 
seen in 3D, at up to 120Hz. If you’re 
an AMD graphics card owner, none 
of this fancy stuff works, so you 
should investigate another monitor 
for your setup.
For those already invested 
in the Asus Aura Sync lighting 
system, the PG27VQ is the fi rst 
monitor to be included in the Aura 
Sync family, with four lighting 
zones, including ambient lighting 
behind the monitor. The PG27VQ’s 
stand is fully adjustable, allowing 
modifi cation of the angle, swivel 
and height of the display. There’s 
a common 100mm x 100mm VESA 
amount on the rear for use on any 
standard monitor arm or wall 
mount. 
Connectivity wise, there’s all 
the ports you need, with HDMI 
1.4, DisplayPort 1.2, a 3.5mm audio 
socket for headphones and two USB 
3.0 ports - handy for connecting 
gaming controllers if your rig’s 
tower is far from the monitor. The 
PG27VQ uses an external power 
supply, which is great as the power 
supply in monitors is often the fi rst 
thing to crap out. With an external 
PSU, all you need to do is swap the 
unit out, instead of the expensive 
hassle of taking the entire monitor 
back to where you bought it from to 
be repaired.
All up, if you’ve got rig with an 
Nvidia card capable of the high 
frame rates this 165Hz G-Sync 
monitor supports, you won’t be 
disappointed. 1ms response times 
will be appreciated by all the fast-
twitch FPS gamers and support 
for Nvidia’s 3D vision is just the 
icing on the cake. For those already 
invested in the Asus ROG and 
Aura Sync system, the ROG Swift 
PG27VQ is a must buy.

440p monitors are now a viable addition to 
your gaming rig thanks to high powered 
GPUs that support high frame rates at 2560 
x 1440. The Asus ROG Swift PG27VQ is on 
paper, the perfect match for a fast GPU that 
spits out hundreds of frames per second at 
1440p in your favourite games. But what’s it 
like in practice?
Inside the PG27VQ is a TN panel that 
supports a crazy low 1ms response time for 
virtually lag free gaming. TN panels aren’t as 
nice to look at as an IPS panel, but if you want 
low response times, TN is the only way to go. 
To Asus’s credit, they’ve made a nice-looking 
TN panel, but the colour gamut is average, 
with only 72% of the NTSC colour space. 
Another sacrifi ce for that high refresh rate and 
response time. 
If you plan go multi-display, three of these 
units make a nice panoramic scene thanks 
to the gentle 1800R curvature and slim 8mm 
bezel. When placed together, they’re ideal 
for racing simulators or cockpit-views in 
fl ight simulators. To make aligning your 
multi-monitor setup easy, there’s a built-in 
alignment feature which adds guidelines to 
the edges of the display. Just match the lines 
up and you’re perfectly aligned. 
Asus have devised overlays that are 
activated by pressing a dedicated GamePlus 
button on the rear of the PG27VQ. Crosshair 
mode adds a persistent crosshair in the 
middle of the screen for pinpoint accuracy in 
fi rst-person shooters. An on-screen timer lets 
you know how long until the next respawn, or 
simply how long you’ve been playing. 
The PG27VQ supports Nvidia’s G-Sync 
system. If you’re unaware, G-Sync removes 
annoying blur, stuttering and screen tearing 
you experience in games when the frame 
rate of the video doesn’t match the monitor’s 
refresh rate. G-Sync adapts the monitor’s 
refresh rate automatically to match your 
game’s frame rate and the result is buttery 
smooth gaming that looks amazing. The 
PG27VQ not only supports G-Sync, but 
supports it at up to a whopping 165Hz.

080p gaming may be overshadowed by 
4K, but it’s still the sweet spot for gamers 
that prefer smooth motion over high 
resolutions. The Asus ROG Strix XG27VQ 
aims to be one of the smoothest 1080p 
monitors around with support for 144Hz 
refresh rates and AMD’s FreeSync. 
At the centre of the XG27VQ is a 1080p VA 
type panel with a 3000:1 contrast ratio. VA 
panels aren’t as responsive or fast as a TN 
panel, but have deeper blacks and superior 
viewing angles. Proof of this is the 4ms 
response time and 144Hz refresh rate, which 
are excellent, but not the fastest available.
A subtle 1800R curve in the display aids in 
providing an immersive gaming experience. 
For day to day tasks some people aren’t a 
fan of the curve, but for gaming, it’s a nice 
touch, particularly with these large displays. 
The curve really helps bring those far-fl ung 
corners into your central fi eld of view. 
The XG27VQ supports AMD’s FreeSync, 
which prevents annoying blur, stuttering 
and screen tearing in games when the frame 
rate of the video doesn’t match the monitor’s 
refresh rate. FreeSync adapts the monitor’s 
refresh rate on the fl y to match your game’s 
frame rate. The result is buttery smooth 
gaming that looks amazing. The XG27VQ 
FreeSync at refresh rates as low at 48Hz and 
up to 144Hz, over DisplayPort or HDMI.

blue light, which LCDs spew out

blue light also introduced fl ickering 
in the image, which looked awful. 
The XG27VQ manages to fi lter most 
of the blue light out to protect your 
eyes, but also doesn’t fl icker. Win-

n one package, AOC has piled on with just 
about every important recent advance in 
display technology. It’s large, at 31.5-inches 
and with a useful resolution of 2560 x 1440, it’s 
quick, with FreeSync and a 144Hz refresh rate, 
and it’s curved. The AOC AG322QCX is priced 
at $599, which is extremely competitive for a 
gaming screen this size.
The AOC AG322QCX Agon monitor is 
made for gaming, it supports FreeSync, which 
almost everything does today if it hasn’t 
joined the shrinking G-Sync camp. We’re 
this a Team Green monitor you would see 
its price closer to $800. A 4ms response and 
the aforementioned 144Hz refresh almost 
guarantees smooth frames, as long as your 
GPU isn’t overtaxed, and it won’t likely be at 
this resolution. Having such a physically large 
display running at a relatively conservative 
resolution is a great strategy for a gaming 
screen. It will be sharp enough for in-game 
text to look good, and scaled well, while a 
relatively low-tier GPU will power it along 
nicely as long as it isn’t budget.
The fl ipside to this big plus is one very big 
potential negative. Being, that text outside of 
a game looks poor. Covering a very large

they’re not a densely packed as a 
higher res monitor – particularly 
4k – so can look undefi ned in 
some areas, notably curves, which 
can look as jaggy as a game edge 
with antialiasing turned off. It’s 
particularly troubling typing in a 
word processor, and despite some 
improvements seen when tweaking 
Windows’ Cleartype settings 
the end result is that this is not a 
monitor for full time workers.
The VN panel provides good 
contrast (2000:1) while the viewing 
angle stayed true before brightness 
and colours started deteriorating 
past at least 45 degrees off center. 
That means for a relatively bargain 
price three of these in a triple 
setup would offer good peripheral 
viewability along with outstanding 
screen real estate. 
The curve is a gentle 1800R 
which is good for gaming, offering 
an immersive experience (though 
mostly due to its size) without being 
ridiculous. 
It comes with a good set of 
standard features, plus a couple 
of happy surprises. Around the 
back is a fl ip-down headphone 
holder, good job AOC. There’s also 
a detachable cabled control unit for 
adjusting all monitor OSD controls. 
It’s hard to see what this brings 
because the toggle and buttons for 
the OSD on the monitor itself are 
perfectly workable. Similarly, you 
can install a Windows app to make 
those same tweaks via the desktop. 
I liked the built-in break reminder, 
which shuts the monitor screen 
off for a set period for those who 
should be taking better care of their 
eyes. Among the colour pre-sets, 
too, is a low blue-light mode, once 
again great for eye care, especially 
at night.
And, there’s RGB. A fairly tasteful 
illuminated bar runs across the 
bottom of the lower bezel, and 
another four light strips are on the 
back. They can be turned off. It’s 
extras like these that would make 
us wince if this monitor were not so 
cheap. As it is, it has us wondering 
how AOC managed to make this a 
very much non-vanilla product, yet 
at such an attractive price.
The stand is metal, and pivots 
the screen angle, which is rare and 
fantastic, as well as height and 
rotation. Connectivity is reasonable, 
with VGA, HDMI 1.4 HDMI 2.0 
and a pair of DP 1.2 ports. A pair of 
5w speakers are built-in, and even 
though the cost they add is probably 
minimal this is a gaming screen and 
no gamer in their right mind would 
use these speakers. 
With 27-inch monitors only now 
rising to the fore as the preferred 
size for gamers, the 31.5 curved 
144Hz inches on offer here for 
$600 is compelling indeed. It’s 
remarkably good value and a 
thoroughly decent gaming screen, 
but don’t buy one if all you will use 
it for is work, the pixel density is too 
much of an issue for that.

ujitsu is back in the game with the new 
Lifebook U937 13.3-inch ultrabook, after 
years stuck in the wilderness with bland, 
uninspiring business laptops. The Lifebook 
U937 packs unique features in an extremely 
light body that makes Fujitsu’s Lifebook range 
worthy of being on the shortlist for your next 
laptop.
At fi rst glance, the Lifebook U937 looks like 
every other 13.3-inch ultrabook on the market. 
There’s a choice of Intel i7-7600U, i5-7300U or 
i5-7200U CPUs, up to 20GB of DDR4 RAM 
(4GB on-board and a free SO-DIMM slot that’ll 
handle up to 16GB), various capacity M.2 
SATA or PCIe SSDs, an optional LTE modem, 
a 1080p 13.3” IPS panel that’s available with or 
without multi-touch and a 720p webcam.
What makes the Lifebook U937 unique is 
that all that stuff is crammed in a 15.5mm thin 
chassis that weighs only 920 grams. That’s 
right, a 15W TDP CPU and 13.3-inch screen 
in a 920g body. Fujitsu even jammed in a full-
sized Ethernet port! Other 13in ultrabooks 
weigh between 1.1kg to 1.3kg, making the 
Lifebook U937 over 10% lighter than the 
competition.
Fujitsu pulled this off by using a 
magnesium lid and aluminium palm rest, 
both of which cut down on weight, but still 
maintain structural integrity. The Lifebook 
U937 passes the “hold it by the corner and 
swing it around” test with fl ying colours and 
THIS FULL-FEATURED ULTRABOOK IS THE LIGHTEST ON 
THE MARKET AND A RETURN TO FORM FOR FUJITSU

no body fl ex at all. The lid does 
exhibit slight fl exing when opened 
from the corner, but it isn’t severe 
enough to make the Lifebook U937 
feel cheap.
Such thin and light laptops 
usually make sacrifi ces to achieve 
the weight loss, but amazingly, 
Fujitsu hasn’t cut any corners with 
the Lifebook U937. The spill-resistant 
chicklet keyboard is a pleasure 
to use despite no backlighting. 
The trackpad, whilst not up to 
Apple’s lofty standards, is perfectly 
adequate. The display is a high 
quality Sharp IGZO IPS panel, not 
the traditional TN-type panels used 
to save weight. Not even battery life 
is compromised, with the Lifebook 
U937 holding a charge longer than 
many heavier ultrabooks in our 
battery benchmark.
You’re probably also wondering 
how Fujitsu managed to get an 
Ethernet port in a chassis on 15.5mm 
thick. Thanks to a nifty piece of 
engineering, the Ethernet port slides 
out, almost like an SD card, then 
is pushed open to reveal a full-
sized RJ45 socket you can insert an 
Ethernet cable into. As ingenious 
as it is, it does feel like it’ll break as 
soon as someone trips or pulls on 
any connected cable.
It’s a little disappointing to see 
the Lifebook U937 with a 7th-
generation CPU when most other 
manufacturers have laptops with 
8th-generation CPUs on the market 
now. Giving the Lifebook U937 four 
cores and even better battery life 
would have put it at the top of the 
ultrabook heap and possibly, made it 
the best ultrabook ever.
The other disappointment is 
PalmSecure, an optional sensor 
near the trackpad that scans veins 
in the palm of your hand to log 
in to Windows or boot the laptop. 
In theory, it’s a cool feature. Wave 
your hand over the sensor and 
you’re logged in. But in practice, it’s 
a disaster. Registering a palm took 
over 15 minutes of getting a palm 
hovering in just the right spot for the 
sensor to detect the veins. Detecting 
is faster, but still fraught with errors 
and incredibly frustrating compared 
to the increasingly common 
Windows Hello sensors on other 
ultrabooks.
Fujitsu has done an excellent 
job with the Lifebook U937. It’s the 
lightest ultrabook on the market by 
a decent margin and doesn’t skimp 
on anything to get there. If Fujitsu 
replace PalmSecure with a depth 
sensor for Windows Hello and 
upgrade the Lifebook U937 with 
Intel’s latest 8th-generation CPUs, it 
would be the best ultrabook on the 
market without a doubt. Despite 
those minor issues, the Lifebook 
U937 is a brilliant unit if you want 
the lightest full featured laptop 
around.

RAID-1 (mirror, for data security) or JBOD (for 
capacity). The main difference between the 
DS218play and the DS216play it replaces, is a 
major CPU upgrade. The DS218play is now 
packing a 64-bit, 1.4 GHz quad-core Realtek 
RTD1296 CPU, a massive upgrade from the 32-
bit dual STM STiH412 in the DS216play.
This CPU upgrade not only results in 
improved performance for running apps and 
copying fi les, but it also means this relatively 
cheap NAS gets hardware transcoding 
support for 30fps, 10-bit H.265 (HEVC) videos 
at 4K resolution when using the Synology 
DS video app on iOS and Android. It’s still a 
shame Synology hasn’t managed to get Plex to 
support their hardware transcoding platform, 
but nobody’s perfect, not even Synology. 
The new CPU also allows faster fi le 
transfers to encrypted volumes 
thanks to a built-in hardware 
encryption engine. With encryption 
turned on, performance was 
identical over gigabit Ethernet as 
it is without. In either case with 
WD Red NAS HDDs installed, 
the gigabit Ethernet link was fully 
saturated. It’s great to see that 
there’s no penalty for extra security, 
even on consumer focussed NAS 
units like the DS218play. 
To keep the price low on the 
DS218play, Synology hasn’t added 
drive doors to install disks. The 
entire enclosure needs to be

removed and the drives placed 
inside. For most people this isn’t a 
big deal, as drives are unlikely to be 
swapped around often enough to 
justify the cost. A large 92mm fan at 
the rear keeps the drives cool with a 
gentle whisper.
Setting up the DS218play is a 
piece of cake. Plug the NAS in to 
your network, power it up, visit 
http://fi nd.synology.com and 
the DiskStation Manager wizard 
appears to guide you through the 
setup process. As you’d expect, the 
DS218play runs the latest version of 
DiskStation Manager (DSM), which 
brings with it all the basic features 
such as Video, Photo and Audio 
Station apps and Cloud Station 
Backup so all your computers are 
kept backed up to the NAS. More 
advanced features like Synology’s 
security camera, chat, 
notes, mail and VPN 
servers are supported 
on the DS218play too, as 
is remote access to your 
data over the Internet via 
Synology QuickConnect.
Due to the DS218play 
being an ARM based 
unit, not Intel based, the 
number of apps it can run 
is limited. For example, 
there’s no Docker support 
on ARM, which is how 
most 3rd party apps for 
Synology devices are 
distributed now. There’s also no 
support for BTRFS, a new, modern 
fi lesystem with advanced snapshot 
features that DSM supports on Intel-
based models only. For most people 
who simply want a safe place to 
store fi les and run a few basic apps, 
an Intel or ARM CPU doesn’t matter. 
But if you have a app in mind to 
run on your NAS (e.g: Plex), double 
check if the DS218play supports it, 
you could come up short.
At $379, the DS218play competes 
closely with the QNAP TS-231P2 
and the Asustor AS3102T. All three 
are solid units, but Synology’s 
excellent and constantly updated 
DSM software, combined with the 
large 3rd party app library push 
it over the line. However, while 
the DS218play is great, it’s diffi cult 
to justify when the superior, Intel 
based Synology DS218+ is only $100 
more but has a faster CPU, has a 
larger selection 3rd party apps and 
an extra 1GB of memory. Unless 
you really need the HEVC 4K 
transcoding on the DS218play, get 
the DS218+ instead.

he audience for network attached 
storage used to just be power users, 
but now, basically anyone with a 
smartphone would fi nd it useful to store their 
precious movies and photos on. That user is 
who Western Digital has in mind with their 
latest My Cloud Home NAS.
Unlike most NAS units, the My Cloud Home 
is designed to be purely managed via the cloud 
instead of logging in to an administration 
interface locally via a web browser. More 
advanced users and tinkerers might fi nd 
this limiting, but everyone else will fi nd it 
refreshingly easy to use.
To set the My Cloud Home up, hook it up 
to an Ethernet port and some electricity. Wait 
for it to power up, head on over to mycloud.
com/hello on whatever device you like, WD’s 
servers will fi nd your new device and you’ll be 
asked to make a WD My Cloud account.  Wait 
another minute or two and you’re done. The

across. Setup couldn’t get any easier.
The My Cloud Home can be setup,

desktop computer (increasingly 
common lately) but wants to store 
data on a NAS, that’s perfectly fi ne 
with the My Cloud Home. Not many 
NAS units on the market can be fully 
confi gured from a smartphone or 
tablet app only and WD should be 
congratulated for doing so.
Inside the My Cloud Home is 
either one or two WD hard drives, 
the latter of which can be set to 
operate in RAID-1 mode to protect 
against drive failure. Over gigabit 
Ethernet, copying a 15GB video fi le 
chugged along at 55MB/sec and 
88MB/sec reading the fi le back. Not 
that impressive, but performance 
isn’t why you buy this unit. It’s all 
about ease of use.
On a desktop, the WD Discovery 
app does all the work of making the 
drive appear as just another folder on 
your computer. Anything stored in 
the “My Cloud Home” folder is kept 
on the My Cloud Home. You can’t 
create multiple shares or change 
the name. There’s just one folder, 
chuck your data there, end of story. 
In the My Cloud mobile app you 
can view all the fi les to any app on 
your mobile device and vice-versa, 
creating a nifty bridge between your 
desktop and mobile devices. The app 
can automatically transfer photos or 
videos on your smartphone or tablet 
to your My Cloud Home, creating a 
backup of that precious data with no 
user intervention. 
The My Cloud app has 
Chromecast and AirPlay support, 
making it easy to view videos from 
the NAS on a TV. There’s even a one 
click install for Plex and hardware 
remux (audio transcoding only) 
support, making it one of the easiest 
to install Plex Server devices around.
A fascinating feature on the My 
Cloud Home is support for If This 
Then That (IFTTT), connecting 
your My Cloud Home to a plethora 
of different Internet services. For 
example, you can create an applet 
on IFTTT so whenever you post 
a picture to Instagram, it’s also 
uploaded to your My Cloud Home. 
Tagged in a photo on Facebook? 
IFTTT can send it to your My Cloud

Gmail that has an attachment? That 
attachment can be sent to your My 
Cloud Home too. Basically, anything 
on the Internet that involves a fi le, 
IFTTT can intercept it and send it to 
your My Cloud Home.
Synology or QNAP have more 
advanced devices with loads more 
features, there’s no doubt. But the 
approach Western Digital have 
taken with making the smartphone 
and tablet an equal with the 
desktop refl ects the mainstream 
of computing in 2017. The My

T 
he iPhone X is one of the most talked 
about phones in years and, for once, it 
isn’t because it’s simply the latest Apple 
handset. It’s because it heralds numerous 
fi rsts: the fi rst time Apple has used OLED 
technology for its phone screens; the fi rst 
time it has removed the home button, after a 
decade; the fi rst time the fi rm has used facial 
recognition as a means of authentication.
Perhaps most controversially, though, the 
iPhone X represents the fi rst time Apple – or 
any mainstream phone maker – has hit the 
$1,500 mark for a base-model phone. The 
question is, who’s going to spend 
this much money when they could 
buy an iPhone 8 for $500 less?
SPECIAL SCREEN
The answer, as we’ve already seen, 
is hordes of people. And surely 
the biggest reason is that display: 
stretching from side to side, top 
to bottom, it really does look 
spectacular. In part that’s due to the 
OLED technology, which makes 
colours pop, and with a resolution 
of 2,046 x 1,125 it delivers a pixel 
density of 458ppi. It’s the best iPhone 
display ever made.
Unlike the Google Pixel 2 XL, 
there are no problems with viewing 
angles and odd-looking colours. 
Contrast, as you’d expect from an 
OLED display, is essentially perfect, 
and colour accuracy is spot on. 
As with all current generation 
iPhones, the screen has adaptive 
colour profi ling. That means 
that when in the browser, where 
most graphics and professionally 
produced photographic material is 
targeted at the sRGB colour space, it 
tweaks onscreen colours to match. 
During video playback, the phone 
will automatically switch to the 
wider DCI-P3 colour space.
I measured the average colour 
difference (Delta E) in the browser 
at 1.04 across all our tests. That’s 
astonishing accuracy in a phone, 
especially one with an OLED 
display. It supports both HDR10 
and Dolby Vision as well as Apple’s 
ambient light-matching tech, True 
Tone, and Apple adds the shiny 
cherry on top with a stunning peak 
brightness of 501cd/m2. 
BLACK AND WHITE 
The iPhone X is available in two 
colours: white, with a chrome silver 
trim; and black, with a shiny dark 
grey trim. Neither, to my eyes, look 
as good as a $1,500 smartphone 
ought to. Next to the “mocha 
brown” Mate 10 Pro I’ve been using 
for the past couple of weeks, it’s 
positively dour. The trim on my 
white review model starts picking 
up greasy fi ngerprints the moment 
I pick it up, quickly losing its box-
fresh lustre, as does the rather plain 
white rear.
There’s no surprise about the 
positioning of the phone’s various 
physical elements. Aside from the 
lack of a home button and the power 
button, which has moved around 
to the right edge, they’re all in the 
places you’d expect. Other things 
from previous generations remain in 
place, with dust and waterproofi ng 
to the IP68 standard and no 3.5mm 
headphone jack. The removal of 
which, I still believe, was a mis-step.
Likewise, I’m not convinced by 
the camera module on the rear. It’s 
large, unsightly and juts out around 
a millimetre. This unbalances the 
phone when it’s placed on a fl at 
surface, so it rattles whenever you 
swipe or tap. 
The infamous “notch” on 
the front, which so many have 
scoffed at, doesn’t bother me at 
all. If anything, it lends the phone 
character – an identifi able X factor 
if you like – that makes it look 
different to other current fl agships. 
Lord knows it needs something to 
help it stand out.
The positives are the same as they 
are with every other 18:9 aspect 
ratio, low-bezel phone I’ve used: it 
has an incredibly high screen-to-
body ratio, which essentially means 
more screen real-estate for a smaller 
size of phone. So, while the 5.8in 
screen is larger than any previous 
iPhone’s, it’s considerably smaller 
and lighter than the 5.5in design 
Apple has been using for the past 
three years. And those trademark 
rounded corners and edges mean 
the iPhone X is just as comfortable to 
hold and slide into a tight pocket.
FACE THE FUTURE
The consequence of fi lling almost 
the entire front of the iPhone X with 
screen is that there’s no longer any 
room for a home button on the front 
nor, controversially, a fi ngerprint 
reader. Instead, Apple is moving to 
a new biometric approach, with Face 
ID the primary means of unlocking 
the phone and using Apple Pay. 
Face ID works by using the 
phone’s “True Depth” camera to 
project infrared dots onto your face 
– 30,000 of them – and producing 
a 3D model of your face that it 
stores internally, alongside a two-
dimensional infrared image. It 
then uses the same sensor to scan

your face, match it against 
the stored model and 
unlock your phone – 
all in a fraction of a 
second. Apple claims 
the likelihood of 
someone who isn’t 
you unlocking your 
phone is one in a 
million, making it more 
secure than Touch ID. 
Aside from being fooled 
by identical twins, and one 
isolated case where a ten-year-
old boy unlocked his mother’s phone, 
those boasts have so far proved to be true. 
So what’s it like to use? Despite my initial 
scepticism, I must admit to being impressed. 
Setting it up is as simple as enrolling a 
fi ngerprint on an iPhone 8 Plus: simply line 
up your face in the provided circular loupe 
and move it around so the sensor can build 
up a full model of the planes and contours 
of your mug. Do this a couple of times and 
you’re ready to go.
Unlocking with Face ID works pretty much 
perfectly, both for those with glasses and 
without. I’ve yet to have a failure, and you 
don’t have to look straight at the phone either. 
Even with the phone placed to the left of my 
keyboard I only have to press 
the side button or double-
tap the screen and it sees 
my face and unlocks.
I do have a couple 
of small complaints. 
First, unlocking for use 
at contactless payment 
terminals isn’t as 
convenient as before. You’re 
now forced to double-tap 
the side button and then 
raise the phone so it can get 
a good look at you before 
tapping on the reader. 
Before, all you needed 
to do was double-tap the 
home button and leave 
your thumb there so the 
phone could recognise your 
fi ngerprint.
Second, I’m still coming 
to terms with the fact that, 
even after Face ID has 
used my face to unlock the 
iPhone X, I have to swipe up to 
get to the home screen. Three steps where 
you used to simply press and hold. Apple 
must learn from 
OnePlus with 
the 5T.
Still, at 
least Face ID 
works more 
reliably than 
Samsung’s iris 
recognition, which 
doesn’t function at all 
if you’re wearing glasses. 
And it’s good to know that 
Apple provides protection against 
accidental unlocking – while you’re 
sleeping for instance – through a 
system it calls Attention-Aware, 
which checks that you’re awake and 
alert before unlocking the phone.
Delve into the settings, and you’ll 
also fi nd that the same system 
can be used to prevent the phone 
dimming the display or lowering 
the volume of alerts if it detects your 
face is in the vicinity and your eyes 
are open.
You can also 
use the Face 
ID camera to 
track your facial 
movements and 
map them onto 
an “Animoji”, 
and this is great 
fun. What isn’t 
quite so fun is 
the repositioning 
of the Control 
Centre. For, 
in addition to 
removing the 
home button, the 
action for calling 
up the place 
where you can 
quickly update 
settings such as 
screen brightness, 
Flight mode 
and volume has 
moved: you now 
have to drag your thumb down from 
the top right corner. I don’t like it.
QUICK, QUICK, SLOW
Performance, as is always the 
case with the latest iPhones, is 
superlative. The new Apple A11 
Bionic chip is inside, coupled with 
3GB of RAM, and it produced very 
similar benchmark results to the 
iPhone 8 Plus. It’s basically faster 
than any other phone on the market 
in terms of its CPU and graphics 
processing grunt.
In really demanding games I’d 
expect the iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 
8 to marginally outperform it, but in 
most cases the limiting factor will be 
the screen’s 60Hz refresh rate rather 
than the graphics chip inside.
Finally, to battery life. First signs 
weren’t great: it lasted a mere 9hrs 
22mins in our video-rundown 
test, falling well short of the 13hrs 
54mins mark set by the iPhone 8 
Plus (and short of Apple’s 13-hour 
claims too). In general use, however, 
you can expect the same kind of life 
as the rest of Apple’s phones. By the 
end of the day, you’ll be reaching for 
a charger.
Note that it can reach a 50% 
charge within 30 minutes when 
powered by the supplied USB-C 
power adapter, and naturally 
supports Qi wireless chargers too.
SNAPPY PICTURES
The camera is great, and for all 
the same reasons as the iPhone 
8 Plus: two cameras on the rear, 
both with 12 megapixels and using 
Sony sensors. One is a wide-angle 
camera, the other a telephoto. The 
key difference between the iPhone 
X and the 8 Plus is that the telephoto 
camera has a slightly wider aperture 
at f/2.4. It’s optically stabilised, too, 
just like the main f/1.8 camera.
In theory, this means telephoto 
shots in low light should look 
cleaner and less noisy in poor 
light than with the iPhone 8 Plus. 
A quick glance at the EXIF data, 
though, shows that, as soon as the 
light drops, the iPhone X’s camera 
software simply uses a crop of a 
shot from the main camera. It’s 
effectively digital zoom and it hits 
quality. Badly.
The other camera is essentially

LET’S TALK PRICE
The iPhone X is a striking phone. 
Not just in terms of looks, but 
also through its innovative and 
effective means of accurately 
recognising faces and unlocking 
the phone. It’s also supremely quick, 
has a brilliantly colour-accurate 
display and the camera is sublime. 
Unfortunately, it’s the price that 
takes all the headlines.
With prices famously starting 
at $1,579 for the 64GB version, and 
jumping to a frankly lunatic $1,829 
for the top-spec 256GB offering, 
Apple’s top-end smartphone is 
simply too expensive.
I realise other manufacturers 
have been moving their prices 
steadily north in recent times. None, 
however, have taken things this far. 
The question is, does the reality of 
the iPhone X justify the premium 
charged over the Samsung Galaxy 
Note 8? Or, more realistically, the 
Galaxy S8?
The answer to that question is 
no. The iPhone X is many things: 
it’s Apple’s best ever phone, it has 
an unbelievably good display, but 
there’s no way I could recommend 
it when there’s a phone that’s just as 
good, if not better in some ways, and 
will cost you barely half as much. 
Perhaps the iPhone X’s strongest 
competition, however, is that which 
comes from within. The iPhone 
8 Plus, although bulky for a 5.5in 
phone, is still brilliant and starts at 
$1,229. The only practical thing it 
lacks compared with the iPhone X is 
Face ID – and I can live without that.

ost printers are bundled with tiny 
cartridges containing a smudge 
of ink, forcing you to buy a full 
expensive cartridge that’s worth more than the 
printer you just purchased. Epson has heard 
our collective frustration with that business 
model and come up with the EcoTank concept 
for their latest range of ink-jet printers that 
includes 2-years’ worth of ink in the box.
With the “Expression ET-3700 EcoTank 
All-in-One Supertank Printer”, Epson ditched 
cartridges and simply includes a few bottles 
of ink. Included with the ET-3700 is enough 
ink to print 11,200 colour pages. To compare, 
Epson’s high capacity ink cartridges yield 
approximately 1,100 colour pages. The 
EcoTank printers can do ten times as many 
pages before needing a refi ll. 
The ink reservoirs and bottles are keyed 
do you can’t accidentally pour the wrong ink 
in the wrong tank and the bottles have a one-
way valve so you don’t spill any precious ink.
High volume users will save heaps of 
money as the ink bottles are much cheaper 
than traditional cartridges. A set of Epson 
254XL & 252XL ink cartridges that yield 
approximately 1,100 pages sell for $184. A 
set of T502 bottles is only $75 and yields 
approximately 6,000 pages. The savings 
are obvious compared to other inkjets, but 
surprisingly, Epson’s EcoTank system is 
even cheaper to operate per page than a 
monochrome laser printer in the same price

scans at 1200 x 2400 DPI and can be 
controlled via the 2.in touch screen 
on the front, the included Epson 
software on a desktop, or direct 
to a tablet or smartphone with the 
Epson iPrint app where you can 
then save the image on your device. 
As more people move away from 
desktop computers, being able to do 
all this from a smartphone or tablet 
app is super handy. The ET-3700 
also supports Apple AirPrint and 
Google’s Cloud Print, so you can 
print from any app on your device 
without any extra software. 
The Epson ET-3700 is $549, has 
an automatic duplexer, Wi-Fi and 
Ethernet, a fl atbed scanner and 
comes with enough ink to print 
11,200 colour pages. A similar colour 
laser printer like the Brother DCP-
9015CDW is $349 but only comes 
with a 1,000-page yield set of toner 
cartridges. To get an extra 10,000 
pages worth of toner from the DCP-
9015CDW, you would need to spend 
over $2,200 on fi ve sets of high 
capacity toner. Even when compared 
to the cheapest non-genuine toner 
off eBay, the Epson EcoTank bottles 
still work out cheaper.
Simply on that fact alone, the 
ET-3700 is great buy, but when 
you add in no drum replacement, 
superior colour prints and arguably 
better black prints, a faster fi rst 
print time, borderless printing and 
lower electricity consumption and 
24-month warranty, it’s diffi cult not 
to recommend an EcoTank printer 
over a laser unit, particularly if 
you’re a high-volume user.

ightroom CC might prove to be the 
straw that broke the camel’s back. 
Having shoved its reluctant Creative 
Suite customers onto a monthly subscription 
plan, Adobe is now trying to do the same 
to photographers – by taking their photo 
collections hostage. 
Lightroom is practically a staple amongst 
photography enthusiasts and professionals, 
despite Adobe allowing the application to 
stagnate over the past few years. Meaningful 
updates have been rare and performance has 
grown stodgy. Now we know why: Adobe has 
been working on a new app.
Lightroom CC is effectively a cloud version 
of Lightroom – with the desktop original now 
ominously rebranded Lightroom Classic CC. 
It’s more akin to the mobile/tablet apps that 
have been on iOS and Android for some time 
than the full-blown desktop app, and that’s 
refl ected it in its trimmed-back feature set. 
The key difference is Lightroom CC 
wants nothing to do with your local photo 
collection. You can import an old-school 
Lightroom catalogue into Lightroom CC, but 
those photos will be sucked up to Adobe’s 
cloud. Depending on the plan you choose, 
Adobe is offering photographers up to 
1TB of cloud storage, an indication that it 
wants you to smash all your photos onto its 
servers – although even 1TB will likely prove 
insuffi cient for most photographers. 
If you’ve carefully curated a library of 
presets over the years, you’ll have to manually 
copy those over to Lightroom CC too. Nothing 
is imported automatically – all you get is the 
A THINLY VEILED ATTEMPT TO TURN PHOTOGRAPHERS INTO 
MONTHLY SUBSCRIBERS, BUT IT’S TOO LIGHTWEIGHT
ADOBE LIGHTROOM CC
KEY SPECS

pared-back selection of presets that 
comes with Lightroom CC. 
Lightroom CC’s editing tools 
aren’t a patch on those in Classic, 
either. Advanced controls such as 
split toning have gone AWOL. The 
handy histogram revealing where 
highlights and shadows have been 
clipped is gone. Adjustment brush 
presets such us dodge, burn, soften 
skin and teeth whitening are no 
more – you’re merely left to adjust 
the various exposure, highlights, 
whites and blacks sliders manually. 
And once you’ve fi nished editing a 
photo and want to “export” it, well… 
your options are save it to JPG in 
one of three preset sizes. Nothing 
like the vast array of export options 
you get with Classic.
To be fair to Adobe, this isn’t 
an either/or scenario. You can use 
Lightroom Classic in conjunction 
with the new CC app and get the 
best of both worlds. You can sync a 
Classic Collection with “Lightroom 
Mobile” and have those photos 
available to edit in CC, be that on 
the desktop, mobile or tablets. You 
could twiddle with photos on your 
smartphone in between shoots, for 
example, and have them synced 
and waiting for you when you get 
home to your PC. That said, I did 
encounter one or two delayed syncs 
when I tweaked a photo in CC and 
then opened Classic, which doesn’t 
bode well. 
There is one very good feature 
that is unique to Lightroom CC: 
search. Enter a term such as “dog”, 
“car”, “red” or “boy” and Lightroom 
CC does a pretty impressive job of 
sorting through your collection, 
without any need to tag the photos 
with those particular attributes fi rst. 
If you were hunting through your 
collection to fi nd a specifi c photo 
for a client, that could prove to be a 
belter of a feature. 
So what’s the game plan? Much as 
Adobe protests it has no plans to do 
away with Lightroom Classic, I don’t 
believe it. The “Classic” designation 
is not the kind of label you put on a 
product with a long-term future. 
In the meantime, photographers 
have four options. There are now 
two versions of the Photography 
pack. The Lightroom CC plan 
includes only that app with 1TB 
of cloud storage. The revamped 
Photography plan includes CC, 
Classic and Photoshop, but only 
20GB of cloud storage. Or $14.29 per 
month buys all the apps and 1TB of 
storage. Full $72.59 Creative Cloud 
subscribers also get all the apps, but 
only receive 100GB of storage – a 
needless kick in the teeth. 
Can I see myself moving to 
Lightroom CC only? Not a chance. 
Uploading batches of hundreds of 
RAW fi les to the cloud is painful, 
the editing tools are too basic, and 
I want my photo collection where 
I can physically touch it. Will 
Adobe deprive me of that choice 
eventually? I’d bet on it.

A 
side from the monthly sucking of 
funds from your account, there’s 
one problem with subscription-only 
software such as Adobe Premiere Pro CC: 
it’s easy to miss when a signifi cant new 
version arrives. Don’t make that mistake 
with this latest incarnation, because it’s a 
belter: along with usability and collaboration 
improvements, there’s also much better 
support for 360-degree video.
Let’s start with the usability and 
collaboration improvements. At long last 
you can now open more than one project 
simultaneously. Before, if you wanted to reuse 
assets created in one project within a new 
one, you would need to import the old project. 
This could get messy. Now just open both 
projects, then copy and paste between them. 
You can grab elements from the timeline of 
one sequence, and when you paste them into 
a sequence in another project, their related fi le 
references come with them. 
Vaguely related is the new Shared Projects 
facility. Premiere Pro CC has had a team 
project capability via Creative Cloud storage 
for a while, but Shared Projects are designed 
for collaboration using communal storage on 
a local network. A user can now lock a project 
that has been loaded from a central storage 
repository, say a NAS or SAN, so that other 
workstations can only open it in read-only 
mode. Once Project Locking has been enabled 
in the Premiere Pro Preferences, you give your 
workstation a username in the same dialog. 
Then you create Shared Projects, and can use 
a little padlock icon in the bottom left-hand 
corner to toggle read-write mode or release a 
project for others to work on. 
The other signifi cant area of improvement 
is for creating 360-degree VR content, which 
Adobe is labelling Immersive Video. There’s 
now a selection of 360-aware effects and 
A MAJOR UPDATE: NOT ONLY USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS BUT A 
USEFUL SELECTION OF VR EFFECTS AND TRANSITIONS TOO
ADOBE PREMIERE 
PRO CC 2018
transitions that derive from Adobe’s 
acquisition of the Mettle SkyBox 
Suite. Although you could apply 
2D effects already, these introduce 
unwanted artefacts along stitching 
lines. The new effects are seamless, 
and include blur, chromatic 
aberrations, color gradients, de-
noise, digital glitch, fractal noise, 
glow, plane to sphere, projection, 
rotate sphere and sharpen. 
The plane to sphere effect is 
particularly useful; without this, 
when you import a 2D image it will 
automatically look curved. Apply 
the VR plane to sphere, and the 
image will instead appear like a 2D 
placard within 360-degree space, 
with tools to adjust how far away it 
looks and orientation. Even better, 
all these effects are GPU-accelerated, 
so they gain a performance 
advantage from your graphics 
hardware.
The VR rotate sphere effect 
lets you correct orientation issues 
with your 3D sphere, and you can 
add keyframes to animate the 
default view direction within the 
360-degree space. The VR Projection 
tool is also handy, because it makes 
it easy to use footage shot on 
different 360 cameras on the same 
timeline.
The remaining effects are 
essentially 360-aware versions of 
their 2D counterparts. Immersive 
transitions include chroma leaks, 
gradient wipe, iris wipe, light leaks, 
light rays, Mobius zoom, random 
blocks and spherical blur. All eight 
use the 360-degree space in an 
interesting way to move between 
clips, and are a welcome addition 
because most 2D transitions 
introduce unwanted visual artefacts. 
Premiere Pro itself also now works 
in VR, so you can edit while wearing 
a VR viewing device such as the 
Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.
There are a couple of other 
signifi cant new features. The 
Essential Graphics Panel, introduced 
with Premiere Pro CC 2017 to 
replace the legacy titler, has 
been improved by the addition 
of Responsive Design. The Time 
element lets you pin a range of 
intro and outro keyframes at the 
beginning and end of a motion 
graphics clip, which are preserved 
when you make ripple edits. This 
also includes a rolling credits 
feature. The Position element lets 
you pin a graphics layer to another 
layer or the video frame itself. The 
graphics layer will then respond to 
changes to the pinned layer or video 
frame, so when these are added to 
a sequence with a different aspect 
ratio they will maintain relative 
position.
There are sundry smaller 
improvements, including the 
ability to preview fonts and edit 
motion graphics templates created 
in After Effects. There are also 
eight new label colours to aid clip 
organisation. But the ability to load 
multiple projects, shared project 
controls and extended VR support 
are the killer new features. Premiere 
Pro CC 2018 is both easier to use and 
now a serious contender for creating 
360 content.

ivilization VI has already been out for 
over twelve months, but developer 
Firaxis is planning for its future three, 
four, five years from today. This shouldn’t be 
a surprise. Its predecessor, Civ V, released in 
2010 but didn’t really come into its own until 
its second expansion, Brave New World, three 
years later.
Out of the gate, Civ V was mostly 
praised for the way it broke with tradition, 
introducing a hex-based map and a one-unit-
per-tile mechanic. But it took several years 
and two major add-ons to deliver religion, 
espionage and a satisfying cultural game, all 
crucial pillars of the series.
By contrast, “vanilla” Civ VI feels more 
feature complete than Civ V did; it already has 
solid religious, espionage and cultural options 
for those players who find war distasteful or 
have no desire to establish a colony on Mars. 
With this head start in mind I asked Civ VI 
lead designer Ed Beach if Firaxis are thinking 
about Civ VI and its post-release support in 
terms of a similar time scale to Civ V? “Yes, 
DAVID WILDGOOSE CHATS TO A CIV LEAD DESIGNER ED BEACH 
ABOUT WHERE THE GAME – AND THE FRANCHISE – IS GOING
we are,” he says. “The Civ V support 
model was obviously a big success 
for us.”
And given Civ VI is more feature 
complete, where does that leave you 
in terms of thinking about future 
content for Civ VI? “This is probably 
the one thing I’m most excited about. 
We have the opportunity to strike 
out in entirely new directions for the 
series now.”
THE GAME THAT  
NEVER ENDS
Beach won’t go into specifics 
regarding these new directions, so I 
suggest one area they could address 
is the tendency for player interest 
to trail off in the late-game. Players, 
Beach agrees, start a lot of games, 
yet finish few of them. “Improving 
on this trend would make our 
games even stronger,” he says. 
“The world is so dynamic when 
it’s being settled in the early stages. 
We need that unpredictability to 
penetrate deeper into the game 
session. “Anything we can do to 
introduce factors that cause empires 
to crumble, wars to break out, major 
coalitions to form – generally just 
increasing the level of mayhem in 
the world – those will all help retain 
players’ interest.”
THE POWER OF FAITH
It still feels like early days for Civ 
VI. According to Steam stats, it tends 
to hover around the lower reaches 
of the top 20 most played games 
while Civ V, with its seven-year-
old userbase, is regularly in the 
top 10. While we wait for the “new 
directions” of Civ VI’s first major 
expansion, Firaxis has maintained 
interest through the addition of DLC 
packs containing new civs, leaders 
and scenarios, and a series of free 
seasonal updates that have fixed 
bugs and tinkered with features in 
often major ways. The recent “Fall” 
update, for example, overhauled 
religious play to a significant extent, 
fundamentally altering the way 
religious units move and interact, 
tweaking how religion spreads 
across the world, adding a handful 
of powerful beliefs, and redesigning 
the “lens” that lets you see at a 
glance the current religious state of 
play.
Beach describes the religion 
game as now more of a positional 
battle for control of key cities that 
block other religion and help your 
own faith to spread. “Although the 
initial religious lens presented a 
lot of the necessary data, it wasn’t 
as useful as we had originally 
hoped,” he says. “So we reworked 
that to make all the key factors 
clearly discernible. In addition we 
moved the religion units onto their 
own map layer so these battles [or, 
as they’re euphemistically tagged 
in-game, “theological debates”] 
didn’t interfere with the armies and 
builders crisscrossing the map.
RACE WARS
It’s a huge change. That missionaries 
and apostles exert zone of control 
and gain flanking bonuses opens up 
so many more tactical options for 
spreading and containing faith, and

GAMES INTERVIEW
the new guru unit means you can 
keep your preachers healed on the 
frontlines. Alongside the religious 
overhaul, Firaxis has also recently 
released two religious focused civs 
as DLC - Indonesia under Gitarja 
and the Khmer under Jayavarman 
VII. Beach tells me that diversity 
plays a huge role in determining 
which civs and leaders make it into 
the base game and in DLC. “We 
have a whole list of criteria we are 
trying to satisfy, mostly to come up 
with the most diverse set possible,” 
he says. “Those diversity factors 
include geography, historical era, 
gender, and cultural grouping. And 
then we also want to make sure 
we get a set that covers all of the 
gameplay systems.”
Religion was undervalued 
previously, at least in the sense that 
it wasn’t especially useful to invest 
in faith if you weren’t specfically 
aiming for a religious victory. 
But both the newest DLC civs, in 
hand with the gameplay changes 
to religion, give new reasons to 
accumulate faith. “We have a 
whole list of criteria we are trying 
to satisfy, mostly to come up with 
the most diverse set possible...” The 
Khmer, for instance, gain food and 
housing from holy sites constructed 
on rivers, and their martyr ability 
means they’re encouraged to send 
their missionaries off into foreign 
lands and get into fights with enemy 
apostles. If a Khmer missionary dies 
in theological debate, they earn a 
valuable relic that draws culture and 
tourism to their temples.
Conversely, Indonesia 
demonstrates how faith can work 
for you even if you don’t actually 
found your own religion. They 
gain faith from coastal cities and 
can then spend that faith on the 
Jong, a powerful naval unit that, 
in my experience, absolutely 
wrecks enemy cities all through the 
Renaissance Era.
LEADERS RULE
In a further nod to using DLC to 
cover all gameplay systems, the 
Khmer get a much-needed buff 
to the aqueduct, perhaps the most 
undernourished of districts in 
the base game, while Indonesia’s 
Kampung improvement buffs sea 
tiles and actually makes it desirable 
to settle small islands. While Trajan 
(Rome) and Frederik (Germany) are 
the most popular leaders in Civ VI, 
Beach is a fan of leaders who tend 
to be overlooked by the community. 
He often plays as Harald (Norway) 
or Philip (Spain) because he likes 
exploring and navigating on the 
high seas, but his favourites are a 
couple of leaders who are the most 
misunderstood.
“I think my favourite is Catherine 
de Medici because I’ve personally 
invested a lot of time in our 
espionage system,” he says. “But the 
one with the cool strategy that gets 
overlooked is Saladin. 
“He’s probably the strongest 
science leader in the game right 
now, though many people write 
him off as just a religious leader. If 
he can spread a religion across the 
map it just further boosts his science 
output. And the Mamluk unique 
unit that heals every turn is great for making 
sure Arabia gets a larger empire established by 
the mid-game.”
I have one more question to ask Beach, and 
it’s one that’s been bugging me for the past 
twelve months. Why, oh why, I ask, does the 
AI build Huey Teocalli on a single-tile lake or 
Petra on a city’s only desert tile? I mean, I’m 
glad they wasted all those resources in doing 
so, but it’s infuriating when I have my eye on 
those wonders for myself. Beach summons all 
of Catherine’s diplomatic expertise to answer. 
“That’s not always a crazy move with Huey 
Teocalli since it does help all of your other 
lakes in your empire. But yes that can be 
annoying with Petra, although denying it to 
other players is potentially smart, too.
“That said, I think we should tune the AI to 
be less likely to go for either of these builds. 
This is exactly the type of feedback we like 
to hear as we continue to look at the AI and 
further refine its play.”
Thanks, Ed, that’s exactly what I wanted to 
hear. Here’s to the next three, four, five or more 
years of Civ VI.

bviously, Nintendo did have the 
smoothest development process for 
the Switch. Zelda: Breath of the Wild 
was originally a Wii U game and suddenly 
had to be ported to Switch to the killer-app 
launch title. And as an open-world game 
it’s great, but could it bring in that hipster 
audience Nintendo seemed so desperate to 
attract?
Skyrim seems a better bet. The game was 
fi rst released in 2011, sure, but the market 
has shown a tolerance for endless special 
editions because Skyrim, more than any 
other fantasy RPG, is played by people who 
traditionally would not have considered 
spending 247 hours 52 minutes (the average 
playthrough time) slumped in front of a PC, 
to be something they might like to do.
The advantage Skyrim gives is that it’s 
an incredibly deep and content rich RPG, 
packed with hundreds of hours of gameplay, 
and Nintendo doesn’t have to wait fi ve years 
for Bethesda to make it.
“I COULD BE BOUNDED IN A NUTSHELL, AND COUNT MYSELF A 
KING OF INFINITE SPACE...” - HAMLET ACT 2: SCENE 2
Sure, hundreds of thousands 
of people have already played it 
to death. But plenty of those will 
grab it again without hesitation, 
because it’s Skyrim. For the rest 
of us, especially us PC gamers 
who never quite found the time 
to sit down for 247 hours, an RPG 
with this kind of depth and scope, 
running on a handheld device, is a 
revelation.
In fact, for the right kind of 
gamer - the kind of person who 
maybe bought a Switch for their 
kid or partner and doesn’t really 
groove on the cutesy Mario stuff - 
Skyrim might just be the platform’s 
killer app.
Not in TV-mode, of course. There 
it competes against the special 
edition on PS4 and Xbox One, and 
doesn’t look as good.
But when you undock, that’s 
when you realise what this so-
called “underpowered” console can 
give you: a PC-scale RPG you really 
can play anywhere. And it’s more 
than just the physical portability. 
The Switch’s suspend-and-resume 
functionality is rock-solid. Pick up 
the console, tap a button, the game 
is running. On Switch the game is 
ready for my whims, always. 
You can split that ridiculous 
247-hour playtime into 15 minute 
chunks. Or three hour chunks. 
Four hour chunks? Yeah... not so 
much. It’s pretty brutal on the 
Switch’s battery because it is a 
technically demanding game. Get a 
long USB-C cable...
Oh the game itself? Don’t - don’t 
you know? I mean, it’s seven years 
old! Oh well. Set in the Skyrim

Skyrim” and “People who haven’t

in 2011”? Possibly not especially 
big. But if you fall into that 
singular demographic, this game is 
simply a must-buy. 
Fundamentally, Skyrim on 
Switch is a tech demonstrator. 
It shows what this plucky little 
tablet can really do. Is it perfect? 
Hell no. Is is the best version of 
Skyrim? Certainly not. Yet in a 
world where the line between CPU, 
GPU and even RAM continues to 
blur, Skyrim shows that handheld 
gaming is absolutely the future.

SMARTPHONES
The Samsung ads that claim the S8 reinvents the phone 
may be a little over the top, but it has created something 
beautiful. With the screen spreading across almost every 
surface, including the left and right edges, it’s stunning 
to behold. The price is equally stunning, but in return you 
get an excellent camera, great battery life and chart-
topping speed.

GOOGLE PIXEL 2
The Pixel 2 XL proved a 
disappointment, but not 
so the Pixel 2: this built 
on all the best aspects of 
the Pixel – with a better 
camera. 64GB, $1,079

SAMSUNG C34F791
It may seem expensive, but this is a 
top-quality 34in 3,440 x 1,440 curved 
monitor. At 1500R, it’s very nearly the 
same curvature as the human eye, 
which justifies the term “immersive” 
whether you’re playing games or 
working. $1,459.
PHILIPS 276E7
The obvious sacrifice you make for a 
27in IPS panel at this price is resolution 
– it’s 1,920 x 1,080 – but it offers good 
all-round image quality and looks 
attractive on the desk thanks to a 
slimline design, but it’s the price that 
makes this one a real champ. $249.

a wide range of hidden features and

scratch – which is what we reveal here.

WINDOWS 10 HACKS FEATURE
PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   65 

66  WWW.PCAUTHORITY.COM.AU
HACK WINDOWS 10’S SECRET     
STOP MICROSOFT 
SPYING ON YOU
The whole time you’re using 
Windows, you’re generating 
feedback. This is sent back to 
Microsoft for several reasons, 
including benign ones such as 
making sure its apps and operating 
system work smoothly. Some, 
however, are more questionable: 
targeting you with ads and services 
based on your previous activity. 
In its defence, Microsoft has 
recently started being a lot more 
open about the data it collects and 
what it uses it for. In October 2017, 
for example, it posted a document 
giving extensive details, perhaps 
in an effort to both allay users’ 
suspicions and discourage them 
from switching off or blocking 
essential services (see tinyurl.com/
kwferf4).
If you’d rather not be used as a 
marketing tool, there are several 
steps you can take to restrict what’s 
being sent to HQ. Click Settings, 
then Privacy. You’ll see four On/Off 
options, with the top one controlling 
personalisation of ads. Opting for 
Off  blocks Windows from gathering 
data based on your activities and 
deletes what’s already stored on 
your PC.
There’s no reason why you 
shouldn’t trust Microsoft to comply 
with your wishes, but if you’re of a 
suspicious nature, you might want 
to consider blocking Windows’ 
connection to the collection servers. 
Traditionally, blocking a server is a 
simple case of editing the “HOSTS” 
fi le to redirect its IP address to an 
alternative location, but this method 
doesn’t work where the analytics 
engine is concerned. 
Instead, check out O&O Software’s 
free ShutUp10 (oo-software.com/
en/shutup10), which lets you adapt 
your security settings, blocks user 
data and diagnostics and gives 
you control over location services 
and Windows Update. The full 
range of tools that it disables is an 
eye-opener, including Microsoft’s 
ability to remotely change settings 
on your device to “test” certain 
confi gurations.
Finally, open Settings and 
navigate through Privacy to 
“Feedback & diagnostics”. Switch off 
the tailored experiences option, and, 
if you wish, set feedback request to 
Never.
Pause automatic updates
We wouldn’t generally 
recommend pausing updates. 
They’re automatic for a very good 
reason: if they were manual, we’d 
forget. Nonetheless, Microsoft lets 
you defer non-essential updates 
for up to fi ve days. You can only 
do this once before downloading a 
full update, at which point you can 
delay again. To activate a temporary 
hold, open Settings, click through 
“Update & Security” to “Restart 
options”and choose a day and time.
If you need to pause updates 
for more than fi ve days, there is a 
work-around for Windows 10 Home 
users. Tell it you’re on a metered 
connection and Windows will hold 
off until you connect to a different 
network. Open Settings, click 
through “Network & Internet”, pick 
Wi-Fi from the sidebar and click 
“Manage known networks”. Select 
your network, click Properties and 
toggle the switch to “Set as metered 
connection”.
Neither of these options affect 
Windows Defender or any third-
party anti-malware tools, which will 
still download their own updates.
DISABLE P2P DOWNLOADS
Windows uses peer-to-peer 
networking to download updates 
from other users’ machines where 
possible, reducing the load on 
Microsoft’s own servers. In theory, 
this should mean your updates 
download more quickly, but the 
payoff is that your own machine 
will serve up data for other users 
around the world. If you’re on 
an unmetered connection, this 
shouldn’t be a problem, but you can 
turn it off if it’s likely to take you 
close to a data cap.
Open Settings and pick “Update 
& Security” then “Advanced 
options”. Click Delivery 
Optimization. If you’re running 
several machines on the same site, 
check “PCs on my local network”, 
but make sure the second option, to 
roll in PCs on the internet, is cleared. 
Clicking on “Advanced options” 
will also allow you to set bandwidth 
and upload limits.

Classic Shell, right-click the

WINDOWS 10 HACKS FEATURE
    SETTINGS
Windows Insider is Microsoft’s 
programme for more ambitious 
users.
Sign up and you can download 
pre-release builds of Windows 10 
and Windows Server to use before 
anyone else. While up-to-date 
Windows 10 users are currently 
working with build 1709 – Fall 
Creators Update, code-named 
Redstone 3 – Windows Insiders 
have had access to 1803, Redstone 
4, since 31 August 2017. The rest of 
us will have to wait until early 2018 
to join them.
There are many reasons why 
you might want to run pre-release 
builds, from simple curiosity to a 
need to test them in a quarantined 
environment. For developers who 
need to ensure their applications 
are compatible with forthcoming 
revisions to the OS, signing 
up is a no-brainer. Entry into 
the programme isn’t generally 
restricted, though, so home users 
who simply want to see what’s 
coming down the line can join them. 
You’ll need to be running at least 
Windows 10 version 1703. To ﬁ nd 
out if you are, open Settings and 
click About in the System pane.
Naturally, there are caveats. 
You’ll be installing software that, 
by its very deﬁ nition, is unﬁ nished. 
It’s usually stable, and we’ve not 
encountered any problems, but if 
you lose data you have only yourself 
to blame, so adequate backups 
are a must. Microsoft warns “[The 
Windows Insider programme] isn’t 
for the faint of heart, and can often 
lead to bugs and other problems. 
By signing up for this programme, 
you’re agreeing to let Microsoft 
install pre-release software on your 
PC and collect usage information.”
Previously, managing your 
membership required that you 
installed a dedicated Windows 
Insider app, but its features have 
now been rolled into the Windows 
10 Settings application. You’ll ﬁ nd 
them in the “Update & security” 
section, and can choose what kind 
of updates you receive, as well as 
the speed at which they arrive. 
Brave members will sign up for 
Fast, which gives them access to 
the earliest public releases. These 
will have been through three levels 
of internal testing at Microsoft, but 
not been seen in the wild before. 
More conservative users should opt 
for the Slow ring, which rolls out 
the same updates only if they’ve 
not been found to cause problems 
for the Fast ring members. If you’re 
signing up on your only PC, we’d 
recommend opting for the Release 
preview ring and receiving the 
updates only if they’ve behaved 
well for both the Fast and Slow ring 
members.
You can ﬁ nd out more about the 
programme at insider.windows.

Windows icon to reveal a second 
Start menu, which majors on direct 
links to utilities and diagnostics 
tools, including Device Manager, 
PowerShell and Task Manager. Pre-
Creators Update, there was a direct 
link to the full Control Panel, but 
after upgrading this was replaced 
by an alias for the dumbed-down 
Settings centre.
CREATE A 
GOD FOLDER
It looks like Microsoft wanted to 
keep this one quiet – but create 
a new folder with the extension 
“folder name.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-
825C-99712043E01C}”.
Whatever you use before the 
dot will be adopted as the folder’s 
actual name, with the part in curly 
braces disappearing. It will take the 
Control Panel icon, and with good 
reason: open it and you’ll fi nd direct 
links to over 200 settings, including 
playing media automatically, 
managing BitLocker and changing 
advanced colour management 
settings. It’s offi cially known as 
the Windows Master Control Panel 
and, as you can search it from the 
Explorer toolbar, it’s handy to keep 
close by as it lets you jump straight 
to the option you want to tweak, 
rather than having to fi nd it through 
Settings or Control Panel. You can 
also right-click any action’s name to 
create a direct shortcut, which can 
be saved to the desktop or another 
folder.

MAKE  WINDOWS  FASTER            
DITCH CORTANA
Cortana is woven into the fabric of 
Windows 10, but can be disabled. 
In Windows Home, open the 
Registry Editor (use the Search 
box to fi nd “regedit” and click 
the top result), and then navigate 
to “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\
Windows”. Right-click on 
“Windows” and select New  | Key, 
then rename it “Windows Search”. 
Right-click the empty space in the 
main pane and pick “DWORD 
(32-bit) Value” from the New 
menu. Specify “AllowCortana” as 
the header and zero as the value. 
Exit Registry Editor and reboot 
your machine and your searches 
will only encompass your local 
machine. The taskbar’s search box 
will be replaced by a magnifi er that 
offers just to Search Windows when 
clicked.
If you’re running Windows 
10 Pro, launch the Group Policy 
editor (“gpedit.msc”), again from 
the Search box, and click through 
Administrative Templates | 
Windows Components | Search | 
Allow Cortana. Click Disable.
If you only want to hide Cortana, 
right-click the Taskbar and pick 
Hidden from the Cortana sub-
menu.
REMOVE APPS 
Deleting apps you’ve installed 
is easy. Doing the same with the 
preinstalled defaults is trickier 
as they don’t appear in Control 
Panel. Instead, type “Powershell” 
into the Cortana box, right-click 
the top result and pick “Run as 
administrator”. PowerShell is text-
based, but the formula for removing 
a program is the same:
Get-AppxPackage *app-name* | 
Remove-AppxPackage
Replace app-name as appropriate. So, to 
delete Zune Music, use:
Get-AppxPackage *zunemusic* | 
Remove-AppxPackage
For a list of all apps installed on 
your system, use Get-AppxPackage 
on its own, read off the application 
title from the Name line of each 
entry, and use the last part of 
it between the asterisks in the 
commands above. Microsoft.
ZuneVideo, for example, would be 
truncated to *zunevideo*.
Apps that you’ve installed from 
the Windows Store don’t appear 
in Control Panel’s “Add and 
Remove Programs” pane, but can 
be removed by right-clicking their 
icon on the Start menu and picking 
Uninstall.
GET THE CLASSIC 
START MENU
Windows 8 and 10 have moved 
further and further away from the 
standard set back in 1995, with 
the simple set of apps and options 
hidden behind the Start button. 
To get that minimal interface 
back, install the free Classic Shell 
(classicshell.net), which can emulate 
Windows XP, 7, 8 and 10 menus with 
single and double columns. It also 
lets you revert Windows Explorer to 
behave the way it did in XP or Vista, 
and add loading progress, security 
zone details and the title of each 
page to Internet Explorer.
Shift-clicking the Start button 
opens the regular Windows 10 
tiled screen, and there’s an option 
to do the same from the top of the

KILL  NAGGING  NOTIFICATIONS
FINE-TUNE NOTIFICATIONS
Sometimes it can feel like Windows 
is fighting against you. Every ping, 
beep and pop-up will be enough 
to break your attention. You might 
not think this is anything to 
worry about, but the University of 
California, Irvine, argues it takes an 
average of 23mins 15secs to return 
to your task every time you are 
interrupted. You need to take control 
of nagging notifications.
This isn’t to say kill them all. 
Action Centre, Windows 10’s main 
method of getting in touch, can be 
used to your advantage because 
many notifications – including 
Facebook updates and emails – can 
offer a way to instantly reply. Others 
allow you to authorise actions (such 
as “Mark as read”) directly without 
digging into the application. Twist 
Action Centre to your needs and it 
can be useful.
First, control which notifications 
are allowed to pop up. Open 
Settings, click through to 
“Notifications & actions” in the 
System section, and toggle the 
switches beside each app. At the 
very least, switch off calendar and 
mail notifications if these are also 
set to appear on your phone. With 
calendars often setting reminders by 
default, it’s not unusual for an alert 
to appear simultaneously on your 
desktop, laptop, tablet and phone. 
That’s an instant recipe for insanity.
Scroll down to find the settings for 
individual applications. Although 
it’s not immediately obvious, 
clicking their headings rather than 
the switches beside them lets you 
dig deeper for finer-grained control. 
Click Calendar, for example, and 
aside from toggling permission to 
display notifications, which you can 
do from the overview, it lets you set 
if they can appear on the lockscreen, 
if they should make a sound when 
they arrive, how many should 
display in Action Centre if several 
are due at the same time and more. 
You can even choose on an app-by 
-app basis if its notifications are top, 
high or normal priority, with those 
further up the scale being positioned 
towards the top of the screen, so 
they’re visible without scrolling.
If you want to take things further, 
you can disable notifications entirely 
from the top-level Notifications & 
actions pane by toggling the switch 
below “Get notifications from apps 
and other senders”. This is probably 
overkill, but you should certainly 
disable two options below it: “Get 
tips, tricks and suggestions as you 
use Windows” and “Show me the 
Windows welcome experience after 
updates and occasionally when 
I sign in to highlight what’s new 
and suggested”. The first of those 
will also turn off the inducements 
to try Edge instead of your current 
browser.
TURN A  
BLIND EYE
Notification badges are among the 
most distracting elements in any 
OS. Right-clicking the Action Centre 
bubble gives you the option to turn 
these off, as well as hiding your app 
icons and switching on Quiet Hours.
The Quiet Hours setting mutes 
all notifications until the “hours” 
expire. The default, which can’t 
be changed, runs from midnight 
until 6am, but if you want to extend 
them, simply switch them on and off 
manually.
You should be able to rely on 
Microsoft to know how best to 
patch your PC, so while retaining 
a degree of control over which 
patches and fixes are applied might 
be comforting, it’s rarely necessary. 
Open Windows Defender Security 
Center, click on Settings and turn off 
notifications for recent activity and 
scan results. You can do the same for 
firewall settings, as long as you bear 
in mind that if a newly-installed 
app refuses to work it could be 
because it’s unable to connect to an 
authentication server.
Changing your active hours 
will reduce the number of System 
Update notifications you receive. By 
default, active hours are set to expire 
at 5pm, so if you routinely work 
beyond this, or you use your PC in 
the evening, you’ll be interrupted by 
Windows asking if it can go ahead 
and update. 
The active hours option is in the 
Windows Update section of Settings. 
Set the end of your active hours 
to 11pm or later to have Windows 
update overnight. Note that your 
active hours can’t be more than 18 
hours a day.
LOG IN AUTOMATICALLY
If you’re the only person who uses 
your PC, you can disable the one 
interruption we all encounter daily: 
the login screen.
Find and launch “netplwiz” 
through the search bar, then 
uncheck the box beside “Users must 
enter a username and password 
to use this computer”. Click Apply 
and netplwiz will ask you to specify 
which user should be automatically 
logged in, and for the appropriate 
password.
While this will save you time 
when rebooting, it’s a risky step 
– especially if the automatically 
logged-in user has administrator 
access. We recommend setting 
up a separate, limited account for 
automatic logging in so that, before 
anyone who gains access to your 
machine can do too much damage, 
  Consider turning 
off alerts for 
calendars and 
emails if they’re 
also set to pop up 
on your phone or 
tablet

WINDOWS 10 HACKS FEATURE
As long as you’re happy editing the Windows Registry, you can take more 
drastic steps but, as is always the case when working with the Registry, 
make sure to create a System Restore point before beginning and, 
preferably, a full, veriﬁed backup of your system before you do.
We’ll start by disabling system pop-ups. Launch Registry editor (type 
“regedit” into the search box and pick the ﬁrst result), and navigate 
through the Registry tree to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\
Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced”. Once you’re there, pick 
“DWORD (32-bit) Value” from the Edit menu’s New sub-menu (or right-click 
any blank area in the main pane) and name it “DWORD EnableBalloonTips”. 
Make sure that you match the capitalisation. That should be all you need to 
do, as by default the DWORD’s Value should be set to zero, but right-click it 
and pick Modify just to make sure.
Now we 
need to do the 
same for 
application 
pop-ups that 
are delivered 
from local 
APIs or the cloud 
via Windows 
Notiﬁcation 
Service – or 
anything that’s 
not Windows 
itself. These 
notiﬁcations are appropriately known as “toasts”, perhaps due to the fact 
that they pop up, like bread from a toaster.
Go back through the Registry tree to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\
Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotiﬁcations”, where you should 
ﬁnd an existing DWORD for ToastEnabled. Double-click to edit it and set 
the Value data to zero (“0”). If the key doesn’t already exist, create it and 
then set the value.
Close the Registry editor and restart your PC for the settings to take 
effect. You can make sure that they worked correctly by performing 
any action that would usually spawn a pop-up, such as updating ﬁles in 
Dropbox using the web browser while the Dropbox client is active on your 
machine.
Exit the Registry and restart your PC.
Use brute force: hack the 
Windows Registry
they still need to switch users and provide appropriate 
login credentials.
ZERO OUT YOUR TO-DOS
App badges, such as the one on the email app icon that 
shows how many messages remain unread, are another 
distraction you can turn off. They’re the app’s way 
of demanding your immediate attention, rather than 
waiting until you’re ready for them.
Open Settings and navigate through Personalization 
to Taskbar, where you can toggle off the setting for 
“Show badges on taskbar buttons”.
While you’re here, click through to “Select which 
icons appear on the taskbar” and “Turn system icons 
on or off”, both of which are also found in the Taskbar 
pane. The former lets you hide icons for apps such as 
Dropbox, while the latter lets you remove status icons 
such as battery power, sound and so on. While we’d 
retain both battery and sound, we’re inclined to hide 
Action Centre as it can easily be called up manually 
using Win+A.
TAME APPS
A lot of applications have their own notification 
settings, which can only be changed through the apps 
themselves. Dropbox’s preferences, for example, has 
checkboxes for mentions, comments, tasks, shares, syncs 
and edits, all of which can be manually turned off. Just 
bear in mind that, if you’re using Dropbox as part of 
a team, this could impair your ability to keep up with 
your colleagues.
Monitor which apps ask the most questions and target 
them over time. Web browsers are common culprits, so 
look at trimming the number of times they need your 
intervention. In Chrome settings, for example, disable 
the “Ask where to save each file before downloading” 
option, which you’ll find in the Advanced settings 
section.
In Edge, open Settings | Advanced settings, and 
toggle off “Ask me what to do with each download” 
so they’re automatically sent to the Downloads folder. 
Scroll down to Notifications and click Manage, then 
toggle off any web apps that are allowed to notify you. 
Why? Because these notifications don’t just appear 
within the browser: they also pop up in Windows itself, 
and can post to the Action Centre.
In Internet Explorer, open Internet Options| 
Advanced and clear the checkboxes beside “Notify 
when downloads complete” and “Tell me if Internet 
Explorer is not the default web browser”. Make sure the 
pop-up blocker is enabled on the Privacy tab, then click 
Settings and uncheck the box to “Show Notification bar 
when a pop-up is blocked”.

powerful friend

COULD YOU BE IN FOR A NASTY SURPRISE WHEN DISASTER  
STRIKES? NIK RAWLINSON EXPLORES THE RISKS
YOUR  
BACKUPS  
AREN’T
SAFE
D 
oes backup get your back up? It shouldn’t. A 
robust backup routine ought to be fuss-free 
and transparent – if it isn’t, you’re far less 
likely to keep your archives updated. That means that 
when things go wrong and you need to recover a lost 
file, the crucial documents you’ve been working on may 
not have been backed up. 
Even if you’re trying to do everything right, your 
chosen backup method may not be as comprehensive 
or bulletproof as you thought. And that should be a big 
concern: small businesses can’t afford to have things go 
wrong when it comes to backup, and home users stand 
to lose precious documents, photos and videos if their 
backup system lets them down.
Over the next four pages, we’ll show how to protect 
your local, cloud and web-based files in a truly reliable 
way – and find out why your current backup regime 
may not cut it.
SYNC VERSUS BACKUP
Let’s clear one thing up right away: synchronisation 
isn’t backup. Cloud-syncing services are an easy, 
effective way to keep vital files updated across several 
machines. However, if you’re relying on a service like 
this to save your skin in the case of an IT emergency, 
you’re running a serious risk.
Take Dropbox as an example. Not only does Dropbox 
duplicate your files onto every computer you own, it 
also keeps its own set of backups – so you can roll back 
to an earlier version of a file, or bring deleted items back 
from oblivion. This feature can be a life-saver: to recover 
a deleted file, you can just log in through the browser, 

PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   73 
BACKUPS FEATURE
click Files, then click “Deleted fi les” in the 
sidebar. Find the fi le you want to resurrect and 
click Restore.  
The catch is that changes and deleted fi les 
are only stored for 30 days, after which they’re 
purged. So while Dropbox can rescue you 
from short-term problems, it’s no use when 
you need to restore a document that was 
changed or deleted a few months ago. You can 
extend the window to 120 days by upgrading 
to a Dropbox Professional account, but it’s 
expensive: it costs US$20 per month.
It also still doesn’t count as a proper backup 
solution. A dedicated backup service should 
allow you to recover fi les that were deleted 
years ago, or step back through a complete 
history of changes to a document. Not only is 
this essential for data security, it also provides 
a helpful audit trail so you can track the 
development of your projects. Some backup 
services even offer an authentication service 
that can be used to prove that a fi le was 
created or edited on a certain date.
Although we’ve picked on Dropbox here, it’s 
by no means an outlier. Similar issues apply 
to Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive and so on. 
Syncing services should be used for 
just that – syncing – and backup left 
to tools designed with that task in 
mind.
THE 3-2-1 STRATEGY
When it comes to backup, the 
standard advice is that you should 
keep three copies of anything 
that matters, in two different 
formats, with at least one of them 
off-site – an approach known as 
the 3-2-1 strategy. The last point 
is very important: no matter how 
diligently you back up your system, 
if you store your media right next 
to your PC then it will be equally 
susceptible to fi re, fl ood and theft – 
another reason why your backups 
might not be as safe as you would 
hope.
The good news is that off-site 
backup is easy. There are plenty 
of cloud-based backup providers 
who will, for a modest subscription, 
handle everything. However, this 
is normally on a “best-effort” basis; 
they won’t be held liable for any 
lost data. For safety, speed and 
convenience it’s a good idea to keep 
local backups as well.
Ideally, you want your local 
backups to be updated in real-time, 
so that every time you update a fi le 
the backup gets updated, too. You 
can get close to this using Windows’ 
File History feature (or Time 
Machine on macOS), with a NAS 
or a USB drive as your destination. 
If you’re serious about backups 
then ideally you should also keep 
a second regularly updated set, to 
provide an extra layer of robustness 
against glitches and disasters. This 
should be on a different medium to 
your primary backups: using a pair 
of hard drives is much safer than 
two folders on one drive.
This is another place where it’s 
tempting to rely on cloud services, 
but here’s a cautionary tale. Apify 
founder Jan Curn lost 8,000 photos 
after he uploaded them to Dropbox, 
then tried to remove them from his 
local hard disk, to free up space. 
In theory, he should have been 
fi ne. He used Dropbox Professional’s 
Smart Sync feature, which is 
supposed to store your fi les in 
the cloud, and download them on 
demand. However, Curn recalled 
that the Dropbox client crashed 
during the initial sync operation, so 
he unsynced his photo folders by 
hand. “Everything worked well, the 
directories disappeared from the 
local hard drive, but they were still 
available on Dropbox’s website. All 
good,” he wrote on Medium.
But, two months later, Curn 
discovered that the photo folders 
were empty on the server, too. 
“[It] seems that the Dropbox client 
  ABOVE LEFT  Dropbox 
keeps copies of deleted 
files for 30 days as 
standard and 120 days in 
the Professional version
ABOVE  At least one of 
your backup destinations 
should be off-site
LEFT  Windows’ built-in 
backup tools can archive 
your data on either an 
external drive or a NAS 
location
“SYNCING SERVICES SHOULD BE 
USED FOR JUST THAT – SYNCING 
– AND BACKUP LEFT TO TOOLS 
DESIGNED WITH THAT TASK IN MIND”

fi rst deletes fi les locally before it 
informs the server about the new 
selective sync settings,” he noted. 
“Consequently, if the client crashes 
or is killed before the server is 
contacted, the fi les remain deleted 
without any trace. After the client 
restarts again, it only sees there are 
some fi les missing and syncs this 
new state with the server.”
Dropbox’s engineering team 
managed to recover 1,463 of Curn’s 
fi les, but the rest were lost. It’s a 
reminder of another key principle: 
a backup is a copy. If you only have 
one copy of something, it’s not a 
backup.
SCHEDULING A BACKUP
If your backup routine relies on 
you remembering to update your 
archives then it’s liable to fail; 
dedicated backup tools either 
run continuously, or update your 
backups at regular intervals. Most 
backup tools take an incremental 
approach, so only new and updated 
fi les are stored, which saves time 
and keeps storage demands down. 
It can also save you money, by 
postponing the day when you need 
to invest in a larger repository for 
your backups.
Set the smallest practical interval 
for each incremental backup. 
Hourly is by no means too often: 
ask yourself whether you could 
afford to lose a morning’s work if a 
lunchtime power cut corrupted your 
drive and wiped out several hours 
of productivity. However, if you’re 
working with a capped broadband 
connection, it makes sense to limit 
your cloud backups to run during 
unmetered hours (typically overnight), as 
long as you also have local backups running 
throughout the day.
Don’t rely entirely on incremental backups, 
though. Taking periodic full backups allows 
you to quickly and easily restore your 
complete system to a recent state; mixing 
incremental and full backups is just as 
important as storing them in several locations. 
USING WINDOWS’ BUILT-IN 
BACKUP TOOLS
Windows’ integrated tools make it very easy 
to maintain local backups. Start by enabling 
the File History tool, which uses a connected 
drive or NAS as a repository for key fi les, 
including your Libraries, the Desktop, contacts 
and favourites.
To fi nd it, open Settings’ Update & Security 
pane, and click Backup in the sidebar (or just 
search Cortana for Backup). Click “+” beside 
“Add a drive” and select a connected storage 
device. This only searches for USB drives; if 
you want to use a NAS, wait for it to fail, then 
click “Show all network connections” and 
select the volume you want to use.
It may look like nothing has happened, but 
click out and back into Backup and you’ll see 
that the “Add drive” button has been replaced 
by a switch toggled to On to activate the 
backup. Click “More options” below this to 
specify what’s included in the backup set, how 
frequently you want it to back up (between 
every ten minutes and daily) and how long 
the backup set should be kept. You can also 
invoke an immediate backup.
With this done, Windows will start quietly 
and continuously backing up your modifi ed 
BACKUP AND 
DISK IMAGINGY 
Disk imaging software lets you 
store a complete copy of your hard 
drive, so you can quickly get up 
and running even if you need to 
completely replace the hardware. 
Most imaging tools also let you 
back up and extract ﬁ les from an 
image, for all-round protection. 
Here, we’ll use O&O DiskImage 
Professional to back selected ﬁ les 
to a NAS on our local network. 
Start by opening the Tools menu 
and clicking Map Network Drive, 
which opens Windows’ standard 
drive mapping tool. We’ll leave 
the assigned letter at Z, then click 
Browse… and navigate to a folder on 
the drive. Clicking Finish maps it, and 
our selected folder will behave like a 
locally connected drive.
We can create an image of our 
whole hard drive – but we’re running 
this local backup in addition to 
a cloud backup service, which is 
storing our ﬁ les off -site. So we just 
want to back up our Documents and 
Pictures, so we can recover them 
quickly without having to wait for a 
download from the server. Switch to 
the File operation tab and check the 
boxes beside the folders. 
We could back them up now by 
clicking “Start ﬁ le backup” to create 
a one-time archive. But, as these 
ﬁ les are frequently accessed, we 
want to make sure they’re backed 
up regularly. Click “Add as job” 
instead and give the job a logical 
name. Switching to the “Start time” 
tab, we’re scheduling it to run at 
the end of each working day. On 
the Notiﬁ cation tab, we’ve asked 
it to send us an email each time it 
completes. 
Finally, we need to tell it where 
to store the backup, so switch to the 
File backup tab, click the “…” beside 
Storage path and navigate to the 
Z: drive (our NAS). We’ve created a 
folder inside it called backup, which 
we’ll use to store the archive. Clicking 
Apply creates the job and pulls 
up a summary of what DiskImage 
Professional will do. By default it 
makes an unencrypted backup using 
BZIP2 compression. 
You can also image your drive at 
regular intervals. Click “One-click 
imaging” on the Drive operation 
tab, followed by the “…” beside 
Target, and set the destination 
folder. Clicking Start performs the 
operation.

BACKING UP YOUR FILES WITH 
PARAGON BACKUP & RECOVERY 
Rather than manually 
copying ﬁ les, we’re 
using Paragon Backup & 
Recovery to automate 
the process, and back up 
our Microsoft Offi  ce ﬁ les 
to an external hard drive, 
connected via USB. Backup  
Recovery’s opening screen 
lets you create a single 
one-off  backup, but we 
want to schedule the task 
so it repeats regularly, so we’ll click “Create 
backup job” to get started. This opens a wizard 
that walks us through the various steps involved 
in creating a backup. 
Our ﬁ rst task is to name the backup job, and 
optionally provide a description – the software 
suggests using the date, time and name of the 
source drive. Once that’s done, we need to create 
a backup set. This could be the whole computer, 
a partition, speciﬁ c folders or, of interest to us, 
particular document types. 
Next, we switch to the “File types” tab in the 
Source pane and tick the Documents option. 
Rather than backing up everything, we only 
want to target Microsoft ﬁ les, so we’ve used the 
ﬁ lters box to specify the various Word, Excel and 
PowerPoint formats. Clicking through to the 
Target tab, we then select the destination drive. 
Backup & Recovery calls schedules 
“strategies”, and has four default options. You 
can create your own, but the Daily Backup 
routine, which keeps at least the last seven 
backups, and creates a full backup after every 
six incrementals, suits us ﬁ ne. 
Finally, the Advanced Settings tab lets you 
tweak the level of compression and specify a 
maximum size for the archive. We’re going to 
leave these both as they are, but will enable 
password protection to encrypt our ﬁ les. By 
default, it uses Paragon’s own encryption 
engine, but you can opt instead for AES–128, 
AES–192 or AES–256 if you prefer. Clicking Next

BACK UP YOUR 
CLOUD FILES
As we’ve mentioned above, 
entrusting your fi les to a cloud-
syncing service doesn’t guarantee 
their safety – so you should make 
sure your local folders are 
included in your backup sets, so 
that fi les stored on sync services 
such as Dropbox, OneDrive and 
iCloud should be backed up 
automatically. Simply keep their 
client apps running the whole 
time your PC is active to keep 
the copies updated.
With Google Apps, things are 
a bit more complicated. Google 
prefers that you work through the 
browser when editing documents, 
and the “fi les” it stores on your 
local machine are only web links 
that launch each fi le in the relevant 
Google web app. This means that 
the fi les on the server are your 
only copy – which is, of course, a 
dangerous situation to be in. 
The solution is a tool called InSync 
(insynchq.com), which downloads 
the fi les themselves – including fi les 
others have shared with you – and 
converts them to Microsoft Offi ce or 
OpenDocument formats so you can 
open them locally. Synchronisation 
and translation works both ways, 
too, so any edits you make on your 
PC will be sent back to the server, 
effectively giving Google Drive 
the same offl ine features Offi ce 
365 enjoys through its association 
with the offl ine Offi ce apps. You 
can buy a lifetime licence for a very 
reasonable $30.
BACK UP YOUR WEBSITE
If you keep a blog, or use a CMS to 
manage your website, it’s important 
to think about backing that up. Even 
if you’re using managed hosting or a 
shared server, it’s asking for trouble 
to keep all your data in one place: 
hosts can – and do – go bankrupt, 
disappear or suffer DDOS and 
malware attacks.
Automattic’s VaultPress 
(vaultpress.com) is a comprehensive 
backup tool for WordPress blogs, 
which backs up not only your 
database, but your themes, settings, 
system fi les and uploads, too. It 
starts at $39 per year for daily 
backups with a 30-day archive, 
uptime monitoring, and protection 
against brute force attacks, comment 
and pingback spam.
If you don’t need something 
quite so heavyweight, check out 
the free BackWPup WordPress 
extension, which can back up your 
site to Dropbox, S3 or an FTP 
server. To install it, hover over 
Plugins in your WordPress 
Dashboard, click Add New, and 
type “BackWPup” into the search 
box at the top of the following 
screen.
Similar backup tools are available 
for other CMS platforms, and many 
hosting control panels feature 
backup tools for fl at-form or non-
managed sites. Parallels Plesk lets 
you schedule both incremental 
and full backups of your data 
and confi guration; by default the 
destination is a folder on the same 
server, which isn’t ideal, but you 
can send it to a separate FTP server 
and password-protect the resulting 
archive.
Backup isn’t exactly an exciting 
topic, but we’ve seen how easy it can 
be using Windows’ built-in tools, 
and user-friendly software such 
as O&O DiskImage Professional 
and Paragon Backup & Recovery. 
Throw in a dedicated off-site 
backup service such as Backblaze or 
Carbonite and you’ve easily satisfi ed 
the requirements of a dependable 
3-2-1 backup strategy. There’s just 
one more thing to say: once you’ve 
set up your system, make sure 
you thoroughly test your ability to 
restore fi les, before you need to rely 
on it for real.

yber crime is on the increase, with the latest fi gures showing that there were an 
estimated 3.6 million cases of fraud and two million computer misuse offences 
in the year up to September 2016. This kind of crime includes phishing attacks, 
where people were tricked into giving away money, and unauthorised access to 
personal data from hacking. That’s an 8% increase, which saw the cost of fraud rise to more 
than $1bn.
With a growing number of attacks coming from abroad, and with some orchestrated by 
foreign governments, protecting yourself online has never been so important. In this guide, 
we’ll take you through the best ways to protect yourself. 
Of course, the main starting point is to have dedicated internet security software. However, 
this won’t prevent all attacks, such as your online accounts getting hacked due to weak 
passwords, so it’s important to take steps to counter all types of hacks. In this feature, we’ll 
take you through the steps you need to deal with security in all situations, so you can protect 
your data and online accounts.

P 
asswords are still used to protect the 
vast majority of online accounts, so 
choosing secure ones is absolutely 
critical. If you use just a simple word, then 
it’s easy for the hackers to guess your login 
details or run a brute-force attack, cycling 
through a dictionary until they gain entry. 
Likewise, you should ensure that your 
password reset security questions are tough to 
guess, or a hacker may be able to gain entry to 
your accounts.
CREATE SECURE PASSWORDS
Your fi rst job is to create a secure password 
that’s easy for you to remember. If you end up 
creating a secure password, but have to write 
it down on a Post-it note that you’ve stuck to 
your PC, something is clearly not working.
Original password security guides 
suggested that passwords should be 
eight characters or longer and contain a 
combination of upper- and lower-case 
characters, as well as numbers and symbols. 
These are hard to remember and relatively 
easy for computers to crack by guessing.
The answer is to create long passwords 
using a combination of seemingly random 
words. You can use capitalisation for each 
new word if that makes it easier for you to 
note down, such as ‘CatCupboardFoodBowl’. 
This is a 19-character password, but it’s pretty 
easy to remember. In this case, our cat sits 
by a cupboard waiting for food to be put in 
their bowl. This password is straightforward 
for us to recall, but would take a computer a 
long time to guess by running through every 
possible combination of letters and symbols.
If you want to make any password a bit 
longer and even harder, you could use a 
common prefi x and suffi x. For example, add a 
number and symbol to the front, say ‘3*’, and 
the same to the end, say ‘!9’, and we end up 
with ‘3*CatCupboardFoodBowl!9’.
Use a different phrase for each website 
or service. That way, if one site gets hacked, 
the criminals can’t use the same password to 
get access to your accounts.
A second clever thing about this technique 
is that you can note down reminders for a

THE HUMBLE PASSWORD REMAINS THE KEY TO MANY ONLINE ACCOUNTS, 
SO CREATING SECURE ONES WILL HELP KEEP YOUR ACCOUNTS SAFE
password, rather than the password 
itself. For example, we could just 
write ‘cat’ as a prompt for the above 
phrase.
CHECK YOUR PASSWORD 
STRENGTH
When you come up with a new 
phrase, it’s worth checking how 
secure the fi nal password is before 
you start using it. The website 
www.passwordmeter.com is a great 
resource. 
HOW TO MANAGE 
SECURE PASSWORDS
If you have an arsenal of secure 
passwords but are struggling 
to remember them, a password 
manager is a great way to keep them 
all organised. The best password 
managers store your passwords 
in the cloud, so you can access 
them from anywhere with a single 
master password. There are fl aws 
to the system, of course: having 
your passwords stored in the cloud 
means they’re no longer in your 
control, so if the provider is hacked, 
your passwords might be at risk.
Your browser also stores your 
passwords to make it easier for 
you to log into your favourite sites. 
Unfortunately, these are rather easy 
to compromise; there are some very 
simple and free tools that can extract 
passwords from your browser’s 
Registry entries. So while they 
may work perfectly well, there are 
certainly better options available.
USING DASHLANE 
TO STORE PASSWORDS
We recommend Dashlane 
(www.dashlane.com) as a 
password manager. At its most 
basic it can store your passwords 
and autofi ll them for you, as long 
as you have it installed on your 
PC or smartphone. What’s more, it 
can generate different ultra-secure 
passwords for all the sites you use.
The only password you have to 
remember is your master password, 
which is used to log into Dashlane 
itself. If you forget the master 
password, there is no way to retrieve 
it, so you should keep that in mind 
and write it down somewhere 
secure.
Because you don’t have to 
remember individual passwords 
any more, Dashlane can make them 
extremely long and complicated. 
And having Dashlane installed and 
autofi lling your passwords for you 
also means you’re going to be less 
susceptible to password-stealing 
keyloggers.
Of course, using those highly 
secure (and so utterly unmemorable 
passwords) does mean you always 
need to have Dashlane installed on 
your devices. That shouldn’t bother 
most people, though, who rarely 
jump from device to device on a 
daily basis.
  Password Meter is a great resource for 
checking how strong your passwords are

BEAT THE HACKERS FEATURE
PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   79 
If you’re still using some old 
passwords, Dashlane will take you 
to task if they aren’t secure enough. 
Click on the Security Dashboard to 
get a detailed analysis of all of your 
passwords. This will tell you how 
many passwords you’ve reused, how 
many are weak, and even if a site on 
which your password is stored has 
been compromised. So if you don’t 
follow tech security news closely, 
if Dashlane picks up that a site has 
been hacked, you’ll be informed and 
told to change your password.
Another handy tool is the ability 
to share your passwords with 
emergency contacts. Simply type 
in the email address of the person 
you want to share passwords with, 
and they’ll be allowed to send 
you a request for access to your 
passwords. You can either allow 
them to see all your passwords, or 
just a select few you think they might need. 
This is very handy if you’re travelling and 
need a friend or family to sort out something 
for you online.
All the above features are free, but if you 
shell out $40 for a year of Premium, you also 
get the ability to synchronise your password 
data across devices, including to mobile apps. 
SET SECURE RECOVERY 
QUESTIONS
If you forget your password, you need a way 
to recover the information. High-quality sites, 
such as Google, will email, text or post you a 
recovery code at the time; poor-quality sites 
still rely on security questions, which you 
set up at the time you created your account. 
Typically, questions will be something like: 
‘What was the name of your fi rst pet?’
This type of information can be gathered by 
the determined hacker, so never put down the 
real answer. Instead, use the secure password 
method above to enter hard-to-crack data. 
If you can’t remember the information, 
write it down on a bit of paper and secure it 
somewhere safely at home, such as in a safe.
  Dashlane will suggest and manage secure passwords 
for every site you visit

o matter how careful you 
are or how secure your 
passwords are, there’s still 
a chance that your login details 
will be stolen by a hacker. Having 
separate passwords for every 
account limits the damage, but using 
two-factor authentication can protect 
an account even when the password 
has been stolen.
With two-factor authentication, 
you enter your password as normal, 
but then enter a one-time code, 
which usually refreshes every 
minute. Without this code, you get 
no entry. There are three main ways 
of generating a code: by SMS, via 
an app on your phone, or using a 
dedicated USB security key, such 
as the YubiKey 4. The latter is our 
favourite, as you just plug the key 
into your computer and tap the 
button on it when prompted. This 
makes two-factor security no hassle 
at all.

TURN ON THE 
AUTHENTICATOR APP
Once your phone has been verifi ed, 
2-Step Verifi cation has been enabled for your 
account. When you next log in, you’ll be sent a 
code to your phone, although you can choose 
to trust a device for 30 days; this means you’ll 
only be prompted for a code once a month. 
If you want to use the Google Authenticator 
app (available for free in the Apple App 
Store or Google Play store) to generate codes, 
click Setup underneath the Authenticator 
option. Open the Authenticator app on your 
phone and click the plus icon, then point the 
camera at the QR code on your computer’s 
screen. Click Next, enter the code that your 
Authenticator app has generated and click 
Next again. Now, when you need to enter a 
code to access your Google account, you just 
open the app and enter the code it displays.

ADD A KEY
If you want to add a security key, 
fi rst make sure that your key is not 
connected to your computer. Then select 
Add Security Key underneath the Security 
Key option. Click Next on the dialog box that 
appears, plug in your security key and tap 
its button. When prompted, enter a name 
for the security key. Security keys become 
the default login option, and you just tap the 
button to generate a code. If you don’t have 
a key with you, Google lets you choose an 
alternative two-factor option.

scan the QR code with the Authenticator app 
and follow the onscreen instructions.

USE AUTHENTICATOR FOR 
OTHER SERVICES
Google Authenticator and security keys 
are also supported by a lot of other services, as 
we mentioned earlier. Each different service 
has to be confi gured individually, so check 
its website for full instructions. However, the 
rough steps are the same for all. For example, 
with Facebook, go to the Security settings 
and click Login approvals. Click the Require 
a security code to access my account from 
an unknown computer. Click Get Started to 
follow the wizard through, entering your 
phone number to get an authentication code. 
To use Google Authenticator, click 
Code Generator. There’s an option to use 
Facebook’s app for this, but it’s not very 
good and it’s easier to have everything in one 
place. Instead, click Set up another way to 
use codes and Facebook will bring up a QR 
code. In Google Authenticator, tap the plus 
icon. Tap Scan Barcode and point your phone’s 
camera at the onscreen QR code. When 
prompted, enter the code your app generates 
into Facebook. Similarly, select the Add 
key button to add a security key, following 
the wizard through. Finally, if you change 
phones, you’ll need to go through these steps 
again to confi gure Authenticator on your new 
handset.

ather than hacking you, 
it’s easier for criminals 
to simply trick you into 
revealing personal data. It’s far less 
effort for them, but the results can 
be just as deadly. Spam fi lters and 
security software should catch most 
of the bad stuff, but here’s our guide 
to staying safe from the messages 
that make it through.
DETECT A 
PHISHING EMAIL
Phishing scams are still incredibly 
popular, designed to trick us into 
voluntarily giving away login 
details or answers to security 
questions. Typically, a phishing 
email is designed to look as though 
it has come from a company, such 
as your bank. Usually, the message 
will carry a dire warning, telling 
you that your account has been 
locked out, or that you need to 
provide extra security information 
to continue using your service.
Sadly, these messages work, 
triggering a moment of panic in 
many people. The key with any 
suspicious email message is not 
to act too quickly, and stop and 
think. By looking for some tell-tale 
signs, you can usually work out if 
a message is for real or not. Here’s 
how to spot the scammers.
1 
CHECK THE SENDING 
EMAIL ADDRESS
Email addresses are composed 
of two different elements. First, 
there’s the display name, which is 
just a text fi eld and can easily be 
changed to anything. For example, 
if you go into your email client and 
change your name to ‘ANZ Bank, 
you’ll look a little like the bank if 
you send a message to anyone.
The second part is the actual 
email address. This can be faked, 
making it look as though the email 
is coming from a different address; 
however, as this usually makes it 
easier for anti-spam clients to detect 
dodgy messages, phishing emails 
usually come from a legitimate

DON’T BE TRICKED INTO GIVING OUT PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OUR GUIDE 
TO SPOTTING PHISHING EMAILS AND DEALING WITH LEGITIMATE COMPANIES
address. Crucially, these addresses are clearly 
not associated with the company the message 
is supposedly from: legitimate emails usually 
come from an email address that uses the 
company’s domain name, such as info@anz.
com.au. When you receive any email that sets 
your senses tingling, make sure you look at 
both parts of the email address. 
2 
LOOK FOR BAD GRAMMAR
Phishing messages are often poorly 
written and have obvious grammatical 
errors in them. If you get a communication 
from a company and it’s full of broken 
English, be very careful.
3 
CHECK LINKS
Phishing emails usually link to an 
external website. This will 
be confi gured to look like the 
company’s site, but any 
details you enter will 
be stolen and used by 
the criminals to access 
your real account. 
Before you click 
a link in an 
email, hover 
your mouse over 
the link text and 
see where it will 
take you. If a link 
doesn’t take you to a company’s website, do 
not trust it.
4 
MANUALLY VISIT A SITE
A fi nal bit of advice is to avoid clicking 
links that take you to the online login 
screen. Instead, manually type a company’s 
address into your browser before logging in, 
so you can verify where you’re going.
DON’T GIVE OUT DETAILS 
OVER THE PHONE
If you call a company, they will ask you some 
verifi cation questions before discussing your 
account or personal details. This makes a lot 
of sense, but what about when a company 
calls you? We’ve lost count of the number of 
times that we’ve been called and then asked 
to provide personal details as verifi cation. Do 
not do this, as it’s dangerous and scammers 
could be phoning you to get answers 
to your security questions. Instead, 
offer to phone back using 
the offi cial telephone 
number found on a 
company’s website.
  Phishing messages usually have tell-tale signs that they’re not legitimate

T 
hieves not only want to steal 
your kit, they also want the 
data and passwords stored 
on them. Preventing all kinds of 
theft, particularly when you take 
your kit out and about with you, 
is incredibly important. Following 
these simple tips can make a huge 
difference.
1 
PASSWORD-PROTECT 
EVERYTHING
Don’t use a smartphone that 
doesn’t have a lock code at the very 
least. Certainly, don’t run a laptop 
that doesn’t have a user 
password. This makes it too 
easy for people to get your 
personal fi les and, via your 
device’s web browser, view 
any online accounts that 
you’re logged into.
2 
REMOTE TRACK 
AND WIPE
Enabling, where 
possible, remote tracking 
and wiping is a good idea 
for all your devices. The 
former lets you fi nd a 
stolen device, and is more 
accurate with smartphones, 
STOP THEFT

as they have a data connection and GPS 
built in; Windows 10 laptops can only tell 
their location based on the Wi-Fi network 
that they’re connected to. The wiping 
function lets you securely wipe a lost device, 
preventing thieves from recovering any data.
To enable remote tracking in Windows 
10 (there’s no remote wipe option), go 
to Settings, Update & security, Find my 
device. Turn on Find my device to enable 
the feature, which requires you to have (or 
create for free) a Microsoft account. Devices 
can be tracked online at account.microsoft.
com/devices. 
For older versions of Windows, you 
need a different product, such as Prey (see 
preyproject.com). The free version just tracks 
your device, but pay monthly (from $5 a 
month) and you can also remote-wipe or 
recover your data.
With Android, you can download Find My 
Device to register and track your devices. 
If your phone is stolen, you can use Find 
My Device on another phone or go to www.
google.com/android/fi nd, and then locate 
or remote-wipe your handset. Apple users 
have the similar Find My 
iPhone service.
3 
HIDE YOUR 
PASSWORDS
You’re in just 
as much danger of 
getting hacked out and 
about in the real world. It 
pays to be vigilant, as 
there have been cases of 
people on trains having 
their passwords stolen by 
an observant passenger 
watching what you’re 
typing. Likewise, the 
same can happen at 
Wi-Fi hotspots or in airports, with people 
looking over your shoulder. Every time you 
have to enter a password make sure that 
there’s nobody looking at you, and shield 
your screen and keyboard from view. 
4 
USE A KENSINGTON LOCK
Thousands of laptops are stolen every 
year from airports and trains, so you 
don’t want to become just another statistic. 
Kensington locks can be an excellent method 
of protection when you have your laptop 
out. Like a bike chain for your computer, 
they connect to the special Kensington lock 
slot on your laptop. You can then wrap the 
provided cord around something more 
secure, such as a table leg. That way, if 
someone tries to run off with your laptop, 
they won’t get very far.

U 
sing a shared network or computer can 
be disastrous, giving hackers an easy 
way to steal your private information. 
If you want to stay connected when you’re 
out and about, following some simple advice 
can help you protect your data.
DON’T USE SHARED 
COMPUTERS
Public computers can be exceptionally 
dangerous, and you can’t guarantee that the 
computer sitting in a library or in a hotel 
lobby is free of malware. Using that computer 
can make it easier for hackers to steal your 
data, using hidden keyloggers and the like. 
For that reason, we don’t recommend using 
shared computers anywhere.
If you really have to use another computer, 
such as a friend’s computer, make sure that 
you use a private browsing session, so that 
your login details aren’t saved. Protect your 
accounts with two-factor authentication and 
log out at the end of your session.
BE WARY OF FREE WI-FI
Wireless networks aren’t particularly safe, 
and hackers have been known to set up 
dodgy hotspots so they can monitor and steal 
your internet traffi c. Worse, hackers have 
been known to set up hotspots that use the 
same name as legitimate networks, such as 
‘free_airport_wifi ’. As a result, your phone 
or laptop will connect to these networks 
automatically without you knowing.
There are preventative measures that you 
can take. First, only join a Wi-Fi network 
if you really have to, but at least verify the 
name of the network to which you should 
be connecting. For example, airports will 
usually display information signs that show 
you the name of the network.
When you’ve fi nished using the network, 
forget the name and details, so that your 
device won’t connect automatically in 
the future. For Windows 10 devices go to 
Settings, Network & Internet, WiFi. Click

AVOID INSECURE 
NETWORKS AND DEVICES
SHARED HOTSPOTS AND HOTEL NETWORKS CAN BE DANGEROUS 
TO USE. HERE’S HOW TO STAY SECURE IN PUBLIC SPACES
USE A VPN
A virtual private network (VPN) 
encrypts your data and transmits 
it across the internet to a secure 
endpoint. This prevents anyone 
from being able to spy on what 
you’re looking at, including 
Wi-Fi hotspot owners. There’s a 
secondary advantage that a VPN 
can also make it look as though 
you’re located in a different 
country, which means you can 
do things such as watch Foxtel 
Go when you’re on holiday. We 
recommend ExpressVPN, as it’s 
fast, great value and gives you 
loads of choices for the country that 
you want to appear in.

LEFT: Forget public networks when you’re done with them to avoid future problems
RIGHT: A VPN is a must-have for travellers, protecting your internet use from spying eyes

he Mirai botnet infected thousands of 
smart devices around the world last 
year, taking over everything from baby 
monitors to security cameras. When put into 
action, Mirai was responsible for a large-scale 
internet attack. Mirai showed that all of your 
internet-connected devices are potentially 
at risk and that you need to take steps to 
protect them. Here are the best options.
1 
CHANGE DEFAULT PASSWORDS
Mirai used a database of default 
usernames and passwords to infect a lot 
of devices, so it’s vital that you change these. 
Follow your device’s instructions to change 
any administrator passwords, using strong 
replacements.
2 
TURN OFF UPNP
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) 
is a technology that most routers 
have turned on by default. It allows 
devices that are connected to your home 
network to confi gure your router’s fi rewall 
automatically, which makes setting up new 
devices easy as you don’t need to do any 
manual confi guration. However, UPnP is 
insecure, so an infected device can open up 
your network to further attacks, potentially 
exposing other devices, such as your 
computer, to hackers. Disabling UPnP makes 
your network more secure, but in some cases 
you may need to confi gure port forwarding 
PROTECT YOUR SMART DEVICES
SECURITY CAMERAS, SMART TVS AND OTHER INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICES CAN BE 
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK IF THEY’RE NOT PROTECTED. HERE’S HOW TO KEEP THEM SAFE
manually. This increases the 
complexity of managing your 
internet-connected devices, but 
means that you’ll have a more 
secure network.
3 
UPDATE FIRMWARE
Software updates are a great 
defence against attacks. With 
each revision, manufacturers 
often patch fl aws and improve the 
security of their products. You 
should regularly check if there’s a 
fi rmware update for your internet-
connected devices.
Most will let you check for an 
update directly from the web-
based management page, although 
some products require you to 
download the update manually 
from the manufacturer’s support 
site. As the instructions differ from 
product to product, check your 
manuals to fi nd out the best way to 
perform an update.
4  
CHANGE DEFAULT WI-FI 
PASSWORDS
While most attacks are made 
over the internet, don’t give hackers 
the chance to get on to your 
network directly by connecting to 
an insecure Wi-Fi network. Instead, 
make sure that you’ve changed 
your default Wi-Fi password to a 
more secure one. The exception 
to this is if your router creates a 
unique secure password during 
setup, or if it ships with a unique 
password by default. While you’re 
changing your Wi-Fi password, 
make sure that your wireless 
network’s name doesn’t give away 
any personal information, such as 
your name or address.
  Keep your devices up to date with 
the latest firmware to protect against 
hackers

M 
ost cyber attacks are 
about making money, and 
ransomware is the pinnacle 
of this goal: it encrypts your fi les 
and then requests you pay up to 
get everything back. As shocking 
and distressing as an attack is, you 
needn’t pay up to get your data back. 
Here’s what to do.
1
MAKE EXTERNAL 
BACKUPS
If you haven’t been infected 
yet, then make sure that you have 
multiple backups of your data. 
As ransomware can infect any data 
that it can see, it’s worth making 
regular backups to external media 
that you can remove from your 
computer, such as an external hard 
disk. That way, if your computer 
gets infected, you know that you 
have a clean and untouched copy of 
your data. Remember, never connect 
an external hard disk to a computer 
that you think may be infected.
2  
DON’T PAY THE FEE
If you get infected by 
ransomware, never pay the fee. 
Paying out means giving criminals 
money, and there’s no guarantee that 
you’ll get the unlock code and your 
fi les back. In fact, many ransomware 
authors get so overwhelmed by 
requests that unlock codes are rarely 
PROTECT AGAINST 
RANSOMWARE
RANSOMWARE IS THE MOST INSIDIOUS FORM 
OF ATTACK, ENCRYPTING YOUR DATA AND 
REQUESTING MONEY TO RECOVER IT. HERE’S 
HOW TO ENSURE YOU DON’T FALL VICTIM TO IT
sent out. Instead, you need to focus 
on recovering your data.
The easiest way is to perform 
a clean install on your computer 
(or restore from an image stored 
externally hard disk), and then 
restore your fi les from a recent 
backup. If the ransomware has 
encrypted fi les that you don’t have 
backups of, your focus should be on 
restoring the data.
3  
CLEAN THE INFECTION
Turn off your infected 
computer and unplug it 
from your network. This reduces 
the risk of the infection spreading. 
Now, you’re ready to clean the 
ransomware from it. This will 
wipe out the option to pay the 
ransom, but as discussed above, you 
shouldn’t pay up anyway.
A rescue disk, such as the one 
available from Kaspersky, should 
be able to clear an infection. You 
can make a rescue USB disk using 
another computer.If that doesn’t 
work, you’ll need to update your 
internet security software (a 
good idea, in any case, to prevent 
future infections). We recommend 
Kaspersky Internet Security 2017, 
Bitdefender and Norton. To do 
this, you’ll need to connect your infected 
computer to the internet. Before you do this, 
unplug everything else from the network, 
including computers and NAS devices. Now 
install the security software, update it and run 
a full scan.
4  
LOOK FOR FREE UNLOCK 
OPTIONS
If you don’t have backups, Kaspersky 
runs a website dedicated to providing free 
ransomware decryptors (noransom.kaspersky.
com). Using the tools on this site, you may be 
able to fi nd a tool that will do the job for you 
for free. You’ll need to know which variant 
of ransomware has infected your computer. 
Installing or updating security software 
should do this. If you’re having problems 
identifying the variation, you can also type 
in information from the ransomware’s pop-
up warning message into Google. Check 
Kaspersky’s site to see if there’s a matching 
tool that you can use. Unfortunately, if these 
steps don’t work, then the chances are that 
your fi les are gone for good.
  A rescue disk can help you clear a 
ransomware infection before you 
recover your files
  Kaspersky’s detected site helps you find free unlock 
options for many common ransomware infections
  We don’t recommend paying a ransom, as there’s no guarantee 
you’ll get your files back

lthough you can take reasonable 
steps to protect your data, a company 
that you’ve signed up with may 
still get hacked, with your personal details 
being leaked. Unfortunately, there’s little 
you can do to prevent this from happening. 
Instead, it’s important that you react quickly 
to any breach to prevent the problem from

FIND OUT IF YOU’VE 
BEEN HACKED
Most of the time, it’s easy to know if 
you’ve been hacked, as you won’t be able to 
log into an account. However, not every theft 
of login details results in this. Look out for 
emails from any company you’re signed up 
with, warning you of a hack. You can also 
sign up for haveibeenpwned.com. You enter 
your email address or usernames and the site 
will tell you if your login details have been 
featured in any leaked data.

RECLAIM ANY 
HACKED ACCOUNTS
If you’re locked out of an account, you’ll 
need to reclaim ownership. In most cases,

out you’ve been hacked is when 
you’re told by a friend or family

FEATURE WINDOWS 10 ANNOYANCES
 THE FIX  
We’ve split the solution into two parts. 
First, we’ll look at how you can get your 
computer to stay asleep; second, we’ll look 
at how you can force your computer to go 
to sleep.
COMPUTER WAKES FROM SLEEP
If you’ve got problems with your computer 
waking itself from sleep mode, then it can 
happen almost immediately, or after a few 
hours. If it’s the former, then it’s typically 
a piece of hardware waking up your 
computer; the latter points to a service or 
scheduled task, such as Windows Update.
To find out what is responsible, you 
need to put your computer to sleep using 
the Start Menu option. When it wakes up, 
press Windows-X and select Command 
Prompt (Admin). At the command line type 
powercfg /lastwake and you’ll see what 
was responsible for waking your computer. 
If you just see something listed under 
Friendly Name, such as Intel (R) USB 3.0 
eXtensible Host Controller – 1.0 (Microsoft), 
then the odds are it’s a USB device that 
has woken your computer. But you could 
see a different piece of hardware, such as 
a network adaptor, or a scheduled task or 
service (pic right, top).
You can further track down hardware 
problems by using the command powercfg 
/devicequery wake_armed. This will show 
you a list of hardware that is allowed to wake 
your computer. Make a note of the 
list of devices for future use. In 
most cases, a device will wake your 
computer because it’s using out-
of-date driver software or generic 
Microsoft drivers (see ‘Windows 
installs its own drivers’ for more 
details). 
To test this, you can temporarily 
stop any device listed from being 
able to wake your computer. Press 
Windows-X and select Device 
Manager. Most devices listed 
by the wake-armed command 
will have descriptive names, 
such as HID Keyboard Device, 
which makes them easy to find in 
Device Manager by expanding the 
matching section. Double-click 
the device you want to change to 
bring up a new dialog box. Click 
the Power Management tab (if there 
isn’t one, then the device you’ve 
selected can’t wake your computer), 
untick Allow this device to wake 
the computer and then click OK. 
For network cards, select Only 
allow a magic packet to wake the 
computer (pic right, below).
Once you’ve done one device, 
go back to the command prompt 
and type powercfg /devicequery 
wake_armed. The list should now 
be shorter. Set your computer to go 
into Sleep Mode. If it doesn’t wake 
up, then you’ve found the problem 
device; if it does wake up, follow 
the instructions above until you’ve 
found the problem device.
Once you know which device is 
causing the problem, search online 
for a Windows 10 driver for it and 
install it. If there’s no Windows 10 
driver available, leave the device as 
unable to wake the computer.
Now re-enable the other devices 
that you prevented from waking 
your computer. You’ll need to 
retest that your PC stays asleep. If it 
doesn’t, you have a second problem 
device, so repeat these instructions 
to find it and update its driver (if 
available).
If your computer is waking up 
for another reason, such as in the 
middle of the night, then it’s most 
likely a scheduled task. There are a 
few things to disable that can help 
here. First, you can disable wake 
timers. Press Windows-X and select 
Power Options. Click Change plan 
settings next to the power plan that 
you’re using, and then click Change 
advanced power settings. Expand 
Sleep, and Allow wake timers and 
THE PROBLEM WINDOWS  
WON’T STAY ASLEEP
Sleep problems have plagued PCs for years, with computers waking  
when they shouldn’t and failing to go into standby when they should.  
With Windows 10, the problems have got worse, as out-of-date drivers  
and automatic updates can play havoc with your computer.

WINDOWS 10 ANNOYANCES FEATURE
PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   91 
then set all available options to 
Disable. Click OK to apply. Now 
repeat these instructions for all the 
listed power plans, remembering 
to expand the full list by clicking 
Show additional plans on the Power 
Options screen.
Windows can also wake 
itself automatically to perform 
maintenance, such as to defragment 
your hard disk. This is just plain 
annoying. To change this, open 
up the Control Panel and go to 
System and Security, Security 
and Maintenance. Expand the 
Maintenance section and click 
the Change maintenance settings 
link. Here, you’ll see the time that 
your computer is set to perform 
maintenance tasks (our PC was set 
for 2am). You can change the time 
to something more palatable, or you 
can untick the Allow scheduled 
maintenance to wake up my 
computer at the scheduled time box 
to permanently disable it.
Finally, Windows can wake itself 
up with a scheduled task. To find 
out what can do this, open the Start 
Menu and type Powershell, then 
select Windows PowerShell. At 
the command prompt, type Get-
ScheduledTask | where {$_.settings.
waketorun}. This will show you 
all scheduled tasks that can wake 
your computer. To find a task, 
open the Start Menu and type Task 
and select Task Scheduler. From 
the PowerShell list, you only need 
worry about the ones that have the 
State set to Ready (pic above).
Use the PowerShell TaskPath 
column to expand the right 
folder, by first expanding the Task 
Scheduler Library option in the 
left-hand window. When you’ve 
found the task name, double-click 
it to open the settings dialog box, 
then click Conditions and untick 
Wake the computer to run this task. 
Click OK to apply the settings (pic 
below). The Windows 10 Reboot 
task is used by Windows Update 
and can be reset by Windows, 
overriding your changes. The task 
can be permanently disabled if it’s 
really causing grief (see ‘Windows 
forces updates on you’).
WINDOWS WON’T SLEEP
If your computer doesn’t 
automatically go to sleep, something 
is keeping your PC awake. To find 
out what it is, press Windows-X and 
select Command Prompt (Admin). 
Type powercfg /requests and hit 
Enter. This will show you a list 
of devices and software that are 
currently preventing your computer 
from sleeping. The list needs to be 
empty for your computer to go to 
sleep. If you see something in the 
list, wait around five minutes and 
run the same command again: it’s 
common for your computer to be 
doing something where Sleep mode 
would cause an issue, but these 
tasks shouldn’t stick around forever.
If you’re still getting anything 
listed in the requests list, then it’s 
time to take a tougher stance. First, 
if it’s an application causing the 
problems, then look for an update, 
but close it down in the meantime. 
If you can see anything about audio 
playing, look for open browser 
tabs or other applications that are 
playing audio or video. Pause the 
content or shut the application or 
browser tab.
There are a couple of well-known problems 
that should be fixed. Google Chrome is a 
massive pain and will often keep a computer 
awake, and you’ll often see it in the requests 
list. Often, it’s a specific website or extension 
causing the issue. Try closing down any tabs 
playing audio (look for the speaker icon). 
Next, shut down one tab at a time and keep 
running the powercfg /requests command 
until you find the problem one.
Unfortunately, this doesn’t always fix 
the issue, and a regular website will just 
stop your computer from going to sleep. 
The easiest way around the problem is to 
add an override that makes Windows 10 
ignore what Chrome is up to. To do this, 
go back to the command prompt and type 
powercfg /requestsoverride PROCESS 
chrome.exe AWAYMODE DISPLAY SYSTEM. 
To remove the override, type powercfg /
requestsoverride PROCESS chrome.exe.
Finally, you may see that the [DRIVER] 
Legacy Kernel Caller is keeping your 
computer awake. This is most likely down to 
a bit of hardware running outdated software: 
a sound card, particularly a USB model, 
is most likely to blame. Look for the latest 
manufacturer- provided drivers for your 
hardware (if available) and install them to fix 
the issue.

92  WWW.PCAUTHORITY.COM.AU
FEATURE WINDOWS 10 ANNOYANCES
 THE FIX  
There’s no way to completely turn off updates 
using a simple Control Panel option, and 
only check for them manually; so you can’t 
go back to the way you used to work with 
Windows 7 or Windows 8. With Windows 10, 
Microsoft has decided that updates have to 
be downloaded and installed, which makes 
sense from a security point of view, if not 
from a usability one. 
While you can disable the service that 
automatically updates your Windows 10 
computer, it’s not a good idea to do so. 
Updates are important and can protect you 
from hackers and system instability. For 
this reason, it’s best to let Windows install 
updates, but manage how it does so and 
control when it can reboot your computer.
First, there are the tools that Windows has 
built in. To change these, click on Settings 
in the Start Menu and then select Update & 
Security. You can stop Windows from using 
your computer and internet bandwidth to 
seed updates; by default, Windows 10 uses 
a peer-to-peer technology that’s similar 
to BitTorrent to share updates. Click the 
Advanced link and then click Choose 
how updates are installed. If you want to 
download updates from Microsoft 
only and not other computers 
on the internet, turn Updates 
from more than one place to Off. 
If you don’t mind downloading 
updates from other computers, but 
don’t want to share updates from 
your computer, leave the option 
set to On. Now, you can choose 
only to share updates that you’ve 
downloaded with other computers 
on your home network by selecting 
PCs on my local network instead.
Windows 10 will automatically 
install updates and will reboot 
your computer where necessary. 
The only tool Windows gives you 
at the moment is Active Hours, 
where you pick a start and end 
time for when you’ll most likely be 
using your computer (pic below). 
During these hours, Windows 
won’t automatically reboot your 
computer. To change the times, go 
to Settings, Update & Security, and 
select Change active hours. Here 
you can set the start and end times. 
Currently, Windows only lets you 
set active hours for a maximum of 
12 hours. With the Creators update, 
due for release later in the year, 
Windows will let you set an 18-
hour window instead.
If you really want to stop 
Windows from rebooting your 
computer, then you have to prevent 
the Reboot task from running. 
To do this, run Task Scheduler 
from the Start Menu and, in 
the panel on the left, go to Task 
Scheduler Library, Microsoft, 
Windows, UpdateOrchestrator. 
Right-click Reboot and select 
Disable. Windows 10 can re-enable 
this Task, but you can prevent this 
from happening. In an Explorer 
window go to  
C:\Windows\System32\
Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\
UpdateOrchestrator. Rename 
the Reboot file to Reboot.bak  
(you’ll need to provide 
Administrator permission). 
Now create a new folder called 
Reboot. This prevents Windows 
from re-creating the task, and 
your computer will never reboot 
automatically. To reverse these 
steps, delete the Reboot folder, 
rename the Reboot.bak file and re-
enable the task (pic above).
THE PROBLEM WINDOWS  
FORCES UPDATES ON YOU
Updates are incredibly important as they keep your computer safe, but with Windows 10,  
Microsoft took the decision that it knew best and forces you to get updates, rebooting your  
computer automatically. Even worse, Microsoft decided that it would also update key bits  
of hardware with its own drivers automatically (see opposite).

WINDOWS 10 ANNOYANCES FEATURE
PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   93 
Windows 10’s automatic update 
process can be a real pain, as 
it also automatically downloads 
driver updates at the same time. 
While this can be a good thing, 
lots of people have reported 
hardware issues caused by 
automatic updates overriding 
manufacturer-provided drivers. 
 THE FIX  
If you want to decide which drivers 
you want to download and install, 
you can force Windows 10 to do this. 
The setting is a little hidden and, 
annoyingly, is not included with the 
general update settings. To fi nd the 
options, press Windows+X and select 
System, then click Advanced system 
settings. In the dialog box that 
pops up, select Hardware and then 
choose Device Installation Settings. 
You’ll see a message that reads Do 
you want to automatically download 
manufacturer’s apps and custom 
icons available for your devices?. 
Choose the No option and Windows 
will no longer download driver 
updates for hardware automatically 
for any device, so you’ll need to 
remember to update drivers 
manually.
THE PROBLEM EDGE 
KEEPS ACTING AS THE 
DEFAULT BROWSER
Microsoft is super keen to promote Edge as your 
browser of choice. Even choosing a different 
browser as your default doesn’t entirely stop Edge 
from popping up from time to time.
 THE FIX  
The main problem is that choosing a default program in 
the new Settings app doesn’t actually do a very thorough 
job. With browsers, for example, it leaves Edge with 
some default actions, which is why it pops up more than 
you’d expect. Fortunately, it’s fairly easy to fi x. Open the 
old Control Panel by searching for it in the Start Menu. 
Then go to Programs, Default Programs and select Set 
your default programs. This will display all installed 
applications on your computer, so scroll down and select 
your browser,. In the main panel, you’ll see how many 
default actions the selected application has. Click Set this 
program as default, and Windows will assign it to all of 
the available actions. 
THE PROBLEM 
CAN’T SIGN IN 
WITH A LOCAL 
ACCOUNT
If your computer was connected to the internet 
when you ﬁ rst set it up, Windows 10 defaults 
to using a Microsoft Account to sign into your 
computer. If you don’t want to log in this way 
anymore, you can override the setting instead.
 THE FIX  
Open the Start 
Menu and 
click Settings, 
then Accounts. 
Click the Sign 
in with a local 
account instead 
link. You’ll be 
prompted to enter 
your existing 
password, so do 
this and click 
Next.
Enter your new local username, a new password and 
a password hint, and then click Next. Finally, click Sign 
out and fi nish to complete the change, and the next time 
that you log in you will have a local account only. You 
can switch back to a Microsoft account at any point in the 
future by going back to Settings, Accounts and clicking 
the Sign in with a Microsoft account instead link.

FEATURE WINDOWS 10 ANNOYANCES
 THE FIX  
There are two issues to fi x. First, you have to 
remove all the junk you don’t want; second, 
you have to stop Windows from suggesting 
or automatically pushing more junk to your 
computer. We’ll tackle the latter fi rst. 
To stop Windows from installing apps 
on your computer automatically, you need 
to disable automatic updates. This means 
that you will have to update apps manually, 
which isn’t as secure. This is a good reason 
why Microsoft shouldn’t install junk on a 
computer without the user’s permission, so 
that we can all use automatic updates with 
confi dence.
To change the update settings, launch the 
Windows Store from the Start Menu, click 
your user icon (top right, near the search bar) 
and select Settings. Change the Update apps 
automatically setting to Off. Windows can 
now never push apps on to your computer 
automatically, or force an update.
To update any existing apps, select 
Downloads and updates from your user 
icon menu. Click Check for updates to 
manually download updates.
To turn off suggest apps in your Start 
Menu, go to Settings, Personalisation, Start. 
Change the Occasionally show suggestions 
in Start option to Off (pic above).
You can now remove all the junk 
that Microsoft installed on your 
computer. Go to Settings, System, 
Apps & Features, and you’ll see a 
list of everything that’s installed 
on your computer. Just click an 
application and then click Uninstall 
to remove it. Windows Store apps 
can also be removed using the Start 
Menu: right-click an entry and 
select Uninstall.
Windows 10 will still show 
adverts on the lock screen, but you 
can disable these. Go to Settings, 
Personalisation, Lock screen. 
Change the Background option

Live Tiles are a useful way to see 
updates from an app, but Microsoft 
often uses this feature to advertise, 
such as promoting a new game 
through Xbox Live. To prevent 
this, you have two options. First, 
you can right-click a Live Tile and 
select Unpin from Start to remove 
it. Second, you can right-click a Live 
Tile and select More, Turn live tile

THE PROBLEM WINDOWS 
10 HAS PRE-INSTALLED 
JUNK AND ADS
If you look through your Windows 10 Start Menu, you’ll probably see quite 
a few applications that you didn’t install. These programs have either been 
automatically downloaded for you by Microsoft, such as Candy Crush 
Soda Saga, or they’re ‘suggested’ apps (or adverts, as we like to call them).
With Windows 10, Microsoft has 
made handling default programs a 
little more difﬁ cult and has made 
some strange decisions. For 
example, Microsoft made Edge 
the default PDF reader, which is a 
shame, as it’s rubbish. Edge is slow 
at reading PDFs and doesn’t work 
with links. There are other examples 
of poor default program  choice, too.
 THE FIX  
Fixing default programs is 
straightforward. We’ll show you what 
to do to set a new default PDF reader, 
but the same instructions apply to other 
applications, too. 
Go to the Control Panel and ignore 
the Settings app. Go to Programs, 
Default Programs and choose Set your 
default programs. Scroll through the 
list of installed applications and 
select your PDF reader. Click ‘Set 
this program as default’, and 
you’re done. If your default changes 
again, you’ll need to repeat this 
step.

OneDrive is Microsoft’s cloud 
storage service, and it’s baked 
into Windows 10. If you sign 
in with a Microsoft account, 
OneDrive will automatically log 
in, too, and anything you save 
in the OneDrive folder will be 
automatically uploaded to the 
cloud.
 THE FIX  
OneDrive can be stopped easily 
and prevented from running 
automatically. Right-click the 
OneDrive icon in the Notifi cation 
Area and select Settings. Untick the 
Start OneDrive automatically when 
I sign into Windows box, and click

This won’t remove the OneDrive

a backup of your computer before you 
make any changes to the Registry. 
To run the editor, press Windows+R,

THE PROBLEM 
NAVIGATING THE 
START MENU IS HARD
Although Microsoft added a list view of all your 
installed applications with the Windows 10 
Anniversary Update, trying 
to ﬁ nd an app can still be a pain.
 THE FIX  
Fortunately, Microsoft also added a secret feature that lets 
you navigate the Start Menu by selecting a header letter 
(A, B, C and so on). This changes the Start Menu into an 
alphabet: select the letter you want, and you’ll jump to 
that section of the Start Menu.
THE PROBLEM 
WINDOW 
MANAGEMENT 
IS FIDDLY
Windows has some of the best window 
management controls, but Windows 10 
introduced Snap Assist. When you use 
Windows+Right Arrow or Windows+Left Arrow 
to snap a window to take up half of your desktop 
space, Windows 10 now tries to make you choose 
an app to ﬁ ll the remaining space.
 THE FIX  
If you don’t like the 
way that Windows 
10 handles window 
management, you 
can turn off the new 
features and go back 
to the Windows 7 
style of working. Go 
to Settings, System,

efore we rush into some of the brilliant, 
odd and useful apps and tools, we’re 
going to bore you about backing up 
data. It’s essential, and there’s a handy tool 
built into Windows that isn’t enabled by 
default: File History.
FILE HISTORY
File History is useful because it saves multiple 
versions of a fi le, allowing you to quickly 
revert to an earlier copy, whether that’s 
because you prefer an earlier draft or the 
most recent version has become corrupted. 
Typically, File History requires a spare storage 
device to back up to. By spare, we mean a 
drive that doesn’t already contain original 
copies of any fi le to be backed up by File 
History. For example, a computer 
with an SSD for Windows and 
applications, and a mechanical hard 
disk for documents, fi les and data, 
might not be able to use File History 
as both drives will be providing 
source fi les (and therefore neither 
can be a destination).
There are two workarounds, the 
fi rst being to link File History to a 
separate drive. This can be a NAS, 
a USB device, or another device 
attached internally. In this case, 
setup is easy. Open the Start menu 
(hitting the Windows key on your 
keyboard is quickest) type backup 
settings, then select the Backup 
Settings option. The Backup settings 
page should appear, and you just 
need to click the big plus icon 
labelled Add a drive. Windows will 
start searching for suitable drives 
for a File History backup; if you 
want to back up to your NAS, click 
the Show all network locations link, 
then select the NAS folder you want 
to back up to. Provide your NAS 
login details, and you’ll see the big 
plus sign button turn into an on/off 
toggle.
Whether your machine has 
multiple ‘source’ drives or just the 
one storage device, you can still use 
File History by tricking Windows 
into thinking you have a network-
shared folder. Create a new folder 
on the drive where you want to store 
your backups. Then share this folder 
with yourself by right-clicking 
it, selecting Share with and then 
Specifi c people. Select yourself from 
the list of people to share with and 
click Share, and then Done.
This folder won’t be picked up 
by the Add a drive process above, 
so instead click More options and 
then See advanced settings. An 
old-style Control Panel window will 
appear. Click Select drive from the 
list of options on the left and then 
select Add network location from 
the options below the main box. 
Then fi nd your shared folder via the 
Select Folder search that appears. 
Beyond Windows 10’s ﬂ ashy Live Tiles and glossy 
default apps lie many more hidden apps, tools 
and abilities. From making your screen look better 
to protecting your precious data and advanced 
features for coding, playing and managing your 
PC, there’s plenty on offer. The trick is ﬁ nding all 
these features, which is where we step in.

Once you’ve selected the folder (it 
should appear in the main box), you 
can click OK. You’ll be returned 
to that fi rst Control-Panel style 
window, although now your shared 
folder is set as the destination.
However you enable File History, 
you can refi ne the folders protected 
by clicking More options on the 
main Backup screen and adding 
or removing folders. Just click on 
any of the folders listed and then 
click Remove, or else scroll down to 
add other folders – we recommend 
removing music, video and picture 
folders, as backing up these large 
fi les hourly will kill the performance 
of your PC or network. 
To use File History, right-click 
on the fi le you want to restore, 
click Properties and then open the 
Previous Versions tab to select the 
version of the fi le you want to revert 
to.
STORAGE SENSE
While we’re talking about storage 
devices, there’s a little-known tool 
called Storage Sense, which can 
automatically remove fi les to free up 
disk space. Go to Settings, Storage 
and make sure that Storage Sense 
is enabled (click the toggle if it’s 
not). To check that Windows isn’t 
going to do anything annoying 
automatically, click Change how we 
free up space. We hope the options 
are expanded in future updates, 
but the default options to delete 
temporary fi les and empty the 
recycle bin bought us 4GB of extra 
storage space.
  Use File History to back up critical files regularly, up to every 10 
minutes
CALIBRATE DISPLAY COLOUR
The Calibrate Display Colour tool 
can help you get the best out of your 
screen. However, if you’re serious 
about digital art – whether image, 
photo, animation or video – you 
should use a dedicated calibration 
tool to ensure that the colours 
you see on your screen will be 
refl ected in your prints, broadcasts 
or showings. If you use your screen 
with any other device, you should 
use the screen’s calibration tools to 
ensure the best picture whatever the 
input. The Calibrate Display Colour 
tool is a subjective, software-based 
tweaking tool.
Search for ‘calibrate’ in the Start 
menu and launch the tool, and 
then ensure it’s maximised. Follow 
the steps to tweak various levels, 
fi nding the best balance and colour 
tone. If you want to go back a step, 
use the Back arrow at the top-left; 
you can also ditch all changes at the 
end of the process. 
Once the colour calibration is 
done, you’ll be invited to calibrate 
ClearType too. This is worth doing 
as it will make text easier to read on 
your screen (search for ‘cleartype’ 
to use this tool).
NIGHT LIGHT
Being exposed to blue light after 
sunset has become a concern lately, 
so Windows 10 offers a night-light 
mode in the Creators Update that 
combats this. Search for ‘night light’ 
and use the toggle to enable the 
feature. You can change the colour 
temperature at night, making the 
light more or less warm (adjusting how yellow 
it looks) and schedule the change to coincide 
with sunset and sunrise in your location. 
The change in colour tone takes a few seconds 
to occur, so it’s not too jarring.
BACKGROUND SCROLLING
Having to select a window manually 
before scrolling through its contents can be 
distracting. For example, if you’re working

from a website, why should you repeatedly 
have to click the browser? A feature called 
background scrolling fi xes this. When it’s 
enabled, you just hover your cursor over a 
window and use your mouse’s scroll wheel 
to navigate the content.
Search the Start menu for ‘mouse’ and then 
enable Scroll inactive windows when I hover 
over them.
GET LINUX ON WINDOWS
For those more creative with code than 
colours, there’s the exciting news that 
September’s major Windows update will 
enable Bash on Windows. But why wait 
when you can have a fully operational 
Linux shell running on Windows 10 now? 
This secret tool isn’t some virtual machine 
trickery, either: it really is a Linux 
terminal running in Windows 10. 
You can even access your Windows 
fi les from the terminal and your 
Linux fi les from Windows.
The fi rst step is to enable 
Developer Mode. Search the Start 
menu for ‘use developer features’ 
and select Developer mode (instead 
of the default, Sideload apps). Agree 
to the warning, and then search for 
‘turn windows features on or off’. 
When the old-style Control Panel 
window loads, scroll down to tick 
the box next to Windows Subsystem 
for Linux (beta), usually referred to 
as WSL. Once ticked, click OK and 
wait for WSL to install. Once that’s 
done, you’ll need to reboot your PC.
Open a command prompt by 
typing cmd into the Start menu and 
selecting Command Prompt. On 
the text-only window that appears, 
type bash and hit Enter. Wait for the 
software to download and install. 
You’ll be invited to change the locale 
(unless your system uses US English 
as its default language) and to set 
up a username and password for 
your Linux account. An easier way 
to launch your Linux subsystem 
is with the Bash on Ubuntu on 
Windows icon now in your Start 
menu.
You can download software and 
tools into your WSL using apt just 
as you would on any Linux-only 
computer (sudo apt-get install 
{package}), and navigate, code, 
work and so on in the same way 
too. Your Linux fi les are stored 
in C:\Users\[Win_User_Name]\
AppData\Local\lxss\home\[Linux_
User_Name]. You can only access 
this folder by typing that address 
(substituting the appropriate 
usernames) into a File Explorer 
address bar. 
Windows fi les can be accessed 
from WSL via the /mnt/ folder, 
so cd /mnt/c moves you to the C:\ 
drive, and cd /mnt/c/Documents 
will move you to your Windows-
based Documents folder. Note that 
the Linux terminal is case-sensitive, 
so ‘cd /mnt/c/documents’ will 
produce an error.
GOD MODE
It’s your computer, so you should 
be the boss or even greater via God 
Mode. To enable this mode, open 
a Windows Explorer window and 
head to C:\, then create a new folder 
called GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-
465E-825C-99712043E01C}. Once you 
hit Enter the folder icon will change 
to a system tool icon, the name will 
disappear and you have enabled 
God Mode.

BATTERY REPORT
If your laptop has seen a couple of years’ worth of hard use you might be 
getting suspicious about its battery: is it holding its charge like it used to, 
or are you just working it harder? Many laptops have a built-in battery 
checker in the BIOS, and might even have a software tool to check its 
soundness. However, Windows 10 has a built-in tool that will work with 
any laptop.
Press Windows-X to open the alternative Start menu, then launch 
PowerShell (Admin). Command Prompt (Admin) will work too if you 
haven’t upgraded. Then type powercfg /batteryreport and hit Enter. After 
a while PowerShell will tell you that an HTML ﬁ le called battery-report.
html has been created in C:\Users\[Name]. Open this ﬁ le and you can read 
about how old your battery is, its maximum charge, how many charge 
cycles it has suff ered and so on.
MOUNT VIRTUAL CD AND DVD DRIVES
As laptops tend not to have optical drives these days, Windows 10’s ability 
to mount disc images (such as ISO or IMG) as virtual discs might be useful. 
Create an image of the disc that you want to read on your main computer 
(or that external optical drive you can now leave at home) with a third-
party tool such as ImgBurn (www.majorgeeks.com/ﬁ les/imgburn.html). 
Once you’ve copied your disc image to your laptop (or whichever Windows 
10 PC you fancy), just right-click on the image ﬁ le and click Mount. It will 
appear as a virtual disc in a virtual drive in This PC. This trick is just as 
useful for retro-gamers with games spanning multiple discs or running 
partially from their noisy and slow DVD drive.
TRICKS FOR LAPTOPS
WHILE THE TIPS IN THE MAIN ARTICLE APPLY TO LAPTOPS AND DESKTOPS, WINDOWS 
HAS A FEW TOOLS THAT ARE JUST FOR MOBILE DEVICES. HERE ARE SOME OF THE BEST
  Use ImgBurn and Windows 10 to turn software DVDs and CDs 
into virtual discs
access, alter and tweak. There’s not 
much that can’t be found elsewhere, 
or just with a Start search, but 
at least everything you need is 
gathered in one place.
POWERSHELL
To increase the basic abilities of 
Windows, switch the standard 
Command Prompt for the more 
advance PowerShell. Search the 
Start menu for ‘taskbar settings’ 
and make sure that the Replace 
Command Prompt with Windows 
PowerShell is turned on (this is the 
default in the Creators Update). 
PowerShell has all the abilities of 
Command Prompt but adds mouse 
support, and more commands and 
functions.
STOP BACKGROUND 
APPS
Windows runs a lot of apps in 
the background by default, some 
of which you may never use or 
want. Time to cull them: search for 
‘choose which apps can run in the 
background’ and disable all the ones 
that you don’t need, want or even 
recognise. You might even choose to 
turn off all background apps (with 
the main toggle at the top of the page), but this 
means that useful things such as Calendar, 
News and Weather won’t update until you 
specifi cally launch them.
MANAGE VPNS
Loading a separate application to manage 
your VPN connection is a little old-school 
when Windows 10 can manage your third-
party VPN connection. Search the Start menu 
for ‘VPN’ and select Change virtual private 
networks (VPN) and click the big plus sign. 
Select Windows (built-in) as the VPN provider, 
name the connection after your actual 
provider and then enter the server details for 
your VPN server (your VPN provider should 
provide this) and the corresponding VPN 
type.
You can enter your VPN login details, but 
that’s hardly super-secure; or you could just 
enter your username so that every time you 
connect to the VPN you need only supply 
your password. Click Save, and now when 
you open your Network Connections, you’ll 
see your VPN service listed too – much neater 
than a separate app.
The only downside is that the Windows 
built-in VPN tool doesn’t support the 
OpenVPN standard, which many regard to 
be the most secure; those same experts are 
sniffy about the PPTP standard.
  Prevent apps from running in the 
background – this preserves privacy, 
reduces memory load and increases 
battery life
  Use Windows to handle your VPN 
connection for maximum neatness

T 
he trouble with most bits of electronics is that when they 
break, it’s generally cheaper to replace rather than repair 
them. Fortunately, the PC is swimming against this tide 
and is the one bit of kit that you can easily repair yourself.
This is largely thanks to the desktop PC’s modular build, 
which lets manufacturers (or you) put together components from 
different companies. The same fl exibility makes it relatively easy 
to switch out components for new ones.
Laptop owners aren’t as lucky, but many models have 
exchangeable components, such as hard disks and memory, so 
some repairs are possible.
The real trick is knowing which component to swap out, or 
which bit of software to update. In this guide, we’ll take you 
through the most common components and issues with a PC (and 
laptop where appropriate). 
Given how technical PC & Tech Authority readers are, we’ve 
assumed that you’ve tried all of the usual tricks, such as running 
Windows Update and updating drivers and software. Instead, 
we’ll show you how to correctly diagnose a fault and the steps 
you need to make the correct fi x. 
Before you get started, it’s worth reiterating the danger that 
static electricity poses to sensitive components. After you open the 
inside of your PC, you should, at a minimum, tap the unpainted 
part of a radiator to discharge yourself. Anti-static wrist straps do

  Insert a metal paperclip into 
pins 16 and 17 to see if your 
PSU still works
If your PSU has gone, then replacing it is a job 
that’s more fi ddly then it is hard. It’s easiest to 
replace like-for-like. Take the side off of your 
PC’s case and look at the label on the power 
supply, as this will tell you its rated output. If 
your PSU is rated at 550W or below, the EVGA 
Supernova GS 550W is a good choice. If your 
PSU is rated at above 550W, buy the Corsair 
RM750i. Don’t buy cheap, unbranded power 
supplies. Also take photos of the inside of 
your PC for reference.
To remove your old power supply, you fi rst 
need to disconnect its cables. You’ll have two 
for the motherboard (one 24-pin connector, 
plus an auxiliary 4-pin or 8-pin connector); 
SATA connectors for each hard disk, SSD and 
optical drive; and one or two for the graphics 
card. Look for any places where power cables 
have been cable-tied to the case, as you’ll need 
to cut these with a pair of scissors. You may 
need to take the other side of the case off, as 
PC manufacturers often run cables on this 
side of the case to keep cables tidy.
Once all the cables have been disconnected, 
unscrew the power 
supply from the back 
of the case, then slide 
it forwards and lift 
it out. Note which 
way the PSU’s fan 
was pointing, then 
orientate your new power supply’s 
fan to face the same way. Slide the 
new supply into the case and screw 
it in place. 
Now you need to plug the cables 
back in. The new power supplies 
we recommended are modular, 
which means you only need 
to connect the cables that you 
require: the instructions that 
came with it will show you how. Follow your 
visual photo guide to plug in all the power 
connectors, following the same routes and 
cable tidying. Power connectors can only plug 
in one way, so you can’t make a mistake. Plug 
the power back in and start your computer.
     THE FIX 
PSU
Power supply units (PSUs) often go with a loud pop and an acrid 
smell pouring out of them. They can also break with a whimper, 
and a PSU can just stop working without any real signs of 
damage.
Common to both scenarios is that your PC will no longer 
turn on. With a laptop, you can usually tell if the power supply 
has gone, because you won’t see a light on the external box. Try 
changing the cable that plugs into the wall fi rst; if you get no luck, 
you can just buy a new adaptor from the manufacturer. 
For desktop PCs, before you rip out the PSU, try changing the 
power cable, just in case the fuse in that has blown.
Diagnosis beyond this is a little tricky. A PC that fails to turn 
on can have an issue with the motherboard or the processor. In 
our experience, the PSU is at fault in the majority of cases when a 
PC will not turn on.
If you’re confi dent 
rooting around inside a PC, there is a simple test, where you 
insert a paperclip into the motherboard’s 24-pin connector to 
turn it on. If the PSU spins up, then the fault is probably with 
the motherboard. If you’re going to risk doing this test, we 
recommend unplugging all PSU leads from inside your case 
fi rst (see the section on fi xing the issue below). Turn off your PC 
at the wall. Take the big 24-pin connector and match it up to the 
diagram above. Insert a paperclip (remove any plastic covering 
from it) into pins 16 and 17. This connects the pins together, 
causing the PSU to turn on, in a similar way to pressing the 
power switch.
With the paperclip in place, you can put the ATX connector 
down, but ensure the paperclip is not touching anything metal. 
Now turn on your PC at the socket to see if the PSU works.

RAM
RAM problems can be really annoying, 
and the effects can vary depending on 
the issue. When RAM has a major problem, 
your computer may not turn on at all, or the 
fans may spin, but your monitor will stay 
dark. This kind of error is comparatively 
rare and, usually, dodgy RAM will cause 
intermittent and seemingly inexplicable crashes. Fortunately, 
both kinds of problems are fairly straightforward to fi x.
If your computer doesn’t turn on at all, then you need to 
jump straight to the fi x section below. If you’re experiencing 
random crashes, you need to run a memory diagnostic. 
Fortunately, Windows has a built-in 
tool that can help. Click Start and 
type ‘memory’, then select Windows 
Memory Diagnostic. In the dialog box 
that appears, click ‘Restart now and 
check for problems’ and your computer 
will reboot and run an automatic 
memory check. When the test has completed your PC will restart. 
If any errors were found, you’ll get a pop-up message telling you; 
if you don’t, then your RAM is fi ne and your PC problems are 
caused by another issue.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
All desktop PCs and some laptops can have 
their memory fi xed if there’s a problem with 
it. First, note down how much RAM you have. 
In Windows go to Control Panel, System and 
Security, System and you’ll see your RAM 
listed under ‘Installed memory (RAM)’. 
Now, you’re ready to expose your 
computer’s memory. For PCs, you’ll need to 
remove the side of the case. For a laptop, it 
depends on whether the memory is accessible. 
Typically, ultra-portable and convertible 
laptops have the memory soldered to the 
motherboard and aren’t user-serviceable.
For other laptops, RAM is either located 
under the keyboard or on the bottom of the 
laptop. First, check the underside of your 
laptop and look for a small panel. Remove 
any securing screws and then remove the 
panel to expose the RAM.
If there’s no panel, then your RAM may 
be located under the keyboard. You’ll know 
     THE FIX 
whether the keyboard is removable 
if there’s a gap around the board 
with notches big enough for a small 
fl at-head screwdriver. Turn off 
your laptop, and gently insert a 
small fl at-head screwdriver into 
the notches around the keyboard. 
For each one, use the screwdriver 
as a lever to unfasten the clips 
securing the keyboard. Remove 
the keyboard carefully without 
stressing the ribbon connecting it to 
the motherboard, and place it gently 
next to the laptop.
With the RAM exposed, take a 
quick picture, so you can see how 
many sticks you have installed and 
the slots in which they’re inserted. 
With desktop PCs, if you’ve got two 
or more sticks of RAM, they’ll most 
likely be installed in matching pairs.

If your problem is that your computer won’t 
turn on, then you should see if the RAM is to 
blame. First, push the edges of the memory 
sticks to make sure that it is inserted properly, 
then try turning on your PC. If you’re not 
having any luck, try removing all the RAM 
and then testing it one stick at a time. This 
will only work if you have multiple sticks of 
memory; if your computer has just the one 
stick, then we recommend looking at the other 
potential problems fi rst before taking a punt 
HOW TO REMOVE RAM
Removing RAM depends on whether it’s 
laptop or desktop memory. On a desktop, 
look for the retaining clips and push down 
on the side to eject the memory (some 
motherboards’ memory slots have just 
the one clip, so simply push this down). 
Lift the memory stick out vertically. 
Repeat for all sticks of RAM.
On laptops, push the two retaining clips 
sideways, and the stick of RAM will pop out. 
Pull it away from the slot, and repeat this 
action for all the sticks of RAM.

  Windows has a built-in memory diagnostic 
tool that can tell you if you’ve got any dodgy 
sticks of RAM
  If your RAM is located under the keyboard, 
you’ll need to remove it carefully without 
stretching the connecting cable
  Most user serviceable laptops have RAM located on 
the underside of the chassis

on replacing the RAM.
First, remove the RAM as described in the 
box opposite, below. Now, look for the lowest 
numbered RAM slot on your motherboard. 
This should be written on the motherboard, 
but check its manual to be sure; your laptop’s 
manual should carry the same information.
Insert one stick of RAM into the slot you 
identifi ed, following the installation guide in 
the box on the right.
Now turn your computer back on. If it 
powers on, then the fault is likely to be with 
another stick. Repeat this procedure until 
you’ve been through all the sticks of RAM 
and have found the faulty one. To replace the 
memory, see below. If your computer still 
doesn’t power on, then the problem could be 
the motherboard or PSU.
FIXING RAM WHEN A 
FAULT IS DETECTED
If the memory diagnostic tool detected an 
error, what you need to do depends on how 
many sticks of RAM you have. If you have 
one, then you need to replace it; if you have 
two, then replace both; if you have more than 
two, you need to work out which stick is 
causing problems.
To do this, remove all the RAM from your 
computer following the instructions in the 
box opposite. Find the lowest-numbered slot 
on your motherboard or laptop (the supplied 
manuals should state this). Now insert 
HOW TO INSTALL RAM
With desktop RAM you need to line up the notch in the memory stick with the divider in the 
memory slot. Press ﬁ rmly down on both sides until the retaining clips lock into place. 
With laptop RAM, you need to insert the RAM at an angle of approximately 30 degrees. Line 
up the notch in the RAM with the divider in the RAM slot and push the memory stick in securely. 
Finally, push down on the top of the RAM until the retaining clips lock into place.

one stick of RAM following the 
instructions in the box above, turn

memory diagnostic. Repeat for all 
RAM and note down which stick or 
sticks are the bad ones. For systems 
with four or more sticks of RAM, 
when you fi nd one dodgy stick, look 
for its matching pair: both should 
be replaced. You’re now ready to 
replace your computer’s memory.
REPLACING RAM
Once you’ve found out which stick 
of RAM to change, you need to 
replace it. Look at the RAM you 
need to replace and it should tell you 
how big each stick is and the type, 
but Google the model number if 
you’re not sure. You can then ensure 
that you’re replacing your RAM 
with the right amount. Use the total 
amount of RAM that Windows told 
you was installed as a guide.
The easiest way to fi nd compatible 
memory is to use Crucial’s Advisor 
tool (crucial.com/usa/en/advisor). 
Using the drop-down menus, 
you can select your PC, laptop or 
motherboard manufacturer and 
model number, and then get a list of 
compatible RAM. 
For this article, as we’re covering 
repairs and not upgrades, the easiest 
thing to do is to choose replacement 
RAM that matches your broken 
memory exactly. So choose a set that 
has the same total memory size and number 
of sticks of RAM. Don’t worry about buying 
the most expensive on offer, as premium 
RAM makes very little difference to system 
performance; the lower-cost RAM is just as 
good in our experience.
When you have the memory in your 
possession, insert it, following the instructions 
in the box above. Use your original picture as 
a reference, to ensure that you put the memory 
back in the slots that were already used.
When you power on your computer you’ll 
need to go into its BIOS (or UEFI for newer 
computers) to make a few changes. This 
is because PCs default to running RAM at 
slower speeds for compatibility reasons; to 
get your memory running optimally you need 
to enable the correct profi le.
To get into the BIOS you normally hit 
Del, F10 or F12, but look out for an onscreen 
message or check your computer’s manual for 
more details. Look for the memory setting and 
for an XMP (eXtreme Memory Profi le) setting. 
Select the option and choose the fi rst profi le. 
Save your settings and exit the BIOS, and your 
memory will run at its optimum speed.

HARD DISK/SSD
Fatal hard disk errors are usually easy to 
diagnose, as your computer will fail to 
detect the disk or Windows will not boot. A 
‘kerchunk, kerchunk’ noise from a mechanical 
disk is another tell-tale sign. In this situation, 
there’s nothing you can do, and the old myth 
about putting your disk in the freezer won’t 
change anything. You’ll need to buy a new 
hard disk, restore a backup of your data, and 
reinstall Windows. If you don’t have a backup 
and you’ve lost some important fi les, you’ll 
need to send your disk to a recovery specialist; 
be warned, this can be expensive.
If your hard disk is working, it doesn’t mean it won’t 
break soon, and there are some audible tell-tale signs of 
impending disaster that you can listen out for. A high-pitched 
whine, grinding noise or beeping are all clear signs that there’s 
something wrong. This doesn’t always 
happen, and SSDs are silent, so you should run 
regular diagnostic tests on any drives.
Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting 
Technology, or the far easier to say SMART, 
is a technology built into all hard disks and 
SSDs. In effect, every disk monitors itself for 
problems as an early-warning system. With 
the right software, you can read the SMART 
information and get an early warning about 
a hard disk failure. Download and install 
the free PassMark DiskCheckup application 
(www.passmark.com/products/diskcheckup.
htm). Run the program, and you’ll see all your hard disks listed 
under ‘SMART-enabled Devices’. Select one and click the SMART 
Info tab. All values should be listed as ‘OK’; if you see any 
warnings, then it’s a sign that your hard disk is on the way out. 
You should back it up and replace it.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
All desktop hard disks can be replaced, and a 
lot of laptop disks can, too. The big exceptions 
are ultra-portable and 2-in-1 devices, where 
the SSD is usually physically soldered to the 
motherboard and will need special repair in a 
shop or by the manufacturer.
If your diagnostic SMART test didn’t throw 
up any errors, then any mysterious noises you 
may have heard are likely to be caused by 
vibration from mechanical disks. This largely 
affects desktop computers. To try to fi x the 
problem, you can move your PC a little in case 
it’s sitting up against a table leg. If that doesn’t 
do anything, then remove the side of your 
PC’s case and tighten up any hard disk fi xings 
inside. These may be standard screws, thumb 
screws or push-in screwless brackets.
If you did get an error in the SMART test, 
then it’s time to replace it, cloning your old 
hard disk to the new one. If your hard disk 
has stopped working entirely, you’ll need to 
replace it and perform a clean installation 
of Windows. How you do this depends on 
whether you have a laptop or desktop PC.
REPLACE A DESKTOP 
HARD DISK
Replacing a desktop computer’s drive is easier, 
as you’ve got spare SATA and power points. 
If you’ve got a desktop computer, you need to 
buy a replacement hard disk or SSD. 
     THE FIX 
If you’re replacing a hard 
drive that is working but 
has failed its SMART test, 
the easiest thing to do is 
to buy one that’s the same 
size or larger than the total 
amount of storage you’re 
currently using. You can 
check this in Windows by 
going to Computer, right-
clicking your hard disk and 
selecting Properties. In the 
dialog box that appears, you can see 
the ‘Used space’. If you buy a hard 
disk that’s smaller than this, you’ll 
need to delete or back up some fi les 
to use the Clone tool.
If your old disk has failed, you 
can buy any sized hard disk. As

problems before they become a major issue

REPLACE A LAPTOP HARD DISK
Replacing a laptop’s hard disk is a little 
trickier. First, you’ll need to fi nd the disk. If 
the laptop has a replaceable hard disk, it will 
be located behind a fl ap on the bottom of 
your laptop. The fl ap will usually be secured 
with one or more screws.
Remove any screws holding it in place and 
pull out the disk. This may require you to slide 
it away from the SATA connectors fi rst. If the 
disk is in a caddy, unscrew and remove it.
Now measure the thickness of the drive: 
this is the maximum thickness of drive that 
you can install. Typically, most SSDs will fi t 
in most laptops, but some thicker mechanical

You can buy a 
disk that’s thinner 
than your current

has a caddy, you 
won’t have any 
problems, as you can just screw in

MOTHERBOARD
A motherboard fault is one of the hardest to detect, as the symptoms are often 
the same as for other problems. Typically, if there’s something wrong with your 
motherboard, your PC will either not turn on, or you’ll just get a black screen. Given 
that replacing the motherboard is a fairly signifi cant task, it’s best to rule out other 
problems fi rst. 
Following our advice in this feature, you should check your RAM, power supply 
unit, graphics card, processor and monitor. If none of these fi xes your issue, then you 
may well have a motherboard problem. 
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
First, try opening the side of your case and 
removing all the expansion cards (bar the 
graphics card, if you have one). You’ll need to 
unscrew the retaining clip and then pull the 
card towards you. Next, unplug any external 
devices (keyboard, mouse, printer and so 
on), bar your monitor. Try turning on your 
computer again. If it boots up, then it’s an 
expansion card or external device problem. 
Power down your PC, then reconnect the 
external devices one by one to see which, if 
any, is causing the problem. Next, re-insert 
your expansion cards one at a time. Insert 
them back into their slots and then re-insert 
the retaining screw. Turn the computer on 
after each one to see if the problem persists.
If you still don’t have any luck, then you 
can try resetting your CMOS. This wipes all 
BIOS settings, so you’ll need to confi gure 
them again. To do this, you’ll need your 
motherboard’s manual. Look for the reset 
jumper or button. If it’s the former, you need 
to take the jumper off of its existing pins 
and connect the two pins highlighted in the 
manual. For a button, press and hold it. 
Now press your PC’s power button. The 
fans may briefl y spin, but your computer will 
not turn on. Now put the jumper back in its 
original position, or release the reset button. 
     THE FIX 
Power your computer back on. If it 
works, you’ll need to set up your 
BIOS again. If it doesn’t, then the 
motherboard needs replacing. 
To do this, you fi rst need to know 
the make and model of your existing 
board. This should be written on it 
in fairly big letters, but it will also 
be written in the motherboard’s 
manual. The easiest thing to do is 
to make a like-for-like replacement. 
If you can’t fi nd your board still for 
sale, then you should still Google 
the model number and visit the 
manufacturer’s website. You need 
to note down the socket type, such 
as LGA1151 for Intel; the chipset 
used; and the size of board (ATX or 
microATX). You can then use this 
information to fi nd a similar motherboard 
for sale from another manufacturer. 
Before you buy any motherboard, visit the 
manufacturer’s website to ensure that the 
model you have chosen is compatible with 
the model of CPU that you have.
To remove your motherboard, you’ll need 
to unplug all the cables plugged into it (see 
‘Loose cables’, page 100, for a guide on how 
to do this). Once done, you’ll need to remove 
the screws that hold the motherboard in 
place. Search carefully, as it’s easy to miss 
one. Once you’ve done this, the motherboard 
will be loose. Slide the board towards the front 
of the case and then lift it out. 
Follow the RAM guide and the CPU guide 
to remove the memory and processor. Finally, 
from the outside of the case, tap the backplate 
(the area where all your ports are) to knock 
this out. Open your new motherboard and 
remove its backplate. Hold this up to the 
motherboard, so you know which way round 
it goes, then push it from inside the case 
until it clicks into place. 
Lower the new motherboard into your case, 
then push it towards the back until its ports 
push through the backplate’s holes. Screw it 
into position. Then follow the RAM and CPU 
guides elsewhere in this feature to install 
these components. Reconnect all the cables, 
power on your PC and confi gure your BIOS.
  Try removing every expansion card if your PC won’t 
boot to see if any of them are faulty

cleanly remove your old Intel processor
CPU
It’s rare for a processor, or CPU, to break completely. When one does, your 
motherboard will usually make a beeping noise: check the manufacturer’s website or 
the motherboard manual to see what the beep code means. If your PC won’t turn on at 
all and doesn’t make a noise, then it could be the motherboard, so check the diagnosis 
opposite fi rst. If you’re not having any luck, follow the guide below to remove your 
CPU and then turn on your PC; if it beeps, then it’s probably your CPU; if it doesn’t, 
the motherboard has most likely failed.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Replacing a CPU is straightforward, provided 
that you buy the same make and model as you 
had before. If you buy a different model, then 
you have to ensure it’s compatible; check the 
motherboard manufacturer’s website. 
To remove the CPU, you fi rst need to 
remove the CPU fan. This is done slightly 
differently depending on whether you have an 
Intel or an AMD processor.
INTEL CPUS
For an Intel processor, use a screwdriver to 
turn the retaining clips in the direction that 
the arrows show. Pull the legs up and lift off 
the heatsink and fan. Use the lever to open the 
processor cage and lift the processor up. 
Now, line your new processor up with the 
socket (an arrow on the corner of the CPU 
lines up with the corner of the socket missing 
a pin). Lower the processor cage down and 
     THE FIX 
push down the lever. Your processor 
would have shipped with a new 
cooler, pre-coated with thermal 
paste. To use this, make sure that 
the cooler’s legs are turned in the 
opposite direction to the arrows 
printed on them. Put the heatsink 
on the processor, lining the legs up 
with the holes in the motherboard. 
Push two diagonally opposite legs 
down fi rst, then the remaining two. 
They will click into place.  
AMD CPUS
With an AMD processor, to remove 
the heatsink, lift the handle up. 
You can now remove the clip attached to the 
handle from the processor socket’s tab. Lift 
the cooler slightly and then slide the opposite 
side to the handle off of the socket’s tabs.
Lift the processor socket’s handle and 
then lift the CPU straight out. Line the new 
CPU up with the processor socket and then 
drop its pins into the socket’s holes. It should 
drop into place. Push the handle down to 
lock it into place.
Your processor should come with a new 
cooler, complete with thermal paste on it. 
To attach this, lift its handle, so that one clip 
moves freely. First, push the clips on the 
opposite side to the cooler’s handle onto the 
tabs on the processor socket. 
Next, drop the cooler down on to the 
processor. Now, push down on the clip 
that’s attached to the handle until it 
attaches to its clip on the processor socket. 
Push the handle down to lock it into 
place. 
For both Intel and AMD coolers, make 
sure that the fan’s power cable is plugged 
into the CPU power header on the 
motherboard. Now, turn on your computer 
and, if prompted, confi gure your BIOS 
settings.
FOR BOTH INTEL 
AND AMD COOLERS, 
MAKE SURE THAT THE 
FAN’S POWER CABLE IS 
PLUGGED INTO THE CPU 
POWER HEADER ON THE

LOOSE CABLES
Cables inside your computer are generally well held in by friction, but vibration and 
general use can work them loose over time. If you’re getting intermittent faults or fi nd 
that a device isn’t always detected, a loose cable could be the reason.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Power down your computer and take the side 
off the case. Trace all of the cables coming 
from the power supply and push them into 
their sockets. Use only gentle force so you 
don’t cause any damage.
These cables will include two power leads 
     THE FIX 
for the motherboard, power cables 
for hard disks and optical drives 
and, potentially, a power cable for 
the graphics card. 
Next, move to the SATA data 
cables. These connect at one end to 
the motherboard and, at the other, to 
a hard disk or optical drive. Ensure 
that these cables are pushed in 
securely. Front USB and audio ports connect 
to ports on the motherboard, so make sure 
that these are connected fi rmly. Finally, fans 
connect to headers on the motherboard or 
adaptors plugged into your power supply, so 
follow their power cables back and ensure that 
they’re properly connected.
  Try removing a graphics card to see 
if it’s at fault
  Loose cables can cause all kinds of problems, so 
make sure that yours are properly in place
MONITOR/GRAPHICS CARD
If your monitor won’t turn on but you can hear your PC power 
up, you’ve got one of the most irritating problems. Without the 
display, you can’t see any error messages or get any help. The fault 
can be with your monitor or your PC. 
Check that your monitor has a power light fi rst. If it doesn’t, try 
switching power leads. When the monitor turns on, try plugging 
it into a different PC, such as a friend’s computer. If it doesn’t work 
there, try a different monitor cable. If you’ve still had no luck, 
you’ll need a new monitor. If the monitor and cable are fi ne, the 
problem is with your PC.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
A loose connection inside your PC’s case could cause a problem. 
While the case is open, press down gently on the graphics card 
(if you have one), and any other expansion cards. Make sure you 
have a pair of speakers or headphones plugged into your PC, 
then turn the power back on. If the monitor doesn’t come back on, 
listen for the  Windows startup sound. If you hear it, then it’s 
a graphics problem. This issue can be with a dedicated graphics 
card or an issue with the graphics outputs on your motherboard.
The fi rst thing to do is to try an alternative output from your 
computer, such as switching to HDMI or VGA. If your monitor has 
only a DVI input, then an HDMI-to-DVI adaptor costs just a few 
pounds from Maplin. Alternatively, you can try plugging your 
     THE FIX 
computer into an LCD TV via HDMI. If you get joy here, you’ve 
got a workaround.
If you’re not having any luck, then the options depend on your 
PC. If you have a graphics card but your motherboard has video 
outputs, you can try removing the graphics card. Take the side 
of the case off. Remove the retaining screw or screws holding 
the graphics card in place. Detach any power cables plugged into 
the graphics card (they have a clip that you release with thumb 
pressure). Move the clip holding the graphics card in its slot and 
then pull it fi rmly upwards and out. Now, connect your monitor 
to one of your motherboard’s outputs and turn on your PC. If 
you get a picture, the fault was with your graphics card. If you 
don’t have a graphics card, you could try to fi t one. A basic card 
is quite cheap. When it arrives, open up the side of your case and 
plug the new graphics card into the big PCI-E x16 graphics card 
slot (see image, below). You’ll need to unscrew and remove the 
blanking plate at the back of the case fi rst. Push the card in fi rmly 
until it clicks into place (the XFX card we suggested doesn’t need 
power, so there’s nothing else to do). Plug your monitor into the 
graphics card and turn on your PC. If it still doesn’t work, then 
you’ll need a specialist to look at it, as the problem could be your 
motherboard, power supply, processor or RAM.
  This PCI-E slot is where you plug

BROKEN BIOS SETTINGS
If your computer can’t fi nd the right boot hard disk, it’s overly 
noisy or you get a ‘checksum error’ when you turn it on, your 
BIOS may not be set up correctly. This is particularly true after 
you’ve had a motherboard battery failure (see below). 
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Restart your computer and enter the BIOS. Your motherboard’s 
manual will tell you which key to press, but Delete, F2 and F10 
are all common choices. Every BIOS has a slightly different layout 
and modern ones have a graphical interface that you can control 
with a mouse. However, most have similar names for settings, 
so you can follow our advice, but you may have to refer to your 
motherboard’s manual for the exact instructions.
First, check your boot device priority, which is usually listed in 
the Boot menu. This defi nes which device your BIOS tries to boot 
from fi rst, second, third and so on. It’s usual to have Removable 
Devices (USB drives, in other words) fi rst, then the optical drive 
and then your primary hard disk. You can change an option by 
using the cursor keys to select an entry, hitting Enter to bring up a 
menu of choices and using your cursor keys to select an item.
Make sure that your main hard disk is listed as the fi rst hard 
disk in the list and, most likely, third overall. Hard disks are 
identifi ed by manufacturer and model in the BIOS: inside your 
case, you’ll see the same information printed on a label on each 
hard disk.
     THE FIX 
Some BIOSes won’t 
list all hard disks in 
this menu and have a 
secondary Hard Disk 
Drives priority menu. In 
this menu, you need to 
select your main hard 
disk as the fi rst option. 
You’ll then see it listed 
correctly in the Boot 
Device Priority menu.
If you fi nd that 
Windows crashes part way through booting, it could be because 
your SATA ports are confi gured incorrectly, particularly if you 
had a fl at battery. Go to the main menu and fi nd the Storage 
Confi guration menu. If you see an option to confi gure the SATA 
ports as IDE, change the option to AHCI.
You may need to reset your RAM settings, too. Look for the 
XMP (eXtreme Memory Profi le) setting. Select the option and 
choose the fi rst profi le. This will set your RAM to run at the 
correct speed.
Finally, if your computer is very loud, it could be the fan power 
management. Go to the Power menu and look for the Hardware 
Monitor option. You should see some Fan Control options; 
when you enable them, you’ll be able to pick a profi le. Go for 
the quietest-sounding option, such as Silent. Your PC will now 
automatically control the fan speed based on the temperature 
of internal components, keeping everything cool and quiet, and 
ramping up the fans only when your computer is performing a 
particularly strenuous task. Now go to the Exit option and select 
Exit, Save Changes.
  You need to make sure that your main hard 
disk is the one that your computer is set to 
boot from
MOTHERBOARD BATTERY
For some reason, PC manufacturers have never seen fi t to make a 
BIOS with persistent storage. Instead, there’s a battery that keeps 
your BIOS settings stable. When this runs out of power, you’ll 
most likely get a ‘checksum error’ message when you turn on your 
computer. You’ll also see a message asking you to confi gure your 
BIOS settings manually..
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
This problem is very easy to fi x, as all you need to do is change 
the battery, and it’s a simple and inexpensive job. Practically every 
motherboard we’ve seen uses a CR2032 battery, which cost $5 for a 
ten-pack at almost any computer or electronics store.
Open the side of your PC’s case and look for the motherboard 
     THE FIX 
battery. There are two types of holder. Most common is one with 
a sprung tab. Pull the tab with a thumbnail and the battery pops 
out. Clip the new battery in with the ‘+’ facing up. 
The other type of holder has a clip over the top. Use a 
small fl athead screwdriver to push the 
battery forwards and slide it out 
underneath the clip. Slide in the 
new battery with the ‘+’ facing 
up. Now power on your PC and 
follow the guide to setting up 
your BIOS above. 
To prolong the life of your new 
battery, leave your PC plugged 
in and the power socket turned 
on, so that the BIOS is powered from 
the mains. This uses very little 
power but saves you from having 
to perform this slightly fi ddly job 
regularly.

holder has a clip (pictured). 
Pull this back and the battery

PC&TECH AUTHORITY FEBRUARY 2018   111 
  An issue with Windows 
Update can cause future 
problems, so fix errors with 
Microsoft’s free tool
FRONT USB PORTS
Front-mounted USB ports on a PC case are convenient but can 
cause problems, for example if they no longer detect inserted USB 
devices. Front ports can have problems with high-power devices, 
such as hard disks. To check, plug a low-power device such as a 
mouse into one of your front ports. If it doesn’t work, but your 
rear USB ports are fi ne, then the most likely cause is an internal 
connection issue.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Shut down your PC and then turn it off at the mains socket. Press 
the PC’s power button to discharge any residual power and then 
touch the unpainted part of a radiator to discharge any static 
build up.
Remove the side of your PC’s case and look for the USB cable, 
which will plug into a port on your motherboard (called a USB 
header and labelled ‘USB’). Make sure the connector is secure by 
pushing it fi rmly in. When done, power on your PC and check the 
USB port again. If it’s not working, then it could be a driver issue 
(see ‘All USB ports’, below).
     THE FIX 
  Removing your USB 
controllers, so that Windows 
can redetect them, can fix a 
lot of USB problems
ALL USB 
PORTS
USB ports (front and rear) that won’t recognise any device most 
probably have a problem with corrupted drivers.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
The solution is to get Windows to redetect your hardware. First, 
save any open fi les and shut down all open applications. 
Type ‘device’ into the Start menu and run the Device Manager. 
Expand the Universal Serial Bus section and look for anything 
with ‘Host Controller’ in its name, as these are the devices that 
control your PC’s USB ports.
Right-click a USB controller and select Uninstall, then click OK 
in the dialog box to confi rm. Make a note of which one you’ve 
removed. Repeat for all USB controllers. When you remove the 
USB controller that your keyboard and mouse are connected to, 
they will no longer work, and you will lose control of your PC.
Wait until you get a message asking you to restart your computer 
and then press the reset button on your PC: it will restart 
and redetect your USB ports. When you’re back in Windows, 
continue the process 
above to remove any USB 
controllers you didn’t 
remove the fi rst time and 
then restart your PC.
     THE FIX 
WINDOWS 
UPDATE
If Windows Update won’t run, then your computer may become 
unstable and crash regularly. If you go to Control Panel, Windows 
Update and see that it’s stuck downloading updates, even after 
leaving your computer for hours, then this is your problem.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
First, we advise giving updates time to install, as big updates can 
sit part completed for quite a while. However, if your updates have 
been stuck for more than an hour or so, there’s something wrong. 
One of the fi rst things to try is to repair corrupt system fi les.
If Windows still won’t download updates, the issue is likely 
to be with fi le corruption elsewhere. The easiest way to try to fi x 
such problems is with the Windows Update Troubleshooter (bit.
ly/WindowsUpdateTroubleshooter). Download and run the tool, 
and it will automatically scan your computer. When you fi rst 
run the troubleshooter, it may display a message telling you that 
fi xes are more likely to be found running as an Administrator. 
Click Yes to restart the application in Administrator mode and 
start again. When problems are found, you’ll be asked if you 
want to apply the fi x. We 
recommend applying any 
fi x suggested, so click Yes.
     THE FIX

CORRUPTED SYSTEM FILES
Corrupt startup fi les are usually easy to spot as your computer 
will crash on startup and may enter a loop, starting, crashing and 
then restarting. But corruption with these fi les can also cause your 
PC to become unreliable, crashing at random. If you’ve already 
ruled out other components, then it’s worth trying to fi x your 
system fi les.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Windows will automatically load the Startup Repair tool after 
two failed attempts to boot. If this doesn’t work or your computer 
boots but is unstable, you can manually repair your system by 
making a recovery drive. If your computer isn’t working, you can 
create the recovery drive using another computer running the 
same version of Windows.
For Windows 10, you need a blank USB drive. The size you need 
depends on what you want it to do. If you want to install a clean 
version of Windows from it, you need an 8GB drive or larger; if 
you just want to access repair options, you need a 512MB or larger 
drive.
Insert your drive into the PC and note its drive letter in 
Windows Explorer, such as F:. Click Start, type ‘recovery drive’ 
and select Create a Recovery Drive. You can choose to back up 
system fi les, if you want to clean install Windows; remove the 
tick for this option if you just want to repair a PC. Click Next, and 
select your USB drive from the menu. Click Next to go to a screen 
warning you that all data on the chosen drive will be deleted, then 
click Create. 
     THE FIX 
Windows 7 has a similar option, although you need a blank CD 
inserted into a disc writer. Click the start menu, type ‘create’ and 
select Create a System Repair Disc. Follow the wizard through to 
create the disc.
Put the recovery USB drive or CD into your PC and turn it on. 
Your BIOS is most likely set up to boot automatically from the new 
drive. If not, restart your computer and go into the BIOS. Look for 
the Boot options and you should see a Boot priority (or similar) 
menu. If you’re booting from CD, make sure the fi rst boot device 
is the optical drive. If you’re booting from USB, this device needs 
to be fi rst in the list. Use the cursor keys to select an entry and hit 
Enter to choose a boot device. Some BIOSes have a secondary hard 
disk priority menu where your USB drive will be listed; make sure 
your USB drive is listed fi rst, followed by your primary hard disk. 
Save the settings and your PC will reboot.
From the menu, choose Startup Repair. This tool will 
automatically scan your computer for problems, and can 
overwrite corrupted startup fi les. When it’s done, your PC will 
restart. Remove the recovery drive or you’ll be caught in a loop, 
continuously loading the recovery drive menu.
If your computer boots, corrupted system fi les can still cause 
a variety of problems, from random crashing to preventing 
Windows Update from working. A secondary method can fi x 
more stubborn problems. You can run these commands using Safe 
Mode if your computer won’t boot normally.
To run the commands to fi x your problems you need to get a 
command prompt up. Click the Start menu and type ‘command’, 
right-click Command Prompt and select Run as administrator. At 
the command prompt, type ‘sfc /scannow’ (without the quotes) 
and then hit Enter. The system scan will check your computer for 
errors and automatically fi x any that it can. It will tell you at the 
end if it found any corrupt fi les and if it managed to fi x them. 
STARTUP CRASHES
If your computer is slow to shut down, slower to boot up and, 
in some cases, freezes or crashes on startup, then the problem 
could be a Windows feature called fast startup. This is usually 
confi rmed with a simple test: if you’re getting problems when you 
fi rst hit the power button, but a reboot works, fast startup is likely 
the issue.
      THE DIAGNOSIS 
Introduced with Windows 8, but continuing in Windows 10, 
is a feature called fast startup. Enabled by default, it saves 
loaded device drivers and part of the main Windows system to 
     THE FIX 
your hard disk when 
you shut down. Fast 
startup is similar 
to the hibernation 
feature, but it closes 
your applications. 
The theory is that 
this feature makes 
your computer faster 
to turn on again. 
To disable it, go 
to Control Panel, 
Hardware and Sound, Power Options. Click ‘Choose what 
the power buttons do’, and then click the ‘Change settings 
that are currently unavailable’ link, then untick the ‘Turn 
on fast startup’ box. Click Save changes, then reboot your 
computer. 
  If your PC is slow to boot, turn off fast startup

A
s the old saying goes, you are 
nobody without a name. It isn’t 
enough for Melbourne Storm 
to have a stadium, it has to 
be the Etihad Stadium. Apparently the 
marketing people believe that we will 
look more kindly on their brand if we 
believe they are supporting football. 
So, when bringing a new brand to 
market a few years ago, we had to give 
consideration to the URL that people 
would use to get to our site. This matters 
fi nancially because there is an e-shop on 
there where you can buy the products. 
And every sale counts towards the 
bottom line.
Unfortunately, at the time, the domain 
name “manfood.com” wasn’t available. I 
won’t say what it pointed to, but let’s just 
say it wasn’t something one would want 
to associate with a range of delicious, 
award-winning pickles, condiments 
and sauces. Since we needed a URL, we 
settled on welovemanfood.com which, 
although awkward, has done us well for 
the past four years.
Recently, I googled “manfood.
com” and found that it now pointed 
to a domain name holding page and 
appeared to be up for sale. My fi rst 
reaction was to wonder just how wide 
the calculator would have be to get all 
the zeros onto the price tag, but there 
was no harm in asking. I emailed the 
address given and made my enquiry. The 
prompt reply told me that the domain 
was indeed up for sale, and that it could 
be mine for $1,800. Not the sort of small 
change you might fi nd down the back of 
the sofa, but not a price that demanded 
the arms and legs of my nephews either.
The vendor then told me he wanted 
to use escrow.com to do the transfer. 
This was all new to me, having never 
bought a domain name from a third 
party before. But I looked into the site, 
and it seemed legitimate. It appeared to 
have a fully automatic process by which 
the money could be deposited, transfer 
made, and then when both sides were 
happy, the ownership title would be 
released along with the funds. 
I dropped the money in, registered 
and waited for the reply. As part of 
the paperwork, I put in my joker.com 
domain name hosting registration 
details where I host all my other 
domains. Was this going to be some 
huge online scam? Unlikely, given 
that “escrow.com” itself would be a 
somewhat expensive domain name. Or at 
least that’s what I persuaded myself.
A few days later, a miracle occurred: 
the domain name was under my control 
and the vendor had been paid. It couldn’t 
have been smoother. A few tweaks later, 
and the domain name manfood.com 
pointed to our existing server. 
If only things were as simple when 
it comes to registering a new domain. 
Yesterday, I registered a couple of 
domain names for a new project: 
“mydigitalhealthavatar.com” and 
“mydigitalperson.com” seemed like 
useful domain names to have, despite 
their long names. So I registered them 
with Joker in the usual way, using its 
facilities for the registration information 
to be held at joker.com itself.
Today, I have received a barrage of 
emails from website development fi rms 
offering their services. It must be over 
100 and it’s only 1pm. I’ve also had the 
pleasure of two international phone 
calls from Indian call centres and a 
bunch of companies trying to send me 
invoices for SEO services that I neither 
requested nor wanted. One company 
even pretended to be GoDaddy, sending 
an invoice for $24.99 for a business logo 
and website to be delivered in 24 hours. 
And I have lost count of the number of 
web design “experts” who have Gmail 
email addresses. You’d think that a 
professional web designer would at least 
have their own domain.
Does anyone fall for this nonsense? 
Or is it the case that it only requires 
a micro-percentage to click “yes” to 
make it worthwhile? This ties in with 
the worrying rise of sending an invoice 
for fi ctitious services in the hope it will 
be paid. Last month, a company sent 
me an invoice for support for 2018 for 
a product we had bought a year ago. In 
the original sale, there was no mention 
of ongoing support. It just sent it in 
the hope that it would slide through 
accounts and get paid. Naturally, there 
is no way I would do business with 
this company ever again. At least the 
website pimps are easy to spot. If they 
were just a little cleverer, they’d send an 
invoice pertaining to be from Microsoft 
explaining that I’d gone over my 
hundred “free” clicks of the Junk button 
in Outlook and I now owe them $24.99.
