The Psychology of 
Performance: How to 
Be Your Best in Life
T
here is a science to excellence. This course begins with a brief 
review of the history and development of the field of sport 
and performance psychology and a description of the training, 
practice, and ethical issues encountered in practice.
From there, you will learn about the many skills and approaches used 
to achieve excellence, beginning with mindfulness and acceptance-
based approaches. All performance is built on a why, and values 
will be introduced as both the motivation and focus for excellence. 
Values-based goals then become the roadmap to excellence. 
But there are many challenges along the way. Mindfulness is a 
foundational skill that improves poise in performers, enabling them 
to observe their experiences, focus, and choose the best reaction in 
any situation. Thoughts are particularly difficult to distance from, so 
strategies to specifically deal with negative thinking will be reviewed. 
Ultimately, to be their best, athletes and performing artists must 
accept what is, giving up the struggle for control, and must maintain 
a diligent focus on the task at hand. This commitment involves 
a willingness to feel what is necessary in service of performance 
achievement. 
Psychological skills training is the canon of sport psychology, 
and the second part of this course reviews the most well-known 
topics, beginning with motivation and a thorough review of self-
determination theory. Science has found that mental rehearsal 
utilizing the seven elements of the PETTLEP (physical, environment, 
task, timing, learning, emotion, and perspective) model can be

a powerful way to develop physical skills and mental toughness. 
Developing confidence is almost always at the top of the list when 
athletes want to improve mentally and physically, and the ways in 
which self-talk can both help and hurt self-efficacy will be reviewed. 
But no matter how you feel, nothing may be more important to 
performance than maintaining focused attention in the moment, and 
some focusing strategies will be reviewed. 
Ultimately, sport and performance psychology is about becoming the 
best you can be and performing at consistently high levels under any 
condition. The third part of this course explores the various topics 
of optimal performance, beginning with the importance of specific, 
structured routines, which are very different than superstitious rituals. 
Most people have been in the zone at some point. You will learn 
about peak performance and how to get into a flow state more 
readily. You will also discover that talent is overrated. Anyone who 
has achieved excellence has done so through a process of deliberate 
practice, and you will learn how such a process can enhance your life.
But there is a dark side to performance, with a number of issues that 
prove to be a barrier to excellence, and these topics are covered in 
the fourth part of this course. Maybe most common is performance 
anxiety and choking under pressure. Perfectionism drives excellence 
but comes at a terrible cost. Self-compassion does not typically come 
to mind when you think of the rigorous demands of performance 
excellence, but you will learn how vital it is to overcome these two 
performance barriers and prevent burnout. Pain and injury are 
inevitable, but as you will learn throughout the course, it isn’t what 
happens to you that determines the outcome but how you react 
to it that matters. The best strategies to manage pain and make 
a remarkable recovery from injury will be reviewed. Athletes and 
performing artists invest in and depend significantly on their bodies. 
As a result, the pursuit of an ideal body can lead to clinical issues 
such as disordered eating and performance-enhancing drug use.
Performers achieve and develop in a social context, so the fifth part 
of this course explores these topics, beginning with the subject of 
fan psychology. You will discover why people get so emotional when 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
3
their teams win and lose. Athletes rarely perform alone. Teamwork is 
essential to success, and the four correlates of teamwork—cohesion, 
cooperation, role relationships, and leadership—will be reviewed. 
Then, you will learn about the advantages of the Developmental 
Model of Sport Participation to prevent injury and burnout in youth 
athletes while providing social guidelines for the best development 
of skills. You will discover everything sport parents need to know to 
give their child-athletes the best chance to succeed, what parents 
need to stop doing, and the unique role that only parents can 
play at every stage of development. The final lecture explores how 
excellence is maintained throughout the lifespan by examining 
the experiences of masters athletes and how to best handle the 
transition out of sport when that time eventually comes. ■

Sport and Performance 
Psychology
W
e are all performers, and we all have a 
psychology we bring to our performance. 
This lecture will provide some history and 
background of the field of sport psychology and then 
will review the practice of performance psychology, 
ethical challenges in performance consulting, and 
relevant issues addressed in performance psychology.

The History of Sport Psychology

 Sport psychology got its start in about 1891, when the general 
psychological principles started to be applied in a unique 
setting: physical education. 

 Luther Gulick offered a seminar for students studying to be 
physical training directors. It was during this seminar that James 
Naismith was encouraged to develop a new indoor game, and 
basketball was invented. In that same year, Naismith gave a 
commencement address entitled “Psychology of Exercise.”

 A few years later, E. W. Scripture and others were studying the 
reaction times of athletes. It seems that right from the beginning 
of the field, the goal of sport psychology was to develop a 
performance edge to win. Throughout his writings, Scripture 
expressed a belief that psychology could have an influence on 
sport performance. 

 Norman Triplett published one of the first experimental studies 
in sport psychology in 1898. Because of what is now called social 
facilitation, his studies of cyclists concluded that the presence 
of another, whether paced or in competition, produces faster 
results.

 Psychology made its first appearance in the Olympics in France 
in 1897 with the presentation of the “Psychology of Exercise” as 
part of a scholarly meeting to promote the science of athletics. 

 Positive self-talk is one of the most well-known and well-
researched topics in sport psychology, and it was addressed in 
1913 at the first International Congress of the Psychology and 
Physiology of Sport.

 It didn’t take long for the idea of using psychology for 
performance enhancement to extend beyond sport, with studies 
of psychology applied to business in 1917 and the psychology of 
musical talent in 1919.

Lecture 1  |  Sport and Performance Psychology  


 From the 1920s through the 1940s, there was a worldwide 
development of psychological laboratories dedicated to sport 
using experimental laboratory methods. Coleman Griffith is 
credited with opening the first American sport psychology 
laboratory in 1925. He taught a course on psychology and 
athletics and consulted with the football team, playing a role in 
their two national championship wins. Griffith’s book Psychology 
of Coaching was used in collegiate courses, and his work was 
influential worldwide. 

 During the 1940s and 1950s, discoveries in general psychology 
were increasingly applied to specifically improve sport 
performance, such as the use of mental practice and 
visualization. In the United States and abroad, psychologists 
began working with national, Olympic, and professional athletes 
and teams. And the research in the area of performance was 
expanding in both variety of topics and number of studies. 

 By the mid-1960s, worldwide interest in sport psychology had 
grown, leading to the formation of the International Society 
of Sport Psychology and the North American Society for the 
Psychology of Sport and Physical Activity. 

 Psychologists in other countries were already working with 
Olympic athletes and teams in the late 1960s, but Richard Suinn 
is believed to be the first sport psychology professional to work 
with U.S. Olympians in 1972.

 There was growth in the number of sport psychology graduate 
programs in the United States, first emphasizing research and 
then gradually focusing on more applied issues. There is a 
creative tension and a creative collaboration between researchers 
and applied clinicians today as they all strive to be scientist-
practitioners, with the work of one side influencing the other.

 Peak performance and flow became areas of interest in psychology 
during the 1960s and 1970s, and that interest continues today. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
7

 In the 1980s, sport psychology research increased, along with 
greater acceptance of sport psychology in the United States. 
Sport psychology professional credentials were established, 
and Shane Murphy became the first full-time U.S. Olympic 
Committee sport psychologist. 

 In 1982, the U.S. Olympic Committee established a registry to 
identify consultants with the requisite training and experience 
to work with Olympic coaches and athletes, which increased 
the availability of sport psychology services to Olympic athletes 
across the country.

 In 1986, the American Psychological Association (APA) founded 
Division 47: Exercise and Sport Psychology, now called the 
Society for Sport, Exercise and Performance Psychology 
to illustrate its broadening applicability. In 2003, the APA 
established proficiency guidelines officially recognizing sport 
psychology as a specialty within the practice of psychology.

 Also in 1986, the Association for the Advancement of Applied 
Sport Psychology held its first conference. Now more efficiently 
named the Association for Applied Sport Psychology, AASP is 
an international, multidisciplinary, professional organization. 
AASP promotes the development of sport psychology science 
and ethical practice and in 1989 offered certification to qualified 
members with a master’s or doctorate degree. 

 Consultants must meet specific course requirements and 
complete an extensive, supervised work experience to develop 
their competency to psychologically enhance performance. 
Certification was initiated to improve accountability, recognition, 
credibility, professional preparation, and public awareness. In 
2016, the AASP fellows met and agreed to seek accreditation of 
this certification through the National Commission for Certifying 
Agencies, further raising its standards. 

 In the 1980s and 1990s, sport psychologists were still relatively 
new. Many athletes and coaches didn’t trust them or understand 

Lecture 1  |  Sport and Performance Psychology  
8
exactly what they were doing or how they could help. Teams 
were willing to get free workshops, but getting them to make a 
financial investment was more difficult. 

 Often, teams and athletes would be unwilling to sacrifice any 
physical practice, as if mental training were a luxury, not a 
necessity or integral part of their sport. This is changing, with 
more and more teams and organizations at all levels seeking 
more consultations and hiring mental training teams. 

 The science has been growing, too. More sport and performance 
psychology journals are published, with more rigorous research 
methodology. There are more professional guidelines and 
standards and discussions of ethics to help define and promote 
the field. 
Performance Psychology 

 Performance psychology refers to the mental aspects of superior 
performance in settings where excellence is central—usually 
sports, the performing arts, business, and high-risk professions 
(such as the military).

 The field of performance psychology is generally comprised of 
three different tracts: applied sport psychology, psychotherapy, 
and consultation and coaching—each offering a different 
framework. 
››
The work in applied sport psychology is focused on 
psychological skills training (PST). These are the psychological 
processes that govern performance, such as arousal 
management, concentration and attention, goal setting, and 
motivation. 
››
From psychotherapy comes cognitive behavioral therapy, 
from which many of the PST interventions originate. 
Solution-focused methods are a good fit with performance 
consultation. Mindfulness approaches have gained recent 
popularity, informed by acceptance and commitment therapy. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
9
Psychotherapy looks to correct or improve pathology and 
dysfunction; however, the area of positive psychology focuses 
on what’s right, what works, and what’s improving and informs 
performance enhancement work.
››
The third contributing source of information comes from the 
field of consultation and coaching, with a focus on building a 
person’s strengths, resources, and passions to promote his or 
her growth and reach his or her potential.

 Sport psychology and performance psychology are not the 
same thing, but they are related, with significant overlap and 
some differences. Sport may be the most widely researched 
and tested, so sport psychology often informs performance 
psychology when there are similarities in performance pressures. 

 Performance consultants, however, are aware that there are 
entire bodies of literature and cultures completely separate from 
sport psychology. To practice ethically and effectively, familiarity 
with the goals and culture of each of these is necessary. 

Lecture 1  |  Sport and Performance Psychology  
10

 Sport psychologists do a great many things, from teaching, 
to research, to working with elite athletes, to working with 
youth athletes, and everything in between. The field is a rich, 
interdisciplinary mix of academics and practitioners. 

 Sport psychologists have their training and degrees in 
counseling and clinical psychology, educational psychology, 
coaching and physical education, sport psychology specifically, 
kinesiology, and exercise science. 

 A true sport psychologist is licensed by the state to practice 
psychology, so typically you need a clinical or counseling degree. 
Others who are trained to teach mental skills to athletes and 
coaches are better called sport psychology consultants, as 
the term “psychologist” is legally protected by law to indicate 
licensure by the state. 
Ethics

 Psychologists in the United States are held to the APA’s Ethical 
Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. Ethics are about 
doing what’s right, with the best interest of your client always in 
mind. Therefore, training and competence can be an ethical issue.

 If you have consultants primarily trained in the physical education 
disciplines on one end and psychology-trained professionals 
on the other, who is best trained to deal with the psychology 
of physical performance? Most applied work probably falls in 
the middle of the continuum, where personal and performance 
issues overlap. The APA proficiency and AASP certification help 
define the minimum training to perform in the middle, which 
includes a mixture of course work from the fields of psychology, 
sport psychology, and sport sciences, in addition to 400 hours 
of supervised experience. 

 But when an issue starts to go outside a consultant’s area of 
competence, it is up to the consultant to either get the proper 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
11
training and develop the necessary skills or refer to someone 
who is properly trained to address it.

 You also have to take into account applicable laws, psychology 
board regulations, professional psychological organizations’ 
guidelines, consultation with peers, and your own conscience. 

 Confidentiality is a well-known ethical code in helping 
professions. This is easier to keep if, for example, an athlete 
sees a clinical sport psychologist on his or her own, in the 
psychologist’s office. But what happens when a consultant 
works where the athletes train, practice, perform, and rehab? 

 The sport environment, CEO’s conference room, or theatre 
backstage are all environments where information about training 
and performances, physical condition, health, and personal lives 
are often shared freely, so there can easily be pressure on the 
psychologist to share information as well. 

Lecture 1  |  Sport and Performance Psychology  
12

 Identifying who the consultant works for is necessary to determine 
who has access to what happens in consultations. If hired by the 
team or organization, for example, there may not be the privacy 
the athlete desires. Informed consent must be an ongoing 
process, and the limits of confidentiality must be made clear.

 Maybe the biggest ethical issue to consider is multiple 
relationships and boundaries. There is the potential to cause 
impairment in performance, risk exploitation, or harm the client/
athlete in unexpected ways—and that must be avoided. 

 Consider a sport psychologist who consults with a collegiate 
sports team and is employed by the university but is also 
seeing an athlete on the team individually, in a private practice 
setting, for clinical issues that can become quite personal. The 
psychologist must consistently be aware of the pros and cons of 
each situation. 

 A key aspect of remaining ethical is to have relationships with 
colleagues who have a strong commitment to ethics to bounce 
ideas off of. The professional who operates in isolation is most 
at risk for unintentionally crossing boundaries or finding him- or 
herself in an unfortunate situation.
Issues a Performance Psychologist Might Address

 The job of a performance psychologist starts with helping 
performers in any performance area establish and maintain 
high standards, with a focus on mastery; cultivate motivation; 
and strive for excellence, without suffering the consequences of 
unhealthy perfectionism. 

 Often, it is to move performers’ focus from the outcome to 
the process, from their ego to the task at hand; to excel in 
competition; and to help them respond to competition with a 
drive to excel, focus, and achieve rather than become afraid, 
envious, or self-centered. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
13

 The awareness and regulation of emotion is central to 
performance, and its application to business and the military 
beyond sport is easy to see. Performers across settings need 
to be “on” at a very specific time and to be their best at those 
exact critical moments. Therefore, developing attention and 
concentration, especially under pressure, and maintaining 
confidence are frequent consulting goals. 

 Maybe not as salient to athletes, but more important to 
performing artists and business executives is the audience 
with whom they have to engage and interact. An audience’s 
reactions and responses can increase arousal and anxiety, and 
their judgement may be critical to the performer’s success. And 
then there is the consequences of performance, dealing with 
success and failure, and how expectations of these results can 
influence performance.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Describe three situations where you would prefer to have 
a clinically trained sport psychology consultant versus a 
consultant from a sport science background and then three 
situations where a sport science background might be 
preferred.
2.	 Many sport psychology consultants list the teams and 
athletes they have worked with—sometimes just by name, 
sometimes with testimonials and pictures. What ethical 
risks should they consider when promoting their working 
relationship to the public?

LECTURE 2
Deliberate Practice: 
Essential for Experts
T
he key to excellence is practice, and you’re 
probably doing it wrong. Most people are. There 
is a science to it that many people are not aware 
of. The purpose of this lecture is to inspire you. It will 
change the way you think, the way you develop your 
skills in any area, and maybe even the way you parent. 
You will discover that talent, if it even exists, is highly 
overrated. This means that you can truly do anything—
but at an incredible investment. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
15
Purposeful Practice

 You are not limited by genetics. There is no basketball gene or 
innate musical talent that will carry you to greatness. In all areas 
of performance, it comes down to how you practice. 

 Practice not only matters, but determines everything. There 
is one thing that distinguishes experts, truly the very best in 
any field, from everyone else. And it isn’t talent, size, strength, 
agility, or some innate gift. It is the amount of time they spent in 
deliberate practice. 

 Talent, or early demonstration of skills, can be nothing more 
than a self-fulfilling prophesy. If you assume that someone 
doesn’t have the musical or athletic gift because he or she 
doesn’t excel right away, he or she is often encouraged to go in 
another direction. Children with athletic skill early on earn more 
compliments, attention, and investment from coaches in practice 
and more playing time in games. Without encouragement, a 
later bloomer never learns to kick a soccer ball or to sing. 

 Another problem with talent is that it can be a disadvantage in 
the long run. Those with less developed skills early on have to 
work harder to develop them and keep up, and they have to find 
other competitive advantages, such as knowing the opponent 
or paying particular attention to technique, rather than relying 
on athleticism. They learn to work hard, fight for what they earn, 
and persevere through adversity. 

 Sometimes, more talented players aren’t tested early in their 
athletic careers and are behind these lesser-talented peers in 
their study skills, practice skills, mental game, and work ethic—
all factors that have a lot to do with success at higher levels 
and attributes associated with deliberate practice, the ultimate 
factor in determining improvement and expertise. 

 We now know that it is only the right kind of practice carried out 
over a sufficient period of time that leads to improvement. As 

Lecture 2  |  Deliberate Practice: Essential for Experts  
16
a result, we create our own potential. There is no such thing as 
predefined ability. 

 Purposeful practice has very specific, well-defined goals. You 
have to know exactly what you want to accomplish with every 
repetition—know what you want to do and exactly how you 
want to do it, ideally based on how experts do it. 

 Contrast this with naive practice, where we do something 
repeatedly, expecting that the repetition alone will improve 
performance. Practice doesn’t make perfect. Practice makes 
permanent. Only perfect practice makes perfect. Without 
knowing exactly what you want to do, you aren’t progressing. 

 Purposeful practice is first defined by specific goals. Intense 
focus is the second quality. How often during naive practice 
are we going through the motions without being fully engaged, 
either because we lack a specific goal or we’re just not bringing 
our full attention to the moment? 

 Growth is difficult, and that brings us to the next quality of 
purposeful practice: getting out of our comfort zone. And we 
don’t like that. We have a basic need to feel competent, and 
pushing ourselves to do things we don’t know how to do goes 
against that—but it is required to push the limits of our abilities 
and progress. 

 We push into an uncomfortable place and adapt until it becomes 
comfortable, and then we push again, until it gets comfortable, 
and then push again, over and over, in a faithful, persistent 
way. This is how we learn and develop. This is the only way we 
improve, in anything. 
Adaptability

 If you lift weights, you get bigger, stronger muscles, and with 
purposeful and deliberate practice, you get more brain in much 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
17
the same way. Neuroscientists using brain-imaging techniques 
are discovering how the brains of people with particular skills 
differ from those without the skill. 

 It isn’t that their brains differ in childhood or before the mastery 
of the skill, as you might expect if you believed in talent. With 
training, the brain changes, adapts, and grows in response to 
the demands placed on it. 

 There are biological differences in experts, both in their bodies 
and in their brains, but these differences developed. Therefore, 
the most effective forms of practice are going to modify the 
structure and function of the brain, increasing your ability to 
perform a skill. Purposeful practice gets you there. 

 In addition to brain growth, deliberate practice involves 
developing more efficient mental representations, which are 
mental structures that relate to an object, an idea, a collection 
of information, or anything else that you might think about. 
The development of mental representations allows a person 
to see meaningful patterns in a collection of things that would 
seem random or confusing to people with less developed 

Lecture 2  |  Deliberate Practice: Essential for Experts  
18
representations. Developed mental representations also facilitate 
planning in advance. 

 The main purpose of deliberate practice is to develop mental 
representations that will enhance performance. But then these 
improved mental representations will inform our deliberate 
practice. Our ability to detect—and then correct—mistakes is 
enhanced. And then we get a positive cycle of improvement, 
with refined and more challenging deliberate practice further 
developing mental representations, better informing practice, 
and so on. 

 This is the process of improvement. What determines who gets 
to a good level, gets better, or becomes the best is the amount 
of time you spend in deliberate practice. The challenge is that it 
is labor intensive and not much fun. 

 Experts who put in thousands and thousands of hours will 
tell you that they were not enjoying it. The best students are 
motivated to practice intensely, and with full concentration, 
not because it’s fun, but because they see practice as essential 
to improving their performance. They are willing to pay that 
price—even when they don’t feel like it. 

 The 10,000-hour rule, which states that it takes 10,000 hours of 
appropriately guided practice to become an expert in any skill, 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
19
was popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 book Outliers. 
But some tasks and accomplishments take more time, and others 
take less. And as a field develops more experts, you have to know 
or do more over time just to keep up. That means more hours of 
deliberate practice than your peers, so 10,000 hours may not be 
enough. It certainly isn’t a threshold to automatic expertise.

 From a developmental perspective, the first step to becoming 
an expert is being introduced through play to the field of 
interest. Parents play a crucial role here, instructing their children 
as to the purpose of the items they are playing with, such as 
the ball, golf club, or piano. And the family values of discipline, 
hard work, responsibility, and achievement are instilled early. 
Praise is powerful to increase motivation, and the satisfaction of 
developing a skill can help keep a child going for more. 

 But once interest is developed, the next step is to get lessons 
from a coach or teacher—not necessarily an expert yet, but 
one who can maintain interest and motivation in the pupil while 
skills are being built. Parents at this stage remain important 
to provide discipline and structure, such as helping the child 
establish practice routines and giving them praise, support, and 
encouragement to keep motivation high. 

 To strengthen commitment, parents will need to positively push 
their child to prioritize practice over other activities. But when is 
pushing helpful, and when is it too much? It’s difficult to define the 
line exactly, but ultimately the motivation must come from within 
the child, or else it won’t last. So, discovering and emphasizing the 
aspects of the activity the child loves most—so that he or she owns 
his or her performance and is motivated from within—is best. 

 As these students progress, better qualified teachers and 
coaches are needed to take them to the next level, as is an 
increase in practice hours. At this point, those on track to 
become experts will show a tremendous appetite for work. 
They start to identify themselves with their area of growing 
specialization—as a baseball player or ballerina. 

Lecture 2  |  Deliberate Practice: Essential for Experts  
20

 It is in this early or mid-teen period that future experts make a 
major commitment to becoming the best they can be, seeking 
the best teachers or schools for training, even if it means 
moving across the country. The student faces expectations that 
gradually increase until the student is doing as much as humanly 
possible to improve. At this point, the motivation lies solely 
within the student to get out to the very edge of human ability 
and rank among the best. 

 This is the benefit of starting young. Few adults have four to five 
hours per day to devote to deliberate practice. If you start early, 
your body is better able to adapt to the demands placed on 
it. Our brain and body can adapt throughout life, but they are 
more adaptable during childhood and adolescence. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
21
How to Practice

 Deliberate practice develops skills that others have already 
figured out, so find a coach who knows how to guide you in the 
best way to develop them. 

 Deliberate practice takes place outside your comfort zone, just 
beyond current abilities, and demands near-maximal effort, which 
is not enjoyable. Stay outside your comfort zone to improve.

 Deliberate practice requires well-defined, specific goals designed 
to improve some aspect of your target performance. Set them 
consistently, revising and improving them as you progress.

 Deliberate practice is deliberate, meaning that it requires your full 
attention and conscious, intentional actions. Be fully engaged. 

 Deliberate practice requires feedback and modifications of 
efforts in response to that feedback. A coach is extremely helpful 
here, but over time, with improved mental representations, 
experienced students can monitor themselves, spot mistakes, 
and adjust accordingly. Feedback can be difficult to take. Learn 
to love it.

 Deliberate practice both produces and depends on effective 
mental representations, with one improving the other. Be sure 
you have a clear picture of what you are trying to achieve and 
keep it in the front of your mind, constantly striving for it and 
improving it. 

 Deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying 
previously learned skills by focusing on specific aspects of those 
skills that can be improved, over and over again—constantly 
striving for the next level, breaking records, creating training 
techniques, and being the first in your field to do what you’re 
doing. 

Lecture 2  |  Deliberate Practice: Essential for Experts  
22
Motivation

 A lack of motivation may be the biggest barrier to developing 
expertise. Most people get to a point where they think that 
they are good enough and that it isn’t worth it anymore. To 
strengthen your motivation, you can either strengthen the 
reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit. 

 People don’t often need bigger motivators; instead, it’s the 
costs that get us. Here is how to guard against them. 
››
Start by choosing an activity that you truly and deeply want to 
be better in. 
››
Set aside a fixed time to practice that is cleared of all other 
obligations and distractions. 
››
Get more and better sleep. 
››
Limit practice sessions to no more than an hour at a time; you 
can’t maintain intense focus for much longer than that. 
››
Set things up so that you are constantly seeing concrete signs 
of improvement. 
››
Surround yourself with like-minded people—people who 
believe in you and what you’re doing. Believe in yourself.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Choose an area of your performance to improve. Define the 
mental representation of expert performance in that area.
2.	 Where would you find a coach or consult expert opinions on 
how to improve, and what would be the next skill you would 
practice?

LECTURE 3
How Values and Goals 
Drive Performance
I
f the psychology of performance is essentially a ton 
of hard work and deliberate practice, why do elite 
performers do it? If you are going to persevere 
through all the adversity en route to greatness, you have 
to have a why. This lecture focuses on values and goals. 
You will discover how values can form a solid foundation 
for goal setting and increase its effectiveness. 

Lecture 3  |  How Values and Goals Drive Performance  
24
Values

 Values are a consistent way of doing things. They are a standard 
to live by. It’s sport integrity: Every time you step onto the field 
or go into the weight room, you have a standard of behavior that 
you hold yourself accountable to. It doesn’t matter the score, 
how you’re playing, or even how you’re feeling. It is the person 
you want to be—consistently. 

 And it is not limited to sport. If you value honesty, you will bring 
that into your place of work and your marriage. We don’t achieve 
our values, as we do our goals. We live our values in every 
situation, through the adversity day after day. 

 Define the behaviors that reflect your values in these 
performance areas: what kind of teammate you want to be, what 
kind of competitor you want to be, how you want to train, how 
you want to develop both technical and tactical skills, and how 
you keep fun and recreation in your life. 

 Then comes the big question: Are you that type of person now? 
At this point, you might come face to face with the reality that 
you are not living your values. To do so, you must behave in a 
valued direction every day—at every practice, in every game, 
under every circumstance. But there are barriers to this.

 Inevitably, there are some feelings or thoughts that get in the 
way. And for a moment, we lose focus on our values and give 
in to our desire for comfort or relief, or we act out in impulsive 
anger or in response to fear. In the process of performance, it 
is essential that we keep our attention on what we value most. 
If we prioritize our feelings, our values are often compromised. 

 After clearly identifying what our values are and look like 
behaviorally, our next step is developing an awareness of how 
we act and this choice between values-driven, or emotionally 
driven, behavior. You’d be surprised how often we choose 
emotions. We often act mindlessly.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
25

 But values not only provide direction; they also provide energy. 
Performers who are focused on the values that underlie their goals 
train harder and more consistently than those who lack value clarity. 
They make better choices, especially in the face of hardships and 
negative thoughts and emotions, and are more likely to persevere 
in the day-to-day activities that lead to goal achievement.
From Values to Effective Goal Setting

 Once you have reviewed your values, you can set your goals. 
If values are your compass, directing where you go, goals are 
the map and the specific plan for exactly how to get there in a 
behavioral, descriptive way. 

 Goals can increase motivation, confidence, and focus on the task 
by defining exactly what to work on and what to prioritize. Goal 
setting is big in the sport psychology literature for this reason. 
But just setting goals isn’t magical. Emotionally connecting to 
why the goal is important provides the motivation, confidence, 
and focus necessary to ultimately succeed. 

 Identifying values alone isn't sufficient to succeed either. You 
may know that you value hard work and strength, and you could 

Lecture 3  |  How Values and Goals Drive Performance  
26
live them daily, but without setting goals, your values won’t 
direct you toward a particular achievement. Goals provide the 
necessary direction of our energy and actions. 

 In sport, goals that seem to have the greatest effect are moderate 
in difficulty—challenging but realistic. Neither improbable, 
difficult goals nor easy goals show any effect on performance. 
Easy goals don’t push you. You protect your self-esteem with easy 
goal achievement, but you don’t get very far. On the other hand, 
setting really difficult goals doesn’t work either. Failure always 
feels bad, and unmet expectations are disappointing. And who 
has the motivation to go after goals you are likely to fail at? 

 In sport, absolute goals show the greatest improvement in 
performance. Absolute goals are specifically defined outcomes—
winning a race, for example. It’s absolute because you either do it 
or you don’t. Only one person can achieve this goal. 

 Relative goals are goals that are based on personal improvement 
relative to prior performances—running a personal best time, 
for example. Relative goals are also linked to performance 
improvement, but not as strongly as absolute goals are. Relative 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
27
goals should still be somewhat specific, such as shooting for a 
specific time. 

 General “do your best goals” do just about as well as relative 
goals. They are not as useless as once thought, and the fact that 
they do help probably explains why people keep setting them. 
They inspire effort and focus. They just aren’t as effective as 
having a specific, targeted outcome to improve performance.

 In addition to moderately challenging goals and absolute 
goals, there is a third moderating factor in goal setting besides 
difficulty and specificity: proximity. Both short-term and 
combined short- and long-term goals improve performance the 
most. But long-term goals alone do not. 

 This makes practical sense. You can certainly have an idea 
of what you want in the future, but without a practical plan in 
the short term, you won’t take the immediate steps necessary 
to move you in that direction. There is good evidence from 
research that combined goals are best. Long-term goals are 
often too far away to provide you the motivation you need today 
to take action. Linking short- and long- term goals sets out a 
solid plan for achievement, with the long-term goal providing 
meaning to those short-term, ideally daily, action steps.

 Some additional variables that can help. Competitive and 
cooperative goals have a significantly greater positive effect 
on performance than mastery goals. Mastery goals are better 
than competitive goals in a practice climate, so the context in 
which you’re goal setting and the purpose of the goal is very 
important. Competitive and cooperative goals seem to get the 
most out of you when you have to be your best compared to 
goals to improve your skill, perhaps due to the added motivation 
or incentive to beat someone.

 In turn, cooperative and participant set goals have a greater 
effect than assigned goals. There is no performance-enhancing 
effect for private goals, so tell people what your goals are. Write 

Lecture 3  |  How Values and Goals Drive Performance  
28
them down, too. This is another common suggestion that has 
some research support. Finally, athletes should set goals for 
both practice and competition, as setting practice goals is a 
critical factor that differentiates successful Olympic athletes 
from unsuccessful ones. 

 In general, the sport research supports SMART goals—specific, 
measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-limited—but with 
some tweaks and additional emphases. Despite not being specific 
and measurable, “do your best” goals have some value, although 
the moderately difficult goals match up nicely with “achievable,” 
and this finding has the most research support. “Relevant” blends 
nicely with values. And deadlines are very effective.

 Another suggestion that showed less, but still some, effect was 
to tell someone who can be supportive of your intentions. In 
addition, getting feedback on your goal progress also improves 
your performance, particularly with more complex tasks. 
Remember the importance of this with deliberate practice. 

 The literature is far from conclusive. Numerous studies and 
experience show that goal setting helps, but most likely it 
interacts with other things to contribute to success. Goals alone 
aren’t going to do much. You need a collection of skills and 
attributes that interact in any number of complex ways within a 
given individual to be effective. 
Types of Goals

 In sport and exercise psychology, three types of goals are 
typically discussed—outcome, performance, and process 
goals—and each one serves a purpose.
››
Similar to absolute goals, outcome goals define the specific 
end result, typically as it relates to others or in a bigger 
context. Having a clear idea of what you’re going for—this 
type of absolute goal—has the greatest direct impact on 
performance as far as goal setting is concerned.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
29
››
Performance goals are goals that focus the athlete on his 
or her own performance relative to how he or she has done 
before. These goals don’t have anything to do with anyone 
else, so they’re useful for increasing your internal motivation 
and levels of confidence. 
››
Process goals focus on how an athlete performs a specific skill. 
These goals are usually reserved for training sessions. This 
type of goal is even more specific than a performance goal, as 
the process determines success of the performance. 

 The best way to utilize these three types of goals is to link one or 
more process and performance goals to a single outcome goal. 
Linking them in this way improves your results.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Write down your five values and give a behavioral example 
(i.e., action you can see) of each that you could do daily or 
weekly. For example, if you value perseverance, you may live 
that value by going to the gym regularly or be more patient 
with your mistakes.
2.	 Set short- and long-term outcome, performance, and 
process goals for each value based on the principles 
covered in this lecture.

The Benefits of 
Mindfulness in 
Performance
A
s performers, we want to be mindful, because to 
be our best, we must be aware, intentional, and 
purposeful in everything we do. In this lecture, 
you will learn about mindfulness as a performance-
enhancement strategy. While the practice of meditation 
is ancient, its application to sport performance is in 
its infancy. But it is a hot topic in both research and 
application because of the positive results it is getting. 
More than a technique, mindfulness builds a mental 
strength, changing the brain and the way it operates to 
enhance performance. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
31
Mindfulness in Sport

 There are several definitions of mindfulness, but the one from 
Jon Kabat-Zinn is rooted in Buddhist philosophy—paying 
attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, 
and without judgment. 

 Mindfulness is an ancient concept that is at least 2,500 years 
old and has been widely researched and applied in medical 
settings and psychotherapy. Mindfulness in sport is a relatively 
new topic. Mindfulness and acceptance-based models of 
performance enhancement look to change our relationship with 
internal experiences rather than change the frequency, intensity, 
or form of the experience itself. 

 This is in stark contrast to more traditional psychological 
skills training (PST) interventions that seek to create the 
ideal emotions, sensations, thinking, and self-talk for peak 
performance. The core belief of a mindful approach is that a 
person performs best when staying with a nonjudgmental, 
moment-to-moment awareness and acceptance of one’s internal 
state, with his or her attention focused on what is essential for 
performance and a consistent, intentional behavioral effort of 
actions that support what he or she values most.

 The traditional PST model includes strategies such as goal 
setting, imagery, pre-performance routines, and self-talk. 
This model suggests that reduction of negative thought and 
negative emotions and improved self-control skills will result 
in improved athletic performance. While they are widely used 
and often beneficial, there are serious challenges to the idea 
that they are the direct mechanism of action leading to quality 
performance. 

 In a review by researcher Zella Moore, codeveloper of the 
Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment approach, she contends 
that mindful and acceptance-based interventions are not 

Lecture 4  | The Benefits of Mindfulness in Performance  
32
only effective, but it is the mindfulness practice itself that is 
responsible for the improvement. 

 To truly understand and benefit from mindfulness, you must 
practice it yourself and experience it directly. It is not something 
you can intellectually understand and benefit from. 
How Mindfulness Practice Works

 Mindfulness meditation actually changes basic brain structures 
and functions. For example, after only eight weeks of training, 
researchers discovered an increase in gray matter concentration 
of meditators’ left hippocampus, which is critically involved in 
learning, memory, and regulating emotion. 

 Because of the neural changes that can occur with mindfulness 
practice, there is an automatic and improved response to 
emotions and improved behavioral decision making in the face 
of stress. With consistent practice, the performer becomes more 
effective and more efficient in responding to the challenges of 
their environment.

 Benefits begin right away. Research participants demonstrated 
improvement in memory and executive functioning after just 
four days of practice. With as little as three months of training, 
practitioners showed significant improvements in more quickly 
and easily switching their attentional focus. 

 Both expert and novice meditators show similar activation in 
the brain during mindfulness training when novices are properly 
motivated; however, experts sustained their attention longer 
and more efficiently, with less brain activity needed. Skilled 
meditators respond to distractions automatically, without having 
to give additional effort to keep their attention focused on what 
they are doing.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
33

Lecture 4  | The Benefits of Mindfulness in Performance  
34

 The data suggest that the mechanisms of action in mindfulness 
are improved mental efficiency through the development of 
greater awareness and acceptance of internal experiences, thus 
freeing the athlete to focus more attentional resources on his or 
her performance and get better results. 

 The changes in the brain allow athletes to automatically notice 
and direct their attention to what is most essential, without 
needing to consciously reduce or control reactions to other 
potentially distracting experiences to do so. 

 This is different from traditional psychological skills approaches. 
The traditional approach has been to try to reduce or eliminate 
negative experiences first and then intentionally shift to more 
positive thoughts and feelings to perform better. Mindfulness 
and acceptance-based approaches, on the other hand, stress 
the absence of intentional effort. Through daily mindfulness 
practice, improved attention becomes automatic, requiring 
fewer cognitive resources to achieve the desired focus state. 

 The practice of entering a nonjudgmental, present-moment 
focus trains the brain to operate this way without needing to 
consciously or deliberately turn it on under pressure—when we 
need it the most. Performing under pressure is a hot topic in 
sport psychology. Some research suggests that reduced anxiety 
and a narrow focus of attention are both related to optimal 
athletic results. 

 But these data on mindfulness suggest that reduced anxiety 
and closed focus may not, after all, be prerequisites for peak 
performance. Both high-functioning athletes and expert 
meditators seem perfectly capable of demonstrating higher 
levels of anxious arousal and broader awareness than novices 
while still maintaining optimal task performance. 

 More research with larger samples is still needed before we 
can be sure about this. It seems clear, though, that the broad 
and automated attentional focus found in those who regularly 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
35
practice mindfulness is considerably different from the efforts 
to control internal experiences, which are found in typical PST 
interventions. 

 Traditional PST requires athletes to do an intentional scanning 
to notice and then correct internal experiences judged to 
be problematic. But the scanning and efforts to change the 
experience can actually be the problem in performance. What’s 
needed is an automatic and efficient brain that can maintain 
focus on the task, regardless of what the athlete feels. 
Models of Mindfulness

 A simple way to think of a mindful approach to sport 
performance enhancement is that there are three levels: 
mindfulness, concentration, and optimal performance. It starts 
with mindfulness. Accepting and being tolerant of internal and 
external distractions is foundational. From there, the performer 
is then freed up to focus on the task at hand—full concentration. 
And only then, with distractions minimized and concentration 
fully engaged, are we most likely to optimize our performance.

 Researchers Keith Kaufman and Carol Glass have developed the 
Mindful Sport Performance Enhancement intervention, which 
is a group protocol consisting of six weekly 90-minute sessions 
and daily home practice. The intention is to train athletes in the 
basics of mindfulness and then help them apply mindfulness 
skills to both their sport performance routines and life outside of 
sport. The protocol moves athletes from sedentary to active to 
sport-specific mindfulness.

 Evaluations of a shorter four-week protocol are positive, 
with athletes reporting performance improvement from the 
intervention, increases in mindfulness and flow, and decreases 
in sport anxiety and perfectionism. In a one-year follow-up 
study, the athletes showed an increase in mindfulness since 
participating in the workshop as well as improved performance. 

Lecture 4  | The Benefits of Mindfulness in Performance  
36

 The development of the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment 
(MAC) approach by Frank Gardner and Zella Moore was an 
effort to better understand, explain, and affect the mechanism 
of action in athletic performance and improve the efficacy of 
interventions. MAC does not rely as exclusively on mindfulness 
as the previous protocol and draws heavily on the Acceptance 
and Commitment Therapy literature.

 In a third approach called Mindfulness Meditation Training 
for Sport, mindfulness and traditional PST are combined. This 
6-week program, consisting of two 30-minute sessions per 
week for a total of 12 sessions, teaches open awareness, caring 
thoughts for self and teammates, concentration exercises, 
and the practice of accepting negative mind states through 
techniques such as labeling emotions and non-reactivity. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
37

 We can’t stay detached and observe every thought. That would 
prevent us from ever taking action. Mindfulness is a great way to 
help us be more intentional and evaluate and then choose the 
right thoughts and feelings to embrace and act on. In this way, 
after a mindful observation of our urges and thoughts, we can 
then commit to the psychological skills of goal setting to move 
us in the direction we value most. 

 All three of these approaches are rooted in Buddhist philosophy 
and involve meditation. There is a Western camp that is 
sometimes referred to as mindfulness without meditation, as 
there is no formal mindful practice. Its interventions involve social-
psychological approaches to mindfulness that emphasize working 
with information that is outside the individual. It encourages 
engagement with and awareness of the environment, the ability 
to take multiple perspectives, and the ability to revise mindsets 
to develop cognitive flexibility that adapts to the environment to 
achieve the best outcome. 
Benefits of Mindfulness

 Increased mindfulness skill is associated with improved flow, 
which is a mental state thought to be associated with optimal 
athletic performance. One defining aspect of flow is an intense 
and focused concentration on the present moment. Anything 
that can help increase flow is a very good thing.

 Participants in different sports may benefit in different ways 
from nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness. Sports are 
different, with different challenges and different dynamics. The 
individual components of mindfulness may benefit each athlete 
differently. Sometimes you need an open, accepting awareness; 
sometimes you need a focused, narrow one. Mindfulness 
develops your ability to know which focus you need and the 
ability to do that when needed.

Mindfulness Practice Tips
æ
æ
When engaging in mindfulness practice, people often get 
frustrated that they keep losing focus. The benefit is not in 
clearing your mind; it is in refocusing your mind over and 
over. You lose focus and then refocus, and your strength is 
built by repetition of this process. 
æ
æ
Avoid judgement or criticism of yourself or your results, 
especially during the exercise. Bring your attention back to 
the breath with kindness and acceptance of what is, accepting 
your current skill level and the natural state of your mind.
æ
æ
The amount of time you spend in mindfulness practice 
depends on how good you want to be. You can’t overdose on 
mindfulness, although an hour in the morning and an hour 
at night may be the maximum recommended. At the same 
time, do not set yourself up for failure with a goal that is too 
aggressive. Your motivation to practice is critical. You must 
have a purpose for practice and be invested in it, practicing 
with intention, for it to be effective. 
æ
æ
Start where you are, even if it is just 10 minutes per day, and 
practice daily. Then, build on it from there as you improve 
your skill and see the benefits show up in your life. 
æ
æ
Don’t expect dramatic results in a week or two, or even 
four. Depending on your current skill level, it may take 8 
or 12 weeks or more to get the results you want. But during 
that time, you should feel gradual improvements in the way 
you think and feel. Be mindful and observe the results you 
are getting with your current effort and adjust your practice 
intensity accordingly. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
39

 Mindfulness is also associated with higher levels of positive 
emotions and lower levels of negative affect. Positive affect is 
associated with increased enjoyment and performance in sport. 
Negative emotions can decrease performance and contribute to 
overtraining and burnout. This reduction of negative emotions 
and increase in positive ones is a nice side effect of mindfulness 
practice. 

 Mindfulness can help with pain tolerance by decreasing pain 
sensitivity. Decreased pain sensitivity can allow more of the 
athlete’s physical and emotional resources to be dedicated to 
outperforming his or her competition rather than managing his 
or her discomfort.

Questions to Consider
1.	 Describe how each component of mindfulness (paying 
attention, on purpose, in the present moment, without 
judgement) is critical to sport performance.
2.	 What is the difference between mindfully observing an 
emotion, letting it go, and refocusing on the task versus 
ignoring or blocking out the emotion?

LECTURE 5
When Positive 
Thinking Doesn’t 
Work
T
his lecture will introduce some ideas that may 
surprise you: Your mind is not your friend; your 
mind is built for survival, above all else to protect 
you from harm; and what hurts you most is what you 
care the most about, so in an unfortunate way, your 
desire to self-protect decreases your quality of life and 
performance. You have to train yourself to get distance 
from your thoughts, look at them, and ask if each 
thought moves you in the direction you want to go. If it 
does, great. If it doesn’t, then you have to let it go.

Cognitive Defusion

 It isn’t what we think that matters, but how much we invest in it. 
From Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) comes the 
concept of cognitive fusion. Simply stated, fusion means that 
our thoughts dominate our behavior. We are inseparable from 
our thoughts. What they say is our reality. We treat the thoughts 
as if they are exactly what our mind says they are. We are fused 
with what we think. 

 But this isn’t good. We all have thoughts that aren’t true or 
helpful. So, we need cognitive defusion—separating, detaching, 
or distancing from them. We have to step back and see thoughts 
for what they are, which is nothing more than words or pictures. 

 But this is very difficult. When we are born, we live in the world 
of direct experience. We just use our five senses: what we see, 
hear, touch, taste, and smell. But as we get older, we learn how 
to think, and we spend more and more time in this internal world 
of language that has varying degrees of reality to it. 

 Fusion means that we’re stuck in the world of language at the 
expense of the world of experience. Cognitive defusion is like 
mindfulness of thinking, unhooking us from the language of 
thoughts back into the world of direct experience. 

 The purpose of defusion is not to control or change your 
thoughts but to get distance from them so that you can fully 
engage the world of experience, which facilitates effective 
action. You’ll probably feel better, too—but that’s not the goal.

 When fused, thoughts seem like the absolute truth. They can 
feel like a command you have to obey or rule you have to follow 
or something you just know. You just respond to it automatically 
without question. The thought can feel like a threat that you 
have to get rid of as soon as possible, and you experience it as if 
it is right here, right now—even though it’s often about the past 
or the future.

Lecture 5  |  When Positive Thinking Doesn’t Work  
42

 These fused thoughts are experienced as something very 
important that requires all of your attention. This is why when 
people say “don’t think about that” or encourage you to “just 
think positively,” you can’t. These thoughts become something 
that you won’t let go of, even if they worsen your performance 
and your life.

 On the other hand, in a state of defusion, you see thoughts for 
what they really are: experiences inside your head, not out in the 
real world. Sometimes they may reflect a truth in the real world, 
but they often do not. 

 Defusion is a state of relating to the thought in a particular way, 
where you recognize that it may or may not be true. Thoughts 
are not a command or rule you have to follow, just an idea. 
As a result, thoughts are not a threat to you, and in a state of 
defusion, you feel this. 

 The thought is not something happening to you in the physical 
world. It is just words or pictures inside your head, and you have 
distance from the content of those words and pictures. Thoughts 
may or may not be important. In a state of defusion, you can 
make a choice and decide how much attention you want to pay 
to a thought. Thoughts, ultimately, can be allowed to come and 
go on their own, without any need for you to hold onto them or 
push them away.
Workability

 Get out of the mindset of positive thinking versus negative 
thinking and settle into the idea of the workability of thoughts. 
The entire ACT model rests on this idea. It is at the heart of every 
ACT intervention, which is not to make you feel better. Rather, it 
is to help you live a rich, full, and meaningful life. 

 The question to ask of each fused thought is this: Does this 
thought lead me closer to or farther from a rich, full, and 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
43
meaningful life? What is the function and end result of thinking 
that thought? That is how we judge it—not if it is true or false. 
Does it help or hurt us? Then, only attach and interact with the 
thoughts that help.
The Value of Negative Thinking

 When a turtle gets scared, it retreats into its shell. It’s a survival 
instinct, and it seems that each animal has its own unique kind 
that has enabled it to survive as a species. The survival instinct 
of humans is that we worry.

 Our mind scans our environment, constantly looking for 
danger—for something to warn us about. If you go down a dark 
alley late at night, you think about who might be there to rob 
you. You are not afraid of the dark; you are afraid of what you 
think might be in the dark. Your mind warns you of what could 
go wrong, not necessarily what is wrong.

Lecture 5  |  When Positive Thinking Doesn’t Work  
44

 Most of the time, you can acknowledge the danger or threat, 
address it, and move on. We know that airplanes crash, but we 
recognize the safety, defuse from that worry, and fly anyway. Or 
we don’t defuse, have fear, and take the bus.

 All the time, the mind scans the environment to warn you—
and it works. It keeps you alive and safe. You can’t be taught 
to stop negative thinking. It’s your survival instinct, and those 
thoughts won’t stop. It’s how you respond to those thoughts 
that matters. 

 When our survival instinct of negative thinking comes up to warn 
us of danger, we can defuse from it and consider the usefulness 
of the thought. If it is helpful, then act on it. If it is not, let it go 
and behave in a way that brings you closer to what you really 
want, regardless of what you think. 

 Your worry means that you care. We don’t worry about things we 
don’t care about. When we care deeply about something—such 
as another person or a sport or career—we give it the power to 
hurt us. When we care and invest, failure and disappointment 
hurt. And because our mind’s job is to warn us of danger, caring 
about something creates danger. 

 This is often the most consistent, dependable truth about our 
negative thinking. It is a sign that we are in the right place, 
doing something we value. Rather than getting caught up in the 
content of the thoughts, try to see that the purpose of them is 
protection from disappointment—a sign that this matters to you 
very much. 

 A reason to not force positive thinking is because it’s not 
realistic. You know that you can lose or have a bad performance. 
Your mind isn’t going to believe some overly positive spin. 
Acknowledge that the thought—the threat—is there. You can’t 
block it out or act like it doesn’t exist.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
45
Defusion Exercises

 There are many interventions to help performers get distance 
from their thoughts and experience the place where their 
thoughts do not control their actions. These can be used 
whenever an athlete is too close to a thought, interfering with 
his or her performance—or you, if thinking blocks you from your 
valued living.

 We tend to get fused in these areas: rigid rules about life 
and sports that have to be followed; reasons why change 
is impossible or impractical, often preventing the attempt; 
judgements, which can often be helpful and necessary as we 
navigate the world but are problematic when we are fused with 
evaluations; the past or future, which involves ruminating about 
past mistakes or worrying about the future; and self-descriptions 
that can make change difficult.

 Defusion exercises are not techniques as much as they are a 
process. They are a way of teaching performers how to interact 
differently with their internal experiences. They aren’t something 
that automatically unhooks you and then you’re free to go—

Lecture 5  |  When Positive Thinking Doesn’t Work  
46
because the next thought can come right in and hook you again. 
It is a way of teaching athletes to interact with their thinking 
differently, continually, not just when we need it. 

 One of the easiest ways to change your perspective and get 
distance is to label your experience. Take a moment to identify 
one of your negative, self-judgmental thoughts. Put it in a short 
form of “I am X,” such as “I am not good enough” or “I am a 
failure.” Then, let yourself fuse with it for a few moments. Really 
get caught up in it and feel what you feel when you believe it. 
Then, put this phrase in front of it: “I’m having the thought that…,” 
such as “I am having the thought that I’m not good enough.” Do 
this one more time, this time adding this: “I notice I’m having the 
thought that …,” such as “I notice I’m having the thought that I 
am a failure.” 

 Do you feel the distance from the thought? Labeling it as an 
experience, rather than being in the thought, can give you that 
mindful observation, and that makes it easier to choose your 
reaction to it. You can do this with emotions, too: “I notice I am 
having the feeling of anxiety.”

 The idea of defusion is that our thoughts do not determine our 
actions. We like it when our thoughts, feelings, and actions all 
go together. But our thoughts are in fact independent of our 
actions. 

 The essence of cognitive defusion is to experience our thoughts 
as just thoughts and get distance from them, when investing in 
them moves us away from behaving in a valued direction. The 
good news is that you already do this all the time. You don’t act 
on every thought that has ever crossed your mind or on every 
urge or emotion you have ever felt. You defuse from these 
thoughts and feelings all the time. 

 You already act in a valued way independent of what you think 
and feel dozens of times every day—just at the moment the 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
47
reasons such as the law or severe consequences motivate you 
to do so. 

 But the fact remains that your actions are independent. We 
want to cultivate this independence. Mindful awareness of both 
our thoughts and emotions is the first step to learning how to 
best interact with them. Once aware, we can then look at their 
workability, and if they are not working for us, we must learn to 
peacefully accept them as they are and move forward with them.

LECTURE 6
Acceptance and the 
Willingness to Feel
W
e all want to feel good, but that isn’t realistic 
and can create problems. We need to learn 
to accept negative emotions, live with 
them, and perform with them as part of the experience, 
without becoming overly attached to them, focused on 
them, or fighting with them. Then, they are distractions. 
The focus of this lecture is on acceptance.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
49
Acceptance and Control

 A 2014 study found that there are four basic, irreducible 
emotions. Certainly, we experience many more, but they all 
evolved from these four basic, biological emotions that were 
identified across many cultures. Only one of them is positive: 
happiness. The other three are sadness, anger, and fear. So, if 
you want or expect to be happy and positive all the time, you are 
cutting out about 75 percent of what it means to be human. The 
odds of being able to avoid or fix the other three are not great. 
We need to learn to accept them.

 This doesn’t mean that you should just accept every bad thing in 
your life. If control is working—if you can reduce your anxiety or 
manage your thoughts and feelings and that helps move you in 
a direction you want to go—then do that. But if it’s not working, 
if you cannot change what is or if the struggle is hurting your 
performance, then you have to accept that there are things that 
we do not like. You have to let them be there and invest your 
committed attention into what you value most anyway. 

 There is a willingness to feel things as they are. We don’t have 
to like it, but we have to be willing to feel it. But we don’t like 
it. We don’t like pain and things that don’t feel good. And we 
naturally want to avoid or change these unpleasant experiences. 
We obsess about them or push them away. 

 It’s called experiential avoidance: trying to avoid, get rid of, 
suppress, change, or escape unwanted private experiences. We 
do this because it works well. As humans, we are very good at 
problem solving. Over and over, all day, every day, problems 
arise and we fix them. 

 Our mind is like a problem-solving machine, and it works well in 
the physical world. But it doesn’t work well in our mind, which 
takes that same approach to our internal experiences and in the 
process can ruin our performance and increase our suffering.

Lecture 6  |  Acceptance and the Willingness to Feel  
50

 Consider this example: A player is criticized by a coach in 
front of his teammates for not hustling to the ball. As a result, 
embarrassment shows up. The player doesn’t like this feeling. 
So, to get rid of it, he adopts an “I don’t care” attitude. In the 
short term, this works. The feelings of detachment ease the 
embarrassment. But at what cost? Now detached, he lacks focus 
and energy. He doesn’t make good use of practice time and 
isn’t progressing toward his goals, and the lack of effort shows 
up in his play, looking even worse in the coach’s eyes.

 Accepting these feelings does not mean tolerating them—
continuing to be distressed and just moving forward anyway. 
This is still experiential avoidance because the struggle with 
the feelings is still there. If there is still attention to them, 
a hope that they will go away, an active unwanting, or a 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
51
resistance, then this isn’t accepting. And if you are “accepting” 
just so that they will go away, that definitely isn’t acceptance.

 Imagine that you are with your family and they are tolerating 
you, hoping that you will soon go away and checking to see if 
you’ve left yet—versus them totally accepting you with all your 
quirks and flaws and willing to have you around for as long as 
you want to stay. 

 There is a bit of peace that comes with acceptance. You don’t 
have to like it, approve of it, agree with it, or think it’s fair. But 
accepting it does mean that you won’t fight with it and resist 
it either. And you will find that the more you are unwilling to 
feel or experience something, the more you will feel, think, or 
experience it, because if your attention is on getting rid of it, 
then your attention is on it.

 If experiential avoidance works, use it. We are always 
approaching experiences and strategies from a workability 
perspective. If relaxation reduces your anxiety and you don’t 
have to be nervous, then get rid of it. But do not persist in the 
struggle when control is not the solution. 
Creative Hopelessness

 When working with a performer to realize that it is the struggle 
for control—not the thoughts or feelings or urges themselves—
that is the problem, the next step is to enhance that experience. 
The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Mindfulness-
Acceptance-Commitment approaches are not ways to give you 
insight or think differently. These are experiential interventions, 
and the goal of a sport psychologist is to lead the athlete 
through a series of exercises so that he or she can experience a 
different reality or better way of doing things. Just knowing that 
control doesn’t work doesn’t usually help. 

Lecture 6  |  Acceptance and the Willingness to Feel  
52

 We can persist in unhelpful behavior for quite some time, maybe 
because at least we feel like we are doing something, or we keep 
hope alive. Either way, for performers to progress, they have to 
feel that what they are doing now isn’t working and won’t get 
them where they want to go.

 Creative hopelessness is what’s needed. The purpose is to 
highlight the ineffectiveness and specific costs of experiential 
avoidance. We want the athlete to feel hopeless in the 
struggle to control thoughts and feelings so that he or she can 
wholeheartedly give up that agenda. It is creative in the sense 
that once the agenda of control is gone, the athlete is open to 
alternative ways of handling his or her situation. There is room 
for mindfulness and acceptance, the opposite of control. 

 All creative hopelessness interventions are built around three 
simple questions: What have you tried? How has it worked? 
What has it cost you? What’s great about this is that the sport 
psychologist doesn’t have to convince the athlete of anything. 

 In fact, the psychologist is trying to convince the athlete, then 
the psychologist is undermining the process, because he or 
she knows that something isn’t working. It’s why the athlete has 
come to the psychologist’s office. If it is working, then there is 
no reason to stop. But if it isn’t, then the athlete has to discover 
experientially for him- or herself where it isn’t and what the costs 
are. The psychologist’s role is to just ask the questions that help 
the athlete see the truth.
Acceptance Exercises

 The following is an intervention that illustrates how little control 
over our thoughts, feelings, and experiences we actually have:
››
Take a moment to remember where you work. Then, delete 
that memory; get rid of it completely. Did you do that?

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
53
››
Next, make your right leg go completely numb—so numb that 
if it were to be chopped off, you wouldn’t feel a thing. Can you 
do that?
››
Do not think, even for a second, 
about ice cream—not how much 
you like it or don’t care about it, 
not your favorite flavor, not how 
cold it is. Don’t even check in to 
be sure you’re not thinking about 
it, because that would be thinking 
about it. How’s it going?
››
Let’s say that you are on one of 
those dunk tanks, sitting above a tank 
of ravenous sharks and hooked up to 
a biofeedback machine. As long as you 
stay completely calm, you’re fine. But if 
you show even the tiniest hint of anxiety, 
the bench will drop you into the tank. It’s 
foolproof and you can’t beat the machine. 
How long would you last?
››
Let’s say that you would get a billion dollars if you fell genuinely 
and hopelessly in love with the next stranger you passed on 
the street. You could say that you love him or her, kiss and hug 
him or her, and even marry him or her. We control our actions. 
But even for a billion dollars, could you control your emotion 
and fall in true love instantly? No.

 And we can’t control our anxiety. We can’t control what we 
think about, what we feel or don’t feel physically, or what we 
remember or forget. So, let’s learn to accept these things and 
perform with them. 

 Acceptance is very different than dealing with it. It involves a 
combination of things that center around exactly where you put 
your attention and energy into. This is critical for performance. To 
be our best, we have to be focused on the moment, immersed in 
our performance activity. We can’t be struggling to change what 

Lecture 6  |  Acceptance and the Willingness to Feel  
54
we think and feel. When we willingly feel the painful emotions in 
service of our performance-related values, that is acceptance.

 The following is a language tip that will also facilitate acceptance:
››
We often say things like this: “I want to do X, but it’s hard.” “I 
want to shoot the ball, but I’m afraid I’ll miss.” “I want to work 
out, but I’m tired.” The “but” discounts what comes before 
it, placing an emphasis on what follows. It sets the two things 
up as if they can’t coexist. The latter becomes the barrier and 
reason why you can’t do the former. 
››
However, observe what happens when we change the “but” to 
an “and”: “I want to do X, and it’s hard.” “I want to shoot the 
ball, and I’m afraid I’ll miss.” “I want to work out, and I’m tired.”

 Do you see how that simple change of a word opens up room 
for both your values and your unpleasant experiences? It is 
from this place of acceptance that the performer can start to 
take effective action steps to bring him or her closer to his or 
her goals. With mindfulness and acceptance, he or she can take 
flexible action, adapting to the challenges of each situation, 
persisting and changing behavior as needed in pursuit of values. 
Suggested Reading

Questions to Consider
1.	 Think of a behavior that you struggle to persist in. What 
negative emotion do you need to accept to persevere in 
that activity?
2.	 The pursuit of excellence is not purely positive, no matter 
how much the goal is desired or valued. List as many 
negative experiences the athlete must accept in his or her 
training process to be successful as you can.

LECTURE 7
Commitment Means 
“No Matter What”
C
ommitment is not a try. It is not an attempt or 
a best effort. It’s not “I will—until it gets too 
hard, or I don’t feel like it anymore, or it doesn’t 
work for me anymore.” It is “I will—no matter what.” 
And 
in 
the 
Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment 
(MAC) model for performance enhancement, or in the 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy approach to 
living a valued life, this committed action stage is where 
all the mindfulness and acceptance techniques have 
been leading, enabling you to move you in a valued 
direction under any circumstances. 

Lecture 7  |  Commitment Means “No Matter What”  
56
Commitment

 There is a real cost and sacrifice to achieving our goals and living 
our values. Pain, difficulty, setbacks, fear, and adversity are all 
part of the process. They are necessary parts that we have to 
endure en route to achievement. 

 You might think of commitment as the psychological construct 
that benefits from the use of mindfulness and acceptance skills 
so that you behaviorally persevere in a valued direction. And 
that’s another big point to make about commitment. It isn’t a 
promise or a feeling. It’s a behavior. 

 When working with performers, after establishing their values 
and developing mindfulness and acceptance skills to interact 
differently with their internal experiences, it’s time to get specific 
about the behaviors that both help and hurt performance. 
Everything we do moves us closer to or farther from our values 
and goals. 

 We look at the athletes’ behaviors in both practice and 
competition, as well as interactions with teammates and the 
coaching staff, to determine if what they are doing matches up 
with their values. When it doesn’t, we define how to change and 
then commit to acting in that way consistently, especially when 
they don’t feel like it. 

 Commitment should not be confused with motivation. 
Sometimes people think of commitment as a strong want. “I 
want to win a championship; I’m committed to doing whatever 
it takes.” They’ll say this in an emotional moment, and maybe at 
that moment they mean it. They feel it and are excited, and they 
confuse that with commitment. 

 Commitment is seen when you consistently demonstrate the 
specific behaviors and activities that are likely to directly result 
in optimal performance. And because it is not emotional, 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
57
commitment doesn’t waver in the heat of a moment or during a 
tough workout. 

 Ultimately, commitment comes down to a choice. Do we let 
emotions drive our behavior or our values? When the two 
conflict—and they will—only one can be satisfied. Commitment 
is the behavioral follow-through on our values.

 To the performer, we ask this very important question: Are you 
ready to do what is necessary to maximize your performance 
and pursue your personal performance values and goals? The 
quick answer is usually yes, but then we ask a follow-up question: 
Are you fully aware and open to accept all the experiences 
that will happen during this process—the good and the bad, 
the pleasant and the painful? Then we discuss the things the 
performer doesn’t like and doesn’t want to do and how he or 
she is going to handle that.

 This is a step that cannot be taken lightly. It’s a reality check. 
Now is not the time to think about how awesome it will be when 
we achieve what we’re committing to. At this point, we need 
to look at the daily grind—the unpleasantness of deliberate 
practice—realizing that there is a faithfulness to what we’re 
about to do and bringing ourselves to our performance tasks 
consistently and wholeheartedly.

 A choice has to be made. You cannot persevere and do what 
it takes to be the best and do it comfortably. You can’t do it 
well and struggle to control your thoughts, feelings, memories, 
urges, or physical sensations. When you engage in that struggle, 
your progress to move ahead stops. 

 Your commitment is what determines your potential. In other 
words, how much unpleasantness in service of your goal that 
you’re willing to feel as you act in a committed way determines 
how far you’ll go. Deliberate practice plays a critical role in skill 
development. The more focused and frequent your practice, the 
more your skills develop. 

Lecture 7  |  Commitment Means “No Matter What”  
58

 Experts dedicate an enormous amount of time to deliberate 
practice over many years. They have a history of behaving in a 
highly committed way. It’s not that it’s easier for them. They’re 
just willing to feel and sacrifice more and engage in valued 
practice activities to develop their skills—no matter what. 
How committed you are, where you set the bar at willingness, 
determines how far you will get. Where do you draw the line? 
The more you are willing to accept, the higher the commitment 
and the better the results.

 Authors of the MAC approach to enhancing human performance, 
Frank Gardner and Zella Moore, describe a commitment to 
performance values exercise that goes like this. After identifying 
a specific value to focus on, such as being a good teammate, the 
consultant will help the athlete set both long- and short-term 
behavioral goals that reflect that value. 

 In the short term, for example, better communication between 
the athlete and teammates and more fun on and off the court 
could be the goals, and in the long term, this would develop 
more solid relationships and ultimately result in a better team.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
59

 Then, the most critical part is to identify the behaviors that have 
to be added or changed to achieve the performance value. In 
this example, complaining less about teammates, reaching out 
and being more social with teammates on and off the court, and 
making a conscious effort to be upbeat at practice might be 
identified.

 At this point, the consultant will remind the athlete to consider 
what might get in the way and how to use the previously learned 
mindfulness and acceptance skills to be the most effective. This 
athlete may identify her anger and frustration with teammates 
when they make a mistake, previously “causing” her to yell or be 
critical. 

 It is often emotions, thoughts, and discomfort that get us off 
track. And this is when we remind the performer that thoughts 
and emotions can’t make us do anything. We make a choice to 
act on them in a particular way. The commitment, then, is to let 
them pass, refocus, and act on what moves the athlete closer to 
her valued goals. 

 From a MAC perspective, commitment isn’t a stage or skill in 
and of itself. The mindfulness, acceptance, being in touch with 
values, willingness, and commitment are all done simultaneously 
as part of the performance process, interacting with each other 
to help the athlete move forward in a positive direction. There 
are other factors, too. 
Studying Commitment

 The best sport goals are moderate—challenging but realistic—
and your commitment moderates this relationship. When 
commitment is high, highly-difficult goals are associated with 
the best results. Commitment doesn’t matter as much with easy 
goals. You don’t get high performance with easy goals, regardless 
of your commitment level. But commitment has an increasingly 
greater effect on performance as the task difficulty increases.

Lecture 7  |  Commitment Means “No Matter What”  
60

 So, goal setting alone isn’t sufficient. Commitment influences 
the results, and this is because of our tendency to want to 
escape the unpleasant experiences that occur with goal 
difficulty. Commitment seems to buffer the discomfort, allowing 
us to feel uncomfortable and persevere anyway. 

 A study done in 2010 with more than 300 U.S.A. Gymnastics 
female athletes expanded on an earlier model predicting what 
contributes to an athlete’s sport commitment. This model 
differentiates psychological commitment, which is an emotional 
desire and resolve to continue participation, from behavioral 
commitment, which is effort, intensity, and perseverance in 
action. 

 The 
psychological 
and 
behavioral 
commitments 
are 
independent. It’s only behavioral actions that get results on the 
playing field. For this reason, it’s the behavioral commitment 
that coaches and parents are most concerned about. But 
despite this independence, what we think and feel can influence 
action. So, we want to look at the factors that contribute 
to psychological commitment, as it can have an impact on 
behavioral commitment. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
61

 Enjoyment and participation in team activities such as travel, team 
affiliation, and achieving goals are strong predictors of increased 
commitment. The more fun you are having and the more benefits 
you perceive you’re getting, the more committed you are likely 
to be. So, when choosing an activity, be sure you find the fun 
in it; connecting with the people involved and tracking your 
improvements can strengthen your resolve to continue.

 Having attractive alternatives to your activity significantly 
predicts less commitment. In other words, commitment is 
stronger when you have fewer options to choose from.

 Personal investments and perceived costs also significantly 
affect psychological commitment. Personal investments are 
factors such as time, effort, and energy that you put into the 
activity that would be lost if you discontinued it. The more you 
invest, the more committed you are to continue. Perceived costs 
are the downsides of participation, such as time constraints, 
injury, missing out on social activities, and the pressures of 
competition. These are the costs of playing and have the 
opposite effect, undermining sport commitment. 

 Personal investments and perceived costs not only significantly 
contribute to psychological commitment, which is believed 
to somewhat influence behavioral commitment, but they 
also are the only two factors that directly predict behavioral 
commitment—the construct of greatest importance. The act of 
staying engaged and investing in your sport while minimizing the 
negatives of participating should have a strong effect on your 
commitment level. 

 Filtering the factors of investments and costs through your 
values and asking yourself whether it is worth it will strongly and 
directly increase your committed actions. 

 In the gymnastics study, personal investments and perceived 
costs only explained 8 percent of the variance in training 
behaviors. That means that 92 percent of an athlete’s committed 

Lecture 7  |  Commitment Means “No Matter What”  
62
behavioral action is due to other things. On the other hand, 74 
percent of the psychological commitment was explained by the 
factors previously described. So, we understand much of where 
that psychological commitment comes from but much less 
about what contributes to actually taking action. 

 Factors such as social constraints, social support, and perceived 
competence inconsistently predict commitment in the research, 
but in this 2010 study were not significant. They remain included 
in the Sport Commitment Model to encourage further study. 

 With this and other studies, including their own in-depth research 
series, the original authors of the 1993 Sport Commitment 
Model revised it in 2013. The result is a cleaner, more specific, 
and accurate model with some new and interesting constructs. 

 They more narrowly define the different types of commitment 
as either enthusiastic (the “I want to” kind) or constrained (the 
“I have to” kind). In this updated model, researchers found 
that sport enjoyment continues to be a strong predictor of 
commitment. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
63

 In this revision, the authors make an important clarification 
between “other priorities” and “involvement alternatives.” If 
there are attractive or pressing alternatives that directly conflict 
with sport participation, then these priorities will lessen sport 
commitment. But if there isn’t a direct conflict, there is no effect. 

 Similarly, the personal investments put into sport, such as time, 
effort, and energy—the investments that cannot be recovered if 
participation in sport is discontinued—strengthen commitment 
if players actually see that personal investment as a loss. But if 
players don’t see it as a sacrifice, then such investments have 
no effect on commitment. So, there is this qualifying effect: 
Investment of time, effort, and energy will not affect the level of 
everyone’s commitment the same. 

 This qualifying effect also extends to social constraints, the 
expectations of others that create feelings of obligation to 
participate in sport. This can strengthen commitment to sport 
in an athlete who doesn’t feel as if he or she has control over 
whether or not to participate. 

 Social support did make the cut in this model. At least 80 percent 
of each team interviewed cited social support as a strengthening 
factor in their commitment. And a new source of commitment, 
the desire to excel, was found to be a strong factor.

LECTURE 8
Finding Internal 
Motivation
C
oaches and bosses want to know how to 
motivate their players and employees to get the 
most out of them. And as you will learn in this 
lecture, the more internally motivated we can be, the 
better. Meeting our needs for autonomy, competence, 
and relatedness will increase our motivation, and when 
we meet these needs, our performance improves. We 
want to support autonomy in others in the way we 
coach and encourage them, building them up in these 
psychological needs. It isn’t always the easiest or most 
natural thing to do, but it is worth the effort.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
65
Self-Determination Theory

 Self-determination theory is a meta-theory comprised of five 
mini-theories. It starts with the idea that individuals have a 
natural tendency for growth and development. There is a self-
motivation to seek challenges and new experiences to master in 
order to grow. That internal desire is called intrinsic motivation, 
and it is that activating force that we want to stimulate and 
encourage for maximal growth. 

 To do so, there are three psychological needs that, when met, 
will produce a higher quality of motivation, better psychological 
well-being, and greater investment and engagement in adaptive 
behavior. Basic psychological needs theory, the first of the five 
mini-theories, identifies autonomy, competence, and relatedness 
as the three. 
››
Autonomy is the need to experience the activities as a personal 
choice.
››
Competence is the need to feel effective and achieve 
outcomes that are meaningful to you. Competence also has to 
do with social influence. 
››
Relatedness is the need to feel close to, connected to, and 
cared for by important others. 

 The strength of these needs may vary from person to person, but 
the belief is that these needs are innate, universal, and necessary 
for optimal human development. When these needs are met, 
athletes will be active participants and persist through adversity 
in training and competition. They will be in more positive physical 
and psychological health and will perform better.

 When the opposite happens and these needs are frustrated—
athletes feel that a lack of choice or personal input is ignored, 
experience repeated failure or attention is called to those 
failures, or feel rejected and isolated—then burnout and negative 
emotions, as well as subpar performance, can occur. 

Lecture 8  |  Finding Internal Motivation  
66

 Cognitive evaluation theory is the second mini-theory and 
suggests that activities that meet the need for the individual’s 
own standards for competence and autonomy will enhance 
intrinsic motivation. Note that competence and autonomy have 
to be experienced together; just one is not sufficient. 

 The third mini-theory, organismic integration theory, proposes 
that there are multiple reasons for individuals to act in a 
particular way—so it isn’t just intrinsic motivation that matters. 
Extrinsic factors outside of the individual combine with the 
internal to produce a total motivating force within the individual. 

 Goal contents theory, the most recent addition to self-
determination theory, also distinguishes between intrinsic 
and extrinsic goals. Internal goals—such as growth, affiliation, 
contribution to the community, and maintenance of physical 
health—are supportive of basic need satisfaction and tend to 
be focused on developing personal interests. They’re inherently 
satisfying to pursue. Extrinsic goals—such as financial success, 
attractiveness or image, and social recognition—focus on 
external validations of worth and are less supportive, and they 
can even undermine the basic psychological needs. 

 There is a growing body of research that supports the idea 
that intrinsic life goals are better associated with an individual’s 
health and adjustment compared to extrinsic life goals. 

 We can start to see motivation on a continuum, with amotivation 
on one extreme and intrinsic motivation on the other. In between 
are four forms of extrinsic motivation that vary according to 
regulation style, or driving force. Amotivation doesn’t have a 
driving force; you aren’t motivated, and you lack energy. This 
often results from feelings of incompetence and uncontrollability 
and is frequently linked to dropout. 

 The next step up from amotivation is the first form of extrinsic 
motivation. It’s called external regulation. This is when you’re 
doing something but only because you feel controlled by 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
67
factors outside yourself. Athletes do not persist long this way. 
When these external controlling factors disappear, so does the 
targeted behavior. 

 In the next three levels of extrinsic motivation, we start to see 
some ownership and increasing levels of autonomy. Introjected 
regulation describes a partial internalization of drive. What 
defines success is set outside the athlete and then adopted 
internally. It’s still external control because the focus is on 
getting approval or achieving self-worth outside of oneself, 
depending on the behavior. It is a motivator and it can help you 
persist, but it generally doesn’t last. 

 We start to move into autonomous motivation with identified 
regulation. And with autonomous regulation comes higher effort, 
persistence through challenges, and better performance. Here 
the behavior is fueled by the contributions the activity makes 
to our own personal goals and values. But it is the usefulness of 
the activity, not the interest in the activity itself, that guides the 
behavior. This isn’t bad, and it’s often necessary. We perform 
activities out of choice without necessarily enjoying them. 

 Integrated regulation, the most autonomous form of extrinsic 
motivation, is fully internalized and internal motivation in that 
the behaviors are fully coordinated and in agreement with 
personal values and needs. There is still a distinction from 
intrinsic motivation in that the activity is still done to achieve 
something as opposed to the sheer pleasure or enjoyment of it. 
When integrated, sport or the performance activity is a part of 
who the person is. 

 In the real world, we might not that often engage in activities 
solely because of the enjoyment and the opportunity to learn 
and personally develop, but intrinsic motivation is the highest 
degree or strongest level of self-determined motivation. As 
coaches, parents, and supervisors who want to help others 
get motivated, we want to look at these four kinds of extrinsic 
motivation, because we are external sources, and see what 

Lecture 8  |  Finding Internal Motivation  
68
behaviors will increase or decrease the autonomy, competence, 
and relatedness on the part of the people we are trying to 
motivate so that we can help maximize their internal drive.

 The fifth mini-theory of self-determination theory, causality 
orientations theory, states that everyone has varied combined 
levels of autonomy orientation, controlled orientation, and 
impersonal orientation inside of them. 
››
Autonomy orientation refers to internal and well-integrated 
external motivation. 
››
Controlled orientation is being more motivated by internal 
and external controls, constraints, and directives. 
››
Impersonal orientation is a tendency for people to believe that 
they are incompetent and just go with the flow or be passive 
and not act intentionally. 

 An autonomous orientation is predictive of effective functioning, 
adaptive behavior, and good psychological health. Control and 
impersonal orientations show the opposite. 

 This autonomy-versus-control distinction is an important one. 
When self-determined people experience more excitement, 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
69
interest, and confidence, it increases their persistence. As you 
go through the extrinsic motivation continuum, performance 
improves as you become increasingly internalized and self-
regulated. 

 Autonomous motivation predicts better well-being and vitality, 
higher levels of flow, and greater effort, interest, persistence, 
and even sportsmanship. Controlling types of motivation, 
however, are associated with burnout, low levels of flow, 
dropout, aggression, and acceptance of cheating.

 If you want to maximize motivation, be careful: More isn’t 
necessarily better. Motivation doesn’t seem to be additive. For 
example, if you’re intrinsically motivated to do something, if you 
add an additional reward on top of it, such as a bonus, that doesn’t 
mean that you will be even more motivated. It is more about 
the overall sum quality of the motivation and how all the factors 
interact. In general, the more purely intrinsic it is, the better.
Self-Determination Theory in Practice

 As a coach or boss or parent, you can influence the environment 
in which your athlete, subordinate, or child operates, increasing 
or decreasing his or her motivation and influencing performance. 
Autonomy support—the reinforcement of choice, initiation, 
and understanding while simultaneously minimizing the need 
to perform and act in a dictated way—not only promotes 
autonomy but can satisfy the other two needs of competence 
and relatedness, too. An autonomy-supportive coach offers 
emotional support, advice, and guidance to help athletes 
develop responsibility and take ownership of their performance. 

 There are a few reasons why it is difficult to coach or parent or 
supervise in a way that is consistent with self-determination theory.

 Parenting styles in the 1950s and 1960s used a lot of rewards and 
punishments to shape behaviors. Coaches did this with athletes 

Lecture 8  |  Finding Internal Motivation  
70
then, too. And coaches today tend to coach the way they were 
coached. Growth and change are difficult, and it can take a 
coach out of his comfort zone, requiring a lot of time, patience, 
reflection, and intentional practice to overcome the habit of a 
controlling coaching style. 

 And in the short term, some of those controlling behaviors can 
work, and the coach gets immediate results but isn’t tuned into 
the long-term consequences, such as an overall worsening of 
motivation, mood, and dedication. Coaches are the dominant 
role in an unequal relationship with the athlete, and this can 
encourage a more controlling orientation. 

 Loud behaviors—such as yelling from the sideline, getting mad 
at refs, barking orders, and being too busy to talk to the players 
on the sideline—seem to communicate that the coach has 
structure, demands, and expectations that need to get met to 
push the team to better performances. 

 Alternatively, autonomy supporting can be misinterpreted as 
hands-off and lazy. Sometimes if you ask athletes questions 
about what they think they should do rather than telling 
them, they might think you don’t know. But asking questions 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
71
is coaching the player to think for him- or herself, improving 
independence and decision making. Without giving constant 
direction, a coach may be misperceived as incompetent. 

 What the public considers good and bad coaching may not line 
up with what science and research tells us is most beneficial. 
Coaching may have to be countercultural—and that’s difficult. 
On the other hand, sometimes athletes prefer to be controlled, 
so we have to be sensitive to individual differences. 

 This relationship isn’t one-directional. Coaches respond to 
the behavior of athletes as well. Not every athlete is going to 
become wonderfully motivated and independent. Some are 
less cooperative than others, and this challenges a coach, who 
is responsible for moving the team forward. It’s easiest to try to 
control the ones lagging behind and force the motivation on 
them. Unfortunately, that will only serve to further undermine 
self-determined motivation, making them less motivated, leading 
to more controlling behaviors to fix it in a downward spiral.

LECTURE 9
Using Imagery to 
Prepare for Action
I
magery, a mental training skill many elite athletes 
use, is a cognitive process that activates the 
same brain areas that are also involved with the 
unconscious planning and execution of movements. 
Imagery activates neural and behavioral responses 
similar to the genuine experience. Through the use 
of brain-imaging techniques, we know that imagining 
yourself make an action mirrors the neural pattern 
found during the actual execution of that same 
movement. As a result, imagery is a mental technique 
that performers use to prepare for action, rehearsing 
and training their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors for 
peak performances. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
73
Imagery

 Imagery is a skill that can be learned and improved with practice. 
And while it is frequently used to improve physical performance, 
tasks that also include a cognitive component may be even 
more susceptible to improvement through imagery.

 Sometimes called visualization, as this is a large component of 
the experience, athletes will see themselves from one of two 
perspectives. One is from a first-person perspective, called 
internal visual imagery—that is, seeing what he or she would see 
if he or she were actually performing. The other is external visual 
imagery, a third-person perspective in which the performer is 
watching the action from outside his or her own body. In this 
image, individuals view their performance from multiple angles 
to improve their processing of relevant details. 

 You may have heard imagery referred to as visualization, but that 
doesn’t quite capture it. Visualizing is certainly a part of it, but the 
visual image alone is too limiting. Kinesthetic, or feeling, imagery 
is also needed. 

 Kinesthetic imagery includes calling to mind the physical 
sensations, such as the muscle tension and rapid heart rate, you 
might feel before competition. It might also include an awareness 
of your body’s movement in execution or positioning in space. 
Feeling pain and fatigue are common components of kinesthetic 
imagery that are incorporated with endurance athletes or with 
patients rehabilitating from an injury. Emotions are also an 
important component of feeling an image. 

 Performers have to use all of their senses in imagery. And 
while visualizing your performance has some link to the motor 
execution of that action, through the use of functional MRI, 
we find that kinesthetic imagery results in greater activation of 
motor-processing brain structures than visual imagery alone. 

Lecture 9  |  Using Imagery to Prepare for Action  
74

 What makes imagery so effective, and how does it help 
performance? In short, it is the degree of neural overlap between 
imagery and the preparation and production of actual movements 
called functional equivalence. Not only are similar brain activities 
noted when a behavior is both imagined and performed, but 
recorded EMG activity showed similar responses in muscles when 
performing and imagining tasks. 

 In one study, greater EMG activity in the muscles was noted 
when greater dumbbell weight was imagined being lifted. 
Researchers in a study from 2009 found that participants 
increased their one-rep maximum on a bicep-curl strength 
task about equally when comparing imagery alone to physical 
practice alone. This means that some participants got physically 
stronger without lifting weights.

 Imagery affects more than muscles, producing cardiovascular 
and respiratory responses. If you imagine that stressful meeting 
tomorrow or that big tournament this weekend, your heart rate 
increases and your breathing becomes short and shallow, just like 
it does in real life.

 This functional equivalence extends to the neural activity that 
occurs when you see, hear, and smell things in visual, auditory, 
and olfactory imagery. The same neural process that are activated 
when you perceive things with your senses are recreated when 
you imagine them. 
The PETTLEP Model

 When we physically learn to do something, the brain changes. 
Neural connections are strengthened, connections are added 
or removed, and new cells are formed. And we now know that 
the brain is activated in very similar ways when imagining motor 
movements. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
75

 So, the brain changes that occur when you learn a new skill 
physically are also occurring when you imagine them, resulting 
in real physical learning and development of that imagined 
skill. This learning can occur even in the absence of physical 
practice—but it can’t replace your training. 

 Combining physical practice with imagery consistently yields 
superior performance results than practice alone. In some 
cases, alternating physical practice with imagery alone resulted 
in similar performance results, despite a 50-percent reduction in 
physical training. 

 To get the best effect, you want to maximize the neural overlap 
between your images and your physical performance. The 
approach suggested by the PETTLEP model of imagery does this. 
Each of the seven elements of this acronym intends to amplify the 
functional equivalence between imagery and motor performance.
››
The P stands for the physical nature of imagery. Imagery can be 
done in a relaxed state, but it is more powerful when you move 
and rehearse the actual movements. The more physical it can 
be, the better. So, get your body into position to perform, make 
the movements, wear the clothes you will be competing in, and 
hold any equipment specific to the task you are rehearsing. 

Lecture 9  |  Using Imagery to Prepare for Action  
76
››
The E, environment, refers to where the imagery is performed. 
Visit the site where you will be performing, taking pictures as 
needed to remember details, and recreate the location in your 
mind when you return home. 
››
The first T, task, defines the content of the image. It should be 
appropriate to the skill level and preferences of the performer. 
Imagery is intended to develop real skills; it isn’t a fantasy.
››
The second T is timing and refers to the speed of the image. 
Whenever possible, real-time imagery is preferred because 
we perform in real time. You may slow an image to focus on 
a particular detail if needed or when control of the image is 
difficult and slow motion is needed to correct it. But in general, 
real time is preferred to enhance the reality of the image. 
››
Learning is the fifth component of the model. Like task, the 
learning component takes into account the current skill level of 
the performer, but adds that the content of the imagery should 
be adapted over time as the athlete becomes more skilled. 
Changing the imagery in response to learning keeps the athlete 
progressing in skills. This not only refers to physical skills, but 
also psychological states, such as confidence and motivation.
››
The next component is emotion. We live life emotionally, and this 
is particularly true of competitive sport and other performance 
domains. Therefore, for an image to be realistic, the emotions 
felt during performance must 
be recreated. Rehearsing and 
developing 
the 
emotional 
responses you want to feel 
during a performance is a great 
target for imagery use.
››
Perspective is the final component 
and refers to the viewpoint of the 
performer during imagery. There 
is not a strong consensus on which 
perspective is better, either first person 
or third person. First person may be best 
when rehearsing attitudes and emotions 
or when rehearsing strategy. A third-person 
perspective may be adopted to review form 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
77
when executing a technical skill. Athletes report using both 
and sometimes bouncing between the two. 
How to Do Imagery

 The PETTLEP model includes the first two important points of 
how to do imagery: include physical movement and equipment 
and do it in the performance environment—or at least recreate 
the environment the best you can by imagining details, using 
audio sounds and scents. 

 The combination of physical practice and imagery yields 
the best results, and like physical skills, imagery skills can be 
developed. At least three times per week is recommended, as 
one study found significantly better results with three practices 
over just once weekly.

 Physical practice can be limited by injury, fatigue, or overtraining 
the body. PETTLEP imagery can be done when the body needs 
to rest. So, by combining imagery with physical practice, wear 
and tear on the body can be decreased. 

 Many of the studies proving imagery’s effectiveness consist 
of only 3 to 15 minutes of practice in the whole experiment. 
Although effective, such a short duration may not maximize the 
effect, and the authors of a meta-analysis examining this issue 
concluded that 20 minutes is the optimal duration of imagery 
practice.

 A big question, with some conflicting recommendations, is 
whether you should relax before doing imagery. With the 
PETTLEP model, you probably shouldn’t. Relaxation is often 
inconsistent with the excited arousal stage of performance and 
may conflict with the desired realistic emotional component. 

 Imagery vividness does not seem to be enhanced when you 
relax beforehand either. Although if you aren’t able to control 

Lecture 9  |  Using Imagery to Prepare for Action  
78
the image or concentrate on what you are doing, some authors 
suggest that relaxation can help clear out distractions for imagery 
beginners and help them focus. 

 Another thing to avoid when using imagery is negative language. 
“Don’t turn the ball over” or “don’t make a mistake here” are 
sport examples. Our brains don’t process the negative language 
without introducing the very thing we do not want to see or do. 
Focus on and use words that reflect only what you want to do. 

 Controlled research has proven that negative imagery can result 
in performance deterioration, so you want to be sure you control 
your imagery to do what you intend it to do. If you accidentally 
have a negative image, you don’t want to end there. Take the 
time to correct it and end on a positive image.

 But you don’t want to imagine everything unrealistically perfect 
either. Imagine great performances under realistic adverse 
conditions, such as feeling nervous or imagining yourself bouncing 
back from a mistake to perform in the clutch. These are more 
helpful scenarios, particularly in practice between competitions. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
79
Before performances, however, keeping your imagery and focus 
on excellent execution is best.

 Also avoid imagery without a goal. Each imagery practice 
session should have a specific purpose. There is a triple-code 
model of imagery that highlights three essential components: 
the image itself, the somatic or bodily response to the image, 
and the personal meaning of the image. 

 Personal meaning has been shown to create greater EMG activity 
in the muscles and a greater perception of imagery ability 
compared to generic imagery scripts. That meaning, or purpose, 
of the image can be varied. 

 In addition to using imagery for motor learning, you can also use 
imagery to improve your motivation for a particular task or goal 
by rehearsing the emotions you want to feel in those challenging 
situations. 

 You can practice focused attention, physical arousal, and 
emotional control. You can review past performances and evaluate 
your decisions and actions. You can use imagery to enhance 
strength and flexibility by imagining the growth and lengthening 
of the muscles during exercise. Research has also found imagery 
to be effective in healing by imagining the process of physiological 
healing, or seeing yourself as healthy and fully functioning. 

 This isn’t limited to just sport rehabilitation but is used in the 
effective treatment of cancer and other chronic diseases. Graded 
motor imagery, for example, is a specific protocol that has been 
used to lower pain and disability in chronic pain populations. 

 The motivation to practice often gets in the way of successful 
imagery practice. An imagery program takes a lot of time and 
effort to be successful. It is up to the performer to decide if 
the gains are worth the investment. It helps to understand the 
measurable performance improvement that can be had through 

Lecture 9  |  Using Imagery to Prepare for Action  
80
the real physiological changes that occur with consistent imagery 
rehearsal.

 Sometimes, performers can get frustrated with their lack of 
imagery control or vividness. They may assume that they just are 
no good at it or get upset with how difficult it is. In this case, 
it is important to remember that imagery is a skill that can be 
developed with deliberate practice over time, just like any other 
skill. Looking at the results it can have, an athlete has to decide if 
he or she is willing to dedicate him- or herself to practice and be 
willing to work through the frustration to be successful.

 The most unfortunate scenario is when an athlete falsely 
concludes that imagery just isn’t helpful when performance 
doesn’t improve because of a lack of attention to detail in 
following the PETTLEP model, too-infrequent practice sessions, 
or shorter-than-optimal duration of practice. Don’t expect 
results if you don’t pay attention to detail and put in the work. 
Excellence takes work. Commit to the work.

LECTURE 10
Confidence and 
Self-Talk
C
onfidence can be very powerful. When you 
believe that you can do something, you pursue 
it with more vigor, focus, and drive. On the 
other hand, when you lack confidence, you avoid 
difficult goals, give less effort, and give up more easily. 
In this lecture, you will learn how confidence empowers 
you to be your best and take action as well as how self-
talk affects confidence.

Lecture 10  |  Confidence and Self-Talk  
82
Confidence

 We all know confidence when we see it, but it can be more difficult 
to define. In fact, the literature in sport psychology will often 
interchangeably use the terms self-confidence and self-efficacy. 

 Self-efficacy as a theory was first coined in 1977 by Albert 
Bandura, who defined it as an individual’s belief in one’s 
capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action 
required to get the desired results. 

 Sport confidence is the degree of certainty individuals possess 
about their capability to be successful in sport, so it is more 
general and focused on the result, as opposed to the abilities 
necessary to achieve the result, as in self-efficacy. 

 Both involve a cognitive process where we make judgements 
about our ability to accomplish a particular goal. In both we are 
talking about a self-concept within a goal-striving framework 
about what we can do—not about attributes we may possess 
or good feelings about ourselves. Both self-efficacy and sport 
confidence are goal oriented. 

 Self-efficacy beliefs can vary in level, strength, and generality. 
Self-efficacy level refers to the confidence someone has in his or 
her ability to perform in various challenging tasks. You generally 
need a higher level of self-efficacy to believe you can succeed 
more difficult tasks. 

 Self-efficacy strength is the degree of confidence a person has 
in his or her abilities. We know or believe few things 100 percent. 

 Self-efficacy generality refers to how much this set of beliefs 
can be applied to a range of activities or conditions. One 
athlete may feel that he or she can succeed in all athletic 
challenges, another may be confident in racquet sports but not 
endurance events or ball-handling games, and still another may 
be confident only in tennis.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
83

 Greater beliefs people have in their own capabilities consistently 
predict improved performance and accomplishment across 
numerous life situations, including in sports, education, and the 
workplace. 

 It’s not so much that beliefs have a direct impact on performance—
although they do through their influence on behavior—it’s just 
that beliefs alone don’t make anything happen. 

 Efficacy beliefs have powerful indirect effects, too. Your self-
efficacy beliefs influence what you choose to do. They influence 
the goals you choose to pursue, the level of difficulty they are, 
and the effort you put into achieving them. The higher your 
belief in your own self-efficacy, the more challenging your goal 
will be and the more you will persist in the face of adversity. 

 Commitment rises with self-efficacy. On the flip side, if you 
lack confidence, you are more likely to avoid the task even if 
objectively you can do it. 

Lecture 10  |  Confidence and Self-Talk  
84

 Your self-efficacy beliefs influence how you interpret the world 
around you and what happens to you. When you are confident, 
you tend to interpret tasks as challenging rather than threatening, 
are more optimistic and less likely to expect a negative outcome, 
and will have fewer negative emotions when performing tasks. 
That rapid heart rate and jittery feeling can either be excitement 
that will help you when you’re confident or nervousness that will 
interfere with performance when self-efficacy is low. 

 When things do go wrong, confidence serves as a cognitive 
buffer, limiting the damaging effects of negative self-talk and 
negative emotions that can follow. For example, when confident 
individuals fail, they are more likely to attribute it to a lack of 
effort—something they can control and fix the next time—rather 
than a shortcoming in their ability. Even if criticized, confident 
individuals have a better ability to brush off those comments 
and not take them to heart, whereas those lacking confidence 
can internalize these beliefs and damage their sense of self.

 For these reasons, confidence is a significant factor in performance 
excellence. So, we better know how to build it. Albert Bandura 
identified four sources of self-efficacy: mastery experiences, or 
past accomplishments; vicarious experiences, or modeling; verbal 
persuasion; and physiological and affective states. 
››
The most powerful of these are the mastery experiences, a 
person’s perception about what he or she has accomplished in 
the past. Nothing is more powerful than the actual experience 
of success to boost self-efficacy. There’s something about the 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
85
objective and experiential feeling of doing it right. So, we 
want to maximize these mastery experiences in all settings 
to increase confidence. We do that by creating task-involving 
climates where the focus is on personal improvement, 
comparison to where you were before, and how you are 
getting better from there. 
››
Vicarious experiences, or modeling, can be a good source of 
information to increase efficacy. Also called social modeling, 
when we see someone else succeed, especially when that 
person is similar to you in age, gender, or experience, then 
your confidence increases through their success. Cognitive 
self-modeling, or mental imagery, is another way to increase 
confidence. 
››
Verbal persuasion is when someone else has confidence in 
us and expresses that. This helps, especially if that person is 
knowledgeable or someone we trust. For such communications 
to be effective, they have to be within realistic bounds. 
Verbal persuasion after mistakes can build confidence, if the 
communication is teaching and encouraging improvement of 
the things that can go better.
››
The way we interpret our physiological condition and 
emotional states influences our self-efficacy. When our bodies 
and minds feel good, our confidence is elevated. And when 
we feel pain, fatigue, or nervousness or lack motivation, our 
self-efficacy tends to diminish. Athletes should learn relaxation 
strategies and practice under anxious conditions to improve 
their confidence about how well they can perform when their 
arousal is increased. 

 In a sport context and beyond Bandura’s four sources, four 
additional factors will help: If athletes feel good about 
their physical selves, believe in their coaches’ abilities, feel 
comfortable in their competitive environment, and think the 
competitive situation is in their favor, then they should have 
higher confidence in their ability to achieve success. 

 Efficacy beliefs affect performance, and performance affects 
efficacy beliefs. We call these hot streaks, or momentum, when 

Lecture 10  |  Confidence and Self-Talk  
86
there is an upward spiral of confidence leading to improved 
performance, fueling more confidence and even greater 
performance. 

 Athletes sometimes get into a downward spiral, or slump, when 
after a mistake their confidence is shaken, leading to more 
mistakes and worsening of confidence and then even more 
performance declines. Either of these spirals can be broken 
intentionally or by accident. 

 Changing perspective can help boost confidence. Helping 
athletes attribute their difficulty to effort, which they can 
control, rather than lack of talent, which they can’t control, can 
empower them. Sometimes athletes get distracted by their low 
confidence in winning the game. Moving attention to skills they 
have mastered that will help them win is a good shift to make. 

 Efficacy beliefs go beyond the self, as tasks can vary and we 
perform in a context with others. So, we can have efficacy beliefs 
regarding just about every aspect of our performance, and they 
can influence our performance in that area.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
87

 To change your behavior, the degree to which you believe you 
can control your behaviors will influence how much you can 
resist urges and follow through on intentional behavior choices. 
This is called self-regulatory efficacy. 
Self-Talk

 Self-talk is verbalizations or statements made to the self, typically 
serving one of two functions: instructional or motivational. They 
can also be automatic, meaning by accident, or deliberate and 
intentional. They can be positive or negative in content, and 
they can have facilitative or debilitative effects. 

 Most frequently, athletes will use positive statements to psych 
themselves up and improve confidence. Sometimes, focusing 
on rational self-statements can keep negativity from setting in. 
Worry is the most common type of negative self-talk in athletes, 
causing the most interference with performance. 

 Our self-talk can be reactive to the process or quality of our play 
and the environment. One example is how negative coaching 
behaviors increase negative self-talk in athletes. But when an 
automatic negative thought pops up, you are responsible for 
how long you engage it. 

 Different self-talk cues are needed across performance settings 
and skill levels. But in general, more instructional content 
is suggested because of the action orientation and focus it 
generates. This is particularly true for fine motor tasks and 
newer skills. 

 Motivational self-talk is less effective but can add value, 
particularly on grosser motor tasks and well-learned skills. But 
be careful: Having an athlete talk through the steps of a well-
learned skill, such as a golf swing, can slow processing and 
interfere with execution. “Down and through” may be a whole 

Lecture 10  |  Confidence and Self-Talk  
88

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
89
swing thought that is more helpful—instructional but not too 
detailed. 

 A meta-analysis of the existing self-talk literature found a 
moderate positive effect size on all performance. Self-talk is 
relatively more effective for novel tasks compared to well-
learned tasks and for tasks that required precision, coordination, 
or fine execution compared to strength and endurance. 
Furthermore, self-talk was more effective when the performer 
had formal training in self-talk compared to those without.

 In a number of studies, the effectiveness of self-talk has not been 
supported. Self-talk has a role as part of performance, but only 
as a part of the process, and arguably not the most important 
part. Thinking doesn’t do anything unless you follow it up with 
action. 

 And that’s really the mechanism by which self-talk may work, 
by activating one of these things: improve effort, increase 
attentional focus, or control cognitive or emotional reactions, 
or if it helps trigger automatic execution of your skills, then it 
can have a positive effect on performance. This is true even of 
negative self-talk. 

 Athletes cite concentration and confidence as the most helpful 
result of self-talk. This is particularly true for novel tasks or 
in young and beginner athletes, where attention to detail is 
particularly needed to learn and execute.

 Some practical strategies for self-talk include the following:
››
Much of our negative thinking occurs when we are nervous. So, 
self-instructing how to breathe easy and relax can lower that 
arousal. Statements that normalize these excited sensations 
can also help, as the body is just preparing for action.
››
Surround yourself with positive people, particularly positive 
coaches who are reinforcing, give constructive feedback 
specific to performance, and provide social support, especially 
with regard to self-esteem. At the very least, avoid coaches 

Lecture 10  |  Confidence and Self-Talk  
90
who use negative or abusive statements and actions and 
irrational criticism.
››
Knowing what you want to think about or say to yourself ahead 
of time can provide a buffer against unwanted thoughts, so be 
sure to plan for this.
››
Self-talk has to match the needs of the athlete and task 
characteristics. 
››
Athletes should include self-talk into all their training routines, 
imagery, and pre-performance routines by first identifying 
what they want to achieve with the self-talk intervention. A list 
of possible cue words and short phrases could be developed 
and tested in practice for effectiveness. 
››
Don’t go crazy with too much self-talk. Especially for well-learned 
and automatic skills, the goal is to perform automatically with 
trust. Taking yourself through it and overanalyzing can disrupt 
execution and hurt performance with well-learned skills, during 
automated stages of performance, or if inappropriately applied 
with high-level athletes.

Questions to Consider
1.	 It is good to get distance from thoughts and feelings 
because they are not essential to performance. Why, then, is 
it important to develop confidence and self-talk skills?
2.	 What is the role of belief in confidence and self-talk?

LECTURE 11
Developing Focused 
Attention
T
here might not be a more important psychological 
skill for performers than focused attention. In 
some sports, a loss of focus can be devastating 
to performance, risking injury or contributing to the 
loss of skills. Problems arise when performers’ attention 
shifts—usually from what they are doing to what they 
are thinking or feeling. If your attention isn’t on what you 
are doing, then none of the other skills matter. Focus 
can be developed, and it is to our greatest advantage 
to develop it. 

Lecture 11  |  Developing Focused Attention  
92
Attention

 When we talk about attention, we could mean one of six things: 
biological arousal or alertness, a state of readiness to respond 
to the environment; the orienting response, which is automatic, 
where attention is reflexively directed to an unexpected 
stimulus; the visual search, where we shift our attention toward 
a specific region of a visual space; selective attention, which is 
the ability to tune into a specific source of information while 
ignoring other information; mental resources, or the mental 
effort that fuels cognitive activity; and the overall supervisory 
process that regulates our intentional attention. 

 Researchers have boiled it down further to three aspects 
or dimensions of attention: concentration, which refers to a 
person’s intentional decision to invest mental effort on what is 
most important at the time; selective attention, or the ability to 
zoom in on task-relevant information while ignoring distractions; 
and divided attention, which concerns the fact that performers 
often have to do more than one thing at a time. 

 Performers direct their attention across two dimensions. The first 
is from broad to narrow, meaning that the performer is examining 
a large number of cues (broad) to a limited number, or ultimately 
one (narrow). The second dimension considers attention outside 
the body, or external, to internal, or inside the body.
››
With a narrow-internal focus, the performer is concentrating 
on a specific internal sensation or mental process, such as 
imagery. 
››
A broad-external focus is needed when an athlete has to asses 
a situation quickly and see what options are available before 
deciding on the best course of action. A broad-external focus 
can seem distracted if attention is needed in one of the other 
three quadrants, tuning in to too many things or unnecessary 
details. 
››
The third quadrant, narrow-external, is important to minimize 
those distractions and to focus energy in a specific direction 
to execute skills and maximize effort often in relation to 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
93
something in the playing field. When athletes are performing 
their best, they tend to stay external and flow across the 
broad-to-narrow continuum as needed. Problems arise when 
they get distracted by internal experiences. 
››
A broad-internal focus is best when the performer needs to 
analyze and plan. Past information is recalled and compared 
to present conditions to pick the best course of action. 

 To do their best, performers need two things in their concentration: 
the correct, specific target and focusing only on the actions that 
are under their control. This doesn’t mean, for example, that 
factors such as field conditions or wind should be ignored. But 
they should be considered only at the right time and place, when 
planning is appropriate. Once it comes time to perform and you 
decide on an action you want to commit to—already taking all 
of those factors into account—then the ideal focus when you are 
performing is on a specific, controllable target.

 But distractions happen. Athletes who casually say, “Oh, I 
just lost focus; I’ll do better next time” put themselves at a 
disadvantage. You didn’t forget to focus. You haven’t developed 
the skill. And you can improve it. 

Lecture 11  |  Developing Focused Attention  
94

 So, hold yourself accountable. You may never be perfect. 
Sometimes the best we can do is catch it as early as humanly 
possible and refocus back onto the appropriate target—one 
that is important to the task at hand, under our control, and in 
the present moment. 

 Do we control our attention? We greatly influence attention 
and we can become very good about where we direct it, but 
ultimately it is not 100 percent under our control. 

 Daniel Wegner’s ironic process theory helps explain why 
attentional lapses happen at the worst time. Attention wanders 
because we try to control it—hence the irony. There is a 
conscious, controlled search for the ideal focus thoughts. But at 
the same time, there is a simultaneous second process going on 
that is automatic and unconscious that searches for any sign of 
the unwanted thought to be sure the mind is being successful. 
Checking to be sure it isn’t there makes it be there.

 The thoughts we try to suppress come to mind more easily 
than the thought we want to focus on—a phenomenon called 
hyperaccessibility—and it is especially likely to occur under 
conditions of mental load because conscious, intentional 
focusing takes a lot of mental energy. This is real energy, and 
when we are tired or the pressure is too great and we are anxious, 
we don’t have as much strength to control our thoughts. Our 
mind is taxed, and then it wanders to wherever. 
Five Principles of Effective Concentration

 There are five principles of effective concentration to teach so 
that skilled performance is maximized. 
1.	 The first is simple but critical: You have to decide to 
concentrate. It will not just happen by chance or automatically 
be there when you need it. Because it takes energy, it can be 
helpful to turn it on and off with a performance routine.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
95
2.	 The second principle is to focus on only one thought at a 
time. When we multitask, we either shift rapidly between 
doing things one at a time in succession, or one or more of 
the simultaneous actions have been practiced so much that 
they have become automatic and don’t require conscious 
control. We don’t want to be thinking and talking to ourselves 
as we perform. That can slow or disrupt a complicated task. 
Focusing Exercises
Focusing exercises help performers limit their attention to what is 
most important.
What’s My Job? 
Before going into a game, athletes should identify two or three 
behaviors that are under their control to emphasize. Of course, 
there are a ton of things to do, but with all the things to do—and 
coaches coaching and parents coaching from the sideline—in a 
pressure game, it can become overwhelming. When an athlete 
knows what his or her job is—two or three specific behaviors to 
focus on and come back to—it helps ground him or her in the 
chaos. He or she can then play with purpose and determination. 
What’s Important Now? (WIN) 
Do you want to WIN? That stands for “what’s important now?” 
With this technique, whenever you are confused or overwhelmed 
or stuck on a mistake or nervous about the future, just ask 
yourself, “What’s important now?” and it brings you back to the 
present moment and some action thought that will best help your 
performance. At any given moment of any performance, there will 
be some specific thing that is most important for you to be doing 
or focusing on.
3.	 The third principle for good concentration is to do exactly what 
you are thinking or think specifically about what you want to do. 
You are truly focused and will have your best performance when 
there is no difference between what you are thinking and what 
you are doing. Keep your head and body in the same place. 

Lecture 11  |  Developing Focused Attention  
96
This comes from research on flow states and being in the zone. 
Keep thoughts positively phrased regarding what you will do, 
not what you don’t want to do.
4.	 The fourth principle is to focus only on factors that are under 
your control—because if you can’t control them, why invest 
your limited amount of attention into them? You can’t control 
uncontrollable distractions, and they matter, but the time to 
consider them is usually before the game or during breaks in 
the action to plan, choose equipment, and strategize. When 
you are actually performing, those factors should have already 
been addressed, allowing you to focus on what you can and 
do control. 
5.	 The fifth principle goes back to the internal/external dimension 
of attention: When you get nervous, focus outward. We are 
naturally drawn in, out of our performance, and get consumed 
or distracted by what we feel. When we get stuck inside, we 
doubt, worry, criticize, become hypervigilant of what we fear—
and mess up. So, get out, back into the game.
How to Develop Your Focus Skills

 For these techniques to work best, you need the mental 
strength to be able to do them. The top recommendation for 
this is mindfulness training. The purpose of training is to adopt 
a nonjudgmental relationship to distractions while immersing 
yourself in a chosen target of attention. This acceptance but 
detachment from distractions avoids suppression and the 
hyperaccessibility trap. 

 And it is closely related to that flow state, with its grounding in 
the present moment. Study after study has shown that various 
mindfulness and mindfulness-based programs increase flow 
and performance as part of this attentional training.

 Another way to build focus is simulation training, or practicing 
under conditions that replicate key aspects of an upcoming 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
97

Lecture 11  |  Developing Focused Attention  
98
challenge. This means getting used to keeping the distraction in 
the background. Simulation training can help prevent choking. 

 Similarly, pre-event and pre-performance routines can help focus 
attention. These are specific and structured actions a performer 
takes before a performance to prepare mentally, physically, and 
emotionally. Routines usually have a focus component to guide 
attention to task-relevant cues and get into the moment. 

 Another technique is to use trigger words as cues to concentrate. 
Skilled performers often talk to themselves for motivational and 
instructional purposes. 

 All performers have outcome goals. But these desired outcomes 
can become a distraction. So, setting performance goals—
process goals that lie within your control, telling you what to 
do—improves performance by directing your attention to the 
how of performance.

difficult?

LECTURE 12
Superstitions, Rituals, 
and Routines
T
his lecture is about routines, rituals, and 
superstitions. Superstitions may reduce anxiety 
but can also be a distraction. Still, as a sport 
psychologist, it can be disruptive to force an athlete to 
give them up, especially when superstition is part of the 
team or sport culture. Rituals are a bit better, but they 
are not specific enough. Ultimately, performers want 
structured routines that directly improve performance. 
They will include physical and emotional components 
as well as skills such as confidence, focus, and imagery. 

Lecture 12  |  Superstitions, Rituals, and Routines  
100
Routines

 Good routines are designed to prepare an athlete for his or 
her best performance, mentally, physically, and emotionally. 
Routines put specific performance-improving behaviors into a 
logical and sequential order for maximal results. Routines can 
occur before the performance, during the performance, and 
after the performance. Any time a consistent application of 
behaviors can prepare or guide a performer to be his or her 
best, a routine can be used.

 A pre-performance routine is designed to prepare the athlete 
for action. This could be before a specific motor skill, such as a 
basketball free throw, tennis serve, or golf putt. But it could also 
be before a game, the morning of a competition or the night 
before. 

 Warm-up routines can be very helpful. The timing of warm-up 
behaviors enables the athlete to be well prepared in advance 
and avoid the stress of being late or feeling rushed. In a 
routine, each behavior is specific, directly contributes to peak 
performance, and will be repeated at every competition.

 During-performance routines are systematic ways to respond 
within the sport performance. One is Dan Kirschenbaum’s 4-F 
technique. After a mistake, the following series is recommended:
››
Fudge, a brief, internal negative reaction;
››
Fix—the most important part—correcting the problem by 
immediately executing the correct play, or at least with some 
physical movement and corrective imagery;
››
Forget about it; and
››
Focus on what’s important now.

 A good between-performance routine that works well in 
sports that have a series of short performances—like American 
football, diving, and wrestling—is Jim Taylor's 4-R technique:
››
Rest: Take a few slow, deep breaths once the performance is 
over to relax, recover, and center.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
101
››
Regroup: Check in with your emotions and work through any 
frustration or anxiety, or calm down if overly excited after a big 
play.
››
Refocus on the task at hand, in this moment. Get yourself out 
of the past mistake or thoughts about the future. Zero in on 
what you need to do next. This may be technical, tactical, or 
mental. 
››
Recharge: Bring your intensity up or down, depending on your 
sport demands and current level of energy.

 Post-performance routines are excellent for promoting 
recovery, such as warm-downs or nutritional supplements, or 
as a systematic way to review the performance, including film 
review or feedback sessions with coaches. Post-performance 
routines don’t leave these things to chance; they are planned 
and executed, all in service of improving performance. 

Lecture 12  |  Superstitions, Rituals, and Routines  
102

 There are a few things that all performance plans should have. 
One is a physical component. These are the things that are done 
to prepare the body, such as a deep breath for relaxation. 

 Routines should also address psychological preparation, such as 
self-talk strategies with cue words. Other components may be a 
combination of focus and tactical preparation, such as a football 
player before the snap checking off his assignment, adjusting 
his alignment, and emotionally adjusting his attitude, psyching 
up or down as necessary. 

 The best way to maximize your physical functioning is to be 
mentally prepared. In this way, routines are like mental scanners, 
a formal way to assess the competitive environment and make 
adjustments to give the athlete the best chance of success. It 
keeps the performer aware of the environmental conditions, the 
tendencies of their opponents, or their status regarding fatigue 
or aggressiveness. 

 Routines help you check in with any number of internal issues, 
such as negative thoughts, anxiety, focus, and intensity. The 
best routines will have you end with a task-oriented mindset. 

 Some routines are very specific while others are more general. 
Micro routines are typically done as a self-paced event, such 
as pitching a baseball. They can be very specific and precise, 
depending on the needs and preferences of the performer. But 
macro routines, which may cover an entire day or event, may be 
defined a bit more generally and with some flexibility to adapt 
to the changing environment. 

 You want to strike a balance between specific and general 
routines. Be sure not to skip a cool-down completely after a 
game, and include a minimum of a few stretches that have to 
be done beforehand to be prepared. But vary them to prevent 
boredom and to rotate throughout the body. You don’t want 
your routines to be overly specific in case you cannot complete 
them. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
103

 The most effective performance routines are usually mastered 
with a high degree of consistency. But pay attention to the time. 
While they can be self-paced, there are limits. For example, 
American football requires the ball to be snapped 25 seconds 
after declared ready to play. A routine that fits the demands and 
pacing of the game is essential and another reason why you will 
want every aspect of your routine to count. 

 In many routines, not all the movements have a direct effect on 
performance. Some may just help an athlete calm down or focus 
because what he or she is doing is familiar. There is a comfort in 
repetitive movements, and it can help a game-winning shot feel 
like any other free throw, just one of a thousand shots previously 
taken. But sometimes athletes include extra unnecessary 
movements, which serve as a potential distraction. 
Superstitions Rituals

 Sometimes, 
routines 
are 
actually 
superstitions 
rituals. 
Superstitions are big in sports, with both fans and athletes 
alike. For example, you might wear a particular jersey when your 
favorite football team plays. You might know that your jersey 
doesn’t make a difference in the outcome of the game, but you 

Lecture 12  |  Superstitions, Rituals, and Routines  
104
might feel like it does. And that’s how superstitions work. They 
help decrease anxiety. 

 You might not be affecting the outcome of the game, but you 
are treating your nervousness. It is an illusion of control that 
you are happy to believe in. You keep doing the superstitious 
behavior because it keeps helping your anxiety, even though the 
results aren’t there to support its effectiveness: Your team isn’t 
going to win every time you wear your jersey.

 Athletes use superstitions in a similar way. In one Belgium study, 
more than 75 percent of the participating athletes reported one 
or more superstitious rituals. The more tension the athlete felt, 
the more superstitious he or she was. 

 Players are more committed to their rituals when they were more 
uncertain about winning or in bigger, more important situations, 
such as playoff games. Superstitions are more prevalent the 
higher the achievement level and number of years played. The 
stakes are higher, so athletes look for more 
control over the situation to win. They want 
to do everything they can to help the team. 

 Superstitions help anxiety, but there are 
so many more direct ways to work with 
anxiety and enhance focus. Still, 
athletes try to achieve control by 
investing in irrelevant objects 
or actions, believing there is 
a causal link between these 
things and results. 

 The biggest difference 
between a superstitious 
ritual 
and 
a 
pre-
performance routine is 
that routines are always 
under our control and 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
105
directly improve your performance. But we can’t say that 
superstitious rituals don’t help—that there isn’t a psychological 
placebo effect. If superstitions decrease anxiety and increase 
confidence, some authors argue that they aren’t superstitions. 

 But the fact remains that despite their positive outcome, they 
still aren’t the best or most direct way to prepare. Rituals 
that are designed to help increase anxiety when they can’t 
be performed and become a problem in and of themselves 
independent of the game. 

 A part of some rituals that some may think is superstition but 
others may argue are not are pre-game prayers. Routines can be 
defined as a series of pre-performance behaviors organized into 
a detailed plan aimed at maximizing performance. Performance 
routines are a specific and beneficial kind of ritual. Superstitions 
are actions that are repetitive, formal, sequential, and distinct 
from technical performance. 

 Religious ritual and superstition have many similarities. Both 
are continually repeated, and athletes believe that both will 
enhance performance. And both attempt to use the influence of 
an outside force to their advantage, whether that be God or luck 
or something undefined. 

 But the differences between the two are significant. 
Superstitions come out of a need to control or influence the 
uncontrollable, particularly when uncertainty about the outcome 
is high. Superstitions reduce anxiety and serve as a scapegoat 
when things don’t go well. The athlete can blame the failed 
superstition rather than take responsibility for his or her own 
effort, focus, or performance. 

 But prayer can include intentions far beyond that of sport 
superstitions, such as dedicating the sport activity to God, 
bringing God into the activity, or requesting assistance to live 
a moral life in and out of sport, to put sport into perspective, or 
to increase the bond between teammates and bless them and 

Lecture 12  |  Superstitions, Rituals, and Routines  
106
keep them safe—a very other-focused intention in contrast to 
more self-oriented superstitions. 

 In addition, athletes can feel controlled by their superstitions, a 
sense that they have to do them or else their anxiety increases 
about something bad happening. Religious rituals, on the other 
hand, reflect a more personal relationship with God and are 
often done with the intention of trusting God. 

 Although a team prayer ritual could become superstitious if 
an athlete develops some magical thinking about the prayer 
activity and outcome, ideally prayer or other religious rituals 
promote greater holistic well-being for the athlete and the team 
in a way superstitions cannot. In this way, it can sometimes be a 
part of an athlete’s pre-performance routine, such as a gratitude 
prayer before competition, as the effects of such religious rituals 
can positively affect physiological arousal, calming the physical 
effects of anxiety. 

 For these reasons, religious rituals are not considered 
superstitions. In fact, research in the field of the psychology 
of religion confirms that definitions of superstition that do not 
mention religion are actually more accurate than those that do.

107
Do Routines Improve Performance?

 Routines do improve performance. Studies have shown that 
athletes who use a pre-performance routine perform better 
than those who do not. 

 Getting into the right intensity is important, so a routine to 
get physically prepared is important. But this may be the least 
significant benefit.

 Performance failures typically aren’t because the body isn’t 
ready. Most breakdowns occur in the mind—when focus is off, 
when there is poor planning, when you are rushing through, or 
when you make bad decisions. So, your best routines will include 
getting the body, mind, and heart ready. 

 Routines increase a sense of control and guide your focus. They 
help performers establish the best plan of action throughout a 
performance. And routines reduce stress. They are familiar, and 
you know what to do and feel prepared.

Peak Performance: 
Getting in the Zone
H
ave you been in the zone? It’s that place where 
you are just playing, doing your thing, one 
with the sport or experience. You are trusting, 
moving, and flowing moment to moment, completely 
immersed in what you are doing. Best or optimal 
performances involve four things: peak experiences and 
peak performances, which are moments in time; flow, 
which is a state of high performance that we want to be 
in more consistently; and mental toughness, which is a 
collection of mental and emotional attributes that can 
be developed. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
109
Peak Experiences and Peak Performances

 Peak experiences are personal high points of life—one of the 
most exciting, rich, and fulfilling experiences a person has ever 
had. It is a psychological experience that exceeds the usual level 
of intensity and meaning. Note that this doesn’t necessarily 
mean an outstanding technical performance. It’s emotional and 
personal. 

 It is an exemplary moment in time, with a lasting positive effect on 
the lives of those who experience such a moment, even for fans. 
Do you remember a specific catch, dramatic win, or outstanding 
play from your favorite player or team? For performers and 
athletes, this highlights a career. Not surprisingly, having these 
experiences, and wanting more of them, serves as a motivator 
for sport and other performance-based activities. 

 Peak performances, on the other hand, are defined more 
physically. They are less emotionally centered than peak 
experiences and more dependent on what the performer 
actually does. These behaviors exceed an individual’s usual or 
even probable performance quality. It is truly the performance 
of a lifetime, one that stands out and defines the climax of a 
performer’s career. 

 Peak performances are not always relative to others, such as 
setting a world record or winning Olympic gold. They can be 
personal. Your best golf round or fastest 5K race would count, no 
matter where you placed. It is a personal experience determined 
by the performer alone. 
Flow

 Peak performances and peak experiences are most likely to 
occur when you are in a flow state and have mental toughness. 
Flow is characterized as an autotelic experience, meaning that it 
is enjoyable and intrinsically rewarding in its own right. 

Lecture 13  |  Peak Performance: Getting in the Zone  
110

 Flow—or being in the zone—is the ideal psychological state 
achieved during an activity when a balance occurs between 
the perceived challenge of the activity and the sense that 
one has the ability and skills to meet this challenge. There is 
a total immersion in the activity accompanied by feelings of 
enjoyment. 

 Flow has been described as intensely rewarding, internally 
motivated, and an above-average experience, although it is not 
uncommon. In fact, it can occur frequently at work and in well-
trained athletes. Skill level is significantly related to flow, as it’s 
been suggested that those with higher ability will have higher 
levels of flow.

 There are eight major components of flow—nine if you include 
the autotelic experience as a separate component, which the 
studies of sport typically do. 
1.	 The challenge-skills balance is the foundation of all flow 
states. If a task is too easy, you lack intensity and may be 
bored. If a task is too difficult, then stress and anxiety can 
interfere with the positive mood states associated with flow. 
A challenging task that the performer has the necessary 
skills to complete is essential to produce the intense-focus 
characteristic of flow. And it’s only in this context that a flow 
state can be achieved. To get into a flow state, choose your 
activities wisely, setting challenging but realistic goals.
2.	 Merging of action and awareness is responsible for bringing 
about a sense of complete absorption, involvement, and focus 
on the task at hand. When action and awareness are combined, 
performance feels automatic, smooth, natural, uninterrupted, 
and peaceful. You can get lost in the task when you aren’t 
thinking about what you are doing. There isn’t an awareness of 
cognitive effort. Because of this, it’s fun and enjoyable. 
3.	 This merging is the result of total concentration and focus, 
or complete concentration on what you’re doing. If you 
want to develop your ability to engage flow, this is where 
your practice needs to be. Mindfulness training is excellent 
for developing total concentration and focus, but so is daily 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
111
effort to pay attention to the details in life. Practice your 
performance skills, too. 
4.	 When motor behaviors become so automatic that they 
are unconscious, intense concentration and focus on the 
enjoyable and holistic aspects of the task allow all other 
worries and apprehension to fade from consciousness. This is 
loss of self-consciousness. 
5.	 Loss of self-consciousness is often associated with the 
transformation of time. You can be so immersed in what you 
are doing that you’re not even aware of the passage of time. 
6.	 All of this leads to the autotelic experience, an experience 
that has a purpose in, and not apart from, itself—completely 
internally driven, not motivated by factors outside of the athlete 
or activity. The performance itself is rewarding and enjoyable.
7.	 Clear goals serve as intrinsic motivation, something you want 
for internal or personal reasons. 
8.	 Feedback provides you with information regarding your 
progress toward those goals. Positive and negative feedback 
are expected to influence flow in either direction. 

Lecture 13  |  Peak Performance: Getting in the Zone  
112
9.	 Sense of control is tricky. We’re never in full control of sport. 
We don’t control our opponent or winning, so this sense of 
control is more about influence—that if you do all the things 
you do have control over, then you will get the result you want. 
There is a sense of empowerment and a belief that you can 
and will work your way through any adversity that arises. 

 There are differences in the way the nine qualities of flow are 
experienced. Not all nine dimensions are present in every 
flow state. In two studies with elite athletes, researchers found 
that all athletes experienced at least three dimensions and 
93 percent experienced five or more. Five or six of the nine 
appeared to be the average.

 In studies of elite athletes, 12 factors were found to facilitate 
flow, 10 prevented flow from even starting, and 11 disrupted 
flow after it began. Ten of these factors did all three things, so 
there is considerable overlap. 

 Both the absence of negative influences during the performance 
and previous personal experience with flow uniquely facilitated 
flow. Losing rhythm uniquely disrupted flow. But these 10 factors 
were found to facilitate, prevent, or disrupt flow, depending on 
the context and circumstances.

››
Focus helps when appropriate but prevents or disrupts when 
inappropriate. 
››
Preparation when done well facilitates but prevents and 
disrupts when not done well or completely. 
››
Motivation, arousal, thoughts and emotions, confidence, and 
environment and situational conditions all facilitate flow when 
ideal but prevent and disrupt when not ideal. 
››
Positive feedback facilitates flow. Negative feedback prevents 
and disrupts it. 
››
Performance defined as starting well facilitates flow. Poor 
performance prevents it. Mistakes disrupt flow. 
››
Positive team play and interactions enhance flow, negative 
play and interactions prevent it, and problems with the team 
will disrupt it. 
Mental Toughness

 In addition to flow, mental toughness plays an important role 
in peak performances and peak experiences. There are many 
definitions of mental toughness, but this one has done well 
to illustrate a few critical points without getting overwhelmed 
by too much nuanced detail: Mental toughness is the natural, 
or developed, psychological edge that enables you to be 
better and more consistent than your opponent in remaining 
determined, focused, confident, and in control under pressure.

 This definition acknowledges that some people are naturally 
gifted with mental toughness. And while some people are, the 
rest of us can also develop it. Even if you have it, you can always 
improve it. And it does, in fact, give you an edge. 

 The most talented player doesn’t always win. Neither does the 
most mentally tough one. But when the talent margin closes, 
what distinguishes athletes is their mental toughness. It is what 
enables you to be both better and more consistent. 

Lecture 13  |  Peak Performance: Getting in the Zone  
114

 Consistency is key. Nobody keeps focus through an entire game, 
performance, or meeting. But the athlete who can be more 
consistent in bringing his or her attention back to the moment of 
performance has the edge over his or her opponent. The same 
is true for confidence and determination. 

 Being in control under pressure means being in control over your 
reactions to your thoughts and feelings, playing with intention, 
and being a values-driven athlete rather than an emotionally 
driven one. 

 Current research supports a view of mental toughness as a 
multidimensional personality construct that includes a number 
of psychological attributes across sports. According to a meta-
analysis of the research literature on the subject by Dr. Robert 
Harmison, that list includes being confident; summoning 
motivation and desire; effectively dealing with adversity and 
failure; overcoming physical and emotional pain and hardship; 
successfully managing anxiety, pressure, and other emotions; 
staying focused; and finding balance and keeping perspective. 
Psychological Characteristics of the Optimal 
Performance State

 The psychological characteristics of the optimal performance 
state include feelings of high self-confidence, expectations of 
success, being energized yet relaxed, feeling in control, being 
totally concentrated, having a keen focus on the present task, 
having positive attitudes and thoughts about performance, and 
being strongly determined and committed. 

 To help athletes identify their personal best performance 
state, have them describe what they thought, what they felt 
in their bodies, and how they felt emotionally during peak 
performances—to specifically identify those thoughts, focus 
points, cue words, and sensations. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
115

 In addition, ask them to describe the social context, such as a 
supportive coach or time alone to focus, that also contributes. 
And then ask them to compare this best performance state to 
their worst performances in the same way: what they thought, 
what they felt in their bodies, and how they felt emotionally. It 
helps to paint very different pictures—to identify their ideal 
target zones and be aware of when they are out of them. 

 The characteristics that seem to correlate with worse 
performances in sport include self-doubt, lacking concentration 
on the task and moment, and being distracted by something 
specifically. Being overly focused on the competition outcome 
or score is a big one, as well as feeling over- or under-aroused. 
You need your intensity to match the job. 

 Not everyone is the same. Some qualities are important to one 
athlete while different levels of that same quality are important 

Lecture 13  |  Peak Performance: Getting in the Zone  
116
to another. The individual zones of optimal functioning (IZOF) 
model suggests that each performer experiences a unique 
range of pleasant and unpleasant psychobiological states that 
either facilitate or inhibit performance. Each emotion serves two 
primary purposes: mobilizing and organizing energy. 

 Will this mobilization and organization help or hinder the performer 
in generating energy and efficiently using it to accomplish his or 
her performance actions? Being in and out of an individual zone of 
optimal functioning has been tested in sport, and results show that 
idiosyncratic positive and negative emotions—that is, positive and 
negative emotions unique to an individual athlete—do appear to 
be related to performance levels. 

 There is some evidence to support IZOF-based principles to 
guide emotional regulation in sport. Psychological skills such 
as relaxation, focusing, or self-talk could help an athlete achieve 
his or her personally optimal emotional states and improve 
objective performance. Inappropriately used, it could knock him 
or her out of the zone and hurt performance.

LECTURE 14
Performance Anxiety 
and Choking
T
his lecture is about performance anxiety and 
choking, which are common problems that 
interfere with performance. As you will discover, 
you’re nervous because you care. Your body is simply 
preparing for action. You must redirect your attention 
to what is essential, and if you want to get better at 
performing under pressure, practice performing under 
pressure.

Lecture 14  |  Performance Anxiety and Choking  
118
Performance Anxiety

 Performance anxiety is normal. It doesn’t matter how crazy or 
excessive the anxiety is. It comes from a normal place, and it’s 
more likely due to how much you care rather than something 
actually being wrong or threatening.

 If you want something and don’t get it, or care about 
something and it goes wrong, we have at least emotional 
pain—embarrassment, 
loss, 
sadness. 
Sometimes 
there 
are financial consequences or missed opportunities and 
experiences. Sometimes there are pain and injury. Bad things 
can happen.

 And while there is always a positive side of what we could 
accomplish or experience, there is always a dark and scary 
side of what will happen if we don’t. Our mind won’t let us be 
unrealistically positive and just forget about these possibilities. 
In fact, the more we try to ignore them, the more our mind may 
draw attention to them. We should think about anxiety as just 
a friendly warning of what could happen, not what will happen. 

 As normal as anxiety is, it can be deadly to performance. The 
most critical skill in sport psychology may be the ability to focus 
on the right thing at the right time. Anxiety messes that up. You 
think about the wrong things—what could go wrong, who’s going 
to be upset, that last-mistake you made, the feelings of fear and 
pressure—and you think about them at the wrong time—when 
you are trying to putt or make a free-throw or when you should 
be looking for the pass. And your performance blows up.

 And that’s just the mental part. Anxiety includes heightened 
physiological arousal, too. Your body is preparing for action. 
The fight-or-flight response kicks in to protect you from 
danger to fight the threat or run away from it. This can help in 
sport, too, as you go into battle with an enemy both intensely 
competing for the same thing. Sometimes, you need that 
heightened arousal. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
119

 All the nasty and uncomfortable physical sensations of anxiety 
are at least neutral, meaning normal and safe, and are intended 
to give you more energy and activation. For example, that racing 
and pounding heart you don’t like is more quickly delivering 
oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from your bloodstream. 
Your blood and muscles need that oxygen to perform. 

 The physical sensations of anxiety are supposed to be helpful. 
And maybe when driving to the basket it is, but then you get 
fouled and have to calm down quickly to make a free throw. 

Lecture 14  |  Performance Anxiety and Choking  
120
If you are an archer or a surgeon, this physical arousal does 
not help. In fact, it will hurt your fine motor skills. Maybe your 
physical arousal is completely irrelevant to performance, such as 
your nerves before a test or giving a speech. You don’t need 
a lot of physical intensity to perform these mental tasks or 
challenges. And if your attention is drawn to these sensations, 
choking becomes a very real risk.
Choking

 Choking is generally thought of as not performing under 
pressure. Missing the putt or field goal or basket to win the game 
may be choking, but it isn’t always. Choking more specifically 
means that you don’t execute a sport skill under pressure that 
you would very likely be able to execute in practice or under 
normal game conditions. 

 There are two sets of theories about the choking mechanism. 
The first set is called self-focused theories, which propose 
that pressure raises anxiety and self-consciousness about 
performing well. The natural reactions are increased attention to 
doing the skill well and too much attention to the step-by-step 
control over execution, which actually interferes with the natural 
and fluid execution of a previously automatic skill. 

 Intentional, purposeful thinking slows you down, particularly if 
you are trying to go against your natural inclination. This is good 
for deliberate, detailed activity but problematic in sport when it 
disrupts automatic execution of well-learned skills. Other self-
focused theories claim that it is the monitoring of the step-by-
step execution of the skill that disrupts execution. 

 Distraction theories are another set of explanations for choking. 
Worry takes a lot of our energy and brain space. We only have so 
much mental energy, and if a good chunk of it is used for worry, 
performance suffers. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
121

 Both theory sets show us that choking is an attentional issue. 
Sometimes it is too much attention to the task trying to monitor 
and control it; other times it is too little attention to the task. 
Ideally, we want our attention to be just right, focused in the 
moment on the task at hand. 

 What you ideally want is clutch performance, the opposite of 
choking—those moments when under pressure the athlete 
actually performs better than usual. This can happen in a few 
ways. The first has to do with how you think about the pressure: 
positively or negatively.

 If an athlete feels able to handle the anxiety and has a sense of 
control over his or her performance, then the sensations may be 
interpreted as facilitative. But if the performer feels that he or 
she is not in control, can’t cope and expects fears, and focuses 
on failure, then anxiety can be debilitative. 

 The practical application is to remember that thoughts are 
just warnings. Your physical symptoms in anxiety are the same 
as excitement. Your body is preparing to do something great. 
Don’t get distracted by the energy. Interpret it as helpful and 
get back to focusing on the task at hand.

Lecture 14  |  Performance Anxiety and Choking  
122
Attentional Control Theories

 Distraction theories suggest that worry takes up some of the 
attention used for performance. Processing efficiency theory 
extends this to how and why the same mechanism can help 
athletes perform when they redirect that energy into extra effort 
or other tasks that enhance performance. After appropriately 
assessing and worrying that what they are currently doing isn’t 
working, they redirect that energy into another thinking strategy. 

 Attention is critical. From an evolutionary perspective, anxiety 
evolved to quickly organize our cognitive functions for 
protective purposes when necessary. Anxiety has a positive 
functional role. Worrying about danger leads people to take 
fewer risks, seek safety, and focus on doing things well to avoid 
the consequences of poor performance. But in sport and other 
performance areas, sometimes—often times—you have to step 
into that risk and feel whatever comes along with it. 

 For this reason, while relaxation is very frequently advised as a 
treatment for anxiety, and it does work to reduce anxiety, use it 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
123
with caution. If you are in a panic or physically very over-aroused, 
you really do need to calm down. Taking a deep diaphragmatic 
breath or doing a progressive muscle relaxation exercise can help. 

 But if you want relaxation to eliminate your anxiety and feel like 
you have to get rid of it all to perform well, you’re going to be 
challenged. You don’t want physical and attentional energy 
wasted on a struggle to control the anxiety at the cost of 
performing.

 If the brain is going to continually search out danger, then the 
environment you are in is going to seem more threatening. You 
may be emphasizing your awareness of threats to the detriment of 
your being able to focus on what can go well or what you should 
be doing to play well. Our survival instinct hurts our performance. 

 But how much it hurts is in part related to how much voluntary 
control we exercise over our attention. And how much 
attentional control you have is a skill that can be built from 
exercises such as mindfulness. Those with a good amount of 
attentional control will be better able to disengage the mind’s 
warnings and refocus on performance compared to those with 
weak attentional control skills. 

 In processing efficiency theory, anxiety taxes attentional 
resources. We have limited energy, and some of it gets snatched 
up, turning into potential threats. When anxious, the efficiency 
with which we can process and act on information decreases. 
Performance suffers because our attention is divided and slowed. 

 A more recent attentional control theory builds on this with an 
explanation of how our concentration is disrupted when anxious. 
We have two systems. Attentional control theory suggests that 
anxiety causes a disruption in the goal-directed system, which 
is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed thinking, 
attention, and behaviors; and the stimulus-driven system, which 
is much faster and can be very adaptive, quickly orienting us to 
important or dangerous details that need immediate attention.

Lecture 14  |  Performance Anxiety and Choking  
124

 As anxiety increases, the strength of our evaluations of the 
potential threat warnings and the likelihood that the stimuli 
will capture our attention and pull it away from performance 
is greatly increased. How do you inhibit the stimulus-driven 
response and shift back to the goal-directed target? 

 Relaxation training can bring down some of that physiological 
arousal, particularly when it is very high, and mindfulness training 
can be important to develop the skill of letting go, shifting and 
reengaging the present moment.
The Quiet Eye

 Sport and performance most critically involve an interaction 
between what we are seeing and what we are doing. Sight and 
action interact. To perform well in a complex, ever-moving, 
changing environment such as sport, an athlete must select 
the information that is most relevant at any point in time so that 
effective plans for action can be made. 

 This can be done by choosing the best visual target each 
moment. These task-specific eye movements are purposeful 
and goal directed, and the target of sight has been generally 
identified as being close to the spot of action. This fixation 
occurs approximately one second before the action for many 
tasks. 

 In sport science, this particular measure of attentional control 
has been called the quiet eye. It is the final fixation of sight on 
the most appropriate target prior to the execution of the most 
critical phase of movement. 

 Experts have longer quiet-eye durations than nonexperts, 
and successful attempts have longer quiet-eye durations than 
unsuccessful attempts. It is believed that the quiet eye helps 
maintain effective goal-driven attentional control while reducing 
the impact of the stimulus-driven attentional system. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
125

 Anxiety threatens to disrupt the quiet eye, so developing the 
quiet-eye gaze can minimize the impact of anxiety and prevent 
performance decline. Control your eyes and you control your 
focus on what is essential.

 We need to train and develop this quiet eye, but not to reduce 
anxiety. Developing the quiet eye keeps all of your attention on 
the most important performance details at the most important 
time. As a performer, it is critical to identify exactly what these 
visual cues are as well as when and how long they should be 
focused on during the execution of a sport skill. 

 This quiet-eye training helps the motor system be more 
accurate in execution by providing timely visual information 
about targets. The quiet eye also draws attention away from 
the internal experience of anxiety, whether that be negative 
thoughts or physiological symptoms. It promotes motor learning 
and prevents choking by directing attention to critical physical 
actions of performance.

 A classic sport psychology tip is to focus on what you can 
control. The quiet eye does just that. Under pressure, rather 
than worrying about the outcome you cannot control, you can 
control where you direct your attention. 

Lecture 14  |  Performance Anxiety and Choking  
126

 By focusing the mind in this way, it quiets the athlete, not just 
his or her eyes. It is usually negative self-talk and worry that work 
us up and make us anxious under pressure. But we can’t do 
two things at once. If we are focused on the target, we are not 
worrying ourselves into a frenzy. The focus can result in a calm, 
quiet approach.

 Another way to do this is to train with anxiety. Practice isn’t the 
same as games, and it’s difficult to replicate game conditions, 
but it can be done if you get creative. By practicing with anxiety, 
you learn to more efficiently and effectively invest anxious 
energy in a more beneficial, goal-directed direction.

LECTURE 15
Being the Perfect 
Perfectionist
P
erfectionism is characterized by attitudes and 
behaviors that strive for flawlessness. Exceedingly 
high standards for performance are set and 
overly criticized. Perfectionism has typically been seen 
as a bad thing, but more recent research suggests that 
this may not be the case. In this lecture, you will learn 
about current research on perfectionism and how to 
manage perfectionism that has gone wrong.

Lecture 15  |  Being the Perfect Perfectionist  
128
Perfectionistic Strivings and Concerns

 Perfectionism can be broken up into two dimensions: 
perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns. 
››
Perfectionistic strivings are characterized by striving to be 
without error and setting extremely high performance standards. 
These strivings tend to be associated with more positive 
characteristics and outcomes, such as conscientiousness, 
adaptive coping and positive emotion, and overall ratings of 
subjective well-being and good psychological adjustment. 
››
Perfectionistic concerns are characterized by worry over making 
mistakes, fear of negative evaluations by others, and a very 
keen awareness of the difference between one’s expectations 
and one’s actual performance. These perfectionistic concerns 
are consistently and strongly associated with neuroticism, 
maladaptive coping and negative affect, and indicators of 
poor psychological adjustment and mental disorders such as 
depression and anxiety. 

 The idea that perfectionism is generally a bad thing is likely because 
the two dimensions are so highly correlated. If you’re high in 
perfectionistic strivings, you tend to also be high in perfectionistic 
concerns, because being perfect is important to you. 

 But some researchers argue that they are independent factors 
that can be useful to consider when working with athletes. 
Perfectionistic strivings are often associated with improved 
performance while perfectionistic concerns can hurt performance. 
We want to encourage one and guard against the other.

 You can be low to high on perfectionistic strivings. If you are 
on the lower end of the continuum, you would likely be labeled 
a non-perfectionist. You may want to do well and appreciate 
quality, but you probably allow for mistakes and don’t get too 
upset when they happen. 

 Those on the higher end of strivings can be measured along a 
second continuum to better define their experience. Healthy, 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
129
or adaptive, perfectionists are high on strivings but low in 
their perfectionistic concerns. So, while they strive for flawless 
performances, they are able to keep their attention on their 
goals and the process of performance. 

 Unhealthy, or maladaptive, perfectionists, on the other hand, are 
distracted. They strive for perfection but to varying degrees also 
worry about failure and how others will perceive them. On the 
highest end, they can experience crippling doubt, fear of failure 
and rejection, and insecurity and will agonize over mistakes. 
Their attention gets divided, moving away from the process of 
performance and attention to detail to fear of negative future 
outcomes. 

 In sport and the performing arts, the pursuit of impeccable 
execution is approved, encouraged, and even revered because 
achievement at the highest level requires extraordinary dedication 
and near-perfect performances to be successful, sometimes 
even to survive. So, it’s critical for performance consultants and 

Lecture 15  |  Being the Perfect Perfectionist  
130
performers themselves to know how perfectionism both helps 
and hinders.

 The one area that does have a lot of academic research is 
academic performance. And the overwhelming majority shows 
that students with higher levels of perfectionistic strivings show 
higher exam performance, higher individual grades, and a 
higher GPA than students with lower levels of strivings. 

 Surprisingly, the relationship with perfectionistic concerns is less 
clear. It’s not completely negative. In fact, most studies find that as 
concerns increase, grades do not necessarily decrease. Although 
some others did find a small negative correlation, it’s not to the 
degree that would be expected. From a performance-focus 
standpoint, we would expect such worry and concern to interfere 
with concentration and hurt grades. But this might just be an issue 
of measurement, and more scientific research needs to be done. 

 A pretty strong argument can be made for perfectionistic 
strivings as a good thing to improve performance, at least in 
part due to the drive it produces to stimulate greater effort on 
the performer’s part. And while perfectionistic concerns don’t 
necessarily help, they don’t always hurt, but that is probably a 
matter of degree: The more severe or significant the concern, 
the more likely it will interfere. 

 In the sport research, we generally see the same thing, but there 
are some differences. One study, for example, found that after 
four trials of a new basketball scoring training task, perfectionistic 
strivings were associated with higher performance. But athletes 
who were high in both strivings and concerns—unhealthy 
perfectionists—showed the largest performance improvement 
over the four trials. The reason for this may have been the 
measures used and how perfectionistic concerns were defined, 
muddying the conclusions that can be drawn. 

 This issue was corrected the following year in two studies with 
triathletes that again confirmed that high perfectionistic strivings 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
131
predict better performance. These strivings are consistently 
associated with self-confidence, hope of success, wanting to 
performing better than others, wanting to perform as well as one 
possibly can, and—most importantly—actual performance in both 
training and competition. Perfectionistic strivings are good. But in 
these studies, perfectionistic concerns neither hurt nor helped. 

 A 2015 study of junior athletes found that perfectionistic 
concerns were a risk factor for burnout. Strivings appeared to 
have the opposite effect, with high levels predicting decreases 
in burnout. So, even if concerns do help performance, it seems 
that they can come at a potentially great cost. 

 If we look at skill level, we find that perfectionistic strivings tend 
to increase in more competitive and serious levels of sport, but it 
is unclear which causes which. It was also found that competitive 
level was only related to perfectionistic strivings, not concerns. 

 This makes sense, as higher-level athletes are going to be more 
invested in their performance than lower-level performers. It 
also makes sense that the more invested you are in performance 
at higher levels, concerns about mistakes should also increase, 
but not necessarily maladaptively, because if maladaptive 

Lecture 15  |  Being the Perfect Perfectionist  
132
concerns consistently come up and interfere, it would limit your 
opportunity to get to that next level. 

 Worry and fear are generally not a good thing. But by reacting 
adaptively to these traditionally unhelpful concerns, you can 
limit their negative influence, ultimately by letting go and 
refocusing on the pursuit of excellence. 

 But if we start cutting out perfectionistic concerns, are we still 
measuring perfectionism? You can’t add or take away constructs 
of perfectionism and still call it perfectionism. So, while it can 
be a useful tool to think about good and bad perfectionism, or 
strivings versus concerns, some authors argue that we should 
keep the concept clearly defined so as to not invite confusion. 

 Perfectionism, in its entirety, is unhealthy. Striving for excellence 
is good. Worry and fear, chronic criticism, and lack of tolerance 
of mistakes are generally bad. So, perfectionism, which includes 
both, has some short-term advantages but at a great cost. And 
athletes who have high levels of primarily adaptive perfectionistic 
strivings also tend to have higher levels of primarily maladaptive 
perfectionistic concerns.
Perfectionism

 In its most complete and truest form, perfectionism is a 
paradox. It is a thinking and feeling pattern that energizes 
achievement and contributes to success while simultaneously 
causing distress that can undermine the level and enjoyment 
of that success.

 Perfectionism may be best thought of as a personality 
characteristic, not just a thinking style or behavioral intensity of 
goal striving. Perfectionists do not pursue these ridiculously high 
standards of performance for an intrinsic reward or enjoyment of 
achieving them. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
133

 For perfectionists, such achievements have become a 
(somewhat) effective way to gain social acceptance, get 
recognition, and establish a sense of personal value. But it gets 
to an irrational level, where success and failure are absolutes—
dichotomies with no gray in between. And with the definition of 
success set so high, the many failures that inevitably result are 
followed by harsh criticism. There’s no room for error, and this 
intensifies the concern about making an error. 

 So begins a hypervigilant search for threats, a desperation to 
avoid and correct weaknesses and limitations, and a profound 
sensitivity to criticism from others because such failures 
undermine their very worth. 

 Perfectionists start to doubt that they have the ability to 
adequately meet these important goals, with a preoccupation 
on where they are lacking and the possible impact of their 
failures. They find it difficult to determine what’s good enough, 
leaving them in a state of constant tension, for if perfection is 
the standard—yet it cannot be achieved—how else can they 
feel? So, they are moved to action, obsessively striving for this 
standard as a hopeless attempt to feel good enough.

 The foundational belief of perfectionism, then, is that self-
acceptance is intimately tied to accomplishment and the two 
cannot be separated. This fosters an overdependence on 
achieving and drives people to strive compulsively, regardless of 
the consequences of that striving.

 With that definition, true perfectionism is so much more than 
just intensely pursuing a goal, or limited to just wanting to 
get it exactly right. These beliefs are firmly integrated into an 
individual’s identity, not only reflecting how he or she behaves 
but also who he or she is.

 Part of the problem is that not only are the standards set both 
rigid and excessive, but perfection is to some degree also 
believed to always be possible. When failure inevitably occurs, 

Lecture 15  |  Being the Perfect Perfectionist  
134
the person can’t handle it, acting like it shouldn’t happen to 
him or her. Not only is failure frequently experienced, but so 
is self-criticism and distress. While this can positively result in 
intense goal striving, it comes at the cost of undermining self-
worth.
Theories of Motivation

 Self-determination theory suggests that we’re motivated to 
fulfill three basic human needs: competence, autonomy, and 
relatedness. We can most readily see that the frequent failure 
of falling short of perfectionistic standards undermines the 
competence need. And because the perfectionist is looking 
for the approval of others and is feeling that he or she has to 
succeed, rather than wants to, this sense of obligation and 
external control undermines autonomy. 

 With these needs not being met, and with perfection as the 
solution to achieving competence, the drive to be perfect is 
enhanced, but it perpetuates the cycle of needs not getting met, 
which sets the perfectionist up for lower self-worth and burnout, 
continually striving for something that he or she can’t get.

 Achievement goal theory looks at how an individual defines 
success and failure as the critical factor determining how he 
or she goes about achieving. So, the perfectionist overworks 
for goals with both extreme approach and extreme avoidance 
motives in an attempt to establish self-worth, wanting to 
approach success and avoid failure. 

 The hybrid goal of craving success, with simultaneous thoughts 
of failure, energize perfectionistic striving. Perfectionistic 
athletes set both mastery and performance goals—goals to 
master a skill and goals to beat others. 

 Sport psychologists tend to emphasize mastery goals because 
you can’t control the performance of others and comparisons can 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
135
lead to distress, but performance goals can be motivating and 
part of what drives the elite is to be better than everyone else. 

 But perfectionists also set performance avoidance goals—goals 
that tell you what not to do. From a performance standpoint, 
mistakes are even more likely to happen with this focus. Goals 
that tell you what not to do make it more likely that you will 
do it because your attention is drawn to the wrong thing. So, 
the perfectionist’s performance suffers in this way, too, and 
motivation takes a hit when mistakes happen.

 People are attached to their perfectionism, so the goal for a 
sport psychologist might be to help them become perfect 
perfectionists. Threatening to get rid of the very thing they 
need—their perfectionism—frightens some athletes. Instead, 

Lecture 15  |  Being the Perfect Perfectionist  
136
the goal is to lessen their concerns while increasing their 
strivings, ultimately stopping true perfectionism and embracing 
a pursuit of excellence. 

 But perfectionism is difficult to treat. A clinical sport psychologist 
with a background in cognitive behavioral therapy or acceptance 
and commitment therapy may be in the best position to treat 
the perfectionistic athlete. 

 Still, coaches and the sport culture can help. Teaching the 
difference between perfectionistic striving and striving for 
excellence is one way to do it. The latter makes room for 
mistakes. Another strategy is appropriate goal setting, where 
the goals are challenging but realistic and flexible. Setting up 
a mastery-orientated practice climate is the best thing that can 
be done, where mistakes are related to as opportunities to learn 
and success is defined by improvement, not perfection.

Self-Compassion for 
Self-Improvement
W
e can’t just push problems aside as 
if they don’t exist or treat them as an 
inconvenience. We shouldn’t dwell on them 
either, but we have to take some time to acknowledge 
them before we can start problem solving. There are 
times we need to pull it together immediately and cope, 
but in the times between, we need to take the time to 
acknowledge what we really feel. We need to feel our 
feelings and process them and then decide what to do 
with them and how to perform our best. We need to 
practice self-compassion.

Lecture 16  |  Self-Compassion for Self-Improvement  
138
Self-Compassion

 In 2003, Dr. Kristin Neff introduced the concept of self-
compassion, defining it in three parts: self-kindness, which is 
being kind and understanding toward yourself in instances of pain 
or failure rather than being harshly self-critical; common humanity, 
which is perceiving your experiences as part of the larger human 
experience rather than seeing them as separating and isolating; 
and mindfulness, which is holding painful thoughts and feelings in 
balanced awareness rather than over-identifying with them.

 There are two opposite ways we can treat ourselves across 
three dimensions: We can either treat ourselves with kindness 
or judgment; we can either see our experience as shared with 
others and normal or in isolation; and we can either relate to our 
suffering by mindfully observing it or getting overly invested in it. 

 Self-compassion differs from self-esteem. Self-compassion is 
based on self-acceptance, as you are. Self-esteem is based on 
self-evaluation and social comparison.

 We know judgement, but what we need is kindness: the ability 
to be caring and supportive to ourselves when life’s difficult 
circumstances or personal failures arise and we need to get 
through them. When we accept painful experiences with self-
kindness, we are better able to experience our pain rationally 
and calmly rather than with self-criticism and frustration. 

 We can suffer alone and think our pain is unique, and we’re the 
only ones going through it, and no one understands us because 
they aren’t in our situation. These attitudes hurt us because they 
increase our sense of isolation and make it difficult to listen to 
the friend, teammate, coach, or family member who may have 
some very helpful information to share. 

 A belief in a common humanity, on the other hand, represents 
a worldview characterized by the recognition that all humans 
are imperfect and vulnerable and that suffering is part of the 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
139
universal human experience rather than a personal affliction. 
When we see our pain this way, we become less judgmental and 
more understanding when dealing with adversity. It enables us 
to cope better. 

 You might think that if you take it easy on yourself, you’ll squash 
your motivation to work hard and improve. But that’s not true. In 
fact, it’s the opposite; self-compassion actually increases your 
motivation. 

 Self-handicaps are barriers to performance that people create 
to protect their sense of competence and self-esteem, usually 
through unclear performance feedback. If they fail, they tell 
themselves that it isn’t because of their poor ability; it is for 
some circumstance outside of themselves. When the performer 
does well in spite of this handicap, then his or her sense of 
competence is enhanced. 

 Handicapping comes in two types: behavioral handicaps, 
which are actual behaviors that would hurt performance, such 
as decreased effort or less practice time; and self-reported 
handicaps, which are claims of handicaps before a performance, 
such as high anxiety.

 Only moderate or occasional use of self-handicapping strategies 
protects or enhances self-esteem. More frequent use, however, 
will lead to more long-term disadvantages than benefits. 
Decreasing effort or practice, and using that as an excuse, 
increases the risk of failure. 

 Sandbagging is defined as a self-presentation strategy where a 
false prediction or fake demonstration of inability lowers others’ 
expectations of your performance and theoretically decreases 
pressure to perform. Personal expectations of success increase 
performance, but other people’s expectations of success can 
hurt performance, so sandbagging decreases this pressure—
but at a cost. 

Lecture 16  |  Self-Compassion for Self-Improvement  
140

 Sandbaggers limit exploration of their abilities by avoiding 
feedback on their performance when it would be made public. 
In a sport-specific example, sandbaggers who predicted lower 
performance scores ended up performing worse in the actual 
competition, suggesting that predicting worse performance 
could also work as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

 Both self-handicapping and sandbagging are powerful ways to 
protect ourselves from psychological harm, at the cost of being 
our best. But it turns out that people high in self-compassion 
have less of a need to use such self-protective strategies and 
both self-handicap and sandbag less. This is also true in 
academic settings. 
Self-Compassion and Performance

 To date, there are no studies that measure a direct effect of 
self-compassion on physical sport outcomes such as strength, 
speed, or wins and losses. But the research does address 
psychological variables associated with self-compassion that do 
enhance performance directly.

 You can be both kind and challenging. You do not have to be 
mean to yourself to motivate yourself. You can have extremely 
high standards and at the same time be honest with yourself 
about who you are and the mistakes you made. 

 Only then, with this accurate and balanced picture of yourself, 
can you change what needs to be fixed. Self-criticism is actually 
associated with lower goal progress in athletes. So, if you want 
to be better, be kind to yourself. 

 Self-compassion may be particularly beneficial for female 
athletes who face the unique challenge of negotiating the 
difficult relationship between the body required for performance 
and the body desired for appearance. These athletes inevitably 
experience guilt and shame because by meeting one standard, 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
141
they fall short in the other. Self-compassion is described as 
an emotional regulation strategy that can neutralize negative 
emotions and promote a positive state of mind. 

 The lack of self-compassion is only a slightly bigger issue for 
women compared to men. In a 2015 meta-analysis consisting of 
71 publications and more than 13,000 participants, women were 
found to be a bit less self-compassionate. This is consistent with 
past findings that females tend to be more critical of themselves, 
use more negative self-talk, and ruminate more than males. 

 Unfortunately, this can lead to a higher incidence of depression 
among females. So, it may be particularly important to help 
women learn how to be self-compassionate, but because the 
effect size is small, gender differences in self-compassion 
should not be overemphasized. Men need to practice this, too. 
In fact, we could all use more of this, regardless of gender, race, 
age, or culture.

Lecture 16  |  Self-Compassion for Self-Improvement  
142

 The benefits of self-compassion are not limited to sport and 
performance. Another 2015 meta-analysis with more than 3,200 
participants found self-compassion to be positively associated 
with the practice of health-promoting behaviors such as eating 
habits, exercise, sleep behaviors, and stress management. 
The authors concluded that some of these results are due to 
the impact of self-compassion on the increased positive and 
decreased negative emotions. 

 In a large meta-analytic study with a sample of almost 16,500 
participants, the authors found not only a very clear association 
of self-compassion with various forms of well-being, but also a 
causal relationship, with medium to large effect sizes.

 Self-compassion 
also 
apparently 
helps 
procrastinators. 
Procrastination creates stress, but we do it anyway because it 
delays the immediate discomfort of whatever we don’t want to 
do. Delaying it, however, often just creates more stress and 
pressure later on, increasing our urge to procrastinate even more. 
Procrastinators then tend to make it worse by beating themselves 
up for the behavior with self-deprecating and automatic negative 
thoughts, further increasing stress and distress. 

 Individuals with high self-compassion report dramatically less 
motivation anxiety and tendency to procrastinate than those 
with low or moderate self-compassion. Those with lower levels 
were associated with higher levels of procrastination. And 
treating yourself harshly after failure to do what you want just 
adds to the stress associated with procrastinating, further 
compromising health. 
Practicing Self-Compassion

 Dr. Kristin Neff’s website, www.self-compassion.org, is an 
incredible resource of articles, meditations, and exercises. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
143

 Maybe the best way to develop compassion for yourself is to 
consider how you might treat a friend. In a writing exercise, 
respond to these four prompts: 
1.	 Think about times when a close friend feels bad about him- or 
herself or is struggling in some way. How would you, at your 
best, respond to your friend in this situation? Write down what 
you typically do and what you say, and note the tone in which 
you typically talk to your friends.
2.	 Think about times when you feel bad about yourself or are 
struggling. How do you typically respond to yourself in these 
situations? Write down what you typically do and what you say, 
and note the tone in which you talk to yourself.
3.	 Do you notice a difference? If so, ask yourself why. What 
factors or fears come into play that lead you to treat yourself 
and others so differently?
4.	 Write down how you think things might change if you treat 
yourself like a close friend when you’re suffering.

 Taking a self-compassion break can take less than five minutes 
and consists of the three elements of self-compassion: 
mindfulness, common humanity, and kindness. 

Lecture 16  |  Self-Compassion for Self-Improvement  
144
1.	 When a moment of suffering or pain arises, pause and 
recognize that it is there. Typically, we will do any number of 
things to avoid or get rid of it, including trying to dismiss it or 
criticize ourselves for being so silly or weak. But your feelings 
matter and they’re there, so take a moment to acknowledge 
them. Don’t evaluate, embellish, or justify them. Just notice 
them, label them, and feel them for what they are.
2.	 Then, recognize that you are not alone. Remembering that 
you’re having a very normal feeling, that millions of others also 
feel, can help. This isn’t meant to trivialize your experience—
quite the opposite. Respect that you feel what you feel, and 
while no one knows exactly what you’re going through, there 
is an element of it that everyone can relate to because we all 
suffer in some capacity. 
3.	 Once you can feel that, put your hand over your heart, or on 
that place where you feel that emotional pain, or where you 
need a soothing touch, such as holding yourself or stroking 
your skin. Feel the warmth of your hands, considering how 
you can be kind to yourself or what you need to hear at that 
moment. This is an opportunity to give yourself validation, 
encouragement, or acceptance. Physical touch has a powerful 
effect, even your own. End with kind words to yourself. Watch 
how much better you feel.

LECTURE 17
Burnout and the 
Need for Recovery
T
his lecture is about burnout, which is defined as 
a psychological syndrome where an individual is 
low on three dimensions: energy, involvement, 
and efficacy—maybe better described as exhausted, 
cynical, and ineffective. When you’re exhausted, you feel 
overextended and depleted physically and emotionally. 
Cynicism describes a negative, callous, or excessively 
detached response toward different aspects of work. 
Inefficacy, or reduced accomplishments, captures the 
feelings of incompetence, lack of achievement, and 
decreased productivity associated with burnout. All 
three dimensions are needed to be considered burnout. 

Lecture 17  |  Burnout and the Need for Recovery  
146
Burnout

 These definitions associated with burnout come from analyses 
of burnout within the helping professions. As far as sport goes, 
this model extends well to coaches because they are helpers 
providing for their athletes. But athletes are different. They are 
receiving the help, so the model has to be modified.

 Exhaustion remains but is adjusted to physical and emotional 
exhaustion associated with intense training and competition. 
Cynicism is replaced with sport devaluation: a loss of interest, 
indifference, or resentment toward performance and the sport. 
Inefficacy is replaced by reduced accomplishment, relating to 
an athlete’s skills and abilities and observed when athletes fail to 
achieve personal goals or are performing below expectations. 

 Of course, athletes are going to get exhausted when training. 
But burnout exhaustion lasts long after training fatigue is 
relieved following rest. And the pattern or onset of burnout 
differs in sport than in the work setting. Exhaustion comes 
first but is then closely followed by reduced accomplishment. 
Devaluation doesn’t happen until later.

 Sometimes there is a confusion of terms. Burnout is not being 
just really, really tired. In this case, such fatigue can lead to 
withdrawal from an activity that is actually helpful. You get your 
break and then return refreshed. 

 In burnout, the withdrawal is part of the problem, not the cure, 
because it becomes a habit of low motivation. True physical 
exhaustion involves the depletion of physical energy resources, 
and withdrawal in cases of burnout are a more significant 
psychological and motivational unwillingness to engage than 
when just fatigued.

 Burnout can look like depression, but there are distinct 
differences. Burnout tends to be associated with a specific 
performance context, whereas depression is more generalized 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
147
across all aspects of a person’s life. The sadness, guilt, 
hopelessness, and worthlessness that are seen in depression 
are not necessarily a part of the burnout experience. They are 
separate, but you could experience both simultaneously.

 Probably the most confused construct with burnout is 
overtraining. Overlapping symptoms such as exhaustion, 
lethargy, and negative mood make distinguishing between them 
difficult. A common way to screen for overtraining is by using 
the Profile of Mood States scale, which assesses five negative 
mood states and one positive mood state. 

 Successful performance in sport is usually associated with an 
iceberg profile, one that is high on vigor and low on tension, 
depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion. Overtrained athletes 
show the opposite pattern. 

Lecture 17  |  Burnout and the Need for Recovery  
148

 Some argue that burnout is a more severe form of overtraining 
but also maintain that they are distinct conditions. Overtraining 
is more associated with physical training and issues of under-
recovery, whereas burnout can happen in the absence of 
excessive physical loads, such as due to psychological stress. 

 Regarding overtraining, rest is critical for recovery. But rest 
alone does not do it for the burned-out athlete. 

 The overtrained athlete is attempting to balance a continued 
drive to train with a physically reduced ability to do so. The 
burned-out athlete, on the other hand, is done physically and 
emotionally. He or she has lost the motivation to train and 
ultimately even participate in the sport. And while burnout 
isn’t a common problem, for those that are burned out, the 
consequences are devastating.

 Burnout is a syndrome, or a collection of symptoms that occur 
together. Because these symptoms are associated with other 
constructs, such as depression, it can be challenging to identify. 
In addition, it can be difficult to tell which symptoms are true 
symptoms of the condition and which ones are the resulting 
consequences of the syndrome. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
149

 Burnout can affect five main areas: affective, cognitive, physical, 
behavioral, and motivational. 
››
The affective symptoms are typically a restrained or subdued 
mood state, such as gloomy, tearful, or depressed. But it can 
also be moody, with shifts to anxiety or aggression because of 
frustration and oversensitivity. 
››
The cognitive symptoms include problems with information 
processing, memory, attention, and concentration as well as 
sometimes a rigidity in thinking. 
››
There is inconsistency in the physical symptoms with objective 
measures of health, such as cholesterol and cortisol levels 
being only weakly associated with burnout compared to 
stronger self-reports of headaches, nausea, restlessness, sleep 
disturbance, ulcers, high blood pressure, disrupted menstrual 
cycles, and frequent and prolonged colds. 
››
The same inconsistency shows up for the behavioral 
manifestations, such as substance use, over- and undereating, 
high risk taking, avoidance, impulsivity, and procrastination. 
››
But the motivational symptoms are clear. There is a crisis in which 
the emotional drive has disappeared, replaced by feelings of 
disappointment that sport is not experienced as great as it once 
was, accompanied by a loss of hope. This leads to the behavioral 
responses mentioned previously and, ultimately, withdrawal. 

 While these descriptors are from the literature on professional 
burnout, they hold up pretty well in the sport context. Additional 
symptoms specific to sport include feeling trapped or unable to 
escape sport, constant fatigue, and needing longer recovery 
periods for the physical and emotional exhaustion dimension. 

 Reduced accomplishment in the sport model adds inconsistent 
performances, training hard but not seeing any improvement, 
and internalizing or taking feedback too personally. 

 Finally, devaluation is characterized by a loss of motivation 
and enthusiasm, seeing few benefits to participating, looking 
forward to being done with the sport and time away, resentment, 
and just being sick of playing and competing.

Lecture 17  |  Burnout and the Need for Recovery  
150
Models of Burnout

 There aren’t enough longitudinal studies to identify the exact 
causes of burnout in sport, but a few models have been 
proposed to explain it. One of the most well-supported models 
in the literature is the cognitive-affective model, in which stress 
is perceived as the key causal factor. 

 Burnout is the product of chronic exposure to stress. Based on the 
idea that humans want to maximize positive and minimize negative 
experiences, athletes will engage in activities as long as they are 
favorable, balancing the costs and rewards of engaging in the 
activity compared to other opportunities. When sport becomes 
an aversive source of stress, burnout and withdrawal are likely 
when the costs become too great and outweigh the benefits. 

 Burnout happens in four stages. The first stage is the demands 
of the sport—time, training, relationships, and pressure. In the 
second stage, the athlete meets these demands. If he or she 
can handle them, then everything is good. But if he or she feels 
that he or she can’t handle them because of a lack of skills, 
time, energy, good coaching, money, or emotional support, 
then the third stage of physiological responses is initiated: the 
stress response, or the fight-or-flight response. This triggers 
the coping behaviors in the final stage. These behaviors can be 
positive, such as rest, working harder, or seeking support, or 
they can be maladaptive, such as working harder when rest is 
needed or avoidance. Then, the athlete cycles back into the first 
situational demands stage, and the process continues. 

 In burnout, a sense of chronic overload continues, and 
physiological responses of lethargy, tension, fatigue, or illness 
result. If the stress isn’t managed so that the benefits outweigh 
the costs, withdrawal from sport can be the final coping behavior.

 Building on this, the stress-recovery perspective suggests that 
burnout is the result of a growing imbalance between stress and 
adequate recovery. It can start with overtraining as athletes are 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
151
unable to recover adequately, and as the gap between stress 
and healing continues, burnout can follow. This emphasis on 
recovery is an important one. It is critical to performance-
improvement cycles. 

 A second stress-recovery model, total quality recovery, places 
a greater emphasis on the role of proper recovery in preventing 
overtraining, staleness, and burnout. It’s comprehensive, 
emphasizing physical, emotional, psychological, and social 
recovery.

 That takes care of stress perspectives, but there are other 
models, including the sport commitment model of burnout. 
Like the constrained, obligatory kind of commitment identified 
in recent models, in the sport burnout literature, it is called 
sport entrapment: high cost and low rewards for participating, 
few choices for alternative activities, and a high investment in 
participation. Entrapped athletes doubt the value of their sport 
and feel restricted and unable to leave, leading to burnout.

 In 
a 
social 
model 
called 
the 
unidimensional 
identity 
development and external control model, burnout is the result 
of encouraging athletes to develop their identity exclusively in 

Lecture 17  |  Burnout and the Need for Recovery  
152
and around sport, where success becomes critical to a positive 
sense of self. In addition, decision making is in the hands of 
coaches, administrators, and others, so both the limited identity 
and lack of autonomy and control contribute to burnout, leading 
to sport withdrawal.

 The final model of athletic burnout has been the application of 
self-determination theory, which proposes that we all have three 
basic needs for well-being and personal growth: autonomy, 
competence, and relatedness. Autonomy is your perception of 
control and choice. Competence is how you feel you are measuring 
up to internal and external goals and standards. Relatedness is 
how connected and secure you feel in your environment. 

 The more satisfied you are in each of these areas, the more self-
determined, or internally motivated, you can be. The more self-
determined you are, the more control over your own behaviors 
you have, and the greater likelihood of success and achievement. 
But if you are more externally regulated and you’re depending 
on things outside yourself, then getting your needs for 
autonomy, competence, and relatedness met can be hindered. 
And burnout may be one of several negative consequences. 
Preventing and Treating Burnout 

 Pulling from the professional intervention literature, there is 
evidence that stress management techniques—such as cognitive 
restructuring, taking a more helpful perspective and what these 
experiences mean to people, and relaxation training—can be 
helpful. 

 The more interventions you can do—and it’s great if you can 
address both the individual and the performance context—the 
better, especially because research shows that the organizational 
factors play a bigger role in burnout than individual ones. But it 
may be easier for the individual to change. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
153

 Targeting the exhaustion element of burnout seems to yield 
the best results. The inefficacy and cynicism seem to be more 
resistant to improvement.

 A more positive mood should be protected and developed in 
sport to prevent burnout. Mindfulness practice is one way that 
you can achieve this, and it is a particularly good way because 
such a practice is entirely under your control. 

 Enhancing engagement may be the best way to prevent 
burnout overall. Do what you can to stay positively absorbed 
and engaged in what you are doing. Athlete engagement is 
characterized by confidence, dedication, vigor, and enthusiasm. 

 Physical and emotional exhaustion is the first dimension of 
burnout, so rest is important. But it is difficult to prescribe, 
because it is different for everyone. Personal awareness 
decision making is the key, monitoring your body and recovery 
and quality of workouts, and making adjustments as needed 
to meet your goals and maintain energy. Be aware of sleep, 
hydration, and nutrition so that your body maximally heals after 

Lecture 17  |  Burnout and the Need for Recovery  
154
exercise. Prevention is ideal, so finding a daily or weekly way to 
recharge yourself is best. 

 The second dimension is sport devaluation. Motivation is 
needed here, so remember self-determination theory: autonomy, 
competence, and relatedness. 
››
Recognize your independence. Realize that you could do 
something else with your life. Perhaps a daily gratitude 
exercise will help. Each day, journal three unique things that 
you’re thankful for to keep you engaged. 
››
Goal setting and achievement are great ways to keep you 
focused on your competence, even if your coach or boss 
doesn’t acknowledge it. While it’s true that the environment is 
the greater cause for burnout, we have to be responsible for 
ourselves. Keeping a goal journal with daily, or at least weekly 
and monthly, goals keeps you focused on your progress. This 
also helps buffer against the third dimension of burnout, 
reduced accomplishments. 
››
The relatedness component, how connected and secure we 
are in our environment, ties in well with the stress models of 
burnout, as relationships are often the biggest stressors. We 
cannot control other people; we cannot make them nice or be 
supportive. Find healthy relationship boundaries. And say no. 
You only have a limited amount of energy.

LECTURE 18
Pain Tolerance and 
Injury Rehabilitation
T
his lecture focuses on pain and injury, which are 
as much a part of sport as winning and losing are. 
In some ways, pain is a part of what we love most 
about sports. It makes them difficult and challenging. Not 
everyone is willing to risk pain, and athletes take pride in 
that. Injury certainly involves pain, but it’s so much more. 
Injuries happen and can’t be avoided in sport.

Lecture 18  |  Pain Tolerance and Injury Rehabilitation  
156
Pain

 Pain is a biopsychosocial experience. Every pain experience 
involves your biology, your thoughts about the pain, and your 
emotional reactions to it, and it is influenced by the social 
context in which it occurs. It will often start with a physical 
trigger or cause, although it doesn’t have to. 

 Thoughts and emotions influence pain perception 
and can affect behavior. Positive, affirming, 
confident reactions can be beneficial. But when 
pain elicits a strong negative emotional reaction, 
then a vicious cycle can develop where pain 
increases distress, which increases pain, 
which increases distress, and so on. Anxiety 
and depression can kill motivation for 
rehab and further prevent recovery.

 Pain also occurs in a context. In American football, drawing 
attention to an injury could be dangerous for a player who 
doesn’t want to let the opposing team know that he has been 
hurt by their efforts. In soccer, however, reacting to pain can be 
helpful, hopefully drawing a penalty and a potential penalty kick. 

 The social aspects of pain are also critical to the pain experience. 
Does pain elicit more support and attention from family or 
teammates? Does pain serve as an excuse for poor performance? 
Might pain let an athlete escape a particularly tough workout? 

 It might not be that someone is faking pain or malingering an 
injury, but there might be real perceived differences in pain 
sensations due to the psychological and social factors that 
contribute to the pain experience. Such social reinforcers for the 
pain actually increase the physical experience of pain. 

 Psychology is an integral and significant part of the pain 
experience. This is why doctors can’t just look at a person’s injury 
and know how much pain he or she should be feeling. It is also so 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
157
often why—particularly in chronic pain, which threatens a person’s 
day-to-day life experiences—medications alone, even powerful 
ones, do not work. It’s because the pain isn’t just physical.

 There isn’t just one kind of pain. Athletes will experience a 
continuum of pain: Fatigue and discomfort are the normal 
sensations 
associated 
with 
training, 
competition, 
and 
rehabilitation. As an athlete, you have to get comfortable with 
being uncomfortable, as this is a routine part of sport. 

 More intense is positive training pain. This, too, is necessary, 
and athletes need to push into this on a regular basis to be their 
best, although it can be difficult. It is a nonthreatening pain and 
typically happens with endurance activities. It is believed to be 
under the athlete’s control, as it stops when the activity stops or 
lessens when intensity is dropped. 

 This normal performance pain is usually characterized as being 
a dull, more generalized pain. It doesn’t last long after exertion 
and is produced voluntarily. In many ways, it can be satisfying 
when interpreted as a sign of a good workout or achieving goals. 

Lecture 18  |  Pain Tolerance and Injury Rehabilitation  
158

 If an athlete isn’t sure what these kinds of pains are, or interprets 
them as dangerous, it can lead to unnecessary distress and 
decreased compliance with rehabilitation.

 Next is negative training pain, which is threatening. It means that 
continued training is no longer beneficial. It hurts, and pushing 
through it isn’t helping you athletically. 

 Negative warning pain is even more threatening, signaling 
potential injury and prompting the athlete to evaluate the cause 
and take appropriate action to prevent injury. 

 Negative acute pain indicates that an injury has occurred. 
Unlike performance pain, this pain is intense and specific. It 
persists after exertion has stopped. It is perceived as outside 
the athlete’s control and can be distressing. And if athletes 
misinterpret this pain as safe, they are at risk for worsening the 
injury, treatment setbacks, and re-injury. 

 Finally, at the most extreme end of the spectrum is numbness, the 
absence of sensation. This is typically a cause for concern. It signals 
a serious injury and should be interpreted as highly negative.

 When pain shows up, you can either pay attention to it or not. 
Association is a strategy that means tuning in to the pain as a 
performance cue. Dissociation strategies, on the other hand, 
intentionally use distraction as a way of coping with the mental 
and physical demands of the sport. There isn’t one strategy 
that’s best; rather, you can determine which strategy is best 
when you consider your goals, effort, conditioning, willingness 
to hurt, and pain management skills.

 John Heil wrote the top book on sport injury, and in it, he 
suggests seven elements to remarkable feats of pain tolerance. 
1.	 There has to be the expectation that pain can and will be 
tolerated. 
2.	 Acceptance involves giving up the struggle to be comfortable 
or focus on getting relief. Pain is respected as valuable and 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
159
essential. 
In 
this 
way, 
pain is positive. It can be 
equated with effort. You 
might not even call it pain 
but use other labels, such 
as fatigue or discomfort, 
to 
help 
change 
the 
cognitive interpretation 
and normalize it.
3.	 With a strong goal 
focus, achievement of 
the goal is of primary 
concern, an incredibly strong desire to achieve an outcome 
that leads to willingness to experience anything to achieve it. 
4.	 This leads to absorption in the work, or a focus so strong on 
the moment-to-moment process of performance that all else, 
including pain, just fades away. 
5.	 In remarkable feats, there may be cognitive and perceptual 
changes, such as tunnel vision and enhanced visual clarity, not 
hearing some sounds but intensified others, slow- and fast-
motion time effects, intrusive thinking, dissociation, memory 
loss, distortion, and even temporary paralysis and automated 
behavior. When these strange changes occur, they are 
considered normal and helpful in service of performance.
6.	 The awareness that pain will be tolerated for a limited 
amount of time makes remarkable feats of pain tolerance 
more likely. Performance pain will eventually end, but the 
emotional pain of failure can last forever, motivating the 
performer to endure more in the moment for a more enduring 
sense of satisfaction and achievement later. 
7.	 Pain can be most greatly tolerated in a true survival context, 
under life-threatening conditions. While sport seldom involves 
true life-or-death situations, there is a metaphorical survival 
context when an athlete must “win or go home” or fight to 
make the team. The athlete’s survival at sport can depend on 
a successful outcome, increasing the willingness to experience 
pain to achieve the goal.

Lecture 18  |  Pain Tolerance and Injury Rehabilitation  
160

 Heil also describes the pain-sport attentional matrix, a useful 
way to look at how focusing on and distracting from pain 
interacts with performance. 
››
You can start by associating to both pain and sport. This is 
useful when pain signals the proper technique.
››
Dissociating from both pain and sport will help decrease 
pain, but performance suffers. Comfort is never the goal in 
sport, so this has limited usefulness as far as achievement 
goes but can be helpful during natural breaks from activity as 
a way of getting psychological rest from pain or the cognitive 
demands of the sport. 
››
Dissociating from pain while tuning into sport performance 
is best when the pain is understood as routine or benign. It 
is best to just let it be there and stay focused on the task, 
otherwise pain becomes a distraction and interferes with 
performance. But sometimes this has limited value. Ignoring 
it in the beginning may work, but as it increases, pain has a 
way of wanting to be heard. So, develop a mindful approach 
to pain tolerance, letting it be there as it is, accepting it, and 
staying away from catastrophizing. 
››
Tuning into pain and dissociating from sport in many cases 
would cause the ultimate breakdown in performance. But it can 
be valuable during rehabilitation, in the management of overuse 
and chronic injury. Sport can totally absorb our attention. We 
can lose ourselves in it and push our bodies beyond where they 
should go, with pain signals suppressed to the detriment of 
athletes’ physical well-being. This strategy is best used during 
breaks in the action to assess pain or look for muscular guarding 
in an attempt to protect the hurting body part. 
Injury

 Injury can be devastating to an athlete, or it can be an 
opportunity to improve and come back even better. In either 
case, it is an athletic challenge, and an athlete is best served to 
treat it as such, using all the skills, tenacity, commitment, and 
hard work he or she has used in sport. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
161

 Emotionally, an athlete will go through an affective cycle. It is 
not uncommon to experience distress, such as anxiety and 
depression. It is also common to experience some denial or 
unacknowledged distress, particularly in the early stages. 

 These are normal, and we don’t have to panic and rush to get 
athletes to the third component of the model, determined 
coping, which is characterized by vigorous, proactive, goal-
driven behavior—although that is the ultimate goal. We want to 
spend more time in this phase, but it is normal and healthy to 
cycle through all three.

 When a performer is injured, we expect some sadness and 
disappointment. Playing time may be lost, perhaps a season. 
This can be particularly distressing if the performer has been 
training for a long period of time. Expect some anxiety about 
the injury and questions about returning to play, losing a starting 
spot, and achieving goals.

 When working with injured athletes, start by assessing what they 
know about their injury and how much they trust their medical 

Lecture 18  |  Pain Tolerance and Injury Rehabilitation  
162
team. Sometimes patients don’t understand the medical jargon. 
Sometimes the athlete feels rushed with the doctor, but they 
have to get their questions answered, particularly about what 
the pain means. 

 Is it benign, or can they play through it? Does it signal more 
damage being done, or is it normal rehabilitation pain? 
These answers are essential to rehabilitate properly, but they 
also minimize anxiety and relieve depression. Safety can be 
established, and progress can be better made.

 There is a return-to-sport model that suggests five stages an 
athlete will go through after injury when attempting to return to 
play.
››
First is the initial return, which tests the injury to be sure it is 
healed. This is medical confirmation. Athletes get stuck here. 
When a doctor tells the athlete that he or she is fine, it doesn’t 
always sink in. It is critical that the athlete knows in no uncertain 
terms that he or she is healed and safe to return. Athletes need 
to be careful about jumping back into sport. They are healed, 
but that doesn’t mean they are in competition shape. The risk 
is physically progressing too quickly. 
››
This leads to the second stage of recovery confirmation. 
Similar to the first, but more psychological in nature, athletes 
need feedback that the now-healed injury is also able to 
withstand the demands of sport. 
››
The third stage is the actual return of physical and technical 
abilities. Athletes are frustrated. They often want to pick up 
where they left off, but they can’t. They have to rebuild. This 
is a dangerous stage because the athlete sometimes wants to 
just jump back in with their teammates, setting them up for re-
injury. Athletes must commit to realistic healing and skill goals, 
based on where they are today. 
››
The next stage of high-intensity training marks the 
psychological transformation from injured to healed. Athletes 
in this stage can experience doubt and anxiety and have to be 
on the lookout for setbacks. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
163
››
The final stage is the return to competition with a mix of 
emotions. An athlete might be back and healed and ready 
to go, but there is also nervousness and apprehension. The 
key for athletes is to trust the rehab they’ve done and, when 
they get back to the game, to adopt the same focus they had 
before they left. If you are protecting the body part or fearing 
re-injury, your attention is not on the game; this increases your 
chances of getting hurt again.

purely a medical or physical issue?
2.	 For endurance athletes, such as cross-country runners and 
swimmers, pain tolerance is essential for success. Describe 
three ways in which pain can be interpreted as necessary 
and beneficial. What must an athlete do to keep this

LECTURE 19
The Dangerous Pursuit 
of the Ideal Body
W
e all feel pressure to look better. With every 
advertisement, music video, magazine cover, 
and Hollywood movie showing someone 
strong and beautiful, how can we not compare 
ourselves to these ideals and feel like we have to keep 
up? It starts early. Girls as young as eight and nine years 
old are worrying that they aren’t thin enough, and boys 
wonder if they’re muscular enough at nine. What can we 
do about this dangerous pursuit of the ideal body?

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
165
Body Image Disturbance

 Western 
cultures’ 
feminine 
beauty 
ideal 
and 
sexual 
objectification of women is well documented, and now men are 
getting caught up in it, too, defining masculinity through body 
shape and size. Masculine and feminine ideals get internalized, 
and it becomes the lens through which we compare ourselves to 
the rest of the world, evaluating our bodies as personal worth. 

 When we fall short, as we often do, dissatisfaction and distress 
can result in leading men and women alike to engage in 
behaviors that aren’t the healthiest. Dieting, particularly with 
extreme restraint, is the primary way to achieve the feminine 
beauty ideal. Physical activity, particularly high-level strength 
training and conditioning, is the avenue to achieve the male 
ideal. 

 Performance settings and cultures add additional pressure 
for athletes. For example, weight requirements or coach-
encouraged weight limits, public weigh-ins, judging criteria 
that reinforce and reward certain body types, and even just 
commenting on weight add to the pressure. 

 Revealing uniforms are especially problematic. High school 
female athletes and both male and female college athletes rated 
uniforms as one of the most significant weight and body image 
pressures. Body consciousness becomes an unneeded source of 
pressure and distraction that hurts performance.

 What happens when you try to meet two competing ideals at 
once? A female swimmer’s muscular shoulders are advantageous 
for sport but could make her feel self-conscious and dissatisfied 
with her body in social situations where she may want to appear 
more “feminine.” You can’t be both at once. Some pick a side 
and choose to interpret their body in the most positive way. 
Others experience conflict for years.

Lecture 19  | The Dangerous Pursuit of the Ideal Body  
166

 When the athletic body conflicts with the social ideal, the 
performer is at risk for unhealthy behaviors. And these unhealthy 
behaviors are often rewarded. Dieting, playing through pain, 
perfectionism, and excessive exercise might be complimented 
by coaches and teammates in service of achieving sport goals. 

 And at the right time, in the right way, in the appropriate 
situations, these behaviors may be okay or even commendable. 
But in the wrong context or in excess, these behaviors can come 
at the expense of personal health, leading to disordered eating 
or substance use. 

 Athletes in sports that are judged—aesthetic sports—are at 
particular risk for eating disorders. Winning in cheerleading, figure 
skating, synchronized swimming, and gymnastics is determined 
by the subjective evaluation of others, not an objective outcome, 
such as time, weight lifted, or baskets made. These athletes 
experience considerable weight-related pressures. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
167

 Many coaches in lean or endurance sports, such as wrestling, 
powerlifting, distance running, swimming, and tae kwon do, 
believe that leaner bodies and lower weight will improve 
performance, even though empirical research doesn’t support 
this idea. 

 Coaches and parents, therefore, may pressure an athlete to lose 
weight to his or her detriment. In these cases, there are higher 
rates of purposeful dehydration, self-induced vomiting, and 
diuretic and laxative use. The goal in some of these sports is to 
get one or two weight classes below their natural weight to gain 
a competitive advantage. But this isn’t always true.

 The pressure can be internal, too, especially when their identity 
is closely tied to their performance results. In addition, as 
athletes and performing artists advance, they devote more 
time, effort, and training to the pursuit of excellence. So, there’s 
internal and external pressure to win and do what they have to 
do to be their best. 

 But the strongest influence on body dissatisfaction and dietary 
restraint is the direct negative opinions and comments by 
coaches and teammates about what athletes look like and weigh 
and how bad the athletes feel about it. 

 Athletes value a coach’s opinion, so coaches can really influence 
how an athlete thinks about his or her body. But coaches also 
directly control the athlete’s physical training, playing time, and 
sometimes even food intake. And because of that power, when 
pleasing the coach can result in more playing time and attention, 
it can further incentivize the athlete to drop weight. 

 Comments regarding weight are common. In one sample of 
gymnastics coaches, half admitted that they made judgments 
for weight loss based only on appearance, not the athlete’s 
performance or nutritional training protocols. In another sample 
of young adult female athletes across a variety of sports, more 
than half had heard negative comments about their appearance, 

Lecture 19  | The Dangerous Pursuit of the Ideal Body  
168
body shape or size, and weight—not only from coaches, but also 
from family and peers.

 Even well-conditioned athletes can find themselves lacking, 
whether because of comparison to photoshopped pictures, to the 
size and shape believed to have a competitive advantage, or to 
what the general public currently finds attractive. 

 And if they believe the ideal is what they should look like and 
overemphasize the importance of their appearance in their 
self-evaluation, they are most at risk to be dissatisfied or even 
disgusted with how they look and want to change it. And the 
more that athletes are exposed to these messages, the more 
likely they are to internalize these ideals and ultimately are more 
at risk for disordered eating to achieve them.

 Negative emotions such as low self-esteem, guilt, and stress are 
associated with high levels of eating pathology as well as intent 
to restrict food intake. Dieting does not automatically make you 
a high eating disorder risk, but it does objectively put you one 
step in that direction. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
169

 While we think of these as problematic behaviors, the athletes 
see them as solutions—ways to fix the performance problem, 
get the edge, secure a starting position, keep up with the 
competition, or get to the next level. Sometimes it’s emotional, 
to feel good enough. Either way, disordered eating and the use 
of appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs are solutions 
that create other problems.
How Can We Help?

 Researchers suggest that creating a body-healthy environment 
may serve as a preventative measure, where the physical and 
psychological well-being of the athlete is central to all decisions, 
recommendations, and requirements regarding training. 

 Of course, coaches and administrators are concerned with 
the health of the athlete, but with the data we have, it looks 
like performance and winning are really at the center. This 
needs to change, but not necessarily at the cost of winning. In 
fact, a physically and mentally healthy athlete will be a better 
performer. 

 Researchers Trent Petrie and Christy Greenleaf offer some 
suggestions about where the right balance between health risks 
and sport performance is.

 There is no ideal body weight or body fat percentage that 
translates into peak performances. The best performers in 
sport vary in height, weight, size, and shape. So, the first step is 
disconnecting weight and performance. Don’t get athletes and 
dancers distracted by something that has little to do with their 
actual performance. Focus instead on skill development, mental 
training, proper nutrition, and rest.

 The authors argue that weight requirements and weigh-ins are 
unnecessary and should be eliminated in almost all instances. If 
weight requirements and weigh-ins are beneficial for health or 

Lecture 19  | The Dangerous Pursuit of the Ideal Body  
170
safety, then let the sports medicine team handle all the details, 
not the coaches or administrators. Do it privately and don’t 
post the results. Coaches and other staff should not talk about 
it. And coaches should be educated about disordered eating 
and the impact it can have on an athlete’s body image. When 
they criticize weight, it undermines confidence and negatively 
impacts performance. Keep these weight discussions out of the 
coaching arena and leave them to the nutritionist. 

 Better than treating something is preventing it in the first 
place. Meta-analyses show that prevention programs have a 
significant small to moderate effect in reducing risk factors 
such as internalization, body dissatisfaction, and negative 
affect, particularly when high-risk groups are targeted and the 
programs focus on body acceptance or reducing the thin ideal.

 But because problems do exist, screen for them and treat them. 
Information about eating habits, body and weight attitudes, and 
overall mood and stress can be gathered in preseason physicals. 
Then, throughout the year, the performers can be monitored by 
coaches and medical staff for signs and symptoms of disordered 
eating. Once identified, make confidential treatment a priority. 
Yes, this takes time, effort, and money—but our priorities do. 
We invest in what’s most important. Sport cannot say that health 
is important and then not act on it. 

 While education is important, it hasn’t consistently shown 
to significantly impact behaviors. Nothing is more powerful 
than changing the culture itself. As long as performance and 
appearance continue to be what’s most important, health, 
ethics, and fair play will come in second, with disordered eating 
and appearance- and performance-enhancing drug use a 
solution to achieving those more highly valued outcomes.

 Using performance-enhancing drugs is cheating and puts 
the athlete’s health at risk. If the athlete gets caught, as so 
many have, he or she has already made the money, broken the 
records, and achieved the success. The majority of punishments 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
171
for using performance-enhancing drugs, even while playing, are 
relatively minor—a few game checks and suspensions—not a 
lifetime ban. There isn’t a no-tolerance policy, which means we 
tolerate it at best. At worst, we encourage it, to the detriment of 
athletes’ health and well-being. This needs to change.

Questions to Consider
1.	 What would have to change in the sport culture to eradicate 
disordered eating? Choose a specific sport. At the youth 
and high school levels, how would you change the rules of 
the sport, the dress, the coaching, the communication, etc., 
to make this happen?
2.	 What would have to change in the sport culture to eradicate 
the use of performance-enhancing drugs? Choose a specific 
sport league. How would you modify the rules of the league 
to make this happen?

Fan Psychology, 
Identification, 
and Violence
T
his lecture is about the psychology of the sports 
fan. Sport fandom can be summarized in one 
word: identification. It seems to be at the root of 
our passion. Being a fan tends to distort our thinking 
and creates bias. Men tend to identify more, but women 
are not immune. Identification and the consequent 
distortion in thinking influences our behaviors, both 
good and violent. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
173
Fan Psychology

 Why be a fan? What makes us so passionate? Is it helpful or 
hurtful? Why do we get so passionate about a group of men or 
women who don’t even know who we are, yet how they perform 
and the decisions they make affect us so deeply?

 It comes down to belonging. It has been proven that identifying 
with a social group that shares your values or beliefs, a group that 
you value, leads to more social networks, which in turn provides 
more psychological support, boosting mental health. Positive 
social relationships are one of the core and best predictors of 
happiness and satisfaction with life.

 Social identity theory says that an individual’s self-concept 
comes, in part, from knowing that he or she is a member of a 
specific social group, along with the value and significance 
attached to that membership. Team identification is an 
application of this. It’s defined as a fan’s psychological 
attachment to a team and the degree to which a fan views that 
team as an extension of him- or herself.

 Fans feel part of a larger community sharing the same interest, 
and this fandom creates a sense of belonging. This psychological 
sense of community is associated with feeling greater social 
support and higher life satisfaction, quality of life, and social and 
subjective well-being.

 Being a fan boosts your well-being in two ways. First, you can 
bask in reflected glory, which is when you associate yourself with 
a winning team and feel their success as your own experience. 
The second is team identification, which involves the extent to 
which fans see the team as an extension of themselves. 

 Highly identified persons are those with a strong psychological 
attachment to the team, and they get tangible psychological 
benefits simply through their association with the group. 

Lecture 20  |  Fan Psychology, Identification, and Violence  
174

 Team identification is correlated with higher levels of social 
self-esteem and social well-being, higher levels of energy 
and more frequent positive emotions, and lower levels of 
loneliness, depression, alienation, and experiences of negative 
emotion. It’s also correlated with higher levels of openness, 
conscientiousness, and extroversion. 

 Even identifying with a losing team can be beneficial because 
of the belonging. In addition, these fans can take pride in their 
loyalty and ability to stick with the team through bad times as 
another way to enhance their self-esteem. 

 In 2006, Daniel Wann published the Team Identification–Social 
Psychological Health Model to explain the positive relationships 
between sport team identification and well-being. Team 
identification leads to increased social connections with others, 
both enduring and temporary. 

 Enduring social connections are found when fans live in a 
community where other fans of the team are frequently seen. 
Temporary social connections occur when an individual who 
does not live in a community with lasting connections sometimes 
finds him- or herself in the company of other fans of the team. 

 It isn’t through these social connections that social psychological 
well-being is enhanced. Team identification seems to enhance 
well-being directly through the reflected glory—when you can 
get it—and that sense of association. 

 In addition, threats to that social identity, such as poor team 
performance, and strategic coping mechanisms, such as 
assigning good characteristics to the team you are a fan of or 
bad characteristics to players you don’t like, determine how 
these social connections influence health. 

 It is the team identification, not sport fandom in general, 
that yields these positive results. The casual fan may not get 
the benefit if identification is low. On the other hand, highly 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
175
identified fans are threatened by their team’s poor performance 
and will use all kinds of coping strategies to help them deal with 
the distress. 

 Both athletes and fans tend to attribute wins to internal, stable, 
and controllable factors and losses to external, unstable, and 
uncontrollable factors. This phenomenon is known as the team-
serving bias. Wins are attributed to the team’s preparation and 
effort, while losses are the result of poor officiating. 

 Lowly identified fans don’t tend to do this and seem to be less 
bothered with explaining or justifying a defeat. Highly identified 
fans have a strong positive connection to their team, and being 
a fan is a central part of their social identity. As a result, the 
performance of their team is closely linked to their feelings of 
self-worth. They take wins and losses personally and experience 
anxiety, and their mood after the contest will be greatly affected. 

Lecture 20  |  Fan Psychology, Identification, and Violence  
176

 However, consistently great performances are not required to 
maintain fandom. Highly identified fans stay fans through the 
ups and downs and are less likely to disengage when the team 
is unsuccessful. On the other hand, fair-weather fans avoid the 
emotional burden of losing by disengaging after a loss and 
cutting off reflected failure. 

 Identification affects how you view the players. Highly identified 
fans will see players on their team more positively than lowly 
identified fans. They may focus on the positive attributes and 
minimize the negative. Highly identified fans will have a more 
negative bias on players from rival teams, judging them more 
harshly for a similar infraction.

 Fans try to maintain this favorable perception of their teams and 
players by focusing on the positive. They make comparisons that 
favor them, a situation called an intergroup bias. Intergroup bias 
explains why highly identified fans root against rival teams and 
against teams that just beat their team, particularly in playoffs or 
tournaments. It helps with coping. 

 Lowly identified fans don’t feel the same effects of a win or a 
loss on self-worth and self-esteem—positively or negatively—so 
there is no need to use these team-serving, or intergroup, biases 
to cope. It doesn’t mean you are less of a fan; it just means that 
you are less identified. It spares you some mood swings.

 Highly identified fans gain and maintain friendships through their 
association with the team. In fact, highly identified fans, when 
compared to low-identified ones, have greater levels of social self-
esteem, social integration, and trust in others. They also have lower 
levels of loneliness and alienation. Beyond these social benefits, 
highly identified fans demonstrate healthier mood profiles.

 Across the ages, identification with a winning team predicts higher 
levels of social life satisfaction and lower levels of loneliness. 
Sport fandom in general does not contribute to social well-being, 
illustrating the unique and powerful role of identification.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
177

 Higher identification means more time, energy, and financial 
resources invested through more frequent attendance at games 
and events, more money spent on the team, more frequent 
purchases of team merchandise and memorabilia, and higher 
rates of television and radio consumption. 
Fan Violence

 There is a dark side to fandom: fan violence. The National 
Association of Sports Officials reports two to three acts of 
parental violence at youth sporting events each week. What’s 
going on in a fan’s mind to engage in violent behaviors? 

 To answer this, researchers looked at soccer parents and their 
sideline rage and found that the angrier the parents became, 
the more aggressive their behaviors. What got them so angry, in 
psychological terms, was their ego defensiveness, or how anxious 
or sensitive they were to challenges and criticisms of their self-
worth, as experienced through identification with their child as if 
they as parents were playing. And it is a strong reaction—three 
times greater than the irritability you feel from daily hassles. 

Lecture 20  |  Fan Psychology, Identification, and Violence  
178

 A second contributor to anger is control orientation. When 
parents have an unconscious attitude of rules regarding how 
people should behave and the rules don’t go that way, ego 
defensiveness increases because of this perceived attack on 
their beliefs. 

 On the other hand, when parents endorse an autonomy 
orientation—when people regulate their behavior according to 
their personally chosen values—then it reduces ego defensiveness 
because everyone gets to choose their own. These orientations 
don’t directly affect anger, but through ego defensiveness, 
orientation can affect anger positively or negatively. 

 The practical application is, as a fan or parent, to choose your 
orientation. If you have a mindset where there are rules of 
behavior that need to be followed—the game should be fair, refs 
shouldn’t make mistakes, everybody should get equal playing 
time—then you are at greater risk of becoming irate when these 
things don’t happen. 

 But if you can adopt a perspective that is more focused on how 
you want to behave—where you actually have more control and 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
179
see both the sport you are watching and the actions of others as 
independent of you—then you are less likely be ego defensive.

 We see similar angry behaviors from non-parental fans, and the 
level of identification with the team seems to play a decisive role. 

 Identification is only one factor for violence. Another may be the 
demographics of who attends the games. Police intervention is 
often implicated as a reason for increases in fan violence. 

 Fan violence typically begins with random acts of violence 
directed at sports officials, coaches, and players and typically 
involves verbal assaults and throwing stuff. This can elevate to 
clashes between groups of fans, or between fans and security 
inside the stadium, and more verbal assaults and throwing things. 

 But this can now escalate to fights in the stands and pitch 
invasion, where anywhere from two to 300 people rush to the 
area occupied by opposing fans. Besides the risk of direct bodily 
harm from fighting, many can become trampled in the wave—
some of whom are innocent and just trying to flee or seeking 
help from the police. 

 The third stage of fan violence takes it outside the stadium to 
the bars, trains, busses, and streets around town. Speaking of 
bars, alcohol is often a significant factor in fan violence. 

 Spectators’ identification with a team, an athlete, or the nation 
they represent will mediate fans’ response to violence in sport. 
Although not a necessary condition for violence, heightened 
arousal generally increases the intensity and likelihood of 
aggression. 
Maximizing Fandom

 There is a body of research on maximizing, or seeking the 
optimal outcome. Maximizers seek more options in hopes of 

Lecture 20  |  Fan Psychology, Identification, and Violence  
180
getting the best outcome. This requires a greater investment 
of time and energy, and maximizers tend to use poor decision-
making strategies, such as relying too much on input from others 
to avoid this stress. 

 Maximizers often experience regret and dissatisfaction, maybe 
because with more options they are more aware of what they are 
giving up, even when they obtain the outcomes that by some 
objective measures are in fact the best. 

 In these ways, maximizers resemble highly identified sports 
fans, who also invest significant time, energy, and resources 
on the teams with which they identify. Like maximizers, the 
commitment of a highly identified fan carries significant 
emotional consequences: They suffer stress from the highs and 
lows of their teams’ successes and failures. 

 Maximizers try to get the optimal outcome in sport fandom, 
defined as identification with a historically successful team, in 
a different way than searching for the best job. Maximizers may 
drive far for more ice cream selections to get the best one, but 
they won’t take the same approach and follow more teams in 
hopes that one of them will win the championship this year. They 
won’t follow the best teams to maximize their chances, either. 

 Rather, maximizing seems to enhance the strength of identification 
with a team. This was seen in fans of unsuccessful teams. If the fan 
was a maximizer, he or she was more likely to be highly identified 
with the team than if he or she wasn’t a maximizer. Maximizers are 
not usually fair-weather fans. They may seek optimal outcomes; 
however, they do not always end up with them. 

 In fact, when maximizers follow teams that may not provide them 
with optimal outcomes in terms of performance, they identify 
even more strongly with those teams. Believing a team may not 
perform well actually causes maximizers to identify more strongly. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
181

 Maximizing may contribute to sport fan well-being by 
maintaining high levels of identification in the face of team 
adversity. People are happier when they win gambles with 
better-than-expected outcomes. The best fans may stick by the 
worst teams in anticipation of the glory of improbable victory.

LECTURE 21
Four Qualities of a 
Successful Team
T
he father of group dynamics, Kurt Lewin, 
identified the two processes in which all groups 
are certain to be involved: locomotion, which 
is the activities of a group that are directed toward 
the achievement of its goals, and maintenance, which 
consists of the activities directed toward keeping the 
group intact. To enhance teamwork, by improving 
both locomotion and maintenance in sport teams, four 
correlates of teamwork have been identified: cohesion, 
cooperation, role relationships, and leadership. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
183
Cohesion

 Cohesion is the measure of how much groups remain united 
through adversity, pushing forward together either to achieve 
team goals and/or sometimes for emotional benefit—a team 
that takes care of each other. 

 There are four things to recognize about cohesion. 
››
Cohesion is multidimensional. There are several factors that 
can cause a group to stick together. Not all factors are found in 
each group, so teams can have different reasons to stay united. 
››
Cohesion is dynamic. It can change over time. The team that’s 
together just to win a championship may grow closer over the 
season. 
››
Regardless, all groups come together for an instrumental 
purpose. It’s often to accomplish something, but even social 
groups have a social or emotional purpose and goal to be met. 
››
Note the affective, or emotional, dimension of cohesion. 
Bonding on any level is satisfying. We like to belong. Bonding is 
related to positive emotions, such as enjoyment, and exclusion 
can lead to negative emotions, such as depression and 
loneliness. 

 Looking at almost 10,000 athletes and more than 1,000 sport 
teams, researchers found a medium to large effect size in the 
cohesion-performance relationship. Maybe surprisingly, the 
relationship is even stronger in coactive sports, such as archery 
and sprinting, compared to interactive teams. 

 Cohesion has its risks and drawbacks. Athletes have cited time 
wasting and putting social goals before task goals as risks of 
high social cohesion. Another is social isolation, which is when 
a specific teammate isn’t as social by nature and feels left out. 
Similarly, high task cohesion has the potential disadvantages 
of some athletes feeling that the environment has become 
too serious or feeling increased pressure to conform, losing 
individuality, and not letting down teammates. 

Lecture 21  |  Four Qualities of a Successful Team  
184

 The relationship between cohesion and performance is very 
strong in female teams and greater than in male teams. A more 
cohesive team will facilitate winning in women, but the opposite 
tends to be true among men: Winning increases cohesion.

 The effect size is large in high school teams, moderate at the 
intercollegiate level, and smaller at the club and professional 
levels. The skill levels to succeed become progressively 
more difficult and necessary as you move from high school 
to professional levels, meaning that cohesion has a relatively 
smaller effect on performance.

 Team building exercises are probably the most common way to 
build cohesion, typically with specific goals to help the group 
increase effectiveness, satisfy the needs of its members, or 
improve working conditions. Team building works best when 
it centers around at least one of these four elements: goal 
setting, problem solving, interpersonal relationships, and role 
development. 

 Team building can improve the group environment, structure, or 
process. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
185
››
If you want to address the distinctiveness of the group and 
help members feel like they’re part of a real team, creating a 
group logo or getting similar haircuts can do that. Traveling 
on a team bus to games or training in the off-season as a 
group improves togetherness. These address the group 
environment. 
››
To affect group structure, target role clarity and acceptance 
with coach-athlete meetings. Encourage members to buy into 
team norms, such as making a point to encourage each other 
after a mistake. Address team leadership. 
››
To enhance group process, exercises should address the 
importance of individual sacrifices for the sake of the team. 
And let members have input into group goal setting. 
Cooperation

 Team-building 
exercises 
can 
also 
target 
cooperation, 
where success can only be had through working together. 
Cooperative teamwork is best and essential for complex 
and interdependent tasks or games, such as basketball and 
volleyball. This is in contrast to competitive tasks, which have 
their role even within a team. 

 In general, competition is best for simple reaction-time and 
independent tasks, such as archery and sprinting. Competition 
tends to be associated with self-centeredness and can, at times, 
lower players’ self-concept when compared to practice in more 
cooperative environments.

 Cooperation will often require a player to emphasize the team 
above him- or herself. This is essential for effective teamwork 
because of how dependent you are on others to do their jobs. 

 To enhance cooperation, each individual has to buy in to the 
goals and values of the team. A great way to do this is by creating 
a preseason contract, in which you discuss what characteristics 
are most important to the team, what it takes to win, and what 

Lecture 21  |  Four Qualities of a Successful Team  
186
type of team culture players want to have. You generate ideas 
and then summarize them into themes. Try to narrow it all down 
to about five critical values and then specifically define the 
behaviors that would demonstrate each. 

 You write down these behaviors, everybody agrees and signs the 
contract, and it gets posted in the locker room or practice facility 
as a reminder for what players have committed themselves to 
doing all season, because team building is most effective when 
it’s ongoing. Coaches can refer back to it, and they don’t feel 
nagged because it was players’ ideas, and they signed the 
agreement. Teammates have permission to challenge each 
other because they’re working together cooperatively to create 
this kind of environment. 
Role Relationships

 Every player on every team has a role to play, and clearly defining 
that role is essential for a coach. Understanding and accepting 
that role as defined is critical for a player to contribute to team 
success. 

 More specifically, an athlete needs to understand the scope of 
his or her responsibilities, what behaviors are required to execute 
these responsibilities, how he or she will be evaluated regarding 
his or her role performance, and what the consequences are if 
he or she fails to fulfill these responsibilities both personally and 
in regards to the team goal. 

 When a player’s role is ambiguous, it can be stressful to the 
athlete, who will end up wasting time putting effort and energy 
in a direction that’s not needed or even counterproductive. The 
athlete’s satisfaction decreases while anxiety increases. There is 
reduced cohesion with others on a task because of the confusion 
and increased role conflict as athletes step on each other’s toes. 
Ultimately, you get inferior performance. You have to know what 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
187
your job is specifically, accept it, and execute it for a team to be 
successful in sport.

 Role efficacy refers to team members’ beliefs about their 
capabilities to successfully carry out their role duties. Mastery 
experiences are the biggest contributors to self-efficacy, or a 
person’s belief that he or she can execute a specific action to 
achieve a specific result. When performers try something new and 
get positive feedback that they have been successful, it develops 
confidence that they can play the role needed by the team. 

 Team success may come at the direct cost of personal 
development. This is a great example of the real-life challenge 
many athletes face. At least knowing what your role is, however 
limited, and accepting it helps the team. It also helps the 
individual perform in that role. 

 When role clarity is high, we find a moderately strong positive 
relationship between role efficacy and role performance, 
meaning that when one increases, so does the other. But under 
conditions of role ambiguity, there was no relationship. If you 
don’t know what you are supposed to be doing, your confidence 
and performance are going to be unrelated. 

Lecture 21  |  Four Qualities of a Successful Team  
188

 This highlights the importance of clearly defining roles so that 
you can understand what needs to be done. Then, you can 
determine if you are playing the right role, have confidence 
in your ability to execute your job as defined, and ultimately 
improve your likelihood of success. 
Leadership

 An initial look at the research of leadership in sport finds that 
some of the models have conflicting or inconsistent theories 
behind them. Hard leadership styles, where coaches are more 
autocratic in their decision making, are a more demanding and 
directing approach. Athletes have on many occasions preferred 
this style. It’s oriented more toward individual and team 
performance excellence. 

 The autonomy-supportive leadership style emphasizes creating 
and fostering a task-focused climate. This soft style of leadership 
seeks to cultivate a sense of independence and competence in 
the individual, which in turn fosters a sense of well-being and 
intrinsic motivation to train, compete, and stay involved. 

 The best way to look at this isn’t as an either-or situation. Both 
styles have their merits, and being exclusively one or the other 
probably wouldn’t work well in any setting, so a coaching style 
that integrates the two is preferred. 

 Teams that are more social and recreational, and even 
developmental at younger ages, may be thought of as having 
an emphasis on the pursuit of pleasure rather than focusing 
on winning. With an emphasis on deliberate play—where the 
activity is done for its own sake, is enjoyable, is flexible, and 
occurs without adult supervision—more autonomy-supportive 
behaviors by the leader are encouraged. 

 Deliberate play is a precondition for individuals to be continually 
involved in an activity and gain experience that could lead to 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
189
mastery over time. But as the pursuit of excellence becomes 
the greater focus, and more deliberate practice is engaged, a 
greater percentage of commanding-demanding behaviors from 
the leader may be more beneficial. 

 Eleven leader behaviors have been identified as essential 
in the pursuit of excellence: Leaders create vision, stimulate 
intellectually, pay individualized and supportive attention to 
each member, give personalized recognition, are demanding, 
build both self-efficacy and self-esteem, guide training, 
emphasize winning, cultivate self-interest, encourage rivalry 
within the team, and instill both a task and an ego orientation. 

 Transformational leadership theory guides what behaviors we 
want to see in our leaders across four dimensions: 
1.	 Idealized influence: This is where the leader is a role model, 
leading through a demonstration of personally held values and 
beliefs.
2.	 Inspirational motivation: These leaders are optimistic about 
what others can achieve. They set high but achievable goals 
and instill a sense of confidence in their followers. 

Lecture 21  |  Four Qualities of a Successful Team  
190
3.	 Intellectual stimulation: This involves getting others to think 
about old problems in new ways and encouraging them to think 
for themselves.
4.	 Individualized consideration: This involves recognizing individual 
needs and abilities, taking a genuine interest in the team, and 
displaying a sense of care, concern, and compassion. 

 This leadership style affects how individuals think about 
themselves. It influences their confidence, intrinsic motivation, 
and emotional responses. And ultimately, all of these things 
influence the performer’s ability to excel. 

 Jeff Janssen created the Team Captain’s Leadership Model, which 
contains many elements from transformational leadership theory. 
It starts with leading by example, which is idealized influence. The 
basic premise is that if you can’t lead yourself, then you can’t lead 
anybody else. And you lead by example in four ways: through 
commitment, confidence, composure, and character. 

 It is only after you lead by example that an athlete can become 
a vocal leader. Then, 75 percent of the time, your role as vocal 
leader is to be an encourager. 

 Do this by being a servant leader. Make the team the priority 
and team success over personal success. Do the grunt work. 
Check in on others and see how they are and what they need. 
Listen well. Help where you can. 

 Be sure that your words build confidence. Catch team members 
doing something right and reinforce it. Celebrate success. Tell 
players that you believe in them.

 Help them refocus. Do it gently but directly. Don’t scold; be 
on their side about it. You want the same things. Remind them 
to focus on what’s important now. It is under adversity when 
leadership is most needed to help athletes refocus on what is 
essential for success.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
191

 Be a team builder. Keep the team goals in front and visible. 
Remind the team who they are and why they’re doing this. Help 
teammates accept their role by valuing it yourself and telling 
them. Encourage teammates to bond outside of sport and 
develop positive personal relationships. 

 If a leader is doing all of that, he or she will be more effective 
and there will be less of a need to be an enforcer. Still, about 
25 percent of your duty will be as an enforcer, as no team goes 
without conflict or needing accountability.

Questions to Consider
1.	 How would you encourage an athlete who is not happy 
with his or her playing time from the perspective of each 
correlate of teamwork: cohesion, cooperation, leadership, 
and role relationships?
2.	 Why is leading by example not enough? Why do people 
tend to embrace the enforcer role of leadership too much?

LECTURE 22
Talent: A 
Developmental 
Process
T
alent is a developmental process, not a genetic 
gift. It can’t be developed unless it is recognized 
and nurtured by parents, teachers, and coaches. 
Discipline over a long period of time is necessary. 
The motivation to do this is greatly enhanced by the 
support and encouragement of those in the field and 
family members. The vast majority of athletes do not 
make it to the top. In this lecture, you will learn how 
to help athletes develop to be their best, regardless of 
how far it takes them.

Talent Development Models 

 When we look to develop kids athletically, a talent identification 
model is typically used. This is where a skills-based approach is 
used to evaluate talent in a youth sport league. The less skilled 
children are gradually weeded out through competition and by 
investing in the better players. The idea is to give more coaching 
and playing time to those kids who show promise. 

 But there are many problems with this model. First, some of these 
young kids get into an early training model that is inconsistent 
with a child’s motivation to play sports. Remember, these are 
kids. Kids like to play and have fun. Modeling an adult athletic 
training program often doesn’t fit developmentally, and the 
kids—even the really talented ones—may not have the maturity 
or interest to commit themselves in such a serious and intensive 
manner. These kids risk greater injury, burnout, and dropout.

 But there’s even a question about whether you’ve identified the 
most talented athletes this way. Many of these talented kids 
haven’t even hit puberty yet. Their bodies are going to change 
significantly. The size or speed that is used to distinguish adult 
athletes may not become apparent until adolescence. 

 And there’s no guarantee that a particular attribute that 
separates a child-athlete from his or her peers will still 
distinguish that child when he or she becomes an adult athlete, 
particularly if it’s size or strength. By weeding these supposedly 
less talented kids out early, late-maturing athletes could be 
lost, and both the athlete and the sport system would suffer a 
shameful loss of opportunity. 

 Identifying sport talent is unreliable, especially before puberty.

 There are limited spots at the top, and lesser athletes get 
dropped the higher you go, whether in Olympic or professional 
sports. This pyramid approach to sport development assumes 
that earlier and increased training in childhood will provide a 

Lecture 22  | Talent: A Developmental Process  
194
performance advantage to children who are chosen for select 
teams and will eventually increase their chances to climb to the 
top in adult sports. The focus is on the short-term performance 
outcome for a limited number of kids. But where does that 
leave the other 99 percent?

 Soccer in England, baseball and basketball in the United 
States, and ice hockey in Canada have a large base of youth 
participation. They can more easily get away with eliminating 
potentially talented kids early because there is always another 
talented kid to take his or her place. 

 But this excludes a very large number of children from the 
opportunity to develop into elite-level athletes, and it reduces 
the pool from which elite athletes develop in at an early age. This 
hurts the sport in the long run, and it hurts potentially talented 
athletes. It favors the kid who develops early, not necessarily the 
eventually most talented young adult. 

 Many of these elite youth sport programs downplay the costs 
of this early talent selection because there are so many other 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
195
kids ready to try and take the place of kids who burn out or get 
injured and quit. Emphasis remains on the top performers, and 
the rest are all but forgotten. 

 It takes time to develop, and an early start isn’t the only way, 
especially when you consider the risks. And the pyramid approach 
is, at best, unreliable. In fact, childhood sport performance is 
actually a poor predictor of adult performance. There are too 
many other variables to consider. 

 A better talent development model focuses on retaining 
athletes by providing equipment, space, and playing and 
training opportunities for a large number of children. This offers 
the chance to select the best athletes from among a much larger 
pool of motivated adolescents. The most important purpose 
of childhood sports, then, is to attract and motivate children 
to stay involved so that they can choose either a recreational or 
elite pathway at the appropriate developmental age of about 13. 

 This approach is consistent with a true developmental 
perspective that defines talent not as something that just is or 
isn’t there, but as the truly multidimensional, difficult-to-assess-
at-childhood construct that it is. For talent to come to fruition, 
input from a host of personal and social variables over a long 
period of time is required.
Developmental Activities in Youth Sport

 Developmental activities in youth sport can be examined across 
two axes: how much the activity is led by adults versus children 
and how intrinsically rewarding the activity is versus instrumental 
in developing skills. This results in four kinds of activities:
1.	 Deliberate play is where athletes experience sport through 
fun and playful games. Its reward is intrinsic; it provides 
immediate gratification, maximizing enjoyment. An example 
is street hockey. It is led by children, often modified from the 
standardized rules, and is low pressure. It encourages kids to 

Lecture 22  | Talent: A Developmental Process  
196
be creative and experiment with new skills they might be afraid 
to attempt under the critical eye of a coach or parent. Social 
skills develop as kids are left on their own to negotiate rules of 
fairness and resolve conflict. There is often a mix of ages and 
skill levels, creating a host of opportunities to test skills and 
learn from more mature players or deal with the adversity of 
competing and getting beat by someone bigger and stronger.
2.	 Spontaneous practice has the extrinsic or practical value of 
improving sport skills but is still led by kids. An example is 
when two athletes use their free time to practice their jump 
shots on their own. They don’t follow an adult-specified 
curriculum, and they may not be targeting the skills they 
most need to improve. The value is the ownership a kid takes 
over his or her skill development, and the practice pays off in 
performance improvement. 
3.	 Deliberate practice is led by adults and dominates most 
organized sport leagues. Kids are often divided by skill level or 
age to structure and control the instruction, keeping the learning 
focused on the specific demands of the sport. This requires 
effort, generates no immediate rewards, and is motivated by 
the goal of improving performance in the future rather than 
enjoyment in the present. Drills are run at practice by a coach, 
and feedback is given to a young athlete. It is essential for 
development of expertise, but there is debate about how early 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
197
this is needed. Are the benefits of this structured environment 
more valuable at this stage than the benefits of deliberate play?
4.	 Play practice is where adults lead the fun and games in 
a structured practice environment. Coaches often use 
this incentive to play at the end of practice if the kids pay 
attention and get through the necessary drills, but that’s the 
wrong attitude. Adults want to emphasize training, but this 
play practice has great value. It keeps kids motivated while 
developing sport skills. 
The Developmental Model of Sport Participation

 The most prominent conceptualization of athletic development is 
the Developmental Model of Sport Participation, and it consists 
of seven basic assumptions that have stood up to scientific 
scrutiny. These postulates not only promote the development 
of expertise, but also the physical health and psychosocial 
development for all children involved in youth sport. 

 Unlike the pyramid approach, this model does not support elite 
programs or the early selection of talent during childhood. It 
features the interaction of variables at all levels.
1.	 Early diversification does not hurt elite sport participation in 
sports where peak performance is reached after maturation. 
2.	 Sampling, or trying out a bunch of sports and activities, is 
linked to a longer sports career and has positive implications 
for long-term sport involvement.
3.	 Early diversification allows participation in a range of settings 
that most favorably affect positive youth development. 
4.	 A lot of deliberate play during the sampling years builds a 
solid foundation of intrinsic motivation. It does this through 
involvement in activities that are enjoyable and promote self-
management. 
5.	 A lot of deliberate play during the sampling years establishes 
a wide range of motor and cognitive experiences that children 
can ultimately bring to their main sport of interest. Deliberate 
play builds a solid foundation of generalizable skills.

Lecture 22  | Talent: A Developmental Process  
198
6.	 Around the end of primary school, about age 13, children 
should have the opportunity to either choose to specialize 
in their favorite sport or continue in sport at a recreational 
level. The primary goals of recreation are an extension of the 
sampling years, with an emphasis on enjoyment and health. 
They can involve deliberate play and deliberate practice. But 
if specialization is desired, then more time is dedicated to the 
chosen activities. 
7.	 By late adolescence, around age 16, kids have developed the 
physical, social, cognitive, emotional, and motor skills needed to 
invest their efforts into highly specialized training in one sport. 

 The sampling pathway is less direct than early specialization but 
offers a potentially wider range of positive outcomes. There is 
a trade-off. Early specialization and the extra hours of practice 
yield results, and great results for a limited number of kids. Before 
choosing which path to go down, coaches, parents, and athletes 
are encouraged to weigh the potential health, psychological, 
social, and motor benefits and risks of early sampling or early 
specialization. 
Recommendations for Athletic Development

 Be careful about cutting kids from competitive sport programs. 
They may mature late and lose the opportunity to be a high-
level performer, which hurts them, and the sport program, in the 
long run. Provide the opportunity for all kids ages 12 and below 
to participate and develop, making adjustments when needed. 

 Discourage specialization in one sport until mid-adolescence, 
unless early specialization is required by the nature of the sport. 

 All kids should be taught the skills for all positions. Growth spurts 
and puberty can dramatically change kids’ bodies, attitudes, 
and aggression. You won’t know what position the athlete will 
be best suited for until growing and development are complete.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
199

 Activities for ages 2 to 10 should focus on the development 
of fundamental movement and manipulative skills. The risk of 
early specialization is that only the skills specific to that sport 
get developed, limiting their development and opportunities in 
other sports or activities later on.

 From a psychological perspective, provide younger children, ages 
4 to 7, with frequent positive feedback. Self-worth is based on 
perceptions of competence in multiple areas, and this feedback is 
critical. Complement simple task accomplishments and personal 
effort. 

 At ages 7 to 12, emphasize mastery efforts and how the young 
athlete learned and developed over time through hard work and 
persistence. 

 Avoid peer comparisons. Everyone has different advantages or 
disadvantages that have nothing to do with anyone other than 
the athlete him- or herself. So, from ages 7 through adolescence, 
increase the use of self-comparison techniques to evaluate 
personal competence. This will help buffer against a whole host of 
problems, such as performance anxiety and fear of failure, later on. 

 Value the role of every player on the team. Be sure to let each 
player know how he or she contributes by defining his or her role 
and reinforcing its importance. 

Lecture 22  | Talent: A Developmental Process  
200

 Kids develop best in a positive and encouraging environment 
that supports autonomy and growth. Remember this when the 
desire to win or an overemphasis on outcomes dominates. 

 Competition doesn’t become enjoyable until the end of this 
sampling stage, so be careful about emphasizing it too early. 
You can have competitive challenges during deliberate play 
activities, but emphasize mastery of skills over outcome and 
peer comparisons. 

 Once an athlete reaches the specialization years, don’t focus 
exclusively on intense levels of training. Balance deliberate play 
and deliberate practice. 

 Teach athletes to view mistakes as being a necessary and 
essential part of the learning and developmental process. The 
fear of making mistakes is crippling, and coaches or parents 
who get angry or criticize and show frustration when mistakes 
are made create an unsafe environment for learning. If you want 
your athlete to develop, he or she has to have a healthy attitude 
toward mistakes. Start developing this early.

Questions to Consider
1.	 In lecture 2, an early start was identified as an important 
factor in the development of expertise. How does 
that conflict with the goal of the sampling years in the 
Developmental Model of Sport Participation? Can they 
coexist? At what cost?
2.	 Think about the growing specialization of youth sport today. 
What are the benefits and costs? Do you support keeping 
things the way they are? Why? If not, what would you 
change, and why?

n this lecture, you will learn how to help your 
child grow and develop into a successful achiever, 
whether that is in sport, art, music, or life. You will 
learn that everything you say and do matters—and 
that everything you don’t say or do matters. At the 
foundation of good sport parenting is the unconditional 
love and support throughout the process of raising an 
independent young adult. Let all your decisions come 
from this attitude to guide your words and behaviors.

Mistakes Sport Parents Make

 The biggest mistake sport parents make is what they say on the 
car ride home. This may be what kids hate most about youth 
sport. After a tough loss, they’re not interested in your opinion 
of how they could have hustled more or technical instruction on 
their batting swing. 

 Give your kids time. Let them sulk if they want to. They don’t 
need emotional correction at this time, either. In general, being 
upset is appropriate. You don’t have to fix them. In fact, trying to 
fix them can invalidate their feelings and make it worse. Sit with 
them in their pain. You can talk about the game when they want 
to talk about it. If you have to talk, at least ask them when. Let 
them own it.

 To show unconditional love, treat your kids the same after wins 
and losses. Otherwise, you are going to teach them that your 
love and mood are dependent on the outcome—an outcome 
they can’t control. That creates too much unnecessary pressure. 

 Something that drives student-athletes crazy is when their 
parents yell at the referees. Referees are doing the best they 
can. They have professional integrity and make human mistakes, 
or they’re 16-year-olds getting paid 10 dollars a game. Taking 
your abuse is not part of the job description. But the child-
athletes recognize this better than the parents. They feel bad for 
the referees. They understand that they are doing their best, the 
same way the athletes are trying. Your yelling embarrasses them 
and sets a bad example.

 Another thing that bothers student-athletes is when their 
parents engage in sideline coaching. You are probably only 
trying to help, but you’re not the coach. When you coach from 
the sideline, you might undermine the coach or confuse the 
child about what to do. Don’t put your child in the position to 
have to choose between listening to the coach or you.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
203

 Give the kids space to think. Sport performance goes far 
beyond just the physical skills. When kids are playing, they 
are also learning how to think and focus, seeing the field, and 
working on the technical and tactical aspects of the game. It 
doesn’t help to yell at them to do the obvious, such as “run” or 
“catch the ball.” 

 Concentration is a mental skill athletes are trying to develop, 
and if you are going to be shouting instructions, it’s going to 
make it difficult for them to focus. Their attention is going to be 
divided, and that’s going to lead to more mistakes. 

­Lectur e 2  |  How to Be a Great Sport Parent  
204

 Here is a script based on the psychological research of the best 
things a parent can say to encourage a young performer:
››
Before a competition: Have fun. Play hard. I love you. 
››
After a competition: Did you have fun? I’m proud of you. I 
love you. 

 These statements can be broken down into one: I love to watch 
you play. Notice the unconditional love, complete acceptance 
of the child, and lack of pressure or attention to performance. 
Kids already know that they play sports to win. They know to 
avoid mistakes. What they need to know is that you love them 
no matter what.
Parents and the Development of Elite Talent

 Many children who become experts have already had hundreds 
of hours of deliberate play and practice before the age of eight. 
So, parents have tremendous influence on the child’s social and 
sport development experiences. The roles, beliefs, values, skills, 
and behavior of the family create a psychosocial context in which 
the child develops, greatly influencing the outcome. 

 In the early or sampling years, parents introduce the child to a 
variety of activities, with the emphasis on play and fun. At this 
stage, parents value the activity and communicate this to the 
child. Looking at interviews with world-class performers in sport, 
music, art, math, and science, researchers found that these 
parents tried to ensure higher-quality coaching and supported 
the coach in creating a learning climate with process-oriented 
training and an absence of competitive pressure on the child. 
Parents believe their child may have a gift and begin to invest in it.

 Competence is an essential ingredient in motivation, so the 
acknowledgement of improvement and achievement after hard 
work is critical in a young athlete’s development. Parents can 
negatively affect motivation by getting angry or using rewards 
to try to control behavior. Parents can also hurt development 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
205
by only providing rewards based on results; instead, reward 
behaviors they can execute to give them the best shot at winning. 

 The transition period that takes place in the middle years, from 
ages 12 or 13 to about 15, is characterized by a shift to greater sport 
specialization and higher levels of training and competition—up 
to about 12 to 19 hours per week over 75 percent of the year. 

 Parents increase their support, accepting and adjusting to 
the greater demands of the increasingly challenging sport 
environment. The teen’s investment and pressure increases, and 
so does the parents’. The parents make sacrifices, giving up other 
social opportunities, providing transportation, and providing 
financial support—all while continuing to be a good role model 
under more challenging situations. 

 With greater investment and disappointment, the emotional 
regulations of dealing with playing time, injury, perceived 
fairness, and coach-athlete relationships increase. Parents of 
talented athletes become more proactively involved with their 
child’s sport. 

 This is when kids start to become more autonomous in their 
training and sport progression. Remember, you aren’t the 
coach. You’re not responsible for your child’s performance. The 
developing athlete relies more and more on feedback from 
perceived experts, such as coaches and peers. Parents are not 
seen as the best source for competence-based information or 
feedback anymore. 

 Parents model the role of close, proactive guardians within the 
support team. As part of this, parents may shift family activities 
to center on the talented athlete’s training and competition 
schedule, which can affect siblings. This family focus can be 
central to an athlete’s success.

­Lectur e 2  |  How to Be a Great Sport Parent  
206

 School is still valued at this point, encouraging balance within 
sport achievement. Older siblings will often serve as role models 
for work ethic at this stage, in either direction. 

 The intensity of demands increases significantly at this stage. 
Know what you’re getting into. Interviews with tennis and 
soccer parents at this stage identified a few specific challenges: 
conflicts between their role in tennis support and their real jobs, 
lack of family and partner time, organizational and administrative 
roles, and the financial impact. 

 Then there’s the stress of watching competitions, dealing with 
the emotions of the results, and interacting with the other sport 
parents. There are also challenges you have to face and overcome 
trying to ensure your child’s best interest while everyone else is 
doing the same for their kids, often creating competition and 
conflict between parents. Athletes during this stage do best 
when supported by parents who show more directive behavior 
with situational advice and emotional support.

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
207

 Unfortunately, it seems that negative behaviors are also more 
prominent during this stage. Too much pressure, too much 
involvement, poor emotional reactions to outcomes, and 
embarrassing behaviors show up here. And athletes complain 
of too much sport talk, a restricted social life, and parental 
approval tied to results. 

 You can ask kids at a young age about what they want, what 
works, what makes them feel supported, and what makes them 
feel bad, and they’ll tell you. Parents and kids should ask each 
other what they want and listen to the responses. Your child-
athlete is the expert on what he or she needs. Partner with your 
child to find the best way to support him or her.

 The athlete continues to grow, and in the later years of mastery and 
investment, ages 15 through 18, the athlete is probably training 19 
to 22 hours per week. He or she is moving from elite junior to elite 
senior performance and working toward professional status. As 
the athlete grows and continues to become more independent, 
the parent role is mostly emotional support. 

 Home becomes a refuge from the ups and downs of athletic 
life. Parents become unconditional providers of social support, 
a valuable but often underappreciated role. But parents are 
the only ones who can do this because everyone else has some 
investment in the child’s performance. The disappointments 
and setbacks can be more emotionally intense, requiring even 
more parental emotional support. 

 In some cases, tangible support can be increased, too. 
Sacrifices to ensure optimal training conditions may be greater, 
such as travel for elite coaching or relocating the family. And 
then parents have to navigate the strained relationships with 
siblings who may be jealous of the achievements and differential 
behavior toward the elite athlete.

208
The Best Sport Parenting Practices

 For children at any age and any level, the best sport parenting 
practices consist of three specifically defined behaviors. These 
roles are unique to parents, and while they may not be as fun or 
exciting as sideline coaching and feeling like you’re truly part of 
the team, they are roles that only you as a sport parent can play. 
And they are important. 
1.	 Parents are providers of a young athlete’s sport experience. 
In the early years, this translates to introducing kids to various 
sports, supporting them financially and logistically, and giving 
them informational support in training and competition. Often, 
this translates to the more challenging role as the provider of 
emotional support, admiration, and reinforcement of positive 
behaviors. 
2.	 Parents serve as interpreters of their child’s sport 
experience. What you believe in as a parent—the priorities 
you set and what you value—gets transmitted to your kids. 
If you think their talent is a natural gift or product of hard 
work, this will influence their motivation, how they respond 
to adversity, and what they think about themselves. Parental 
values regarding the benefits of competitive sport and the 
necessary psychological characteristics for improving can 
fast-track a young athlete’s development and positive coping 
responses. Negative beliefs, doubts, and criticisms do the 
opposite. 
3.	 Parents are role models. Kids are always watching and 
listening. They see how you talk about coaches and how you 
respond to your mistakes as well as theirs. Be what you want 
them to be, in and out of sport. Demonstrate work ethic by 
training for your own road race, setting and committing to 
training goals. Be calm when watching sports and respect 
the referees and coaches. Be honest in all things. Model 
sportsmanship and don’t cheer when opponents made an 
error; compliment good plays on both sides. Let kids solve 
adversity themselves; ask their opinion of challenging situations 
to develop their sense of competence and independence.

Age-Related Decline

 We don’t need science to tell us that we slow down as we get 
older. Our speed, strength, dexterity, and memory inevitably 
decline. While we can’t deny that aging effects are real, a study 
of masters athletes gives us clues on how to keep performing at 
a high level as life goes on. 

 The older we get, the faster we decline in sport performance. The 
decline is generally greater for females; for longer, endurance 
events within any sport compared to shorter-distance events; 
and for events that require greater peak power. 

 Performance in tasks that demand motor accuracy over maximal 
power tend to peak at later ages and are more likely to be 
retained longer. Tasks that rely on experience, knowledge, and 
strategy are more likely to be retained than physiological and 
power tasks. 

 Interestingly, research shows that age-related decline is 
consistently greater with cross-sectional data than with 
longitudinal data, meaning that when we compare age groups 
at a point in time, the differences between ages is greater than if 
we follow a specific group of athletes over a long period. This is 
because continued training slows decline. So, it may be that over 
time, increased access to coaching and increased availability of 
older-age competitive programs could be the reason for this 
difference as more opportunities to train and participate arise. 

 For the nonathletic population, there’s about a two percent 
decline in performance per year. But by comparison, sport 
performance declines at only half of a percent per year from age 
35 to 70. This was based on cross-sectional data from archived 
masters’ records. Longitudinal studies suggest much less than 
half of a percent for continuously involved aging athletes. 

 It seems that continued involvement is the key. Masters athletes 
continue to train specifically for, and compete in, their chosen 

Lecture 24  |  Aging Athletes: Competing and Retiring  
212
sports well beyond the typical age of peak performance. Many 
remain quite competitive even when compared to their younger 
peers. The age of masters sports typically begins around 35, 
although this varies by sport. Seniors are athletes older than 55. 

 There are a few ways in which these athletes retain their skills.
››
The compensatory explanation suggests that it’s possible to 
maintain performance through increased reliance on other 
aspects of functioning that have been improved. When you 
lose it in one area, you make up for it in another. An aging 
tennis player may choose to focus exclusively on tennis and 
give up other sports and activities to stay sharp and may use 
an oversized racquet to optimize her chances for success. 
››
Selective maintenance is similar to compensation in that 
insufficient practice is believed to be a significant contributor 
to age-related decline. To maintain high levels of performance, 
individuals must maintain the right amount of deliberate 
practice, which is the intentional and very specific practice 
of skill development, consistently identifying what could be 
better and working toward that goal with consistent feedback. 
Unlike compensation, which introduces new skills to offset 
declines in other areas, selective maintenance claims that older 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
213
experts will continue to use intense deliberate practice in the 
same way as younger experts. This works best when they keep 
up the specificity, intensity, and volume of practice as they age, 
while their peers tend to decline in these ways. 

 Average training amounts typically decline during each stage of 
life, even among the elite. But older competitors remain highly 
involved. One study of senior Olympians reported 54 minutes of 
aerobic training four times per week and 14 minutes of anaerobic 
training twice per week. 

 You can’t just throw yourself into this intense training at a later 
age and expect to catch up to these athletes. It’s ideal to get 
thousands of hours of practice early on to reach a high level and 
then maintain continuous involvement and deliberate practice 
to slow decline. 

 But while such practice is very specific, there is something to be 
said for less specific activity, such as cross-training, to prevent 
wear and tear, to stay active when seasonal barriers interrupt 
training, and to keep motivation high by avoiding boredom or 
burnout. Then, there is the transfer of fitness and skills from one 
activity to the other. 

 Athletes 
stay 
committed 
across 
the 
lifespan 
through 
achievement goals. Masters athletes tend to structure their 
training around one or two major annual competitions that they 
consider to be very important. They also tend to be more task 
oriented than ego oriented, meaning that they tend to focus 
more on beating their own times than beating others, and feel 
more control over doing so. But this doesn’t mean that they 
don’t care about winning. 

 To succeed, you have to commit, even when you don’t feel like 
it. And athletes at all levels will commit in either a functional 
or obligatory way. Functional commitment is a “want to” 
commitment based on choice. Obligatory commitment is a “have 
to” commitment. 

Lecture 24  |  Aging Athletes: Competing and Retiring  
214

 While one certainly seems more positive than the other, they 
both play a role in keeping older athletes engaged. Research 
shows that masters athletes have high levels of functional 
commitment and moderate to low levels of obligatory 
commitment. This is good because functional commitment 
tends to be healthier, more adaptive, and more likely to be 
positively related to determined training and participation. 

 Why would anyone “have to” play at this stage of their life? 
There are just some aspects of sport that can’t be replicated 
elsewhere—for example, head-to-head competition. So, if you 
want to continue to have such experiences, you have to continue 
in sport.

 Sport enjoyment and satisfaction are consistently the strongest 
predictors of functional commitment across masters sports. In a 
study of senior Olympians, enjoyment was the only predictor of 
functional commitment in participants older than 65. A sense of 
personal investment, the expectation of enjoying and having the 
opportunity to participate in sport, and the lack of alternative 
activities contributed to a lesser extent. 

 Social 
support 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
increase 
functional 
commitment. But a lack of social support is associated with a 
higher level of obligatory commitment. Even more, the high 
expectations and pressure from significant others, called social 
constraints, most strongly predict this “have to” commitment. 

 When an athlete has greater functional commitment, he or she 
will put greater amounts of time, energy, and effort into sport, 
particularly, as one study found, as masters swimmers get older. 
But there was another age difference: Expectations and pressure 
from significant others was related to decreased resolve among 
younger masters but increased resolve to continue sport among 
older masters. 

 Social factors are the final area that influence masters sport 
involvement. About half of masters athletes have been 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
215
continuously involved with their sport since they were young. 
Sport becomes a part of their identity, recognized by others for 
what they do and achieve in sport. So, as they get older, staying 
involved in masters sports maintains this identity through the 
lifespan. 
The Retirement Process

 We would expect that the retirement process would be most 
difficult for student-athletes or professional athletes who have 
most strongly and exclusively based their identity on athletic 
performance. Other challenging scenarios would be if there is 
a large gap between what they aspired to be and their actual 
ability forcing an exit from sport, or if they have little experience 
with these kinds of role transitions, poor emotional coping skills, 
or limited social or material resource support. 

 Athletes who are forced out of their sport before they want to be 
usually face the most challenges. Some can no longer make the 
cut because of age or injury. Others, even if still young and healthy, 
get to a point where their skills are not at the level they need to 
be to make the team. This deselection is the most frequent cause 

Lecture 24  |  Aging Athletes: Competing and Retiring  
216
of involuntary withdrawal from sport. Ironically, these are often 
the athletes who are least prepared for the transition. 

 If they are borderline athletes, they will likely have increased their 
training in a desperate hope to make the team, pushing back 
education or career planning even further into the background. 
It leaves them without a developed plan B when they’re cut. 

 As a result, the athletes most vulnerable to deselection can be 
the most unprepared to cope with the end of their sport career. 
If their dreams haven’t been fulfilled before they exit, some 
athletes will question if all the time, effort, sacrifice, and struggle 
was worth it. For some, it can get so bad that they become bitter 
and disown their entire sport experience.

 A career-ending injury is unpredictable, comes as a sudden 
surprise and derails all plans, and is completely out of a person’s 
control. And of all these factors are associated with increased 
levels of anxiety and stress. In fact, career-ending injuries have 
been shown to be the most difficult reason for exit from sport 
to manage and can lead to the most severe reactions, leading to 
the most dissatisfaction with life after a sports career. 

The Psychology of Performance: How to Be Your Best in Life
217

 As athletes realize they can’t duplicate the elite athlete 
experience, they can understandably feel sad and a sense of 
loss. Some relocate. For the ones who do, once separated from 
the frequent and structured time with coaches and teammates, 
loneliness and boredom often set in.

 Athletes who freely choose to retire usually have the easiest 
transition. When they do so in their own time, they typically are 
of the appropriate age, have achieved most of their sport goals, 
and have prepared for and planned what they will do next. 

 This planning is critical to success, yet most athletes don’t plan for 
their retirement or life after sport. Then, when they are inevitably 
faced with it, they are left feeling a sense of emptiness and have 
difficulty taking the first steps into exploring their next career. 

 These athletes are years behind their peers in establishing 
themselves in the workplace. They often have a limited sense 
of their values, needs, non-sport interests, and skills outside of 
sport. The sporting world is different from real life, so it makes 
sense that those athletes who do take the initiative and plan for 
retirement have been shown to adapt to the transition more 
quickly and report greater life satisfaction.

 In sports, particularly elite sport, athletes specialize. They 
narrow their interests and focus most of their attention and 
energy on sport. It takes a tremendous amount of dedication, 
commitment, and time to perfect techniques and win. 

 This often comes at the price of personal and career development. 
And if the strength and exclusivity of sport specialization at a 
young age becomes too great, athletes can fail at developing 
other aspects of their identity during their teen years. 

 The primary developmental task of late adolescence and early 
adulthood is to explore different occupational alternatives, 
ideological beliefs, and potential life roles to gain the experiences 

Lecture 24  |  Aging Athletes: Competing and Retiring  
218
necessary to develop a personal identity—and hopefully one 
that is well rounded. 

 But to be elite, this is often sacrificed. The time commitment 
and both physical and psychological demands prevent this 
healthy exploration. As a result, the strength and exclusivity of an 
athletic identity has some negative consequences when athletes 
disengage from sport because of retirement, injury, or deselection. 

 While athletes are playing, they surround themselves with 
people who share their investment in sport, such as coaches, 
teammates, the sports medicine team, and administrators, who 
can be more interested in keeping the athlete in sport rather 
than facilitating their retirement. When retirement comes, 
athletes can find themselves without emotional support. This is 
where organizational support at the elite level is important, and 
there are programs to help. 

 The Life Development Intervention model contains strategies 
for each stage of transition: enhancement strategies when 
planning for the future, support strategies while the athlete is 
transitioning, and counseling strategies to help athletes cope 
with the aftermath.

Questions to Consider
1.	 If you created a hierarchal list of the important and valuable 
concepts addressed in this course to achieve excellence, 
where would you rank deliberate practice? How would you 
justify that ranking?
2.	 How can sport and performance psychology benefit 
performers after their career is over?
