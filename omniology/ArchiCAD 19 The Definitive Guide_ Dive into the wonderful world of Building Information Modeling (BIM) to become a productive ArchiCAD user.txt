About the Authors
Scott H. MacKenzie started working in the AEC (architecture, engineering, and 
construction) industry way back in 1988. His first role was as a manual draftsman, 
where he drew with ink on Mylar. Soon afterwards, he became a CAD operator. He 
loves creating, drawing, and managing construction documents. He worked with 
several different CAD programs and became a CAD manager in 1994. In 2003, he 
started using his first BIM program. Scott was convinced at that time that BIM was 
a much better way to draw, document, and manage drawing sets. Fast forward 
to today, and he says to you, "There is no project too small for the use of BIM 
(ArchiCAD). Those other CAD programs are stuck in 20th century technology."
He spent the first 12 years of his career producing electrical, HVAC, and plumbing 
drawings. Then, in 2000, he jumped over to the architecture side and has been there 
ever since.
Back in 2007, he was asked by Graphisoft to update ArchiCAD for AutoCAD Users to 
match the current version of ArchiCAD.
I would like to thank my wife, Karen, for her support and belief that 
I could complete this project. Despite all the distractions in our life, 
such as major house repairs, selling our house after the repairs were 
complete, and then moving from Columbus, Ohio, to Manhattan, it 
has finally happened!
I also want to thank my friend, a well-esteemed professional peer 
and colleague Adam Rendek. Without Adam, this book would have 
been only half as good as it is and would have taken much longer 
to finish.
Also, I thank Packt Publishing for giving me this opportunity and 
working with me through all my issues.

Adam Rendek moved to San Francisco to pursue his career in design and 
construction after graduating from the Budapest University of Technology and 
Economics with a master's degree in architecture and building engineering. He has 
worked on numerous large projects, both in Europe and the United States, including 
the Palace of Arts in Budapest—recipient of the 2006 FIABCI Prix d'Excellence—and 
the UCSF Mission Bay Hospital project in San Francisco.
In addition to his professional work, he taught a lecture series on digital presentation 
and building information modeling at U.C. Berkeley in 2005 and 2006. Adam 
also worked on a research project that explores optimization opportunities in 
the energy modeling workflow and developed solutions to build life cycle and 
operations management in the past 3 years. He published several papers on building 
information modeling (BIM) and energy modeling and presented at a major 
conference in the United States and Europe.
He is currently working on the BIM implementation of a large public organization 
(San Francisco International Airport) on behalf of DPR Consulting. His 
responsibilities include client stakeholder engagement as well as the development 
of technology implementation strategies. Adam collaborated with the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratories in a research project, identifying optimal data 
exchange for energy modeling purposes. He was a consultant for IDEO, Adobe 
Systems, Autodesk, and Graphisoft on product development for the AEC industry.

Preface

Preface
Your whole experience of creating an architectural design and conveying that 
design via construction documents can be a fun, challenging, aggravating, or an 
enlightening experience. Many factors come into play to determine the success of 
your project, such as the people involved and the established procedures used, 
but the design tools you use in the process can greatly affect your success.
Graphisoft introduced their true 3D design software for a personal computer at the 
Hanover Fair in Germany back in 1984. By 1986, the program was named ArchiCAD 
(Version 2.0) for the Apple Macintosh operating system. The first Windows version 
of ArchiCAD was released in 1993 for Version 4.16. Since then, ArchiCAD has been 
available for both the Macintosh and Windows operating systems. ArchiCAD 19, 
released in 2015, is the culmination of the industry's evolving technology, new 
features, improved process workflow, and a graphic user interface that has been 
evolving ever since that first unveiling in 1984.
Learning a new software program can be enjoyable if the program is fun to use 
and somewhat intuitive. Experienced CAD users that start using a BIM (Building 
Information Modeling) program such as ArchiCAD enjoy the intelligent interaction 
between elements and the 3D model environment.
If you are a 2D CAD user, you will appreciate ArchiCAD's ability to keep everything 
in one file, instead of needing to have separate files for each floor (story). Modeling 
tools generate 3D elements by default, even when you draw within a 2D view. 
Elements such as doors and windows clean up automatically when moved along a 
wall. Changes made to the elements in a plan view will update automatically in the 
corresponding section and the elevation views. You are going to love it! This reason 
is enough to stop using your CAD program and move to ArchiCAD.

Preface
[ x ]
You will need to draw your major design elements only once, because the virtual 
model drives the documentations. You will learn that this is all a part of the virtual 
building environment inside ArchiCAD.
If you are already a BIM user with an understanding of all the abilities mentioned 
here, you will learn about the unique features that ArchiCAD offers. These features 
include special ways to control your viewing environment, numerous selection 
modes, flexible element filtering, and robust modeling tools.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Project Setup and Modeling a Residential Project, helps you to get started 
using ArchiCAD by creating your first project. You will get an introduction to the 
ArchiCAD graphic user interface (GUI), as you learn about project settings and how 
they drive your project environment. Then, you will see how easy it is to model 
walls, doors, windows, and a roof for your new house!
Chapter 2, Objects, Drafting, and Annotation – A Residential Project, will teach you 
how to create your own custom objects to add to your new house. This chapter will 
introduce you to the tools used for text creation and 2D line work. You will feel right 
at home with the tools in this chapter, because they are very similar to all the basic 
tools in any standard CAD program.
Chapter 3, Documentation – A Residential Project, will get into forming the finished look 
of your project. You will learn about views, how to manipulate what is displayed on 
your drawings, and how to control the way it is graphically displayed. Then, you 
will learn about creating sheets and the super easy way to put views on them.
Chapter 4, Project Setup and Modeling Part I – A Healthcare Building Project, will help 
you set up what will be used as the shell and core model for your commercial 
building. In this chapter, you will dig a little deeper into ArchiCAD's project 
environment settings, and learn to use more advanced modeling tools. This will 
provide the framework for your new building.
Chapter 5, Project Setup and Modeling Part II – A Healthcare Building Project, will cover 
creating the interiors model to be used together with the shell and core model 
created in the previous chapter. You will get the project settings put in place, and 
link the shell and core model in. Then, you will model all the interior walls, and 
have fun inserting furniture, casework, and appliances.

[ xi ]
Chapter 6, Objects, Drafting, and Annotation – A Healthcare Building Project, will dig 
deeper into making your own custom objects. You may find that creating your own 
custom objects it a lot of fun, and your favorite thing to do. In this chapter, you 
will also learn about the other annotation tools available in ArchiCAD, as well as 
advanced detail creation.
Chapter 7, Documentation – A Commercial Project, will teach you more about 
view creation, view management, sheet creation, and drawing management. This 
chapter will help ensure that you fully understand how to control the look and feel 
of your drawings. You may not realize it at first, but this knowledge is essential 
to a successful project.
Chapter 8, Work Sharing with ArchiCAD, will teach you about data extraction, and 
the many different ways to incorporate different types of drawing formats into your 
projects. Also, it will teach you how to export your work into multiple different file 
formats for other parties to utilize in their work. You will find that ArchiCAD is 
second to none in this category.
Chapter 9, Visualization and Model Management, will be fun when learning about 
rendering, animations, and virtual environment fly-through models. We end the 
book with model management and best practices. Model management may sound 
boring, but it will help you keep your project in good shape.
What you need for this book
A basic understanding of architecture and to be proficient with a 2D CAD software 
program, such as AutoCAD Lite, or exposure to a BIM program, such as Revit.
Who this book is for
This book is for architects, architectural technicians, and construction professionals 
who are familiar with 2D CAD, such as AutoCAD Lite, or have some exposure to a 
3D BIM package, such as Revit. No experience with ArchiCAD is required. If you 
want to learn the skills needed for architectural drawing production in the real 
world, then this book is for you.

Project Setup and Modeling 
a Residential Project
Our journey into ArchiCAD 19 begins with an introduction to the graphic user 
interface, also known as the GUI. As with any software program, there is a menu bar 
along the top that gives access to all the tools and features. There are also toolbars 
and tool palettes that can be docked anywhere you like. In addition to this, there are 
some special palettes that pop up only when you need them.
After your introduction to ArchiCAD's user interface, you can jump right in and start 
creating the walls and floors for your new house. Then you will learn how to create 
ceilings and the stairs. Before too long you will have a 3D model to orbit around. It is 
really fun and probably easier than you would expect.
The ArchiCAD GUI
The first time you open ArchiCAD you will find the toolbars along the top, just 
under the menu bar and there will be palettes docked to the left and right of the 
drawing area. We will focus on the three following palettes to get started:
•	
The Toolbox palette: This contains all of your selection, modeling, and 
drafting tools. It will be located on the left hand side by default.
•	
The Info Box palette: This is your context menu that changes according to 
whatever tool is currently in use. By default, this will be located directly 
under the toolbars at the top. It has a scrolling function; hover your cursor 
over the palette and spin the scroll wheel on your mouse to reveal everything 
on the palette.
•	
The Navigator palette: This is your project navigation window. This palette 
gives you access to all your views, sheets, and lists. It will be located on the 
right-hand side by default.

These three palettes can be seen in the following screenshot:
All of the mentioned palettes are dockable and can be arranged however you like on 
your screen. They can also be dragged away from the main ArchiCAD interface. For 
instance, you could have palettes on a second monitor.
Panning and Zooming
ArchiCAD has the same panning and zooming interface as most other CAD 
(Computer-aided design) and BIM (Building Information Modeling) programs. 
Rolling the scroll wheel on your mouse will zoom in and out. Pressing down on 
the scroll wheel (or middle button) and moving your cursor will execute a pan.
Each drawing view window has a row of zoom commands along the bottom. You 
should try each one to get familiar with each of their functions.

View toggling
When you have multiple views open, you can toggle through them by pressing the 
Ctrl key and tapping on the Tab key. Or, you can pick any of the open views from 
the bottom of the Window pull-down menu.
Pressing the F2 key will open a 2D floor plan view and pressing the F3 key will open 
the default 3D view. 
Pressing the F5 key will open a 3D view of selected items. In other words, if you 
want to isolate specific items in a 3D view, select those items and press F5.
The function keys are second nature to those that have been using 
ArchiCAD for a long time. If a feature has a function key shortcut, 
you should use it.
Project setup
ArchiCAD is available in multiple different language versions. The exercises in 
this book use the USA version of ArchiCAD. Obviously this version is in English. 
There is another version in English and that is referred to as the International (INT) 
version. You can use the International version to do the exercises in the book, just 
be aware that there may be some subtle differences in the way that something is 
named or designed.
When you create a new project in ArchiCAD, you start by opening a project 
template. The template will have all the basic stuff you need to get started 
including layers, line types, wall types, doors, windows, and more.
The following lesson will take you through the first steps in creating a new 
ArchiCAD project:
1.	 Open ArchiCAD.
2.	 The Start ArchiCAD dialog box will appear. Select the Create a New Project 
radio button at the top.
3.	 Select the Use a Template radio button under Set up Project Settings.
4.	 Select ArchiCAD 19 Residential Template.tpl from the drop-down list. 
If you have the International version of ArchiCAD, then the residential 
template may not be available. Therefore you can use ArchiCAD 19 
Template.tpl.
5.	 Click on New. This will open a blank project file.

Project Settings
Now that you have opened your new project, we are going to create a house with 4 
stories (which includes a story for the roof). We create a story for the roof in order 
to facilitate a workspace to model the elements on that level. The template we just 
opened only has 2 stories, so we will need to add 2 more. Then we need to look at 
some other settings.
Stories
The settings for the stories are as follows:
1.	 On the Navigator palette, select the Project Map icon 
.
2.	 Double click on 1st FLOOR.
3.	 Right click on Stories and select Create New Story.
4.	 You will be prompted to give the new story a name. Enter the name 
BASEMENT.
5.	 Click on the button next to Below.
6.	 Enter 9' into the Height box and click on the Create button. Then double 
click on 2. 2nd FLOOR.
7.	 Right click on Stories and then select Create New Story.
8.	 You will be prompted to give the new story a name. Enter the name ROOF.
9.	 Click on the button next to Above.
10.	 Enter 9' into the Height box and click on the Create button.
Your list of stories should now look like this
•	
3. ROOF
•	
2. 2nd Floor
•	
1. 1st Floor
•	
-1. BASEMENT
The International version of ArchiCAD (INT) will give 
the first floor the index number of 0. The second floor 
index number will be 1. And the roof will be 2.

[ 5 ]
Now we need to adjust the heights of the other stories:
1.	 Right click on Stories (on the Navigator palette) and select Story Settings.
2.	 Change the number in the Height to Next box for 1st FLOOR to 9'.
3.	 Do the same for 2nd FLOOR.
Units
On the menu bar, go to Options | Project Preferences | Working Units and perform 
the following steps:
1.	 Ensure Model Units is set to feet & fractional inches.
2.	 Ensure that Fractions is set to 1/64.
3.	 Ensure that Layout Units is set to feet & fractional inches.
4.	 Ensure that Angle Unit is set to Decimal degrees.
5.	 Ensure that Decimals is set to 2.
You are now ready to begin modeling your house, but first let's save the project. To 
save the project, perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the File menu and click on Save. If by chance you have saved it 
already, then click on Save As.
2.	 Name your file Colonial House.
3.	 Click on Save.
Renovation filters
The Renovation Filter feature allows you to differentiate how your drawing elements 
will appear in different construction phases. For renovation projects that have 
demolition and new work phases, you need to show the items to be demolished 
differently than the existing items that are to remain, or that are new.
The projects we will work on in this book do not require this feature to manage 
phases because we will only be creating a new construction. However, it is essential 
that your renovation filter setting is set to New Construction. We will do this in the 
first modeling exercise.
Selection methods
Before you can do much in ArchiCAD, you need to be familiar with selecting elements. 
There are several ways to select something in ArchiCAD, which are as follows:

Project Setup and Modeling a Residential Project
[ 6 ]
Single cursor click
Pick the Arrow tool from the toolbox or hold the Shift key down on the keyboard 
and click on what you want to select. As you click on the elements, hold the Shift key 
down to add them to your selection set. To remove elements from the selection set, 
just click on them again with the Shift key pressed.
There is a mode within this mode called Quick Selection. It is toggled on and off 
from the Info Box palette. The icon looks like a magnet. When it is on, it works like 
a magnet because it will stick to faces or surfaces, such as slabs or fill patterns. If this 
mode is not on, then you are required to find an edge, endpoint, or hotspot node 
to select an element with a single click. Hold the Space button down to temporarily 
change the mode while selecting elements.
Window
Pick the Arrow tool from the toolbox or hold the Shift key down and draw your 
selection window. Click once for the window starting corner and click a second time 
for the end corner.
This works just as windowing does in AutoCAD. Not as Revit 
does, where you need to hold the mouse button down while you 
draw your window.
There are 3 different windowing methods. Each one is set from the Info Box palette:
•	
Partial Elements: Anything that is inside of or touching the window will be 
selected. AutoCAD users will know this as a Crossing Window.
•	
Entire Elements: Anything completely encapsulated by the window will 
be selected. If something is not completely inside the window then it will 
not be selected.
•	
Direction Dependent: Click and window to the left, the Partial Elements 
window will be used. Click and window to the right, the Entire Elements 
window will be used.

Marquee
A marquee is a selection window that stays on the screen after you create it. If you 
are a MicroStation CAD program user, this will be similar to a selection window. 
It can be used for printing a specific area in a drawing view and performing what 
AutoCAD users would refer to as a Stretch command.
There are 2 types of marquees; single story (skinny) and multi story (fat). The single 
story marquee is used when you want to select elements on your current story view 
only. The multi-story marquee will select everything on your current story as well as 
the stories above and below your selections.
The Find & Select tool
This lets ArchiCAD select elements for you, based on the attribute criteria that you 
define, such as element type, layer, and pen number. When you have the criteria 
defined, click on the plus sign button on the palette and all the elements within that 
criterion inside your current view or marquee will be selected.
The quickest way to open the Find & Select tool is with the 
Ctrl + F key combination

Modification commands
As you draw, you will inevitably need to move, copy, stretch, or trim something. 
Select your items first, and then execute the modification command. Here are the 
basic commands you will need to get things moving:
•	
Adjust (Extend): Press Ctrl + - or navigate to Edit | Reshape | Adjust
•	
Drag (Move): Press Ctrl + D or…navigate to Edit | Move | Drag
•	
Drag a Copy (Copy): Press Ctrl + Shift + D or navigate to Edit | Move | 
Drag a Copy
•	
Intersect (Fillet): Click on the Intersect button on the Standard toolbar or 
navigate to Edit | Reshape | Intersect
•	
Resize (Scale): Press Ctrl + K or navigate to Edit | Reshape | Resize
•	
Rotate: Press Ctrl + E or navigate to Edit | Move | Rotate
•	
Stretch: Press Ctrl + H or navigate to Edit | Reshape | Stretch
•	
Trim: Press Ctrl or click on the Trim button on the Standard toolbar or 
navigate to Edit | Reshape | Trim. Hold the Ctrl key down and click 
on the portion of wall or line that you want trimmed off. This is the fastest 
way to trim anything!
Memorizing the keyboard combinations above is a sure 
way to increase your productivity.
Modeling – part I
We will start with the wall tool to create the main exterior walls on the 1st floor of 
our house, and then create the floor with the slab tool. However, before we begin, 
let's make sure your Renovation Filter is set to New Construction.
Setting the Renovation Filter
The Renovation Filter is an active setting that controls how the elements you create 
are displayed. Everything we create in this project is for new construction so we need 
the new construction filter to be active.
To do so, go to the Document menu, click on Renovation and then click on 04 New 
Construction.

Using the Wall tool
The Wall tool has settings for height, width, composite, layer, pen weight and more. 
We will learn about these things as we go along, and learn a little bit more each time 
we progress into to the project.
1.	 Double click on 1. 1st Story in the Navigator 
palette to ensure we are working on story 1.
2.	 Select the Wall tool from the Toolbox palette 
or from the menu bar under Design | Design 
Tools | Wall.
3.	 Notice that this will automatically change the 
contents of the Info Box palette. Click on the 
wall icon inside Info Box. This will bring up the 
active properties of the wall tool in the form of 
the Wall Default Settings window. (This can 
also be achieved by double clicking on the wall 
tool button in Toolbox).
4.	 Change the composite type to Siding 2x6 Wd. 
Stud. Click on the wall composite button to 
do this.
Creating the exterior walls of the first story
To create the exterior walls of the 1st story perform the following steps:
1.	 Select the Wall tool from the Toolbox palette, or from the menu bar under 
Design | Design Tools | Wall.
2.	 Double click on 1. 1st Story in the Navigator palette to ensure that we are 
working on story 1.

3.	 Select the Wall tool from the Toolbox palette, or from the menu bar under 
Design | Design Tools | Wall.
4.	 Change the composite type to be Siding 2x6 Wd. Stud. Click on the wall 
composite button to do this.
5.	 Notice at the bottom of the Wall Default Settings window is the layer 
currently assigned to the wall tool. It should be set to A-WALL-EXTR.
6.	 Click on OK to start your first wall.
7.	 Click near the center of the drawing screen and move your cursor to the left, 
notice the orange dashed line that appears. That is your guide line. Keep 
your cursor over the guide line so that it keeps you locked in the orthogonal 
direction. You should also immediately see the Tracker palette pop up, 
displaying your distance drawn and angle after your first click. Before you 
make your second click, enter the number 24 from your keyboard and press 
Enter. You should now have 24-0" long wall.
If your Tracker palette does not appear, it may be toggled off. Go 
up to the Standard tool bar and click on the Tracker button to turn 
it on.

8.	 Select this again and make your first click on the upper left end corner of 
your first wall. Move your cursor down, so that it snaps to the guideline, 
enter the number 28, and press the Enter key.
9.	 Draw your third wall by clicking on the bottom left endpoint of your second 
wall, move your cursor to the right, snapped over the guide line, type in the 
number 24 and press Enter.
10.	 Draw your fourth wall by clicking on the bottom right end point of your 
third wall and the starting point of your first wall. You should now have four 
walls that measure 24'-0" x 28"-0, outside edge to outside edge.
11.	 Move your four walls to the center of the drawing view and perform the 
following steps:
a.	 Click on the Arrow tool at the top of the Toolbox.
b.	 Click outside one of the corners of the walls, and then click on the 
opposite side. All four walls should be selected now.
c.	 Use the Drag command to move the walls. The quickest way to 
activate the Drag command is by pressing Ctrl + D. The long way is 
from the menu bar by navigating to Edit | Move | Drag.
d.	 Drag (move) the walls to the center of your drawing window.
e.	 Press the Esc key or click on a blank space in your drawing window 
to deselect the walls.
You can select all the walls in a view by 
activating the Wall tool and pressing Ctrl + A.
You are now ready to create a floor with the slab tool. But first, let's have a little fun 
and see how it looks in 3D (press the F3 key):
1.	 From the Navigator palette, double click on Generic Axonometry under the 
3D folder icon.
2.	 This will open a 3D view window. Hold your Shift key down, press down 
on your scroll wheel button, and slowly move your mouse around. You 
are now orbiting!

Play around with it a little, then get back to work and go to the next step to create 
your first floor slab. Press the F2 key to get back to a 2D view.
You can also perform a 3D orbit via the Orbit 
button at the bottom of any 3D view window.
Creating the first story's floor with the Slab tool
The slab tool is used to create floors. It is also used to create ceilings. We will begin 
using it now to create the first floor for our house. Similar to the Wall tool, it also has 
settings for layer, pen weight and composite. To create the first story's floor using the 
Slab tool, perform the following steps:
1.	 Select the Slab tool from the Toolbox palette or from the menu bar under 
Design | Design Tools | Slab.
2.	 This will change the contents of the Info Box palette. Click on the Slab icon 
in Info Box. This will bring up the Slab Default Settings (active properties) 
window for the Slab tool.
3.	 As with the Wall tool, you have a composite setting for the slab tool. Set the 
composite type for the slab tool to FLR Wd Flr + 2x10.
4.	 The layer should be set to A-FLOR.
5.	 Click OK.

6.	 You could draw the shape of the slab by tracing over the outside lines of 
your walls but we are going to use the Magic Wand feature. Hover your 
cursor over the space inside your four walls and press the space bar on your 
keyboard. This will automatically create the slab using the boundary created 
by the walls. Then, open a 3D view and look at your floor.
Instead of using the tool icon inside the Info Box palette, 
double click on any tool icon inside the Toolbox palette to 
bring up the default settings window for that tool.
Creating the exterior walls and floor slabs for 
the basement and the second story
We could repeat all of the previous steps to create the floor and walls for the second 
story and the basement, but in this case, it will be quicker to copy what we have 
already drawn on the first story and copy it up with the Edit Elements by Stories 
tool. Perform the following steps to create the exterior walls and floor slabs for the 
basement and second story:
1.	 Go to the Navigator palette and right click over Stories, select Edit Elements 
by Stories. The Edit Elements by Stories window will open.
2.	 Under Select Action, you want to set it to Copy.
3.	 Under From Story, set it to 1. 1st FLOOR.
4.	 In the To Story section, check the box for 2nd FLOOR and -1. BASEMENT.
5.	 Click on OK.
6.	 You should see a dialog box appear, stating that as a result of the last 
operation, elements have been created and/or have changed their position 
on currently unseen stories. Whenever you get this message, you should 
confirm that you have not created any unwanted elements.
Click on the Continue button. Now you should have 
walls and a floor on three stories; Basement, 1st FLOOR, 
and 2nd FLOOR.
The quickest way to jump to the next story up or the 
next story down is with the Ctrl + Arrow Up or Ctrl + 
Arrow Down key combination.

Basement element modification
The floor and the walls on the BASEMENT story need to be changed to a different 
composite type. Do this by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the BASEMENT view and select the four walls by clicking on one at a 
time while holding down the Shift key.
2.	 Right click over your selection and click on Wall Selection Settings. Change 
the walls to the EIFS on 8" CMU composite type. Then, click on OK.
3.	 Move your cursor over the floor slab. The quick selection cursor should 
appear. This selection mode allows you to click on an object without needing 
to find an edge or endpoint. Click on the slab.
4.	 Open the Slab Selection Setting window but this time, do it by pressing the 
Ctrl + T key combination. Change the floor slab composite to Conc. Slab: 4" 
on gravel. Click on OK.
The Ctrl + T key combination is the quickest way to 
bring up an element's selection settings window when 
an element is selected.
Open a 3D view (by pressing the F3 key) and orbit around your house. It should look 
similar to the following screenshot:

Adding the garage
We need to add the garage and the laundry room, which connects the garage to the 
house. Do this by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR story from the project map.
2.	 Start the Wall tool. From the Info Box palette, set the wall composite setting 
to Siding 2x6 Wd. Stud.
3.	 Click on the upper-left corner of your house for your wall starting point. 
Move your cursor to the left, snap to the guide line, type 6'-10", and 
press Enter.
4.	 Change the Geometry Method setting on Info Box to Chained. Refer to the 
following screenshot:
5.	 Start your next wall by clicking on the endpoint of your last wall, move 
your cursor up, snap to the guideline and type 5', and press Enter.
6.	 Move your cursor to the left, snap to grid line, type in 12'-6", and 
press Enter.
7.	 Move your cursor down, snap to grid line, type in 22'-4", and press Enter.
8.	 Move your cursor to the right, snap to grid line and double click on the 
perpendicular west wall (double pressing your Enter key will work the 
same as a double click).
Now we want to create the floor for this new set of walls. To do that, perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Start the Slab tool.
2.	 Change the composite to Conc. Slab: 4" on gravel.
3.	 Hover your cursor inside the new set of walls and press the Space key to 
use the magic wand. This will create the floor slab for the garage and 
laundry room.

There is still one more wall to create, but this time we will use the Adjust command 
to, in effect, create a new wall:
1.	 Select the 5'-0" wall drawn in the previous exercise.
2.	 Go to the Edit menu, click on Reshape, and then click on Adjust.
3.	 Click on the bottom edge of the perpendicular wall down below. The wall 
should extend down. Refer to the following screenshot:
4.	 Then Change to a 3D view (by pressing F3) and examine your work.

Modeling – part II
Now we are ready to create the interior walls. Open the 1st FLOOR view from the 
project map, and perform the following steps:
1.	 Start the wall tool, change the composite to Wall Wd 2x4 + 5/8" Gyp.Bd.
2.	 Draw your interior walls on the first floor according to the following plan:
Second floor walls
We are going to create the interior walls on the second floor. Some of the walls on the 
second story align with walls on the first story. We will use the Trace and Reference 
feature to display the walls on the story below. Revit users will know this as the 
underlay property of the view.
Open the 2nd FLOOR view and go to the View menu, click on Trace to toggle on 
the Trace mode. This should display the floor below in a halftone by default. The 
image that follows shows the second floor walls to be drawn and the wall below 
in a halftone.
Other ways to toggle the Trace mode on and off are with the keyboard 
combination Ctrl + F2, the Trace button on the Standard toolbar, and 
the button on the Trace and Reference palette.

Modification II – pet palette
Another way to modify something is to use the pet palette. After you select an item, 
click on an endpoint or edge of that element. This will bring up the pet palette for 
that type of element. The pet palette is essentially an on-demand toolbar that is 
specifically designed for the type of element you select. It can have commands such 
as move, rotate, stretch, etc. Following are a few examples according to element type 
and what part of the element is clicked on.
Ceilings
All the walls and floors in our house are drawn. Now it is time for us to model the 
ceilings. This house has typical gypsum board ceilings at 8'-0" above the finished 
floor. We will put them in the first and second floor stories. The basement ceiling 
will be exposed to the floor above.
First, we need to create a composite for a 5/8" gypsum board to be used by the slab 
tool as the ceiling material.
Creating a composite type
Perform the following steps to create a composite type:

4.	 This composite is designed to be used for slabs and walls. At the bottom 
right, click on the Roof and Shell buttons so they are un-selected, leaving 
the Wall and Slab tool selected.
First floor ceilings
We will start modeling the ceilings on the first floor by drawing slabs in every room 
except the garage and the stairwell. However, before we start modeling the ceilings, 
we need to assign a composite type to the ceiling.
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR viewpoint from project map on the Navigator palette. 
Start the Slab tool from the Toolbox palette.
2.	 On the Info Box palette, change the composite to Gyp.Bd. Ceiling: 5/8".
3.	 Change the layer to A-CLNG.
4.	 Set the Reference level to Height and Home Offset. In the height offset box, 
enter 8'-0".
5.	 Use the Magic Wand (Space) and click inside each room one at a time. This 
will create a 5/8" gypsum board ceiling inside each room at a height of 8'-0".

Roofs
You are now ready to model two gable style roofs for our house. One roof over the 
garage and laundry room, and the second over the second floor. The Roof tool is 
very dynamic; it can create a complete gable or hip style roof in one step. Or you 
can create separate individual panels.
The following exercise will step you through the creation of your first roofs!
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR view and start the Roof tool from the tool box.
2.	 Change Construction Method to Rotated Rectangular Hip/Gable. Change 
the overhang offset to 1'-0". Look at the following image:

This construction method requires 3 clicks. Select the upper-left corner of the garage, 
then click on the bottom left corner, and then the bottom-right hand corner. Refer to 
the following image:
1.	 The overhang on the right edge is penetrating the second floor and needs to 
be pulled back. Select the roof, click on the right edge (the pet palette will 
pop up, the offset edge button will be selected), then drag the edge over to 
the edge of the wall to the left. Take a look at the following image:
2.	 Open the 2nd FLOOR view. Click on the Roof tool; use the same method as 
before. Click on the upper left corner of the second floor wall, then click on 
the lower left corner, and then on the lower right corner.

[ 24 ]
You now have 2 roofs, but the pitch needs to be adjusted for our house's design:
1.	 Open the WEST ELEVATION viewpoint from Project Map
2.	 Select one of the roofs. Click on the top point and hold the cursor down so 
the pet palette pops up.
3.	 Click on the Elevate Horizontal Ridge button from the pet palette. Drag your 
cursor up, enter 1 from your keyboard and press Enter. This should bring up 
the ridge by 1'-0".
4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the other roof.
Open a 3D view. You will see that your roofs are added but there is a gap at the 
gable ends that needs to be filled.
Trimming walls with roofs
Your task is to change the height of the 3 walls that will fill the gable end of each 
roof, then trim the walls using the roofs as a cutting plane:
1.	 Open the 3D window, orbit to the west side of the house and select the west 
wall of the garage.
2.	 With the wall selected, go to the Info Box palette and change the Top setting 
to 3. Roof. Use the following image as a guide:
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 25 ]
3.	 Right-click on wall (the wall is still selected), from the right-click menu select 
Connect… | Trim Elements to Roof/Shell.
a.	 Click on the roof over the garage to use it as your trim element.
b.	 Click on the lower portion of the wall to select what part to keep.
c.	 Click on a blank area of the screen to complete the command.
Next, you want to do the same to the second floor walls at the gable ends of the 
second floor roof. However, this time when you change the height of the wall, the 
process is different because there is no story above 3. Roof.
Perform the following steps to trim the second story walls to the second story roof. 
When finished, your exterior walls will be complete.
1.	 Select one of the second floor walls that need to be trimmed to the second 
floor roof. From the Info Box palette, change the Bottom and Top setting 
to Top and Home Offsets. Set the top height to 9'-0". Refer to the 
following image:

2.	 Select the same wall and right click on it. From the right-click menu select 
Connect… | Trim Elements to Roof/Shell.
a.	 Click on the roof over the second floor to use as your trim element.
b.	 Click on the lower portion of the wall to select what part to keep.
c.	 Click on a blank area of the screen to complete the command.
3.	 Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the other second floor wall.
Cutting the roof
There is a portion of the roof over the garage that will need to have a piece cut out of 
it. It is the area above the back door of the laundry room. ArchiCAD makes it easy to 
cut holes out of roof objects. You will start by activating the Roof tool, then select the 
roof and draw the portion of the roof to be subtracted. To demonstrate this feature, 
perform the following steps.
1.	 Open 1st FLOOR from the project map.
2.	 Start the Roof tool, then hold the Shift key down and select the roof over the 
garage (it is vital that you start the Roof tool before you select the roof).

The 2D plan view will still show the northeast corner of the roof, but 
if you open a 3D window, you will see that it is not there.
Layers
We have briefly touched upon using layers in the steps leading to this point. As we 
go further, you will need to learn how to manage your layers. We will go deep into 
layer management in later portions of this book, but we will have a quick primer on 
layers to keep you productive.
Similar to how layers work in CAD programs, you can turn them on, off, and lock 
them. Any element is subject to the on/off/lock status of the layer it is placed on. 
However, layers in ArchiCAD do not control elements the same way as they do in 
AutoCAD or MicroStation.
Open the Layer Settings manager window with a Ctrl + L key combination. Or 
you could also open it from the menu bar by navigating to Document | Layers | 
Layer Settings.
Look at the screenshot taken from the layer settings manager. You will see the 
eyeball icon column; it shows the layer (on) or hides the layer (off). The concept for 
the lock icon is the same. We will discuss the other columns later in the book.

Hide a layer by selection: select an item that is on a layer you 
want to hide and right click, then select Layers… | Hide Layer.
Managing layers with the Quick Layers palette
The Quick Layers palette is an excellent tool for performing quick little layer tasks 
such as hiding the layer of a selected object, hiding all the layers that your selected 
object is on, or locking a selected item's layer. See the features list, palette, and legend 
notes that follow:
a.	 Toggle between shown and hidden layers
b.	 Toggle between unlocked and locked layers
c.	 Hide the selection's layer(s)
d.	 Lock the selection's layer(s)
e.	 Unlock the selection's layer(s)
f.	
Hide all layers other than the ones selected (isolate selected objects' 
layers)
g.	 Lock all the layers not selected
h.	 Undo and Redo for any of the commands executed on the Quick 
Layers palette. Lock all layers other than the ones selected
Site
All of the major modeling tasks have been completed. But the house is floating in 
space and we need to put it on something. So, let's start on creating the site. We will 
use the Mesh command to create the terrain for the house to sit on:
1.	 Open 1st FLOOR from the project map.
2.	 From Toolbox, click on the Mesh tool.
3.	 Change the construction method to rectangle.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com

[ 30 ]
4.	 Create a 150' x 150' rectangle to surround the house: after your first click 
point, enter 150 on the keyboard, then press the Tab key and enter 150 again, 
then press Enter. This will create a site mesh. Select the mesh, then drag and 
center it around the house.
5.	 You need to cut a hole in the mesh to accommodate the basement. 
Click on the Mesh tool icon again and select the mesh that you just created.
6.	 Click on the upper-right outside corner of the house, then with your second 
pick, click on the exterior left front corner of the house. A window will pop 
up for specifying new mesh points. Select the radio button for Create Hole. 
Leave the fit specification as Fit to User Ridges. Click on OK.
Zones (rooms)
Let's go back inside the house and add the room elements, known as zones. Zones 
contain information that feeds room tags and provides data that can be used for BIM 
data extraction.
We need to add zones to all the room spaces. The following steps will walk you 
through the process by starting at the bottom story, in the basement:
1.	 Open BASEMENT from the project map.
2.	 Start the Zone tool from Toolbox. On the Info Box palette, do the following:
a.	 Set the construction method to Rectangular.
b.	 Enter the name BASEMENT in the room name box.
c.	 Enter 001 in the room number box.
3.	 Click on the top left inside corner of the basement room and then on the 
lower right hand inside corner. Then click on the center of the room (the 
hammer icon will appear). You should now see a room tag that has the room 
name, number, and area.
4.	 Open the Layer Settings manager (Ctrl + L) and hide the following layers: 
A-CLNG, A-FLOR, A-ROOF, and L-SITE. This will keep us from accidently 
selecting items on those layers, or you could lock them instead.

5.	 Open the 1st FLOOR from the project map and start the Zone tool. On the 
Info Box palette, click on the Floor Plan Contour Line icon to turn it on, and 
set the pen to 5. Change Construction Method to Polyline.
6.	 Change the name in the Name box to DINING. Draw the zone boundary of 
the DINING room according to the following diagram:
7.	 Change the name in the Name box to KITCHEN. Change the construction 
method to Inner Edge. Click inside the kitchen room and the zone will 
automatically find the walls and use them as a boundary.

Lists
Now that you have created most of your rooms, you may want to know the square 
footage of each one and see them in a list. Go to the project map and scroll down to 
Lists. Expand Lists by clicking on the plus sign, then expand Zones.
Double click on Basic. This will open a list of all the zones you just created. Refer to 
the following screenshot:

Zone categories
Notice that all the rooms are in the LIVING SPACE zone category. This is not what 
we want for Garage, or Laundry Room, or probably even the BASEMENT. Perform 
the following steps to change the category of the zones that we don't want in the 
LIVING SPACE category.
1.	 Open 1st FLOOR. and select the GARAGE zone.
2.	 In Info Box change the zone category from 2.0 LIVING SPACE to 3.1 Garage.
3.	 Select the LAUNDRY zone and change the zone category to 3.0 UTILITY.

4.	 Select the BASEMENT zone and change the zone category to 2.2 
Unconditioned Space.
Closets are zones too
You are almost done with inserting your zones. All that is left to do is to add zones 
for the closets and the stairs from the first floor to the second floor.
1.	 Open 2nd FLOOR.
2.	 Start the Zone tool and set the zone category to 0.10 Storage. Change the 
room name to CLOSET. The value for Construction Method is set to 
Inner Edge.
3.	 Create a zone inside each one of the empty rooms on the second 
floor. The room numbers will start from where you left off on the 
second floor before.
4.	 Open 1st FLOOR. Change the room number in the Info Box to 106. 
Create a zone inside the small rectangle room at the top of the living room, 
and do the same for the small room on the lower-left side of the living room.
5.	 Set the zone category in the Info Box to 2.0 LIVING SPACE. Change the 
room name to STAIRS. Click inside the remaining empty space above the 
front closet.
Doors
It is time for us to start adding doors to our house. If you have used CAD for as long 
time you will quickly learn to love how doors work inside of ArchiCAD. When you 
place a door, it will automatically attach itself to a wall. From there you can move the 
door along the wall and the line work will automatically cleanup. Within each door 
object are parameters that can control size and appearance.
Before you begin, hide the following layers: A-AREA-IDEN, A-ROOF. This will 
make it easier to work on our doors. Perform the following steps:
1.	 Let's start on the first floor. Click on the Door tool inside the Toolbox palette. 
Look at the Info Box palette and D1 Entrance 19 should be the default door 
that is ready to be inserted.

2.	 Zoom in on the southwest corner of the house. Hover your cursor over the 
bottom edge of the south exterior wall, which is just to the right of the front 
closet. You will see the Mercedes cursor and an outlined representation of the 
door opening appear, along with a sun symbol that signifies the exterior side 
of the door. Click once on the wall to place the door in it.
3.	 As you move your cursor around you will see how it changes where the 
door leaf will be placed. Click on it one more time when you have the door 
opening outside to the left. Notice how a door tag is automatically inserted.
4.	 Insert another door in the upper-left corner of the laundry room.

You have now placed your first two doors. They are exterior doors, so now we need 
to place interior doors and openings. We will continue working on the first floor:
1.	 Double click on the Door tool icon inside the Toolbox palette. This will open 
the Default Door Settings window. In the library pane on the upper left, 
under Linked Libraries, click on Empty Door Openings 19 folder. Click on 
Arch Top Door Opening 19. Click on the OK button.
2.	 Place a door opening at the bottom of the stairs, and two in the kitchen.
3.	 Double click on the Door tool icon again to change the door type to D1 
Garage 2 19, from under 08 30 00 Specialty Doors and Frames 19\Garage 
Doors 19. Place the garage door at the center of the south wall of 
the garage.
4.	 Double click on the Door tool icon to change the door type to D1 19 
from under 08 11 00 Wood Doors 19\Wood Internal Doors 19. Insert the 
door in the kitchen by the laundry room.
5.	 Double click on the Door tool icon to change the door type to D1 Bifold 19 
from under 08 30 00 Specialty Doors and Frames 19\Bifold Doors 19. Insert 
the door at the closet at the bottom of the stairs and the closet in the Kitchen. 
In the Info Box palette, change the door opening width to 2'-6". Refer to the

Windows
Similar to doors, windows automatically snap to walls and have changeable 
parameters that control size and appearance. But it is important to note that doors 
and windows require a wall to act as a host because they cannot exist on their own. 
This means that the door and windows assume the layer of the wall. This is why 
you don't see a layer setting in Info Box when the window or door tool is active.

Stairs
The Stair tool is a tool that involves a good amount of setup before you actually 
place a stair, because stairs are always unique and contain many components. For 
our project we need 2 stairs. One to get to the 2nd floor from the first floor and one 
to get to the basement from the first floor.
Before we get started, we will want to alter our view to give us a better view. 
Specifically, we want to turn off the window and door tags. We will do this by 
changing the current model view options:
1.	 Go to the menu bar, navigate to Document | Set Model View | Model 
View Options.
2.	 Select the Presentation-Solid model view option combination.

Summary
In this chapter you were introduced to the ArchiCAD Graphical User Interface 
(GUI), project settings and learned how to select stuff. You created all the major 
modeling for your house and got a primer on layers. Now you should have a good 
understanding of the ArchiCAD way of creating architectural elements and how 
to control their parameters. In the next chapter you will be introduced to objects 
such as casework, plumbing fixtures, and furniture; as well as the drafting and 
annotation tools.

Objects, Drafting, and 
Annotation – A Residential 
Project
In this chapter, you will populate your house with ArchiCAD objects such as 
casework, plumbing fixtures, furniture and more. You will also learn how to create 
your own custom objects. You will start using the tools used for text creation and 2D 
line work. Here is a list of the main topics we will learn about:
•	
Objects—furniture and casework to populate the rooms in the house
•	
Annotation—text and dimensions
•	
The Mesh tool
•	
The Beam & Column tool
Objects
Objects in ArchiCAD are akin to blocks in AutoCAD, cells in MicroStation, or 
families in Revit. Objects can be furniture, casework, appliances, plumbing fixtures, 
and more. In Chapter 1, Project Setup and Modeling a Residential Project, you created 
your own custom stair object. However, that was with the special stair-building 
interface, exclusive to the Stair tool. The interface is different for creating other 
types of objects.
Your house is ready for the interior fit-out. In other words, you need to insert the 
stuff to sit, work, eat, and sleep on. We will go through each room, starting with the 
rooms on the second floor and work our way down.

Bathroom
Your bathroom will need a casework, sink, and bathtub. The first thing we need 
to do is create a layer for the casework. Then, we will add the vanity with a sink 
and countertop.
The casework layer
Before we start inserting casework, we will have to create a layer specifically for 
placing the casework on. Do so by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the Layer Settings window by pressing Ctrl + L. Click on the New 
button at the upper-right corner of the window. The New Layer dialog box 
will open. Enter A-CSWK in the Name box. Click on OK.
2.	 The new layer will appear in the list at the right (the layer should appear 
as selected). In the Layer Combinations pane on the left-hand side, click 
on the closed eyeball icon next to the Enlarged Plan, Floor Plan, and 
Section layer combinations. This will unhide the A-CSWK layer in those 
layer combinations.
Vanity
Next, we will add the vanity for the bathroom. It has a sink and base cabinet with a 
single door. To add the vanity for the bathroom, perform the following steps:
1.	 Double-click on the object icon in the Toolbox palette and set the layer at the 
bottom to A-CSWK.
2.	 In the upper-left pane of the Object Default Settings window, navigate to 
ArchiCAD Library 19 | 12 Furnishing 19 | 12 30 00 Casework 19. Select the 
object named Cabinet Base Single Door 19.

3.	 Look at the Preview and Positioning window and rotate the cabinet to be 
270°. Click on the lower-right hotspot to designate the insertion point. Click 
on OK and place the cabinet on the right-hand side wall of the bathroom.
Notice that the cabinet is missing the end panels. We need to add the end 
panels and make some other changes.
4.	 Select the cabinet and open the Object Selection Settings window (Ctrl + T). 
Expand the Parameters section and make the following changes:
a.	 Cabinet: Toe Setback = 4"; Toe Height = 4".
b.	 End panels: Left End Panel = On; Right End Panel = s
c.	 Counter: Backsplash Height = 4"; Overhang to Front of Cabinet = 1", 
Overhang to Left of Cabinet = 1"; Overhang to Right of Cabinet = 1"
d.	 Tap: = Style 4
e.	 2D Representation: Edge Visibility in 2D = Both
Your cabinet will look like the following 2D and 3D images:

Mesh 2
If you try to look at your new basement windows in a 3D view, you will not see them 
because the mesh you created in the last chapter is blocking the view. The mesh is 
acting as the Earth that your house is sitting on. So, we need to move the Earth away 
from the windows to create a light well for the basement. To do this, we will create 
new points on the mesh. Each point on a mesh has an elevation height assigned to 
it. We will change the elevation heights on the new points we will create (after they 
are created):
1.	 Unhide the L-SITE layer and hide the A-DIMS and A-ROOF layers. Open 
the Basement viewpoint from the project map. Set the Model View option to 
Detailing+No Fill (Document | Set Model view). Zoom in on the northwest 
corner of the house, at the kitchen window.
2.	 We will use the Line tool as a temporary guide to layout our point locations 
on the site mesh for an 18" wide light well. Click on the Line tool inside the 
Toolbox palette. Go to the Info Box palette and change the geometry method 
to Chained and set the layer to L-SITE.
3.	 Make the starting point of your line on the upper-left corner of the basement 
window. Notice that the cursor will change to a check mark to signify 
the endpoint snap. Before you make your second point, you will use the 
keyboard to create the first line segment by performing the following steps:
a.	 Enter 18" (this will appear in the Tracker palette).
b.	 Press the Tab key, enter 90, and press Enter.

c.	 Hold the Shift key down and click on the upper-right corner of 
the window. This will make a perfect parallel line offset from 
the window.
d.	 Let go of the Shift key and double-click on the upper-left corner of 
the window.
The following screenshot shows you what steps b and c look like:
4.	 Create an offset copy of the lines you just drew and select all three lines. 
Click and hold on one of the lines; this will bring up the pet palette. Click on 
the Offset icon. Tap the Ctrl key to invoke the copy command. Bring your 
cursor to the inside of the widow well, type 1", and press Enter. You now 
have the lines that you need to guide us in creating the new mesh points.

5.	 We have to do the same for the remaining basement windows. You can 
copy the lines you made, over to each window location but that can be a bit 
cumbersome. We will take this opportunity to create our first object:
a.	 Select the six lines that you created and navigate to File | Libraries 
and Objects | Save Selection As… | Object.
b.	 Enter the name for your object, such as Window Well Guide Lines 
and click on Save. You have created your first object!
c.	 Start the Object command and set the layer to L-SITE. Your new 
object will be the current object, ready for insertion and if not, use 
the search feature. Place one at each window. Delete the original 
lines that were used to create your object and replace them with 
your new object.
6.	 Open the first floor viewpoint from the project map. Since the mesh was 
created on the first floor, this is where we need to edit the site mesh. Turn on 
the Trace feature (Alt + F2). Set the reference to Below Current Story. You 
will now see the lines you created on the basement level.
7.	 Activate the Mesh tool. Select the mesh. Go to the Info Box palette and set 
the geometry method to Rectangular. Zoom in on the northwest window. 
Click on an outside corner of the outermost corner of your guide object and 
then click on the opposite corner in the window. A dialog box will pop up. 
Click on the Add New Points radio button and then click on OK. Do the 
same for the innermost points. Refer to the following screenshot:

8.	 You have created the new points for one window well, now you need to 
change the elevation height in the four innermost points. Select the mesh. 
Click on one of the four inner points. The pet palette will appear. Click on the 
Elevate Mesh Point button. The Mesh Point Height dialog box will appear. 
Enter -2 and click on OK. Do this for the three other inside points. Switch to 
a 3D view (F3) and see your work.
9.	 Repeat steps seven and eight for the other three window wells.
Holding the Shift key down in ArchiCAD works like pressing 
the F8 key in AutoCAD for Ortho mode and is similar to 
checking the Constrain box on the options bar in Revit.

The Beam & Column tool
Your basement also needs to have a little bit of structural support that we did not 
complete in the first chapter. We need to put a beam down the center and  single 
column near the center of the room. You can do so by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the Basement viewpoint from the project map. Unhide the A-BEAM 
layer and start the Beam tool from the Toolbox palette. Click on the Beam 
icon in the Info Box palette to open the Beam Default Settings window. 
Change the beam type to W8X31. Change the beam height to 8" and change 
the reference line offset to the home story to 8'-8".
2.	 Draw the beam by making a start point at the west wall above the stairs and 
end point at the east wall:

Annotation
Annotation is the text notes, labels, tags, and dimensions on your drawings. In 
ArchiCAD, the annotation adjusts its size based on your drawing scale. The following 
is a set of exercises for the main annotation types that you will use in ArchiCAD.
The Text tool
When you use the Text tool in ArchiCAD, you are essentially creating paragraphs. 
These paragraphs are referred to as text blocks. If you are an AutoCAD user, you 
will think of them as Mtext elements. You can format the text block as a whole or 
have differing formats within the same text block.
ArchiCAD uses the point system to measure the size of text (and also millimeters). 
The size is also blind to the drawing scale. In other words, it does not matter what 
scale your view is at; your text will always be the same point size. Another important 
thing to note is that a text's pen assignment has no effect on the printed thickness. 
But we can address that in a later chapter.
The following is an exercise to add text blocks to aid in the identification of elements 
on the first floor:
1.	 Open the first floor viewpoint from the project map and set the view scale to 
¼"=1'-0". Zoom in on the living room.
2.	 Start the Text tool in the Toolbox palette. Look at the Info Box palette; it 
contains the standard formatting tools. Set the layer to A-ANNO-TEXT. Set 
the text height to 6.75. Change the arrowhead height to 4.
3.	 The next step is to define the width of the text block that you want to place 
by windowing the text block boundary with two cursor clicks (also referred 
to as a rubber band rectangle). Do this over the coffee table object:
a.	 The text format palette will appear
b.	 Type in COFFEE TABLE
c.	 Finish the text block by clicking anywhere outside of the text editor 
or by pressing Ctrl + Enter
4.	 Create text blocks for other objects in the living and dining rooms, such as 
WORK DESK and DINING ROOM TABLE.

5.	 If your text block disappears after you have placed it on an object, you can 
find and select your text block with a window selection, change the display 
order property of your text block, and bring it to the front (right-click on it 
and then navigate to Display Order | Bring to Front).
Edit existing text blocks
To edit a text block after it has been placed, perform the followings steps:
1.	 Activate the Text tool.
2.	 Select the text block with the arrow tool by clicking on an end, or midpoint, 
hot spot, or with a partial elements window.
3.	 Click inside the text block. The text editor will appear.
An alternative to these steps is to turn on the quick select feature and double-click on 
the text block. Then, the text editor will appear.
The Label tool
The Label tool is essentially the same as the text tool with a built-in leader function 
and a connection to the objects. You start by drawing the leader (pointer) with 
three clicks. Then, you draw the rubber band rectangle to define the width of the 
text block:
1.	 Zoom in on the kitchen.
2.	 Start the Label tool in the Toolbox palette. Go to the Info Box palette and 
set the layer to A-ANNO-TEXT. Set the text height to 6.75. Change the 
arrowhead height to 4.
3.	 Click your first of the three leader points on the dishwasher to define the 
label pointer and then draw the rectangle to define the text block width. 
Type in DISHWASHER.

4.	 Create text labels for the electric range and the refrigerator.
Go through the rest of the house and place the text blocks and labels 
where appropriate.
Instead of grabbing the scroll bar on the Info Box palette with your 
cursor, hover over the Info Box palette and use the scroll wheel on 
your mouse to scroll through all the settings.
The Dimension tool
Dimensions are created by first defining the reference points to be dimensioned, 
then placing the dimension line. The Dimension tool has an associative function that 
connects to elements (via reference points) and it will change automatically when the 
elements are moved, although you can opt to make a dimension static via the Info 
Box palette or the Dimension Selection Settings window.
Dimensions are composed of five main components as shown here:
a.	 Dimension point
b.	 Dimension line
c.	 Dimension unit
d.	 Marker
e.	 Witness line

The following screenshot is a graphic representation of the preceding dimension 
type list:
Creating your first dimension
Perform the following steps to create your first dimension:
1.	 Hide the A-ANNO-NOTE layer and unhide A-DIMS. Open the first floor 
viewpoint and zoom in on the kitchen, at the pantry closet.
2.	 Select the Dimension tool in the Toolbox palette. Go to the Info Box palette 
and change the font size to 6.75.
3.	 Click on the bottom two inside corners of the pantry closet. With each click, 
the pencil cursor will turn black to signify that you are at an endpoint. A 
successful click will leave behind a temporary symbol called a reference 
point that looks like a circle with a cross inside.
4.	 Double-click above and in-between your first two clicks to place the 
dimension line. This will bring up the hammer cursor; move it to where you 
want your dimension line. Click one more time to place the dimension line.
Go through the rest of the house and create dimensions. Refer to the wall modeling 
exercises in Chapter 1, Project Setup and Modeling a Residential Project, and place your 
dimensions according to those plan views.

on a point to be dimensioned. Or select the dimension, click on the dimension line 
and the pet palette will appear. Then, click on the Insert/Merge Dimension Point 
button and then click on a new point.
To edit the length of the witness line, select the dimension and click on the 
dimension line. The pet palette will appear. Then, click on the Edit Length of 
witness line button. Finally, click to place the new witness line endpoint.
To override the text value with your own custom text, select the dimension unit text. 
Go to the Info Box palette and change Measured Value to Custom Text. Clear the 
box that has <MeasuredValue> and type in your own custom text.
Summary
In this chapter, you populated your house with furniture, casework, and plumbing 
fixtures. Along the way, you learned more about the dynamics of objects and 
their many changeable parameters. We took a step back into a little modeling, 
by modifying the mesh (landscape) object in order to accommodate for the low 
basement windows. You were introduced to the drafting tools, text tools, and 
Dimension tool.

We are ready to take the next step and learn how to control the look of your drawing 
elements and create construction documents that are referred to as layouts and also 
known as sheets!

Residential Project
So far, we have focused on creating things. Now, it's time to focus on controlling 
how these things are displayed. In this chapter, you will learn about graphic controls 
and sheet setup. This is an extremely important topic to comprehend because 
understanding how to control your graphics is the key to good-quality drawings. 
The topics we will cover in this chapter are as follows:
•	
The project workflow
•	
View Map and Layout Book
•	
Layer Combinations
•	
Elevations & Sections
•	
Enlarged Plans
•	
Annotation
•	
Schedules
The project workflow
Once you understand the project workflow in ArchiCAD, you will know how to 
produce excellent drawings. Let's start with the fundamentals. The workflow in 
ArchiCAD can be divided into four steps, which are as follows:
1.	 Creation: modeling, objects, drafting, and annotation
2.	 Graphic Control: view control (layers, model view options, and view scale)
3.	 Documentation: sheets
4.	 Collaboration: printing and file exports

Take a look at the workflow legend, as follows:
These steps are managed in ArchiCAD within the Navigator palette and the 
Organizer palette:
1.	 Navigate to Project Map | Creation, as shown in this screenshot:
2.	 Go to View Map | Graphics & Creation, as shown in the following

3.	 Then, navigate to Layout Map | Documentation, as shown in this screenshot:
4.	 Next, go to Publisher | Collaboration, as shown here:
View Map
The view map is where you control the graphic display of your drawings. It is also 
where you organize all your drawing views. A well-configured view map will 
ensure a well-managed project.
When you open the view map for the first time, you will see several folders already 
present there. Each one has its own purpose and view settings. Each view contains 
settings for layer combination, scale, pen set, model view options, and more.

The View Map palette
The view map palette is where you create and manage your views. Before you begin 
creating views, you should be familiar with the features of the palette. Refer to the 
following legend that is used in the following screenshot:
a.	 View Settings
b.	 Save Current View
c.	 New Folder
d.	 Clone a Folder
e.	 Delete

Project views
What you see in project map is the result of what just happens to be the current 
view setting, that is, model view option or layer combination. What you see in a 
View Map view is controlled and saved within that view's settings. When you open 
multiple views from within the project map, the view settings stay the same. As soon 
as you open a view from View Map, you will get the opened view's view settings.
Layer combinations
Click on the view map folder named CD Floor Plans. This is where your floor 
plans for the complete building are kept, which will be placed on your sheets. 
Open the first floor plan and notice that the layer combination assigned to the view 
is Floor Plan. There are a couple layers that need to be unhidden and saved to the 
Floor Plan layer combination, which can be done by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the layer settings manager window (Ctrl + L).
2.	 Select the Floor Plan layer combination from the left pane.
3.	 From the right pane, unhide the A-EQMT and A_FURN layers.
4.	 Then, click on the Update button.
5.	 Finally, click on OK.
There will inevitably be annotation items overlapping each other, which shouldn't be 
the case. To improve the clarity of your drawings, go through the first floor, second 
floor, and basement views. Then, move the room tags, dimensions, and text away 
from each other.
To move the door tags, select the door, click on the hot spot at the center of the tag 
and drag it, as shown in the following screenshot. The same process works for the 
window tags.

The ceiling plan views
You need to create a set of views for your ceiling plans to show the locations of your 
lights. Ceiling plans are graphically different from regular floor plans. Because of 
this, we need a separate set of views that have their own model views. This situation 
calls for the creation of a clone folder.
Cloning a folder
A clone folder is a complete copy of a viewpoint category from the project map, such 
as stories, sections, or elevations, with its own view settings saved. Here is how to 
create one for your ceiling plans:
1.	 From the view map, click on the Clone a Folder button. The Clone a Folder 
configuration window will appear.
2.	 In the Identification panel, click on Stories, change the Name setting 
to Custom and enter CD Ceiling Plans in the text box. (CD stands for 
construction documents).
3.	 In the General panel, change Layer Combination to Reflected Ceiling Plan, 
set the Scale to 1/4" = 1'-0", the model view options to Reflected Ceiling 
Plan, and Renovation Filter to 04 New Construction.
4.	 In the 2D/3D Documents panel, change the zooming to Fit in window.
5.	 Click on the Clone button.
6.	 Find the new folder in View Map; select it and drag it up to the position just 
below CD floor plans.
Layer preparation for reflected ceiling plans
There will be a couple of layers you will want to hide in the Reflected Ceiling Plan 
layer combination. Hide the following layers:
•	
A-ANNO-TEXT
•	
A-DIMS
Use the same process explained earlier in this chapter to update a layer combination.

Lighting
Light fixture objects in ArchiCAD are called Lamps. Now that you have your ceiling 
views ready, you can insert the lamp objects you need to light the inside of your 
house. They are as follows:
1.	 Open the second floor view under the CD Ceiling Plans folder.
2.	 Click on the Lamp tool on the Toolbox palette (located under the More 
panel). Click on the Lamp setting button on the Info Box palette.
3.	 Navigate to 26 Electrical 19 | 26 51 00 Interior Lighting 19 and select Ceiling 
Lamp 19.
4.	 Under the Parameters panel, change the Style to Type 2.
5.	 Under the Parameters panel, click on Show Text, and then enter the letter A 
in the text box.
6.	 Place one in the center of each bedroom.
The following screenshot shows the Lamp option:
Use the following list and plan the following drawings to finish placing light fixtures 
in the house:

Light fixture schedule
To help us quantify the light fixtures to be installed in our house, we will create a 
very basic light fixture schedule, as follows:
1.	 Navigate to Document menu | Schedules and Lists | Schedules | 
Scheme Settings.
2.	 Then, the Scheme Settings window will appear. Click on the New button.
3.	 Enter LIGHT FIXTURE SCHEDULE in the Name box and leave the ID box empty.
4.	 Expand the Criteria panel and change the element type to Lamp.
5.	 Expand the Fields panel and click on the Add... button, the Available 
Parameters window will appear. Then, expand General, select Library Part 
Name, and click on the Add button. Then, select Quantity and click on the 
Add button.
6.	 You'll need a parameter that is not available by default the Text parameter:
°°
Click on the delta symbol at the right of the Add button at 
the bottom of the Scheme Settings window and click on Add

Elevation views
Open one of the elevation views from View Map in the CD Elevations clone 
folder. You will see the basement level and mesh you created to represent the land. 
This would be fine if it were a section (except the mesh should be as deep as the 
basement), but we want the exterior elevation views to show what you would see if 
you were standing outside looking at the house. We will change the vertical setting 
on each of the elevations to remove the below ground view by performing the 
following steps:
1.	 Go to the View Map and open the CD Elevations clone folder. Right-click on 
the EAST ELEVATION view. Click on Elevation Settings. The Elevation 
Selection Settings window will appear.
2.	 On the General panel, change the Vertical Range to Limited. In the top box, 
enter 30' and click on OK.
3.	 Do the same for the other three elevation views in the CD Elevations 
clone folder.

Elevation markers
Notice that on any of the plan views, the elevation markers are pretty far away from 
the exterior walls. Open the 1st Floor Plan view and move each of the markers closer 
to the house. This will ensure that when you place the floor plan views on a sheet, 
the elevation tags will appear on the view without taking up too much space on the 
sheet and leaving too much white space on the view.
Enlarged plans
Some rooms in the house will require an enlarged scale drawing because there is 
too much stuff to fit in a one-fourth drawing. This is typical for rooms that have 
casework and plumbing fixtures. We will create enlarged plans for the kitchen and 
the bathroom.

The Detail tool
The Detail tool is what you use to draw the call-outs and markers on the plan. Each 
time you use it, it will create a new large-scale view under the Details folder in the 
project map. We will start our experience with the Detail tool by tweaking the detail 
default settings, as follows:
1.	 Double-click on the Detail tool icon in the Toolbox palette. This will open the 
Detail Default Settings window. Expand the Marker panel.
2.	 Go to the Parameters pane and expand Marker Geometry. Then, make the 
following changes:
°°
Editable Polygon Radius: On
°°
Polygon Radius: 1'
°°
Polygon Line Type: Dashed Long
3.	 On the Parameters pane, expand 2D Representation. Make the following 
changes to make the line weights a little bit bolder:
°°
Contour Pen: 7
°°
Division Line Pen: 7
°°
Marker Line Pen Color: 7

Enlarged plan views
We need to create new floor plan views of the areas that have many items in a small 
space and require more annotations. To do this effectively, we will use a scale that 
increases the size of the drawing elements. We will do this for three rooms: the 
kitchen, laundry room and bathroom.
The first thing you should do, however, is create a folder in the view map to put your 
new views into:
1.	 Go to the View Map and click on the New Folder button.
2.	 The Create New Folder dialog box will pop-up; enter CD Enlarged Plans.
3.	 Click on the Create button.
4.	 Drag the new folder into a position above CD Elevations and below CD 
Demo Plans.
Layer preparation for enlarged plans
The notes that you put onto the enlarged plans will need to be on their own layer, 
specifically for the enlarged plans, and the same is true for dimensions. Create a new 
layer called A-ANNO-TEXT-024 and create another layer named A-DIMS-024. The 
number at the end of the name denotes the scale of the drawings that it will be used 
up on.
The layer combination for the enlarged plans will need to be modified in order to 
show casework, appliances, and plumbing fixtures, as follows:
1.	 First, open the Layer Settings manager (Ctrl + L).
2.	 Select the Enlarged Plan layer combination in the left pane.
3.	 Unhide the following layers in the left pane:
°°
A-ANNO-TEXT-024
°°
A-DIMS-024
°°
A-CSWK
°°
A-EQMT
°°
A-FLOR-FIXT
4.	 Hide the A-ANNO-TEXT, A-MARK-SECT, and A-ROOF layers.
5.	 Click on the Update button in the bottom-left corner. Then, click on OK. 
If you don't use the Update button, your changes will not be saved on 
layer combination.

Kitchen
There is an abundance of activity in the kitchen, so much so that we need a 
large-scale plan in order to legibly document it:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR PLAN view from the CD Floor Plans clone folder in 
the view map. Then, zoom into the kitchen.
2.	 Start the Detail tool from the Toolbox palette. In the Info Box palette, change 
the ID to P-101 and Name to KITCHEN.
3.	 You will be prompted (at the bottom of the screen) to enter the first corner of 
the rectangle detail polygon. Do that to define the boundary polygon of the 
enlarged plan view, as follows:
a.	 Click on the top-left part outside the exterior wall of the kitchen.
b.	 Click on the bottom-right corner of the kitchen, outside the 
kitchen wall.
4.	 Then, the hammer cursor will appear. Click on a blank area just outside the 
detail polygon that you created (to finish the command). The detail marker 
will be placed.
5.	 Open your new view, go to the project map, and open P-101 KITCHEN from 
under the Details folder; or open it by selecting the detail marker, right click 
on it, and select Open Detail Drawing.
6.	 After you open the view, click on the Fit in the Window button at the bottom 
of your view window.
7.	 Then, create a new view in the view map. From the Navigator | View Map 
palette, click the Save current view button and the Save View window will 
appear. Make the following changes:
a.	 Layer Combination: Enlarged Plan.
b.	 Scale: 1/2" = 1'-0".
c.	 Model View Options: Construction Documents.
d.	 Dimensions: Enlarged Scale.
e.	 Click on the Create button.
8.	 Drag your new view into the CD Enlarged Plans folder that you created.

9.	 Open the enlarged kitchen plan view, add notes and dimensions per the 
following screenshot, and use the A-ANNO-TEXT-024 layer.
Laundry room
The laundry room contains casework and appliances. This room will also require an 
enlarged plan view, as follows:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR PLAN view from the CD Floor Plans clone folder in 
the view map. Then, zoom into the kitchen.
2.	 Start the Detail tool from the Toolbox palette. In the Info Box palette, change 
the ID to P-102 and Name to LAUNDRY RM.

The bathroom is another room that requires a large-scale plan view to provide space 
for detailed documentation:
1.	 Open the 2nd FLOOR PLAN view from the CD Floor Plans clone folder in 
the view map. Zoom into the bathroom.
2.	 Start the Detail tool from the Toolbox palette. In the Info Box palette, change 
the ID to P-103 and Name to BATH RM.
3.	 Follow step three through eight from the kitchen exercise earlier.
4.	 Open the enlarged bath room plan view and add notes and dimensions as 
per the following screenshot; use layer A-ANNO-TEXT-024.
Sections
A section view shows a perpendicular view of something that has been cut vertically. 
When we speak of sections within construction documents, we usually mean 
building or wall sections. Building sections contain all the stories of a building, 
and a wall section is either just a single wall spanning all stories or one story.
Sections are created using the Section tool, placing the marker symbology on the 
plan view with two clicks. When you use the tool, it looks as if you are just creating 
a 2D symbol, but you are also creating a vertical slice view inside your model.

Layer preparation for sections
Open the Layer Settings window, select the Sections layer combination, and unhide 
the following layers:
•	
A-CSWK
•	
A-ANNO-TEXT-024
Don't forget to click on the Update button!
Let's start by creating two building sections. These sections should be strategically 
located to show activity in your building that may not be described fully by a floor 
plan. Your first section will cut through the stair (north to south) and the second will 
cut through the center of the house at the kitchen pantry (east to west):
1.	 Go to View Map and click on the 1st FLOOR PLAN view from under CD 
Floor Plans.
2.	 Double-click on the section tool icon to open the default settings. The Section 
Default Settings window will appear.
3.	 Make the following edits under the General panel and then click on OK:
°°
Reference ID: S-101
°°
Name: BUILDING SECTION – NORTH SOUTH
4.	 Enter the first node of your section line by clicking below the exterior wall 
below the front hall closest. Enter your second node above the kitchen 
(orthogonally) exterior wall. Then, the ArchiCAD eyeball cursor will appear. 
It will prompt you to click on one side of the section line to set the view 
direction and define the horizontal range (depth of view). Click on the 
right side of the section line past the dining room wall.
5.	 If the section line is not positioned well, you can move it to where it needs 
to go. You can change the length of the section line by dragging one of the 
hotspots on the section line at the marker. You can also change the reference 
ID and name of a section at any time via the Section Selection Settings 
(Ctrl + T) or from the Info Box palette.
6.	 Double-click on the section tool icon again to bring up the section default 
settings window. Make the following edits under the General panel and 
then click on OK:

7.	 Enter the first node of your section line to the left of the garage along with the 
kitchen pantry closet. Complete the section line by clicking on the opposite 
end of the house just outside the exterior wall. When the eyeball cursor 
appears, click anywhere above the section line and the north garage wall.
8.	 Select one of your new section lines. You should see where your horizontal 
range is (it is denoted by lines and a hotspot). You can drag that hotspot if 
you need to reposition the horizontal range. The following screenshot shows 
both section lines selected, showing their horizontal range and hotspots

Interior elevations
The Interior Elevation tool is different from the standard elevation tool because it 
is designed to recognize single story views. It is also designed to accommodate the 
multiple walls that any room may have. We will use it to create elevations of interior 
walls that have a significant amount of detail.
The next exercise will take you through the creation of interior elevations for the 
kitchen and laundry room because of all the casework in those rooms. In addition, 
you will create an elevation in the bathroom to sufficiently show the vanity and 
wall-mounted light fixtures.

The layer combination used for these views will be Sections by default. This is what 
we want, so we will keep it that way.
The standard elevation markers and views were already created inside 
the project template we use to start this project with. Since this is a 
fairly simple building design, we will not need to create any additional 
standard elevations.
Kitchen
The abundance of vertical objects such as cabinets and appliances in the kitchen 
makes it a prime location for interior elevations. The following steps will show you 
how to easily create an interior elevation of each wall in the kitchen:
1.	 Go to View Map, open the 1st FLOOR PLAN view from under CD Floor 
Plans, and zoom into the kitchen.
2.	 Click on the Interior Elevation tool icon. Then, go to the Info Box palette and 
check the following:
°°
Ensure that the construction method is set to Rectangular
°°
Change the interior elevation name in the Name box to INTERIOR 
ELEVATION @ KITCHEN
°°
Change the Marker reference to The first placed drawing of 
the viewpoint
3.	 The next step is to pick points in the plan view to define a rectangle along the 
extents of the room, to define the interior elevation limit line (depth of view). 
Then, a third point to define the standpoint distance (starting viewpoint), 
as follows:
°°
First, click on the rectangle, just beyond the walls of the kitchen, in 
the top-left corner; secondly, click on the opposite corner beyond the 
work desk.

°°
Then, click inside the room so that the standpoint limit is well within 
the room. Refer to the following screenshot (some layers here have 
been hidden for clarity):
Go to the CD Interior Elevations folder in the view map and check out your four 
new interior elevations, as follows:
1.	 Select the IE-01 INTERIOR ELEVATION @ KITCHEN interior elevation 
group. Click on the Settings button at the bottom of the View Map palette.
2.	 Change the scale to 1/2" = 1'-0" (under the General panel).

Here is a screenshot of the Layout Book palette; refer to the preceding alphabetic list:
Master Layout
A Master Layout is a title block. A project can have multiple master layouts and they 
are managed via the Layout Book palette. Master layouts work similar to an Xref or 
block in AutoCAD. When you make a change to a master, it automatically updates 
all the instances of where that master is used. And master layouts are similar to how 
a title block family works in Revit but editing a master is easier than changing a 
family in Revit. Masters have their own view environment within the project, which 
allows you to edit just like a regular drawing view.
For our project, we will be using the Arch-D master. Arch-D is a 24'' x 3'' sheet and a 
standard size for small- to medium-size buildings.
If you open a layout (sheet) and the title block lines and text do not 
appear, go to the View pull-down menu and then navigate to On-Screen 
View Options | Master Items onto Layout.

Drawings (views onto layouts)
A view placed on a layout is referred to as a drawing. Go to the Toolbox palette 
under Document and there, you will find the Drawing tool. Open the default 
settings window and look around to get familiar with what's there.
New layouts (sheets)
The template file that we used to create this project did not provide a sheet for the 
basement story views. We will start working in the layout book by creating a new 
sheet for the basement plans.
Floor plan sheets
The floor plan drawings are usually the main focus of any project, so we will start 
with the floor plans:
1.	 Go to the Layout Book palette and click on the A-1 PLANS subset icon. Click 
on the New Layout button. The Create New Layout window will appear and 
perform the following steps:
a.	 Under Layout Identification, select the Custom ID radio button and 
enter A-100.
b.	 In the Name box, enter BASEMENT PLAN.
c.	 Click on the Create button.
2.	 The sheet will be placed under the 2nd FLOOR PLAN sheet in the view map. 
Select your new basement plan sheet and drag it up above the 1st FLOOR 
PLAN sheet, as shown in the following screenshot:

floor plan view that is already on the layout and move it to the right to make 
room for the ceiling plan.
4.	 Change the Navigator palette to the view map and open the CD Ceiling 
Plans folder. Drag the 1. 1st FLOOR view from that folder on to the sheet. 
Place it to the left of the floor plan already on the sheet.
5.	 Open the A-102 2nd FLOOR PLAN layout. Select the floor plan view 
that is already on the sheet and move it to the right to make room for 
the ceiling plan.
6.	 Change the Navigator palette to the view map. Open the CD Ceiling Plans 
folder. Drag the 2. 2nd FLOOR view from that folder on the layout. Place it 
to the left of the floor plan, which is already there.
Creating sheets for sections
To create a sheet for your sections, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Layout Book palette and click on the A-3 SECTIONS subset icon. 
Click on the New Layout button. The Create New Layout window will 
appear. Then perform the following steps:
a.	 Under Layout Identification, select the Custom ID radio button

2.	 Then, open the A-401 DETAILS layout.
3.	 Go to the view map and drag and drop each of the detail views under CD 
Enlarged Plans onto the layout.
Creating a sheet for interior elevations
Here, we will create a sheet for the interior elevation views using the following steps:
1.	 Right click on the A-2 ELEVATIONS layout folder from the Layout Book 
palette. Select Create New Layout from the right-click menu.
2.	 Enter INTERIOR ELEVATIONS in the Name box.
3.	 Then, switch to the view map.
4.	 Drag-and-drop the first interior elevation group onto the layout (all 
four interior elevations should appear on the layout).
5.	 Drag-and-drop the second interior elevation group onto the layout.
6.	 Finally, drag-and-drop the single bathroom interior elevation onto the layout.
Schedules sheet
Let's create a sheet for your schedules using the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Layout Book palette and click on the A-5 SCHEDULES subset 
icon. Click on the New Layout button. The Create New Layout window will 
appear. Then perform the following steps:

[ 110 ]
2.	 Open the A-501 SCHEDULES layout from the Layout Book palette. Switch 
to the view map and drag-and-drop the LIGHT FIXTURE SCHEDULE you 
created onto the sheet.
3.	 Notice that the schedule drawing was given a title bar and scale. You do not 
need a title on a schedule because it already has a title built into it. So, we will 
turn off the title bar with the following steps:
a.	 Select the schedule on the sheet and press Ctrl + T to open the 
Drawing Selection Settings window.
b.	 Go to the Title panel at the bottom. Change the title from NCS 
Drawing Title to No Title, and click on OK.
4.	 Place the other two schedules in the view map, Door Schedule, and Window 
Schedule onto the A-501 SCHEDULES layout. Follow step 2 to turn off their 
title bars as well.
You can change the drawing default settings to use no title before placing 
the schedules views on the layout. You just need to remember to set it 
back to your standard title when you are done.
Printing
You will learn that printing in ArchiCAD offers you a robust array of features. There 
are three ways in which you can print something from ArchiCAD. You can use the 
Print command, Plot command, or Publisher using a preconfigured publisher set. 
The Print command is typically used for your small format printing, such as 1'' x 17'' 
and smaller. The Plot command is typically used for everything larger than 1'' x 17''.
You can print a view, single sheet, or multiple sheets at a time or just the area within 
a marquee in a view.
Setting up to print or plot
Before you plot anything on a large-format printer (known as a plotter), you need to 
configure the plot setup for your plotter type— the connection port/path, sheet size, 
and location of your spool folder, as follows:
1.	 Go to the File menu and select Plot Setup…. The Plot Setup window 
will appear.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
[ 111 ]
2.	 Select the manufacturer (make) of your plotter from the top drop-down list. 
Then, select the model number from the second drop-down list.
If your plotter make and model does not appear in the list, use Hewlett-
Packard, HP Design Jet 650C.
3.	 Set your paper size category and size designation.
4.	 Click on the Setup button under the Connection heading and set it to 
connect to your plotter.
5.	 Click on the Select button under the Spool Folder heading and set it 
to a location where you would want to save your plot files.
6.	 Click on OK.

Page setup
Setting up for printing using a small-format printer with the Print command is a bit 
simpler than the plot setup. It assigns the printer, paper size and orientation:
1.	 Go to the File menu and select Page Setup. The Page Setup window will 
appear.
2.	 Select your printer from the Name list. If the printer you want to use is 
not in the list, then click on the Network button and browse connect to 
a new printer.
3.	 Then, set your paper size and orientation.
4.	 Click on OK.
The page setup example
Plotting a layout
For our first printing task, let's plot a single full-size sheet with the Plot command, 
as follows:
1.	 Open the A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN layout from the Layout Book palette.
2.	 Go to the File menu and click on Plot… The Plot Layout window will open.
3.	 Under the Destination heading, select Plotter.
4.	 Under the Source heading, select Active Layout.
5.	 Under the Resize heading, select Custom. If the value is less than 100 
percent, then don't worry; it is acceptable because there is a margin 
to accommodate.
6.	 Under Margin Options, select Use Plotter Margin.

[ 113 ]
7.	 Under Plot with… you can select whatever is appropriate for your plotter 
and needs, such as Color, Grayscale, or Black and White.
8.	 Under the Arrangement heading, you will see a blue rectangle 
representing the layout graphics inside a black rectangle that represents the 
paper's edge.
9.	 Finally, click on the Plot button.
The Plot Layout window
Printing a layout (to fit)
Now, let's print that same layout to a small format printer, scaled to fit within a letter 
size print:
1.	 Keep the same layout open from the preceding exercise. Go to the File menu 
and select Print or press the key combination of Ctrl + P. The Print Layout 
window will open.
2.	 The printer will be identified at the top of the window. If it is incorrect, then 
click on the Page Setup button and assign the correct printer.
3.	 Under the Source heading, select Entire Layout.
4.	 Under the Size heading, select Fit to Page.

5.	 Under the Arrangement heading, the blue rectangle should fit inside the 
black rectangle (there should only be one black rectangle).
6.	 Compare the other settings to the following screenshot.
7.	 Finally, click on the Print button.
The Print Layout window
Printing multiple drawings
Printing multiple layouts or sets of drawings is best handled via the Publisher. Refer 
to Chapter 8, Work Sharing with ArchiCAD, to learn how to create a Publisher set.
Exporting files
ArchiCAD can export to a multitude of different file formats. The most commonly 
used formats are PDF and DWG. The simplest method is to use the Save As 
command from the File menu:
1.	 Open any layout or view.
2.	 Go to the File menu and select Save as.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 3
[ 115 ]
3.	 At the bottom of the Save as window, click on the button next to the Save as 
Type option. You will see that there are seven types of ArchiCAD formats 
and 12 other file formats:
°°
The top four formats in the list will export the entire project file with 
views, layouts, and so on.
°°
The remaining formats in the list will save only the current view or 
layout. If you need to export to 3D, you will need to have a 3D view 
open when you export your file.
The file formats available for export with the Save As command
In addition to the Save As method, PDF files can also be created via the 
Print command. You need to have a PDF printer installed on your 
computer, such as Adobe PDF or another PDF creation program.
Exporting multiple files
Exporting multiple files at a time is best handled by the Publisher. Refer to Chapter 8, 
Work Sharing with ArchiCAD, to learn how to export multiple files with a publisher set.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the project workflow of ArchiCAD as it relates 
to the documentation. You set up views with the view map and created sheets 
in the Layout Book palette. You also configured layer combinations and learned 
about schedules. All of this fits into the overall project workflow in ArchiCAD. 
The next phase in our workflow adventure takes us into the world of printing and 
collaboration. This is where the Publisher (a part of the Navigator palette) comes 
into play.

Project Setup and Modeling 
Part 1 – A Healthcare 
Building Project
Here we go; it is now time to start our healthcare building! Aside from being bigger 
than the residential project that we made, this project will have more views, sheets, and 
linked files. This chapter will cover the initial project setup and creation of the core and 
shell model elements. The following is a list of the main topics covered in this chapter:
•	
Project settings
•	
Hotlinks and Xrefs (abbreviation for external reference file)
•	
Columns and column grids
•	
Exterior walls
•	
Floors and roofs
Project setup
You will want to create a few file folders on your computer (or network server) to 
contain the multiple files used in your new project with the help of the following steps:
1.	 Find a good location for your top-level project folder and name the folder 
Commercial_Project.
2.	 Open the new folder and create the following sub folders for exporting 
PDF and DWG files and a folder for your custom objects and files to be 
used as Xrefs:

Notice the underscore in the project folder name just outlined. It is 
always a good idea to avoid using spaces in folder names. This lends 
itself to avoiding broken hyperlinks when you or anyone else needs 
to send project folder paths to other users.
You will create your core and shell model with ArchiCAD's commercial project 
template. The template will have all the basic stuff you need to get started. Open 
ArchiCAD and then perform the following steps:
1.	 The Start ArchiCAD dialog box will appear. Select Create a New Project 
radio button at the top.
2.	 Select the Use a Template radio button under Set up Project Settings.
3.	 Then, select ArchiCAD 19 Commercial Template.tpl from the drop down list.
4.	 Next, click on New. This will open a blank project file.
5.	 Go to the File menu and click on Save.
6.	 Browse to your new project folder—Commercial_Project. Name your file 
Commercial_Bldg-Shell.
7.	 Finally, click on Save.
Project settings
We are going to create a building with eight stories, which includes a story for the 
roof, stair bulkhead, and basement. The template that we just opened only has two 
storeys so we need to add six more.

Hotlinks
The hotlink project will be comprised of multiple ArchiCAD model files. These files 
will be "hotlinked" into each other. These are also referred to as hotlink modules. 
This means that they will be embedded inside each other with a connection to the 
original file, which can be updated at any time.
When to split your project model and when not to
There is no exact formula for when you need to split your project models up. The 
answer lies within the combination of key factors such as building size and the 
number of ArchiCAD users that will be working in the models and your computer 
resources. Start with as few models that you feel necessary and then split when you 
see a strong need for it.
Here are some reasons as to why we split the project into multiple ArchiCAD files:
•	
Size: When model files get big in size (bytes), they start to slow down. I guess 
you could say that computer resources cannot keep up with the demands of 
a BIM project model of any significant size. One day, this may no longer be 
the case. But for now, BIM is still an untamed animal for computer resources.
•	
Teamwork: There is a limit to how many people can be in a single model 
without the workflow slowing down and experiencing delays. This could be 
visualized in the form of a traffic jam.
•	
Crash protection: If one model crashes or is corrupted, you will have a 
different model to work in while the other one gets fixed.

Chapter 4
[ 121 ]
However, to be clear from a model management standpoint, the fewer models in a 
project, the better. Here are some reasons not to split your project models:
•	
Attribute management: Layers are model specific and if you are not careful, 
you will end up with way more layers than you will need. Composite 
structures can get out of whack. A composite can have the same name in two 
different models but can be totally different in structure. The same applies 
with profiles, line types, fill patterns, and materials. This only happens in big 
and long-running projects but it is something to always be aware of.
•	
Jumping in and out of models to work in the same physical area of the 
building: Each time you do this, you need to update the hotlinks. In other 
words, updating the model in one file; then going over to the other file, 
which has the first model linked; and then updating the link.
Importing and exporting attribute settings
You can export your attribute settings to a file (.aat) for importing it in another 
project file, or to use it as a backup for your current project.
To export your attribute settings, do as follows:
1.	 Go to the Options menu and navigate to Element Attributes | 
Attribute Manager….
2.	 Select an attribute category.
3.	 Select the attributes in the left pane.
4.	 Click on the Append button to add to the left pane.
5.	 Finally, click on the Save button.
To import attribute settings, do as follows:
1.	 Open the attribute manager and click on the Open button.
2.	 Browse the attribute file and click on Open.
Xrefs
Xrefs originated in the Autodesk AutoCAD CAD program. They are AutoCAD 
DWG files externally referenced (linked) into each other without actually being 
embedded. We will use floor plan Xrefs as a guide to trace over for locating the 
exterior walls and columns.
You will need to download the DWG files that will be used as Xrefs in our project. 
Go to http://www.packtpub.com and create a new user account (if you have not 
already done so). Go to your Packt account, register this book, and download the 
files associated with this book.

Attaching Xrefs
The first thing to learn about Xrefs is how to attach them. If you are an AutoCAD 
user, this should be a familiar process. Let's attach the Xref for the first floor:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR viewpoint from the project map.
2.	 Go to the File menu and navigate to External Content | Attach Xref….
3.	 After the Attach Xref window will opens, browse the file Xref_Bldg-
Shell-01.dwg.
4.	 Set the reference type to Overlay.
5.	 Un-check the box for Insertion Point, Scale, and Rotation.
6.	 Set the Anchor Point to Drawing's own origin.
7.	 Place on Story 1. 1st FLOOR.

Xref layers
When you attach an Xref, your project file will gain the layers within Xref. Open the 
layer settings manager. Scroll to the bottom of the layer list and you will see that all 
the Xref layers are separated from the ArchiCAD layers. The Xref is not placed on a 
particular ArchiCAD layer but controlled via all the layers contained inside. In other 
words, you cannot assign an Xref to a specific layer.
If you wish, you can hide the Xref layers from being displayed in the 
Layers list. Go to the upper-right corner of the layer settings manager 
and click on the Layer filter button. Then, click on Hide Xref layers 
(this only hides the layers in the list view and not on your drawings).

Layer combinations
Your new Xref layers will not be shown in any of your existing layer combinations. 
You should unhide them in the layer combination you intend to use for drafting or 
modeling. Let's update the layer combination named Drafting:
1.	 Open the layer settings manager (Ctrl + L).
2.	 Click on the Drafting layer combination in the Layer Combinations pane.
3.	 Then, select all the Xref layers in the Layers pane.
4.	 Click on the big Show button (open eye) at the lower-right corner of 
the pane.
5.	 Finally, click on the Update button.
More about the ArchiCAD GUI
Working on a bigger project will mean that you will change settings and attributes 
more often than compared to a small project. It is recommended that you take 
advantage of some of ArchiCAD's palettes and toolbars to improve your 
production speed.
The Quick Options palette
To help make setting changes go quicker, you will want to have the Quick Options 
palette on your screen. This allows you to quickly change the current layer 
combination, view scale, model view options, pen set, and more.
Go to the Window menu and select Palettes, Quick Options. Place the palette where 
you like. Typically, it is placed under the Navigator palette.
The Attributes toolbar
In the early stages of any project, you will be modifying with various attribute 
settings. The Attributes toolbar will save you many clicks and it is highly 
recommended that you use it.
Right click on any toolbar already on your screen (or right clicking on a blank space 
in the toolbar area will work too). The right click menu for toolbars will appear. Click 
on Attributes. Then, the Attributes toolbar will appear. Move it to where you want it 
to stay.

Exterior walls
One of the main components of our shell and core model is the exterior walls. We 
will use the wall tool for the majority of the exterior walls and the Curtain Wall tool 
for the main entrance at the northwest corner of the building.
Elevation marks
The default exterior elevation markers need to be moved to accommodate for the size 
and location of our building, which can be done by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR viewpoint form the project map. Zoom out using the 
Fit in Window button at the bottom of the view window.
2.	 Select the North elevation marker and drag it up to the top of the floor plan 
just beyond the column grid. Stretch the endpoints of marker range line so 
that they extend beyond the extents of the building.
3.	 Do the same for the other three elevation markers. Move the east marker to 
the east side, extent the marker range, move the west marker to the west side, 
extend its marker range, and move the south marker to the south side and 
extend its marker range.
An example of the North elevation mark
The Wall tool
Model the external walls on each story using the attached Xrefs as a guide. The wall 
default settings will have the Wall Top set to the story mentioned previously and the 
Home story set to the current story.

Roofs
There are multiple roofs on our building: one over the atrium, one at the roof 
story, and a small roof over all of the stair bulkheads. Each of these roofs will use 
a different composite structure. However, we will create our roofs with the Mesh 
and Shell tool instead of the Roof tool.
The Mesh tool
You will create the main roof with the Mesh tool. Using the line pattern shown on 
the Xref for the Roof story, you will create multiple mesh elements inside each of the 
shapes defined by the pattern. Then, you will assign a height to some of the points to 
create a slope, as follows:
1.	 Open the 5. Roof viewpoint and ensure that the criss-cross line pattern on the 
Xref is shown.
2.	 Open the Mesh Default Settings and double-click on the Mesh icon on the 
Toolbox palette (see the following screenshot).
a.	 Change the height to 1'-4".
b.	 Change the Structure type to Solid Body (third button).
c.	 Change the Building Material to 22-05 40 | Steel Deck.
d.	 Set the layer to A-ROOF.

[ 134 ]
e.	 Finally, click on OK.
3.	 Use the Magic Wand (Spacebar) to create a mesh inside each of the shapes of 
the line pattern.
Do not create a mesh inside the stair shafts or the 
atrium.
4.	 There are five criss-cross intersections on the pattern. The roof drains will be 
placed at these five locations. You need to set the heights of all the points at 
those locations to -1'-0" (negative 1').
5.	 Select a mesh that touches one of the roof drain locations. The mesh will 
be highlighted and points will appear. Click on the point at the roof drain 
location. The pet palette will appear and then click on the Elevate Mesh 
Point button. Change the height to -1'.
6.	 Do this for every mesh that touches a roof drain intersection.

7.	 Now you should have a multi-faceted sloped roof. There will be more ridges 
than what is shown on the Xref pattern. This is okay. See the following 
screenshot of the roof story:
The top view of the Roof mesh
After you have created your mesh elements with the Magic Wand, 
some of your points and ridges may be imperfect.  You will see this 
only after you select a mesh.  You can manually drag points into the 
proper location or create new meshes with the Polygonal Geometry 
,method to ensure the points and boundaries are exact.
Now you can model the walls for the roof top equipment inside the two long 
rectangles at the center of the roof story (refer to the Exterior Walls exercise).
The Shell tool
The Shell tool creates 3D elements that the other typical modeling tools cannot. 
There are three different shell construction methods: Extrusion, Revolve, and 
Ruled. We will use the extrusion method to create the roofs over the stair shafts 
and the Revolve to create the roof over the atrium and entry at northeast wing 
of our building.

9.	 Repeat the preceding steps for the other two stair shafts.
The shell type #1
Shell type #2
The Revolve method with the Simple construction method will create a dome shape 
with three clicks. The first click sets the center, second defines the radius of the dome, 
and third defines the circumference; similar to how the Arc/Circle tool works.
1.	 Open the 5. Roof viewpoint and zoom in on the atrium at the northeast 
corner. There will be a center point drawn in the Xref at the center of the 
atrium that you will use as a guide.
2.	 Start the Shell tool. Go to the Info Box palette and set the Geometry Method 
to Revolved and the Construction Method to Simple. The layer should be 
A-ROOF.
3.	 Make your first click on the center point symbol in the Xref.

Columns and Grids
Our building requires a grid of columns and grid lines. You will learn how to create 
an array of horizontal and vertical column lines form the column grid with the Grid 
tool and Grid System tool.
We will use two column sizes: 12" x 12" and 8" x 8". However, one of the column 
types we need to use requires a profile that is not currently in our project file. 
Therefore, we will need to create it. We need to do a little prep work that involves 
the creation of a new profile and some custom composites.
Using profiles
A profile in ArchiCAD is a 2D line drawing that defines a simple shape, which can 
be used as walls, beams, or columns. It is the cross-section outline. See the example 
profiles in the following image:
The three profile examples
We will begin by duplicating an existing profile and changing it to create the new 
profile that we need, as follows:
1.	 Go to the Options menu and navigate to Element Attributes | Attribute 
Manager. The Attribute Manager window will appear.
2.	 Click on the Profile tab (it looks like the cross-section of an I-beam). Then, 
click on the profile named W8X31. Next, click on the Duplicate button. This 
will create a new profile named W8X31 (2). Select the new profile and from 
the Name box below the list, change the name to W12X31.
3.	 Click on OK. The Confirm Changes window will appear. Then, click on the 
Create button.
4.	 The new profile definition has been created but it is just a duplicate of the 
W8X31 profile. You need to open the profile manager and change its size. 
To do this, go to the Options menu and select Element Attributes. Click on 
Profile Manager. The Profile Manager window will appear.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Project Setup and Modeling Part 1 – A Healthcare Building Project
[ 140 ]
5.	 From the Choose Profile list, select the profile you that created—W12X31 
(if the profile you created is still named W8X31 (2), then open the Attribute 
Manager, select the profile, rename it, click on the Apply button, and click 
on OK).
6.	 Click on the Edit Profile button and the Profile Editor window will open; it 
will contain the fill used for the W8X31 profile. You need to change the fill 
outline to be 12" high by 12" wide. Use the marquee tool to stretch the top 
up 2" and the bottom down 2".
7.	 When finished editing the fill, click the Store Profile button, and close the 
Profile Editor window. See the following screenshot of the Profile Manager:
The Profile Manager window
Composites
A composite is a sandwich of materials that make up the building structure 
elements, such as walls, floors, or roofs. For instance, a typical interior wall will have 
a composite, containing a layer of gypsum board on top of a layer of wood framing 
and a layer of gypsum board at the bottom.
We need to create new composites for three exterior wall types and one for the stair 
bulkhead roofs with the help of the following steps:

The Grid tool
The Grid tool is what you can use to create the column line grid (one grid at a time). 
Each grid element is composed of a grid line and grid marker (commonly referred 
to as a grid bubble). Grid elements that are typically placed on floor plan views will 
appear vertically in sections and elevations. Grid elements can also be placed within 
the 3D views. We will use the Grid tool after we use the Grid System tool.

Using the Grid System tool
Your building needs to have a matrix of columns in place to hold up all the floors. 
These columns will be arranged in a standard rectangular pattern and organized 
by grid lines. You can place grid lines and columns, one at a time, or create them in 
one action with the Grid System tool. We will use the Grid System tool to create six 
horizontal and four vertical grid lines and columns at each grid intersection. To do 
this, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open the Shell model and a ground floor view and zoom in on the lower-left 
corner. We need to create a snap point to place the grid system. To do this, 
we will use the Guide Line tool,
2.	 Click on the Guide Lines button on the Standard toolbar. See the 
following screenshot:
3.	 Click the drop-down button attached to the Guide Lines button and select 
Create Guide Line Segment. See the following screenshot:
4.	 Draw a guide line from the top inside edge of the main southern exterior 
wall to the left, past the end point of the west wall above.

Adjusting the column grid
After you place the column grid system, you will notice that some of the columns are 
partially inside walls. Therefore, you will need to adjust the location of some of the 
columns and grid lines with the help of the following points:
1.	 Zoom in to the bottom of the building at column line A. Select grid line A 
and the four columns on it. Move them up so that the bottom of the two 
middle columns are on the inside edge of the wall.
2.	 Move the column at grid intersection A-1 to the lower-left corner of the stair 
shaft. See the following screenshot:

3.	 Move the column at grid intersection A-4 to the inside edge of the curved 
wall at an angle of 135 degrees. See the following screenshot:
4.	 Then, zoom out and delete the column at grid intersection of F-1.
5.	 Select grid line 1 and the remaining columns along grid line 1 and move 
them to the inside edge of the west exterior wall.
6.	 Zoom in on the elevator shaft and move the column inside the shaft, down to 
the inside edge of the shaft wall at the bottom.
7.	 Zoom in on the upper-right corner of the building and move the column 
at grid intersection F-4 to the inside edge of the top right corner of the 
stair shaft.
8.	 Next, go to the other stories and delete or move the same columns as 
directed next.

Creating additional grid lines
For each column that we moved away from a grid line, we need to create a new grid 
line or two since the columns we moved are no longer conforming to our original 
grid. This is a pretty common occurrence in a commercial project. You can have 90 
percent of your columns conform to a basic grid but additional grid lines will need to 
be created to accommodate the design of the building. To create these additional grid 
lines, perform the following steps:
1.	 Hover your cursor over one of the grids, hold the Alt key down, and click 
(the eye dropper cursor will appear). This will activate the Grid Element 
tool and set all the properties to match the grid you clicked on. See the 
following screenshot:
2.	 Start the Grid Element tool from the Toolbox palette (under More) and draw 
a short horizontal grid line for the column in the elevator shaft.
3.	 Select the grid line you just created, go to the Info Box palette, and change 
the value of Name to E.2. Then, in the Markers panel, check only one box to 
display the bubble on the left endpoint, as shown in the following screenshot:

[ 153 ]
4.	 Do the same for the column in the southwest stair shaft. Since this column 
line will be below column line A, make the name for the new grid line A, 
and change the original A grid to A.1.
5.	 Create a vertical grid element for the column in the southwest stair shaft. 
Name it 0.1 and show the bubble at the bottom endpoint only.
6.	 Go to the southeast corner of the building and create a new vertical and 
horizontal grid element for the column there. Align with the other column 
line above. Name the vertical element 3.9 and horizontal element A.2.
7.	 The horizontal grid element will overlap the A.1 grid so we will need to 
stagger the grid line. Select grid line A.2 and zoom in close to the bubble 
where you will see two magenta grips. Click on one of the farthest from the 
bubble and drag the grip up about 5' and over to the left about 2'. See the 
following screenshot:
8.	 Go to the column in the northeast stair shaft and create a vertical grid 
element named 4.1 and horizontal grid element named F.1. Stagger 
them both.

Summary
In this chapter, we set up the project environment settings for our new building. 
We created the exteriors walls, floors, and roofs for our shell and core model file. 
During those exercises, we created new composite structures for our walls and roof 
shells. The shell & core model will be the first of the three ArchiCAD model files 
that makeup our commercial project. In the next chapter, we will create the interior 
model file.

Hotlinking
A hotlink is an embedded copy of an ArchiCAD model file that is linked to the 
original model file. Whenever the original file is changed, the embedded hotlinked 
copy can be updated.
If you are an AutoCAD user, you can think of a hotlink as a block inside your 
drawing that is linked to an external file. Unlike external reference files (Xrefs) 
in AutoCAD, you don't need the original model file after it is hotlinked.
You can also use hotlinked modules for pieces and parts of your building that 
repeat and are in multiple locations, such as office furniture layouts, and hospital 
exam rooms.
Only ArchiCAD files can be hotlinks.
This lesson will walk you through the process of linking the core and shell 
ArchiCAD model.
Layer preparation for hotlinks
It is a good practice to have a layer for each hotlink in your project. To do so, do 
the following:
1.	 First, open the Layer Settings Manager window (Ctrl + L).
2.	 Then, click on the New button.
3.	 Enter A-HTLK-SHEL as the name.
4.	 Show the new layer in every layer combination at the left. With A-HTLK-
SHEL selected on the right, go to the layer and click on the eye icon next 
to every layer combination.
Hotlink the core and shell model
With the following steps, you will hotlink the model you created in the 
previous chapter:
1.	 Go to the project map and open the 1st FLOOR viewpoint.
2.	 Go to the File menu and navigate to External Content | Place 
Hotlinked Module….

Your shell model is now hotlinked into your interior model. You can open other 
storeys and see that they match what you would see in the shell model.
Moving the elevation marks
In Chapter 4, Project Setup and Modeling Part 1 – A Healthcare Building Project, the 
elevation marks need to be moved in order to properly show the outside of the 
building. Right now they are on the southwest part of the building and need to be 
individually placed into an appropriate location; to do so, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR viewpoint and zoom all the way out by clicking on the 
Fit in Window button at the bottom of your view. You can also just zoom out 
by using the scroll wheel on your mouse.
2.	 Drag the north elevation mark so that it is above the north end of the 
building; drag the east elevation mark to the east of the building and so 
on until they are all placed around the building.

Open the other story viewpoints and repeat the previous steps for each story. Be sure 
that the Place on Story setting matches the story that you are attaching.
Hotlinking the interior model
Our next task is to hotlink the interior model into the shell model. We need to place 
windows on the exterior walls. This needs to be done inside the shell model.
Open the interior model and follow the previous steps that you used for linking the 
shell model into the interior model.
Modeling tools
The interior model will consist mainly of walls (partitions) and objects (doors, 
casework). We will start with modeling the walls. There are two wall composite 
types in our project template that are designed for commercial interior walls. 
These composite types are:
•	
Wall Stl 2x4—1hr UL W403
•	
Wall Stl 2x4—2hr UL W403
These composite types are named according to their fire safety ratings; hence, the 1hr 
and 2hr designations.
Creating new composites
Most of the walls that we need do not need to be fire rated so we will make copies 
of the preceding composites and create a couple of nonrated composite types, 
as follows:
1.	 Open the Composite Structures Attribute Management window Options | 
Element Attributes | Composites….
2.	 Click on the big Composite Structure drop-down button at the top and 
change it to Wall Stl 2x4 - 1hr UL W403.
3.	 Click on the Duplicate button and enter the name Wall Stl 4-7/8". Then, 
click on OK.
4.	 Next, change the composite structure to Wall Stl 2x4 - 2hr UL W403.
5.	 Click on the Duplicate button and enter the name Wall Stl 7-1/8" and 
click on OK.

6.	 Look at the list of skins in the Edit Skin and Line Structure panel. Change 
the thickness of the steel framing skin from 3-5/8" to 4-5/8". See the 
following screenshot. Then, click on OK.
Adjusting layer combinations
You should unhide the Xref layers in the layer combination that you intend to use for 
drafting or modeling. Let's update the layer combination named Drafting with the 
help of the following steps:
1.	 Open the layer settings manager (Ctrl + L).
2.	 Click on the Drafting layer combination in the Layer Combinations pane.
3.	 Then, select all the Xref layers in the Layers pane.
4.	 Finally, click on the Update button.
Modeling the interior walls
Now, you are all set to begin modeling your interior walls. The Xrefs are linked for 
tracing over, and you have the composite types for each wall type you will need. 
You will set the wall height, composite, and the layer:
1.	 Open the first floor viewpoint from the project map and set the active layer 
combination to Drafting.

2.	 Double-click on the Wall tool to open the wall default settings and expand 
the Geometry and Positioning panel.
°°
Change the top offset setting from 0" to -6" (negative 6"). This will 
bring the wall up to the underside of the floor slab above.
°°
Set the composite to Wall Stl 4-7/8" and select OK.
3.	 Go to the Info Box palette and ensure the layer is set to A-WALL-INTR.
4.	 Set the reference line location to Outside Face or Inside Face. This way you 
can snap your wall endpoints to the edges and the endpoints of the walls in 
the Xref.
5.	 Set your geometry method to the Single or Chained method and begin 
drawing in your walls.
°°
The Single method concludes the wall after your second click
°°
The Chained method keeps the wall tool active after every click until 
you decide to double click on your final click to terminate the tool
The following screenshot shows where to enter the top offset dimension:
When you are drawing walls, you can change the reference 
line location on the fly from the Info Box palette after you have 
already started drawing.

Creating objects
After you have modeled the interior walls in the interior model, you are ready 
to place the interior doors. When you are finished with that, create the exterior 
windows in the shell model. Place the doors on the interior model walls. Use the 
following doors for the specific sizes:
•	
Single swing doors will be D1 Commercial Door 19
•	
Uneven double doors will be D2 Commercial Door 19
•	
Double egress doors will be D2 Double Egress Metal 19
The panels on the double egress door will not automatically be of equal length. You 
will need to set the door panel parameter named Main Door Panel Width to a value 
that is half of the door width. The following screenshot shows the setting for a 7'-6" 
double egress door:
Creating windows
You will create windows for the exterior of the building. Therefore, we need to open 
the shell model since that is where the exterior walls are. Your first windows that 
you create will be pretty simple and will coordinate with the other features of the 
building. In this case, we will align the bottom of the windows with the curtain wall 
mullions at the entry atrium:
1.	 Open the shell model, go to level 1 and set the layer combination to Drafting.

6.	 Place this window at the single pane window locations on every floor except 
for the north side.
7.	 The single pane window locations on the north wall will be the same 
window as previous, except you will change the width to be 3'0".
There are two other versions of our window that we need to create. There are triple 
pane windows that go on the north and south exterior walls. And we need to create a 
window with five panes for the east exterior wall:
1.	 Insert one of the single pane windows onto the north exterior wall and open 
the selection settings for the new copy of that window:
°°
Change the width of the window to 9'-0".
°°
Go to the Storefront Settings panel and change panel horizontal 
division number to 3. Keep the vertical division number as 1.

Remember, windows and doors do not have their own layer setting 
because they assume the layer of the wall they are placed in.
Views
The types of views we need for this project will be similar to the first project that 
we created. We will just need more views and we will need to be diligent with 
our organization.
The types of views will be as follows:
•	
Floor plans—1/8" scale and 1/4" scale
•	
Ceiling plans—1/8" scale and 1/4" scale
•	
Exterior elevations and interior elevations
•	
Building and wall sections
•	
Stair plans, stair sections, and details
•	
Ceiling details
•	
Roof details
•	
Exterior plan details
•	
Exterior section details
•	
Casework details
Creating layers
You will need to create the following layers to help build the layer combinations 
needed for our view types. These new layers use a convention designed to designate 
the drawing scale:
•	
A-ANNO-CLNG-048
•	
A-ANNO-CLNG-DETL
•	
A-ANNO-NOTE-024
•	
A-ANNO-NOTE-048

Renaming layers
Some of the layers should be renamed in order to conform to the new convention 
used in the new layers you created:
•	
Rename A-ANNO-CEIL to A-ANNO-CLNG-096
•	
Rename A-ANNO-ENLG to A-ANNO-NOTE-048
•	
Rename A-ANNO-NOTE to A-ANNO-NOTE-096
•	
Rename A-DIMS to A-DIMS-096
•	
Rename A-DIMS-ENLG to A-DIMS-048
Creating and modifying layer combinations
The main driver behind your different view types are the custom layer combinations 
you will assign. You will need to have a layer combination for each view type. 
The following section will show you what layers to hide and show for each layer 
combination that you will need.
Enlarged floor plans (1/4"=1'-0")
Open the Layer Settings Manager (Ctrl + L) and select the Enlarged Plan layer 
combination. In the Enlarged Floor Plan layer combination, we want to hide the

Deleting layer combinations
The following layer combinations are not necessary for our project. Therefore, they 
should be deleted:
•	
HVAC Model
•	
Plumbing Plan
•	
Structural Plan
Maintaining layer combinations
As the project progresses, you will either encounter the need for new layers or that 
you don't need certain layers. New layers are hidden by default in all your layer 
combinations. So when you add layers, make sure you set that layer to show in 
the layer combinations you want it to show in.
The layer combination named All visible and unlocked, which comes with the 
project template, needs to be updated every time you add a new layer. It is not a 
magic layer combination. It is just as static as all the others.
Compiled layer matrix
See the following table for a complete layer matrix that shows the suggested layer 
state for each layer in each layer combination:

Cloning folders
We have many different view types to create and manage. For most of these view 
types, we should create clone folders. Using clone folders allows you to control 
multiple views with the settings inside one clone folder.
The following is a list of clone folders to be created:
•	
Enlarged floor plans
•	
Enlarged ceiling plans
•	
Ceiling details
•	
Exterior plan details
The following steps will take you through the process of creating a clone folder. 
To prepare for these steps, open the view map on the Navigator palette and then 
perform the following steps:
1.	 From the view map, click on the Clone a Folder button. The Clone a Folder 
configuration window will appear.
2.	 In the Identification panel, click on Stories; change the Name setting to 
Custom and enter Enlarged Floor Plans in the text box.
3.	 In the General panel:
°°
Change the value for Layer Combination to Enlarged Floor Plan
°°
Set the Scale to 1/4" = 1'-0"
°°
Set the value for Model View Options to Construction Documents
°°
Set the value for Renovation Filter to 04 New Construction
4.	 In the 2D/3D Documents panel, change the Zooming setting to Fit 
in window.
5.	 Then, click on the Clone button.

Deleting clone folders
Some of the clone folders that come with the project template are not needed for our 
project. Delete the following existing clone folders:
•	
Structural Plans
•	
HVAC Plans
Click on the clone folder and press the Delete key on your keyboard. You will get a 
warning stating that deleting views is undoable. Click on the Delete anyway button.
Creating new view map folders
Not all of our view map folders need to be clone folders; but we will want regular 
view folders to keep things well organized. You will have to create new view 
folders for each of the following types of views:
•	
Casework details
•	
Exterior section details
•	
Roof details
•	
Stair plans
•	
Stair sections
•	
Stair details
Use the following steps for each of the view types listed higher up:
1.	 Open the view map on the Navigator palette and click on the New 
Folder button.
2.	 The Create New Folder dialog box will open. Enter Casework Details and 
click on the Create button.
Your project folder structure is complete and ready for the production of the views 
required to produce a construction document set.
Summary
In this chapter, we created a second model and interior model and hotlinked the 
interior and shell models into each other. We attached Xrefs and created new 
composite types for our interior walls. We added doors to the interior walls and 
created three different window types for the exterior walls. Also, we set up the 
main structure of our layer combinations and majority of the views to be placed on 
sheets. In the next chapter, we will create our first custom object from the scratch and 
populate the model with various other objects.

Objects, Drafting, and 
Annotation – A Healthcare 
Building Project
In this chapter, we will add more content to our building such as casework and 
plumbing fixtures. We will create a custom new object, insert configure zones 
(rooms), and create annotation for our views. The following is the list of the major 
topics included in this chapter:
•	
Zones
•	
Adding objects to a patient room
•	
Surface material creation
•	
Modeling a custom reception desk
•	
Creating a custom object
•	
Attributes
•	
Drafting tools
Creating zones
Creating all the zones in our building is a big and important task. The zones will 
represent the rooms in your building. Each zone contains the identity data that 
defines a room. You could think of them as room objects. The Xref files that we 
attached in Chapter 5, Project Setup and Modeling Part 2 – A Healthcare Building Project, 
have the room names in them to help you identify specific room types.

Be sure that all your walls are cleanly connected and that there are no gaps. We 
are going to use the Magic Wand tool to automatically create the zone boundaries. 
Otherwise, we could manually draw a boundary for each room, but that would take 
too much time. To do this, perform the following steps:
1.	 Open the Renovation palette and make sure that Default elements is set to 
04 New Construction. To open the Renovation palette, navigate to Window 
| Palettes | Renovation.
2.	 Open the 1st FLOOR PLAN from the view map under Construction 
Documentation\Floor Plans. Then, zoom in on the upper-left corner 
of the building near the entrance.
3.	 Double-click on the Zone tool icon in the Toolbox palette.
4.	 Set the Category to 2.1 Conditioned Space.
5.	 Next, change the value for Name to PRIVATE PATIENT.
6.	 Then, change the room number to 1001.
7.	 Ensure that the layer is set to A-AREA-IDEN.
8.	 Next, click on OK.

9.	 On the Info Box palette, set the Construction Method to Inner Edge.
10.	 Then, click inside the first patient room (with double doors and a window). 
The hammer icon will appear. Click inside the room again to place the 
zone tag.
11.	 Next, click inside the next patient room to the right and click again to place 
the zone tag. Notice that the room number automatically increases to 1002.
12.	 Do this for all the patient rooms on this floor.
This process will probably cause zones to overlap. If you get the You have clicked 
into an existing Zone. Do it anyway? warning, then click on the No button.
You will most likely find that one of your zones is bleeding into the rest of the building 
(probably the last one that you placed). Make sure your walls are cleanly connected 
and that there are no gaps. Also check that your renovation status is correct.
Updating zones
If you need to fix a gap in a wall in an effort to resolve a bleeding zone, you will 
need to use the Update Zones tool to get the zone to regenerate its boundary. Or 
if you have moved the walls in your zone (room), you can use the Update Zones 
tool to make the zone element conform to the new wall configuration. This can be 
performed on multiple zones at once or just one at a time. To do so, do as follows:
1.	 Select the zone(s) that you want to update.
2.	 Go to the Design menu and click on Update Zones….

Adding casework and plumbing fixtures
We will start adding casework and fixtures to the private patient rooms and 
adjoining shower room. Each patient room will have the following objects inserted 
from the ArchiCAD library with the specified parameter settings:
•	
Armchair: 01 19
•	
Basin: 19

Creating a new surface material
Our next task will be to create a new surface material. The exercise will give you the 
necessary skill to create a surface material you may need for rendering any specific 
object. We will do that by duplicating an existing surface, giving it a new name, and 
changing its color. To do so, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Surfaces icon on the Attributes toolbar (or navigate to Options 
| Element Attributes… | Surfaces…).
2.	 Change the surface to 06 | P Laminate.
3.	 Then, press the New button.
4.	 Name the surface 06 | P Laminate Black.

7.	 Click on OK and again click on OK to close Surface Settings.
Creating a reception desk
We are going to create the reception desk (greeter's desk) at the ground floor entry 
(vestibule). This process will involve using the wall, slab, and some of the 2D 
drafting tools. The table top will be an unusual and free-form shape that you will 
create with the slab tool. You will learn how to use 2D lines to define the boundary 
of the table shape.
The main entrance of our building is on the ground floor, so that is what we will 
work on in the next exercise.

Drawing the desktop outline
We want the shape of the table to relate to shapes of the surrounding elements, so it 
will have a symmetrical arc. The following will walk you through the process:
1.	 Go to the view map and open the Ground view. Zoom in on the upper-left 
area of the building where the atrium meets the rectangular shape of the 
main building.
2.	 Go to the Standard toolbar and set the Special Snap points to Half.
3.	 Then, start the Arc/Circle tool and use the Centerpoint and Radius 
geometry method.
4.	 Enter the arc center point; make your first click (Centerpoint) on the mid-
point of the wall on the right.

5.	 Enter the arc start point and click on the intersection where the curtain wall 
meets the north exterior wall. See the following screenshot:
6.	 Draw your arc down to the left to form a quarter circle; as you move your 
cursor down, type the letter A to activate the angle entry box. Type in the 
number 90 and press the Enter key. You will have a perfect quarter circle arc.

7.	 Draw another arc with the same center point and make the start point of the 
arc at the bottom-right corner of the small window on the exterior wall. Draw 
the arc down, parallel to the first arc, and click on the bottom endpoint of the 
first arc. See the following screenshot:
8.	 Draw a line to connect the bottom ends of the two arcs.
9.	 Then, draw two lines to connect the top arc endpoints to wrap the table 
outline around the wall at the top.
Creating the desk top
Our next task will be to create the top surface for the desk. We will do this with the 
Slab tool:
1.	 First, hide the A-FLOR layer. This will hide the arc of the floor slab in the 
shell model below the table, which would otherwise interfere with our slab 
creation. If this does not hide the arc, open the shell model and see what 
layer it is really on.

2.	 Start the Slab tool and open the Slab Selection Settings window to do 
the following:
°°
Set the layer to A-FURN
°°
Set the composite to 41-30 30 | Cherry
°°
Set the slab thickness to 1"
°°
Set the Offset to Home Story to 2'-6"
°°
Finally, click on OK
3.	 Hold the Spacebar down to activate the Magic Wand tool and click inside the 
desktop outline. This will create the slab.
4.	 Hold your Shift key down and select the new slab to confirm its creation. See 
the following screenshot:
Creating the desktop support walls
The walls that support the desktop will be made of the same material as the desktop 
and will be inset from the desktop edge:
1.	 Start the Wall tool and open the Wall Selection Settings window. Then, 
make the following configurations:
°°
Wall height: 2'-5"

Viewing your desk in 3D
It is always a good idea to check your work in a 3D view. Let's do that now:
1.	 Select the walls and desktop that you created and press the F5 key. 
This will show your selection in a 3D window and nothing else. See 
the following screenshot:
Or use a single floor marquee.
2.	 Turn the A-FLOR layer back on.
3.	 Start the Marquee tool from the Toolbox palette. Go to the Info Box 
palette and ensure the selection method is set to Single Floor (AKA the 
Skinny Marquee).
4.	 Draw a rectangle around the desk, nearby walls, and double doors below the 
desk with the marquee. Then, press the F5 key. See the following screenshot:

Creating a new object
This next exercise is more advanced than previous object lessons in this book. 
We will delve into some of the code used to define objects and also see how to 
manipulate the parameters visible to the end user.
For this lesson, we are going to create another desk by using what we created in the 
previous lesson. Then we will save it as an object. You will modify the slab and walls 
to fit into a different location in the building. Then, you will learn how to turn the 
desk into an object that can be easily copied to multiple places in the building model:
1.	 Select the slab and walls that made up the desk in the previous lesson and 
make a copy (Ctrl + Shift + D). Then, place it in the pantry area on the ground 
level between column grid intersections D-2 & C-3.
2.	 Rotate it approximately 55 degrees counter clockwise so that the short edge 
of the table is straight up and down and move it up against the column. See 
the following screenshot:
3.	 Select the walls and change their height to 2'-11".
4.	 Change the Reference Plane Offset to Home Story height on the slab to 
2'-11".

5.	 Zoom in on the jagged edge of the desk and select the slab. Click on the 
inside corner hotspot of the slab and the pet palette will appear. Then, click 
on the Move Node button to drag the node over the bottom right corner of 
the furring wall. (This is similar to using grips in AutoCAD).
6.	 Click on the long edge of the top pointed piece and push the Insert New 
Node button on the pet palette. Then, drag the new node over to the 
top-right corner.

7.	 Click on the node to bring up the pet palette; then click on the Subtract 
from Polygon button. With this method, you will use your cursor to draw 
a shape that will trim the slab. You could think of it as trimming with a 
polygonal shape.
8.	 Draw a straight line from the top of the column-furring wall to the right, 
which is just past the slab edge. Then, draw a line straight up past the slab 
point; then, over to the left and back down to your first click.
9.	 With the slab selected, click on the top-right node to bring up the pet palette 
and click on the Fillet/Chamfer button.

enter 1', and click on OK.
11.	 Select the slab and walls that support the desktop. Then, go to the File menu 
and navigate to Libraries and Objects | Save Selection as... | Object.
12.	 Then, the Save Object window will appear. Enter the Pantry Counter name 
in the Name box at the top and press the Save button.
13.	 The Change Object's Basic Settings window will appear. It will create 
and assign parameters based on the different elements in your new object. 
Finally, press OK.

[ 202 ]
Refer to the following screenshot of a 3D view of the desk:
Using your new object
The elements you used to create the object are still independent elements 
(and remain where you left them). And now your new object is ready to use:
1.	 Open the Object Default Settings window.
2.	 Go to the browser pane and click on Embedded Library. Your new object 
will appear in the folder contents pane.
3.	 Select Pantry Counter and place it anywhere in a plan view.
After you place it, you will find it difficult to select, unless you grab the lower right 
corner of the desktop. This demonstrates the need to add hotspots to your new object.
Adding hotspots to an object
A hotspot is a node (or point) that can be used to define selection points. We are 
going to add hotspots to the object to provide easier selection. We will do this by 
reusing the original slab and walls and then recreating (overwriting) the object:
1.	 Before we begin, hide the layer A-WALL-INTR. This will make it easier 
to work with our object's elements.
2.	 Go to the More panel on the Toolbox palette and click on the Hotspot tool.
3.	 Zoom in on the desktop slab and click on each endpoint on the slab to insert 
the hotspots. Also, put a hotspot on the midpoint of each arc slab edge. See 
the following screenshot example:

[ 203 ]
4.	 Select the hotspots, walls, and slab and save them as Pantry Counter 
again. Then navigate to the File | Libraries and Objects | Save Selection 
as… | Object.
5.	 Then, the Change Object's Basic Settings window will open. We will take 
this opportunity to rename the attributes that were automatically created. 
Rename the attributes according to the next image:

[ 204 ]
6.	 Start the Object tool and place the Pantry Counter object. You will have a 
much easier time selecting it now.
Looking at the code inside an object
The walls that we used to create the object are shown in plan view, but this is not 
what we want to see. We will open the object and remove the 2D plan geometry that 
represents the walls. We will also dig into the code to control the surfaces in 3D.
The 2D and 3D geometry of an object is actually defined by a code after the object is 
created. You can select any object in your model and open the object editor to see all 
the code that defines that object:
1.	 Select the Pantry Counter object you just created and press the key 
combination of Ctrl + Shift + O. This will open the object editor (or the long 
way to get there is via File | Libraries and Objects | Open Object).
2.	 Go to the left side of the object editor window and click on the Parameters 
button. There is an extra parameter that we will not need. Find the attribute 
named Surface 5, click on the name, and then click on the Delete button at 
the top. See the following screenshot image:

3.	 Take note of the parameter named Pen Uncut Wall. This is the pen used to 
represent the wall elements in 2D plan views that we want to remove. Each 
parameter has a variable assigned to it. The assigned variable will be used 
in the 2D script to define the uncut wall. Click on the variable box for Pen 
Uncut Wall and copy the variable name (penAttribute_4).
4.	 Now let's look at the code that defines 2D geometry. Click on the 2D button 
in the Scripts panel to the left. At the top, you will see a text that identifies 
the object, the date the file was created, and the ArchiCAD version. This is 
the script that defines 2D geometry:
Here is a description of the code in the preceding screenshot:
°°
The first line of code starts with mul2. This is used to establish scale 
transformations.
°°
The second line starts with add2. This prepares positioning.
°°
The third line begins with pen. This defines the pen to be used in the 
following geometry code.
°°
The fourth line is where geometry creation begins with poly2_b, which 
creates a poly line. It is followed by coordinates for the poly line to 
follow. The coordinates for a drawing command such as poly2_b end 
where the next geometry routine begins. The next geometry routine 
will begin with the pen command or another geometry command.

5.	 We want to remove all the instances where the uncut wall pen is used. 
However, for the sake of preserving code and demonstrating a feature, we 
will "comment" the code out. In other words, we will make the software 
ignore the code:
°°
Press the key combination of Ctrl + F to bring up the Text Window 
Find tool.
°°
Paste in the variable name for the uncut wall and press the Find 
button. Then you will be taken to the first instance of the variable 
being used.
°°
With your cursor, select the line of code beginning with Pen down 
to the line before the next instance of Pen. See the following example 
where the variable name for the uncut wall is penAttribute_4:
6.	 In this case, the four lines of code selected define the two arcs in the 
uncut wall. With the four lines of code selected, press the exclamation 
point button at the upper-left of the 2D script window. This will add an 
exclamation point to the beginning of each line of code, which will tell 
ArchiCAD to ignore it. You can add in the exclamation points manually 
if you wish, but this way is faster:
7.	 Find the other location(s) where the uncut wall pen is used and comment out 
those lines as well.

8.	 Press the Check Script button at the top of the script editor window. If your 
script is good, you will get a popup stating that The GDL script is OK. If not, 
you will get a warning pop-up stating the problem and the line on which the 
error has occurred. Since you are not adding code or changing routines, you 
will be pretty safe here.
9.	 Close the object editor from the icon/drop-down menu at the upper-left 
corner or click on the upper right X icon. You will be prompted to save 
changes to the library part. Then click on the Save button.
10.	 The uncut wall lines will disappear. See the next image:
11.	 There is specifically a help menu for creating and modifying objects. 
It is called the GDL Reference Guide. The acronym GDL refers to the 
programming language used within the objects.
Another way to achieve clean 2D lines is to draft inside the Symbol 
Window in the object editor. However, this method is primarily 
used for devices that are too small to show to scale.
Hiding the unused parameter
We removed the instances where a certain parameter was used in the 2D script so 
that it would not be shown. However, the parameter is still shown in the Object 
Selection Settings window under Parameters. The following steps will show you 
how to hide the parameter from the user:
1.	 Open the Pantry Counter object again. (Select it by pressing Ctrl + Shift + O).
2.	 Click on the Parameters button to display the parameter list. Select Pen 
Uncut Wall from the list and click at the far left in the Display column on the 
X button. This will hide the parameter from the user.

3.	 While you are in there, do the same for the following pen parameters:
°°
Pen White (not useful)
°°
Pen WindBknd (used by ArchiCAD to fill the inside of the walls and 
not useful)
°°
Pen Hotspot (not useful)
4.	 Next, close and save the object editor and click on the main Pantry Counter 
tab at the top of the drawing window to close the object editor. Then click on 
Save when prompted.
5.	 Select the object and bring up its selection settings (Ctrl + T) and you will see 
that those parameters are no longer shown.
Changing the display of the parameter list
When you open the Selection Settings window to change a parameter, you will 
notice that the FILLS, SURFACES, and PENS parameters are collapsed and 
indented. To change one, you need to click on the heading first to expand the list and 
then select the parameter you want to change. This is great when you have an object 
that has a large amount of parameters to manage. But in our case, we don't have that 
many objects and the expanding heading feature is not helpful. We will remove it so 
that our parameters are immediately accessible:
1.	 Select the Pantry Counter object and open the library part editor 
(Ctrl + Shift + O).

2.	 Open the Parameters list. Notice that all the parameters that are directly 
under FILLS, SURFACES, and PENS headings have the indent icon present. 
Turn off the indent for each of the parameters under the aforementioned 
headings by clicking on the indent icon. See the following screenshot:
3.	 Save and close.
4.	 Open the object's selection settings window (Ctrl + T) and you will now 
see all the parameters without needing to expand the headings. See the 
next screenshot:
Understanding attributes
The dictionary definition of an attribute is "something attributed as belonging to a 
person, thing, group, etc.; a quality, character, characteristic, or property: Sensitivity 
is one of his attributes." But within ArchiCAD, an attribute can be defined as a 
characteristic or property, such as color, shape, or texture.

[ 210 ]
For you to be successful in using ArchiCAD, is it essential that you understand 
what attributes are and how to manage them. The management of attributes can be 
a full-time job on very large projects. Following is a list of all the attribute types in 
ArchiCAD, with a brief explanation. The order of the list is based on the order used 
in the drop-down menu under Options | Element Attributes:
Layer Settings
The Layer Settings option is used to create, delete, and manage layers and layer 
combinations. You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + L to open the layer settings 
manager window.
Line Types
The Line Types option is used to create, delete, and manage line types. New line 
types are created with dashes and symbols.
Fill Types
The Fill Types option is used to create, delete, and manage fill types, such as Solid, 
Vectorial, Symbols, and Image fills. It is also used to specify if a fill should be used 
as a drafting, cover, or cut fill. You can set the scale behavior to scale with plan 
(model size) or scale independent (paper size).

Chapter 6
[ 211 ]
Building Materials
The Building Materials option is used to create, delete, and manage building 
materials to be used by composite structures such as Precast Concrete, Steel Deck, 
or Heavy Timber.
Composites
The Composites option is used to create, delete, and manage composites that use 
building materials for walls, slabs, shells, and roofs.
Pens & Colors
The Pens & Colors option is used to create, delete, and manage pen sets. It is also 
used to define color and line thickness for individual pens within each pen set.
Surfaces
The Surfaces option is used to create, delete, and manage surfaces such as a specific 
metal, wood, or plastic that can be used by any element.
Zone Categories
The Zone Categories option is used to create, delete, and manage zone categories. 
It also assigns the color, fill color, and zone tags that are to be used by each 
zone category.
Mark-Up Styles
The Mark-Up Styles option is used to create, delete, and manage mark-up styles. 
They assign the color used for the correction elements and highlighted elements for 
each style.
Profile Manager
The Profile Manager is used to create, delete, and manage the profile shapes used for 
columns, beams, and walls.
Renovation Override Styles
The Renovation Override Styles option is used to assign and manage the attributes 
used in renovation override styles. The attributes include pens, line types, and 
fill patterns.

[ 212 ]
Operation Profiles
The Operation Profiles option is used to create, delete, and manage operation 
profiles, which are the part of the energy evaluation features in ArchiCAD; configure 
the occupancy type, such as residential or non-residential; define the values for 
human heat gain, humidity, and water consumption; and set up daily schedules 
to gauge energy consumption.
Managing attributes
All the different attributes can be managed from one tool—the attribute manager. 
Tasks such as renaming, deleting, duplicating, and purging unused attributes can be 
performed with the help of the attribute manager. With very large projects, it is good 
practice to purge unused attributes. If you need to rename multiple layers, use the 
attribute manager as it will be faster:
1.	 Go to the Options menu and navigate to Element Attributes | 
Attribute Manager.
2.	 You will see that there is a tab for each attribute type and a list of all attributes. 
Most attributes have a Purge Unused button. The following screenshot shows 
the Fill Types page. Note that you can set whether the fill is available as a 
drafting, cover, or cut fill at the bottom of the left-hand pane.

Drafting tools
Even though most of what we create in the model is three-dimensional, we still 
need to do some embellishing with the 2D line work. This task can be referred 
to as drafting. Drawing lines, arcs, and polylines is a pretty easy thing to do. Just 
remember that in ArchiCAD, you have the feature to add an arrow, dot, or tick 
mark at the beginning or end of your line or arc:
1.	 First, open the default settings for the line, arc, or polyline tool and you will 
see the arrowhead icon.
2.	 Click on it and see the different symbol options you have to place at either 
one or both ends of our line. See the next screenshot:
Modifying fills
Creating fills is easy. You just select the fill pattern you want and then draw the 
boundary to define that fill. However, oftentimes, you will need to change the shape 
of a fill that has already been drawn. The following exercise demonstrates many 
different ways in which you can modify a fill:
1.	 Double-click on the Fill tool and set the Fill Type to Drafting Fill.
2.	 Then change the Fill Pattern to 01 | Grid 02" D.

[ 214 ]
3.	 Next, set the layer to A-AREA-PATT.
4.	 Click on OK and draw a small polygon, as shown in the following 
the example:
5.	 Then select the polygon. Hover your cursor over an edge and click the left 
mouse button and hold it. This will bring up the pet palette for editing 
edges. Click on the Insert New Node icon and pull the cursor away from 
the polygon, as shown in the following screenshot:

6.	 Do the same to a different edge and then press the Curve edge button 
on the pet palette. Then pull the cursor away from the polygon. See the 
following screenshot:
7.	 Bring up the pet palette on another edge and press the Subtract from Polygon 
button. Then draw a polygon inside the polygon. See the following screenshot:

8.	 Experiment with all the editing commands on the pet palette. When you 
are finished, you will have a good understanding of how you can modify 
drafting elements.
Editing text
After you place the text in your project, there is a good chance that you may need 
to go back and change its contents. The trick to editing text is to have the Text tool 
active. Otherwise, it is more difficult to select text and initiate the editing mode. To 
do this, do as follows:
1.	 Start the Text tool and type in a text string.
2.	 With the Text tool still active, select the new text string. Notice that when you 
hover your cursor over the text string, the cursor changes to the straight text 
box edit cursor, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Click inside the text string and the text editing palettes will appear. As you 
can see, this is where you can change font and size and make text italic or 
bold. Select part or all of the text string and press the B icon to make the text 
bold, as shown in the following screenshot:
If you try to edit a text string when the text tool is not active, you 
will have a harder time getting the text into edit mode.

Editing dimensions
After you have created a dimension, you may need to either delete or add a segment. 
The following steps will show you how to do just that:
1.	 Open the 1st FLOOR PLAN view in the interior model, under the 
Construction Documents folder, and zoom in on the rooms at the 
bottom of the plan.
2.	 Start the Dimension tool and dimension the inside and outside edges of 
three walls. See the dimensions in the following screenshot:
3.	 With the Dimension tool active, hold the Shift key down and select 
the tick mark of a witness line, of an inside wall edge, as shown in the 
next screenshot:
4.	 With the witness line selected, press the Delete key. This will remove a 
segment of the dimension and automatically adjust the adjoining segments.

5.	 This time, select the whole dimension (Shift). Hold the Ctrl key down and 
click on a different wall, off to the right.
6.	 Now, you will have a new segment to the dimension string. See the finished 
example here:
Summary
In this chapter, we worked with zones and zone categories and learned how to create 
a new surface material. We also got a brief overview of all the different attributes 
in ArchiCAD and the attribute manager. We learned how to create an object and 
edit the attributes and code inside an object. We learned how to add and subtract 
segments from dimensions and the basics about working with text.
In the next chapter, we will get into advanced view management, sheets, and 
mastering graphic control to produce great drawings.

Documentation – A 
Commercial Project 
In this chapter, we will prepare views on our project for printing. We will learn how 
to manage and organize layouts. Now that you are more familiar with ArchiCAD, 
we will dive deeper into understanding the concepts and settings related to the 
documentation workflow.
The basic techniques are similar to the ones described in Chapter 3, Documentation – A 
Residential Project. Read it again if you feel that you need to refresh your memory of 
them or just refer to it as you read this chapter.
The following map illustrates the complexity and connections of the documentation 
workflow. You can see the hierarchy of how modeling and documentation is 
structured in ArchiCAD and how the settings and the different areas of the 
Navigator palette are connected to each other.

View setup
The first thing we need to make sure of is that our view settings are correct. 
This will define the look of our printout as well as help us keep a clean and 
organized set. You can access the View Settings dialog box by selecting a view 
in the Navigator palette and clicking on the Settings button at the bottom of 
Navigator. You can also right-click on a view in Navigator and select View 
Settings from the drop-down menu.
The View Settings dialog box consists of several areas, which are covered in the 
following sections.
Identification
Here, you can set the ID and Name of the view and also see the Source of the view. 
The ID and Name fields are the same as the first two fields in the Properties panel, 
at the bottom of the Navigator palette, once a view is selected; but here, we can 
adjust the ID and the name more specifically.
You can choose the ID and name to be based on the project map, which will follow 
them automatically as they are established in the project map. You can also specify 
custom values for these fields. This means that you will have a different ID and/or 
name for the view than the original Source in the project map. You can adjust the 
name and ID in the Navigator palette, which will make the values custom.
In certain cases, this might be useful but in general it is not recommended because 
it creates an added level of complexity, which will have to be managed manually. 
ArchiCAD is great at providing a high level of customization but this needs to be 
treated carefully. More custom settings will also mean that you will have to make 
more adjustments or changes manually in the future.

General – automate all!
This section has some of the most important settings that determine how the view 
will look when printed. You can select the Layer Combination, Scale, Structure 
Display, Pen Set, Model View Options, and Renovation Filter in this area. After 
making sure that the correct layer combination (which determines the visible content 
of our view) and scale is selected from the drop-down menu, we will focus on the 
Pen Set and Model View Options. These two settings have a big impact on the look 
of the printed view:

Pen Set
You can set up different pen sets for different presentation options by navigating to 
Options | Element Attributes | Pens and Colors.
In the View Settings dialog box, you can select the appropriate pen set from the 
General area | Pen Set drop-down list from the available options established 
by going to Options | Element Attributes | Pens and Colors. Pen weights are 
important to generate proper looking printouts.
The general recommendation is to use not more than five different pen weights that 
have distinguishable differences between them. If your pen set includes more than 
that, it will be hard for you to manage the look of your drawings. It is also good 
practice to have the same pen set in colors and in black only. You can quickly assess 
on the screen what the drawing will look like on paper with the black version of 
the pen, while the colored versions of your pens are useful to differentiate elements 
while your are working on your model.

Model View Options
The model view options are perhaps the second most important settings that you 
need to consider to create proper looking printouts. You can set up different model 
view options for different presentation options by navigating to Document | Set 
Model View | Model View Options.
The Model View Options control the display intelligence of the model elements; 
unlike the visibility of whole model elements, which can be controlled with layer 
combinations. Model view options specify whether the parts of the model elements 
are visible in a specific view (for example, the door and window markers) or how 
the parts of the model elements are displayed (for example, the cut fills of the 
wall composites).
In combination with the view scale, these settings will ultimately define what your 
drawings will look like once printed.

[ 225 ]
Here, we need to mention a feature of the View Settings dialog that is easy to miss. 
The Get Current Window's Settings button at the top of the dialog box enables you 
to capture the as-is settings of your current window. For example, if you activated 
the First Floor Enlarged Floor plan, went to the Layers Settings dialog, and turned 
off a couple of layers manually, then clicking on the Get Current Window's Settings 
button will capture the current state of your custom layer visibility regardless of the 
previously set layer combination. You can also capture the current window's settings 
by right clicking on the view in the Navigator palette and choosing Get Current 
Window's Settings.
If you do either of the options mentioned, Custom will be specified in the General 
/ Layer Combination field of the View Settings dialog. Adjusting visibility on the 
screen and not having to go through the effort of setting up and assigning all the 
aspects of the General area of the view settings seems like an easy shortcut. We will 
not use that, because it will make it very hard to manage our views that way.
Our goal is to set all the aspects of the visibility of our views by the preset standards 
and automate all parts of the General area of View Settings. This practice will pay 
off in the long run because making changes centrally to any of the settings will be 
much quicker than readjusting every view one by one.
Another good management practice is to save pen sets in the attribute manager as an 
.aat file, and export Model View Options in the Model View Options dialog box 
as .xml files. Especially when you need to manage multiple files and make sure that 
their settings are identical, you can easily import the pen sets and model view options 
into other files in this way. The Attribute Manager allows you to import pen sets from 
template (.tpl), plan (.pln), and archive (.pla) files as well as .aat and .xml files.
2D/3D Documents
The 2D/3D Documents area allows you to set Floor Plan Cut Plane Settings, the 
Dimensions style, and Zooming of the view. The Floor Plan Cut Plane Settings are 
particularly important for displaying windows properly.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Documentation – A Commercial Project
[ 226 ]
The Floor Plan Cut Plane Settings can also be accessed by navigating to Document 
| Floor Plan Cut Plane. For example, clerestory windows might not be displayed in 
floor plans properly unless we adjust the floor plan cut plane to the right height that 
intersects the clerestory windows. This is why you can adjust the floor plan cut plane 
per view in this area.
The Zooming controls the zoomed area once the view is activated (for example, by 
double-clicking on the view name in the Navigator). Some users prefer the views to 
ignore the zoom when activated. If you would like to set the views in the project to 
be independent of zoom factors, you can check the Ignore zoom and rotation when 
opening this view box. On the other hand, this option can be useful when dealing 
with an enlarged floor plan view where a specific area of the floor needs focus.
3D Only
As the name suggests, the 3D Only area of the View Settings dialog controls the 
3D view settings. You can select whether you'd like to generate the 3D view in the 
3D window or as a rendering with the Generate in drop-down menu. You can 
also select a preset rendering style with the Rendering Scene drop-down menu.

Residential Project.

The organizer – how to access it and why 
it is important
The project organizer is one of the main tools that you can utilize while setting 
up your documentation. You can access it by clicking on the top-left button of the 
Navigator panel and selecting Show Organizer.
The organizer gives you a comprehensive view of your document set and allows 
you to set up and arrange your views, layouts, and publisher sets. We will use the 
organizer for many of the tasks that are required to set up our layouts, so we need 
to get familiar with it first.
Relationship between parts of the organizer
The organizer has two main panels, each of which can display the view map, 
layout book and publisher sets. Since the idea behind the organizer is to reference 
information from the left panel to the right, only the left panel shows the project 
map, which is the most rudimentary level of our model organization. You can right-
click on each item in each panel, get more information and adjustment options of the 
item's settings, and pull over the items from one panel to the other populating the 
destination panel. The following diagram shows the concept of the documentation 
setup in ArchiCAD, starting with the project map on the left, followed by the view 
map, layout book, and publisher sets in the correct order:
Let's set up the sides of the organizer by choosing the project map on the left and the 
view map on the right.
www.it-ebooks.info

Documentation – A Commercial Project
[ 228 ]
There are functional buttons in the lower-right corner of the organizer that can be 
helpful in creating a folder structure at each level of the document organization. 
Clicking on the New Folder button creates a new folder at the selected position and 
clicking on the yellow button on the lower-right next to New Folder can access the 
Clone a folder feature of ArchiCAD. We will focus on the Clone a folder feature because 
it allows us to generate an automated document structure.
Cloning a folder means that you are automatically referencing the content of a folder 
in another level of the document organization. For example, cloning the Stories 
category of the project map in the View Map panel will create a View folder that 
automatically follows any changes made to Stories in the project map. This means 
that a floor plan view will be automatically generated if you add a new story to 
your project. You can create multiple clones of the same project map category with 
different default view settings.

Documentation workflow
The documentation workflow is a subset of the project workflow (see Chapter 3, 
Documentation – A Residential Project, for more information). Our goal is to set 
up a part of our document properly and take advantage of the automated 
documentation system.
The documentation workflow in ArchiCAD can be divided into three steps:
•	
View adjustment: This is used to review the established views in our model 
and consider them as drawings that will be placed on sheets
•	
Sheet setup: This is used to create and review the layouts that will be needed 
to properly document our project
•	
Drawing placement: This is used to place the views on sheets and adjust the 
miscellaneous annotation
It is recommended to keep the whole workflow in mind from the beginning. You 
should create your model and place the 2D elements and annotations thinking 
about what they will look like on a printed page and how you will organize your 
document set.
Creating and adjusting layouts is performed in the layout book. We can work in the 
layout book either in the Navigator palette or by selecting the layout book as one of 
the panels of the organizer.
Let's switch the organizer to show the view map on the left and the layout book 
the right.
Layout Book (sheets)
The Layout Book palette is a collection of layouts, which are digital representations 
of our printed sheets. This is the final setting stage in our documentation workflow 
before we publish (print or save files) our documents.
Let's review the parts of the Layout Book palette before we go into further details. 
The following screenshot shows an example of the Layout Book palette from 
Chapter 3, Documentation – A Residential Project:

Settings. This will bring up the Book Settings dialog box, which will allow you to 
define how the IDs (that is, the numbering) of the items of the Layout Book palette 
will behave. You can also create a new issue and set up how numbering will behave 
in revisions. We will discuss the last two areas in detail in Chapter 8, Work Sharing 
with ArchiCAD.

[ 232 ]
The layouts (building blocks of the Layout Book) have a specific editing environment 
where you can adjust several aspects of the look of the sheets and the placed 
drawings. The basis of every Layout is the Master Layout. Let's discuss the Master 
Layout's settings now (see Chapter 3, Documentation – A Residential Project, for more 
information).
Master Layout
Master Layouts drive the size and repeated elements of our layouts. Parts of the 
Master Layout can assume values automatically. We will discuss this feature in detail 
in the following sections. In general, we want to set up the Master Layout in a way 
that will require the least amount of manual adjustment on each sheet.
You can create and access the Master Layouts under the grey Masters portion of 
the Layout Book palette. To create a new Master Layout, you can either right-click 
on the grey Masters folder icon and select New Master Layout, or click on the third 
button at the lower part of the palette.
The Create New Master Layout dialog will allow you to name your new Master 
Layout and set its size, orientation, and margins. You can also define whether it will 
appear below or above the content of your layout. Typically, we will use the Below 
Layout option. The Drawing Placement area of this dialog box needs some attention. 
This is a useful feature when you need to place multiple views on the same sheet. For 
example, detail sheets usually have multiple details on them. You can add multiple 
views at the same time and let ArchiCAD either arrange them automatically or align 
them to a grid. You can also specify the details of the two arrangement styles by 
clicking on the button at the right.

Finally, you can set the newly created Master Layout as the default for new layouts.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Documentation – A Commercial Project
[ 234 ]
To work on a Master Layout, you can double-click on a specific layout in the list. You 
can add 2D elements (for example, borders and text) to the Master Layout. These 
elements will be repeated on every layout (sheet) that the specific Master Layout is 
assigned to. Master Layouts in ArchiCAD work in a similar way to Master Pages in 
Adobe InDesign. The elements of the Master Layout will appear in red to help us 
differentiate them from the other parts of the layout.
Autotext
It is the best practice to set up the Master Layout with as much intelligence as 
possible. The Autotext feature in ArchiCAD is very helpful in doing so. We can start 
adding Autotext by activating the Text tool and clicking on the second button at the 
top-left corner of the Text tool dialog.
This will create a code that will reference pre-established text values. Some Autotext 
values are actively assuming other referenced parameters. For example, we can 
insert an Autotext at the bottom-right corner of our Master Layout that will reference 
the sheet number. The actual sheet number will automatically change from layout 
to layout, referencing the sheet number parameter of the actual layout.
Another example of an Autotext is related to the project information. We can insert 
an Autotext as a repeating text element of our Master Layout, referring to the project 
name. We can do that by selecting the Project Details Category and Project Name 
Autotext item.
While we are in the Master Layout editing environment, we will see the code 
#Project Name appearing as text, but once we assign the Master Layout to a specific 
sheet, it will display the actual project name instead. We can then set and change the 
project name globally, affecting all of the sheets where the Autotext is inserted by 
navigating to File | Info | Project Info. We can also use this Master Layout in other 
projects with different project names without having to recreate it.
The source of the Autotext can be the project info as described earlier, or we can 
choose an Autotext Reference Drawing by right-clicking on a drawing in Navigator 
or Organizer, under a layout and selecting Set as Autotext Reference. When you 
select a drawing as an Autotext reference, it will appear in the Category list of the 
Autotext dialog box.

2.	 Second, click on the New Master Layout button.
3.	 Then, enter Simple Master 11 x 17 in the Name field.
4.	 Next, select B (ANSI) - Engineering from the drop-down list, under Size 
and select the Landscape orientation.
5.	 You can leave the Margins as they are for now. If you would like to 
adjust the margin of the sheet, you can do so by changing the values 
under Margins.
6.	 You can also leave the Anchor Point as it is.

7.	 Under Display Master Layout, select Below Layout. This will ensure that the 
graphic elements of the Master Layout will appear under the drawings that 
are placed on the Layout that this Master Layout is assigned to.
8.	 The Drawing Placement area allows you to set up a system, which is used 
to place multiple drawings at once. For example, this is useful when placing 
multiple detail drawings on a layout. ArchiCAD can automatically arrange 
them based on their distance from each other or align them based on a 
grid. You can keep the Auto Arrange new Drawings setting. The following 
screenshot shows the Auto Arrange new Drawings settings, which can be 
accessed by clicking on the Auto Arrange Setup button:
9.	 Finally, we will not check the Set as Default for New Layouts because we 
will not use this Master Layout for most layouts.

The new Master Layout will appear under the Masters icon and now, you can assign 
it to any Layout.
Layouts
Now that we are familiar with setting up a Master Layout, we are ready to move on 
to the next step, which is creating and setting up the layouts themselves. We have 
the ability to create a folder structure to keep our layout list organized. Folders in the 
Layout Book palette are called subsets.

To create a subset, you can right-click on the green Layout Book icon on the top of 
the list and select Create New Subset. Otherwise, you can click on the fourth, yellow 
button at the lower part of the palette. Subsets of subsets can also be created in this 
way. For example, you can create a subset called Floor Plans and then create 
different subsets of the Floor Plans subset for different floor plan scales.
When you click on the New Subset button, the Create New Subset dialog box will 
appear, allowing you to assign an ID and name to the subset as well as define how 
the IDs (that is numbering) of the items of the subset will behave.
To create a new layout, you can either right-click on the green Layout Book icon on 
the top of the list and select New Layout or click on the second, white button at the 
lower part of the palette.
When you click on the New Layout button, the New Layout dialog box will appear, 
allowing you to assign an ID, name, and assign a Master Layout to the layout as 
well as define how the IDs (that is numbering) of the drawings placed on the layout 
will behave.

One level higher than the layout is the subset and one level higher than the subset 
is the Layout Book. You can choose whether you would like to automatically assign 
IDs based on the subset and the Layout Book or specify a custom ID for the layout.
It is worth taking the time to set up the ID management at the Layout 
Book level and let ArchiCAD manage the IDs of the layouts.

Creating a layout
Let's create a layout to see the previous theory in action:
1.	 Open Layout Book in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS subset if the tree structure is 
not unfolded.
3.	 Then, select the A-1 PLANS subset.
4.	 Next, click on the New Layout button.
5.	 Enter 2nd FLOOR PLAN in the Layout Name field and leave the ID setting to 
use the automatic assignment.
6.	 Finally, select Arch-D from the Master Layout drop-down list.
You will notice that the new layout assumed the next sequential ID to be A-102 and 
it will appear under the A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN layout.
Adding views to layouts
Adding views to the layouts can be done in several different ways. We will discuss 
three of these options. We actually add drawings to layouts, which are linked 
to views, because at this point, we are dealing with a digital representation of 
a printout:
•	
You can edit a layout by double-clicking on it in the Layout Book. In an 
active layout, you can right-click anywhere and select Place Drawing. You 
can also activate the Drawing tool and click anywhere within the layout to 
do the same. These two methods will bring up the Place Drawing dialog 
box Here, you can link the drawing to the view that you would like to use 
from a list.
www.it-ebooks.info

[ 241 ]
•	
You can select an external source or an external Teamwork Project as the 
source of the view list. In these cases, we can browse an external file and 
review the available views in them. You can also select an internal view from 
the view map of the current file. After selecting the view, you can click on 
Place to place the drawing that is linked to the view on the layout.

[ 242 ]
•	
The third and perhaps, the most intuitive option is to select a view in the 
organizer and drag it on top of a layout. After dropping the view on the 
layout, you can see the drawing with a white icon referencing the selected 
view listed under the layout.
There are several ways to adjust the settings of a placed drawing. Right-clicking on 
the drawing will bring up a menu of options. Select Drawing Selection Settings, 
which will bring up the corresponding dialog box, allowing you to assign an ID 
and name to the drawing. It also defines whether the content of the drawing will 
be updated manually or automatically.
You can also adjust the properties of the drawing and turn on its frame and title. A 
pen set can be assigned under Properties and you can choose whether the drawing 
will be printed in its original colors, grayscale, or black and white.

Titles are annotation library parts that can be assigned to drawings. Several titles 
are available in the basic template and each with different graphic appearances and 
options to display additional annotation elements (for example, drawing scale and 
graphic scale). If you do not want to show a title under your drawing, this is where 
you need to turn it off by selecting No Title from the drop-down menu that lists the 
different title types.
You can directly draw with a limited number of 2D tools on the layout in addition to 
placing drawings. However it is not recommended as manually created 2D elements 
are difficult to update and maintain.
Placing drawings on layouts
We will place a drawing on a layout and change its title to practice the concepts that 
were described earlier:
1.	 Open the organizer and set View Map on the left and Layout Book on 
the right.
2.	 Unfold the tree of the Schematic Design Floor Plans view folder by 
clicking on the plus sign next to it if it is not unfolded yet.
3.	 Click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS subset if the tree structure is 
not unfolded.
4.	 Select the 2nd FLOOR PLAN view and drag it on the top of the A-102 2nd 
FLOOR PLAN layout.
5.	 You will notice that the drawing will appear under the layout.
6.	 Double-click on the A-102 2nd FLOOR PLAN layout and close the organizer.
7.	 Right-click on the placed 2nd FLOOR PLAN drawing and select Drawing 
Selection Settings.
8.	 Under Title, select Simple Title from the drop-down menu.
You will notice that the drawing's title has changed to only display the drawing 
name and scale.
Changes and adjustments
The Drawing Manager is a helpful tool to organize and track our drawings. You can 
activate it by clicking on the top-left button in the Navigator palette and selecting 
Show Drawing Manager.

When you have a layout open with drawings placed on it, the Drawing Manager will 
highlight the drawings on the active layout in bold letters. This is helpful when you 
want to identify which drawings you are working with on the current layout. The 
Drawing Manager allows you to relink a drawing to a different view by clicking on 
the top-left button and selecting a view from the Link to list. You can also do this by 
right-clicking on the drawing itself and selecting Link Drawing to from the menu. 
We will make use of this feature shortly.
If you want to freeze a drawing's state on a layout, you can click on the second 
button on the top-left part of the panel. This will break the link between the drawing 
and the referenced view. This is not recommended because you will create a 
disconnected object in your documentation workflow that you will have to manage 
manually. You can also refresh and delete drawings with the remaining buttons.
You will find two buttons at the bottom of the Drawing Manager that will allow you 
to open the source view of the drawing and access its settings.
The Drawing Manager gives you a comprehensive overview of the drawings that 
are placed on your layouts. The drawing list has two columns that we need to 
mention here:
•	
The Source View column describes the position of the linked view of the 
internal view map or the view map of an external file.
•	
The Path column specifies the file path of the external file itself. This is very 
useful because, if you have several external drawings placed on your layouts, 
this is the only place where you can find the original file's path. If the linked 
view is in the current document, then Path will be set to Internal.

Setting up multiple layouts
Next, we will explore a layout technique that will help you set up multiple 
layouts quickly:
1.	 Open Layout Book in the organizer and set View Map on the left and Layout 
Book on the right.
2.	 Click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS if the tree structure is not 
unfolded and select the A-1 PLANS subset.
3.	 Create a new layout by selecting the A-102 2nd FLOOR PLAN and holding 
down the Ctrl key. Then, drag the new layout on top of the A-1 PLANS subset.
4.	 Repeat Step 3 and create another layout.
5.	 You will notice that the IDs of the layouts will assume the next available 
number (A-103 and A-104) but the names of the layouts will remain A-102 
2nd FLOOR PLAN.
6.	 Rename the new layouts to A-103 3rd FLOOR PLAN and A-104 4th 
FLOOR PLAN.
7.	 Click on the plus button next to the layouts to see the drawings placed on 
them. Since we duplicated the A-102 2nd FLOOR PLAN, the new layouts 
will both have 2nd FLOOR PLAN drawing on them.
8.	 Right click on the drawing, under the A-103 3rd FLOOR PLAN and select 
Link Drawing to.
9.	 Select 3rd FLOOR PLAN from the Link to list of the internal views.
10.	 Repeat Steps 8 and 9 and relink the drawing under A-104 4th FLOOR PLAN 
to the 4th FLOOR PLAN view.
You can create similar layouts of similar drawings rapidly, dragging-and-dropping 
while keeping the Ctrl key pressed technique that was previously described by only 
using the organizer. One of the benefits of this technique is that the drawings will be 
perfectly aligned on multiple layouts, since we created them by duplicating a carefully 
placed original to start with.
Printing
We will use a technique to quickly print a few selected pages for review. This is 
useful when you want to have a discussion with your project team and do not have 
a lot of time to spend on setting up a printing or publishing process:
1.	 First, open Layout Book in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Then, click on the plus sign next to A-1 PLANS and A-2 ELEVATIONS.

3.	 Select the following layouts by holding down the Ctrl key:
°°

°°
A-102 2nd FLOOR PLAN
°°
A-201 NORTH ELEVATION
°°
A-202 EAST ELEVATION
°°
A-203 SOUTH ELEVATION
°°
A-204 WEST ELEVATION
4.	 Go to the File menu and select Print. Otherwise, press the key combination 
of Ctrl + P and the Print Layout window will open.
5.	 The printer will be identified at the top of the window. If it is incorrect, click 
on the Page Setup button and assign the correct printer.
6.	 Under the Source heading, select Selected Layouts in the Navigator.
7.	 Under the Size heading, select Fit to Page.
8.	 Under the Arrangement heading, the blue rectangle should fit inside the 
black rectangle (there should only be one black rectangle).
9.	 Finally, click on the Print button.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the project workflow of ArchiCAD as it relates 
to the documentation. You also learned the details of setting up views in View Map 
and creating sheets in the Layout Book. You also learned about Autotext and layout 
techniques and how the document set is organized. This all fits into the overall 
project workflow in ArchiCAD. The next phase in our workflow adventure will 
take us into the world of multiple layout exports and collaboration. This is where 
the Publisher (part of the Navigator palette) comes into play.

Graphisoft has been focusing its efforts around the Open BIM concept for several 
years. The Open BIM concept is based on the idea of members of an extended 
design team collaborating and sharing content using various types of software 
and file formats.
In this chapter, we will:
•	
Review how the Publisher can automate the file export and printing process
•	
Learn how ArchiCAD can import and export different file formats that are 
important for successful collaboration
•	
Explore how the Teamwork environment enables multiple users to work on 
the same project
•	
Review some considerations that will help you when you want to collaborate 
with your co-workers in the same or different offices
Publisher
The Publisher is ArchiCAD's automation system that serves two main purposes. 
You can either print multiple layouts or drawings with it or export multiple files 
in various formats with literally the click of a button. Before you get to the stage of 
simply clicking on the Publish button, you need to set up your publisher sets.

Work Sharing with ArchiCAD
[ 250 ]
Clicking on the top-right Publisher Sets button of the Navigator palette activates 
the publisher sets. The Publisher Sets window consists of two main areas, which are 
the list of Publisher Sets and Publishing Properties. You can reveal the content of a 
specific publisher set by either double-clicking its name in the list or by clicking on 
the Publisher Sets button and selecting it from the drop-down list.
If you want to create a new publisher set, you will need to bring up the Organizer 
first, because you need the additional source field to populate your new set from. To 
look at this in action, open Organizer and set Publisher Sets on the right.
You will notice that publisher sets can be populated from View Map, Layout Book, 
and other publisher sets. You cannot add an item directly from the project map as 
none of the view settings are yet established at that level.
You can drag and drop items from the left into the publisher set but you 
can also use the Add Shortcut button, which will appear under View 
Map or Layout Book, when you select an item in them. The Add Shortcut 
feature is similar to cloning a folder (see Chapter 3, Documentation – A 
Residential Project, for more information on that subject).

Publishing properties
Once you have created a publisher set, you can close Organizer and view and 
interact with the publishing set's elements in Navigator. The Publishing Properties 
area of the Publishing Sets window includes the Publishing Properties button, 
which we will discuss next.
Clicking on the Publishing Properties button in the lower part of the window will 
bring up the Publisher Set Properties dialog. You can select the Publishing Method 
in this dialog along with other related options. There are four publishing methods to 
choose from the top of the dialog:
•	
The first option is Print, which allows you to print a set of layouts or 
drawings at once. When you select this option, the rest of the dialog goes 
blank. The specific print settings are in a different area, which we will review 
later.
•	
The second option is Save files. Selecting this option allows you to choose the 
destination path and folder structure of the exported files. The Create single 
file method combines multiple layouts and drawings into a single file, which 
is only applicable to the PDF or BIMx Hyper-model formats. This is why the 
dialog allows you to choose one of these two formats at this step. The Create 
a real folder structure or Create flat file structure option will either mirror 
the folder organization of the publisher set or export the individual files into 
a single destination folder. You can choose the Include Project Reviewer 
web environment with these two options. The Include Project Reviewer 
web environment feature generates an HTML website with hyperlinks to 
navigate through the exported files. If you have access to a web server, you 
can upload the website with the exported file and make it available for other 
team members to view in a web browser.
•	
The Plot option is set up for plotting multiple large, format layouts. You can 
revisit Chapter 3, Documentation – A Residential Project, for more information 
about plotting layouts or drawings.
•	
You can either publish or upload a BIMx Hyper-model to the web by 
selecting Upload BIMx Hyper-model. You need to have access to a cloud 
service when you want to upload a BIMx Hyper-model.
It's worth mentioning here that there is a difference between the BIMx 3D model, 
which is saved from an ArchiCAD file, and the BIMx Hyper-model, which can be 
created using Publisher. Unlike the BIMx 3D model, the BIMx Hyper-model includes 
documentation of the project as well. In other words, the layouts and interactive 
links between the drawings in the layouts and model are saved within the BIMx 
Hyper-model.

We will go into more detail about exporting various file formats later in this chapter. 
For now, you can click on OK to close the Publisher Set Properties dialog.
The publishing item list or folder structure will appear when you double-click on a 
publisher set. You can go back to the publisher set list by clicking on the One Level 
Up button with an upward pointing arrow, at the upper-right area of the window.
We mentioned that some of the specific settings are addressed in a different area. The 
Format area under the publishing item list includes drop-down options to select the 
specific export file format and a translator, if applicable. The Format area will include 
the settings for printing when you choose the Print publishing method.

Once you are satisfied with your settings, you have one more option to choose before 
you click on the Publish button. The Sets to output button, next to the Publish 
button allows you to choose if you would like to print only the selected items in the 
publishing item list, or the entire publishing set.
Finally, clicking on the Publish button will bring up the Publishing dialog, which 
you can use to monitor the publishing process. You can click on Close after all the 
items are published.
Exporting to CAD and other file formats
ArchiCAD has the ability to open and save various file types that are commonly 
used in other CAD and BIM programs. The recognition of out-of-the-box file types 
can be further extended with add-ons, enabling you to save additional file types. 
Communicating and coordinating with consultants who use other programs is an 
important part of project development. This is why the ability to read and write 
different file formats is valuable.
Where you save from matters
It is important to be aware of where you are in the project structure when you export 
or import non-native file formats. Depending on how you would like to use the 
information in these files, you can reference them in various parts of your modeling 
and documentation process.
Let's look at the basic examples of this concept next.
Project map and view map
Perhaps the most common file reference today is still in the form of 2D floor plans, 
even though we are working in the world of 3D BIM. Room layouts, structural 
grids, and equipment placement are relatively simple to coordinate with 2D floor 
plans. This is why they are a frequent choice of vehicle to send information between 
designers, structural engineers, and other consultants.
When you activate a project map or a view map element and want to export the 
displayed content, you have three main export options, as follows:
•	
Exporting 2D content
•	
Exporting 3D content
•	
Exporting other kinds of data, for example, lists, schedules, or indexes
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Work Sharing with ArchiCAD
[ 254 ]
In all of these cases, the whole content of the displayed information will be exported 
in one file. For example, when you activate 1st FLOOR PLAN from the Schematic 
Design Floor Plans folder of the view map, you can export the entire first floor 
plan as a 2D DWG file. We will explore the details of the last two options mentioned 
earlier in the Exporting 3D content and Other File Formats sections of this chapter. For 
now, let's keep focusing on exporting 2D content.
Layout Book
The Layout Book is the digital representation of the printed document set. By its 
definition, elements of the Layout Book display 2D information and, therefore, the 
files exported while you view a Layout Book item will always be 2D. This does not 
mean that you can only create static file exports, in which the information is difficult 
to navigate and comprehend. As we will see later, there are useful interactive features 
that can be used to enhance the usability of the files exported from Layout Book.
Publisher
The Publisher is designed to automate the printing and file-export process. With 
a properly set up publisher set, it literally takes the click of a button to export 
numerous files and complex document structures. Whether you need to print or save 
your document set, the Publisher is a useful tool to extract the information that you 
built up though the modeling and documentation process in ArchiCAD and make it 
available to other participants in the project.
In the following exercise, you will save a 2D DWG file of the 1st FLOOR PLAN in 
three ways from the three different areas of the project structure that we discussed 
earlier.
Saving files from the project map and view map
To save files from the project map and view map, perform the following steps:
1.	 First, open the view map in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Click on the plus sign next to Schematic Design Floor Plans.
3.	 Then double-click on 1st FLOOR PLAN to activate it.
4.	 Go to the File menu and select Save As or press the key combination of Ctrl 
+ Shift + S. The Save Plan dialog will open.
5.	 Select DWG File from the Save as type drop-down menu.
6.	 Navigate to your choice of folder in the browser section of the dialog.
7.	 Under the Translator heading, select 01 For further editing.

8.	 Name the DWG file 1st FLOOR PLAN in the File name section.
9.	 Click on the Save button.
10.	 Then, the Locate txt.shx dialog will appear. This dialog will allow you to 
specify a vector-based font assigned to the DWG, which is not essential for 
our purposes.
11.	 Click on the Skip All button to finish the saving process.
Saving files from the Layout Book
To save files from the Layout Book, perform the following steps:
1.	 First, open the Layout Book in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Then click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS subset if the tree structure 
is not unfolded.
3.	 Next, double-click on A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN layout, under the A-1 PLANS 
subset, to activate it.
4.	 Repeat steps four through seven from the preceding heading to set up the 
Save Plan dialog.

[ 256 ]
5.	 Name the DWG file 1st FLOOR PLAN layout in the File name section.
6.	 Repeat steps nine through eleven from the preceding heading to finish the 
saving process.
Publishing files from the Publisher
To publish files from the Publisher, perform the following steps:
1.	 First, open Publisher in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Then select the Layouts to DWG.
3.	 Click on the Publishing Properties button at the lower part of Navigator. 
The Publisher Set Properties dialog will appear.
4.	 Specify a file path of your choice by clicking on the Browse button under the 
File Details section of the dialog.
5.	 Click on OK to close the Publisher Set Properties dialog.
6.	 Double-click on the Layouts to DWG to reveal the content of the Layouts to 
DWG publisher set.
7.	 Click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS folder if the tree structure is 
not unfolded.
8.	 Select A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN under the A-1 PLANS folder.
9.	 Click on the Set to Output button, next to the Publish button at the bottom 
of the Navigator palette and select Selected items.
10.	 Click on the Publish button. The Publishing dialog will appear.
11.	 Once the publishing process is finished, you will see a green check mark next 
to A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN published.
12.	 Click on Close to finish the saving process.

The previous steps highlight the difference between the export options. If you open 
three different DWG files in AutoCAD, you will notice that the 1st FLOOR PLAN.
DWG file will be in Model Space, while the 1st FLOOR PLAN layout.DWG and the 
1st FLOOR PLAN published.DWG files will be in Paper Space. This is the result of 
saving files from different areas of the project structure.
Activating the 1st FLOOR PLAN in the view map brings up the entire floor plan, 
which is the equivalent of Model Space in AutoCAD. The Layout Book is similar to 
Paper Space in AutoCAD, which is why saving the A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN layout 
and publishing the A-101 1st FLOOR PLAN published layout will create DWG files 
that will activate Paper Space in AutoCAD. The difference between the last two 
DWG files is only in the process of creating them.
List of file formats
To have a high-level overview of ArchiCAD's file format translation capabilities, 
let's look at the list of file formats that are available in the Save Plan dialog based 
on the basic installation of the software. As we mentioned before, installing third-
party add-ons can extend this file list. There are similar options available when you 
go to File | Save As with a section or elevation view active; however, there are 
significantly different options available saving with a 3D view active. We will discuss 
3D file formats later in more detail.

We already discussed how the active environment of the project structure has a 
fundamental influence on the available exportable file formats and the type of 
content in the exported files. The other factor that defines what kind of information 
you can export is the type of format itself. From this perspective, there are two main 
groups of file formats available, with two additional groups in one of them:
•	
Raster file formats (2D)
•	
Vector file formats (3D and 2D)
°°
BIM type file formats
°°
Basic vector-based file formats
The concepts of raster and vector file formats mentioned earlier need some further 
explanation.
Raster file formats store information based on pixels. When you zoom in to the 
content of a raster type file, the view will "pixelate" at a certain zoom factor and the 
onscreen resolution will decline. You will need high-resolution raster files to print 
sharp and readable drawings. Raster files can only store 2D content.
Vector files store information based on vector coordinates. You can zoom in to the 
content of a vector file theoretically and infinitely without losing any resolution. 
Vector-based files are often smaller and more appropriate for printing drawings 
because of their nature. Vector files are not appropriate to save renderings or 
photographs however. This is why raster files still have a distinct function even in 
mostly vector-based projects. Vector files can store both 2D and 3D type content.
The BIM type file formats store information based on the attributes of individual 
content elements. For example, a BIM type file recognizes whether a wall it is saved 
from a 2D, 3D, or floor plan view.

Basic vector-based file formats, on the other hand, simply recognize the geometry of 
the displayed content based on vector coordinates. If you save a basic vector based 
file from a 2D floor plan view, it will store only 2D information. If you save a basic 
vector-based file from a 3D view, it will store the geometry in 3D.
Now that we have established the definition of these basic concepts, it is important 
to address the fact that, even though we save a certain file type from a 2D and floor 
plan view, it can either store only 3D or 2D content. For example, a BIM type file 
format will "understand" that a wall is a 3D element, which is based on the wall's 
attributes, even if it is represented in 2D projection in the floor plan view.
Certain vector-based file formats capture 2D drawings if they are saved from a 2D 
floor plan view and store 3D geometry if they are saved from a 3D view. The DWG 
format is a good example of this behavior. On the other hand, if you save a PDF file 
from either a 2D or 3D view, in both cases the vector content will be 2D. The 3D view 
will be "flattened" into 2D graphics if you save a PDF file from a 3D window.
The following screenshot illustrates the available file formats in the Save Plan dialog. 
As we mentioned earlier, similar file export options are available when the File/ 
Save As command is accessed while the other 2D type views are active (for example, 
sections, elevations, or interior elevations). The Save Document dialog is activated in 
those cases that refer to the non-floor plan type content.

The details of the preceding screenshot are as follows:
a.	 These formats are native ArchiCAD file formats. We will discuss the 
Module File type later in this chapter.
b.	 PDF files saved from a 2D type view (floor plans, elevations, sections, 
and so on) will contain 2D graphic elements. PDFs can also include 
raster elements, for example, Figure images inserted on the floor 
plan.
c.	 Windows metafiles are legacy formats that can contain both raster 
and vector 2D information.
d.	 These are raster-based image file formats (also referred to as bitmap 
files) that can be edited in raster graphics programs.
e.	 Autodesk DXF and DWG files are the most frequently used formats 
because many CAD and BIM software are capable of handling these 
types of files. A 2D vector line drawing of the view will be saved 
when you select either of these file types. We will discuss saving and 
opening DWG files in more detail later in this chapter.

ArchiCAD has a long history of collaborating with Bentley products. 
MicroStation is a 3D CAD design and modeling software.
g.	 IFC is an open-source BIM exchange file format. We will also address 
IFC files in more detail later.
Exporting 3D content
We have referred to the fact that 3D content is handled differently in file exports. 
This is true when saving basic vector-based file formats because the definition of 3D 
geometry is dependent upon actually generating content in 3D view. Otherwise the 
basic vector based file formats would not have any reference to 3D content. This is 
not necessary with BIM type file formats, which means that 3D content can be saved 
from either a 2D or 3D view.
You can activate a 3D view by double-clicking on Generic Perspective or Generic 
Axonometry under the 3D section of the project map.

An even simpler shortcut is to press the F5 key, which is the shortcut key for the 
View/ Elements in 3D View/ Show Selection/ Marquee in 3D command. If nothing 
is selected, the whole content of the project will be generated in the 3D view when 
you press F5.
3D file formats
Once the 3D content is generated, you can go to File | Save as to export the model in 
various file formats. The following screenshot illustrates the available file formats in

g.	 Selecting the SketchUp file format can be useful when you want to 
communicate 3D information with consultants who do not have more 
access to robust BIM solutions. There is a free version of SketchUp 
available, which makes this a very accessible file format.

Saving model elements as a library part
ArchiCAD allows you to create library parts without GDL scripting, which is 
the basic coding language of the program. This is a useful feature in generating 
repetitive elements as well as collaborating with other members of the design team. 
For example, a simple representation of a 3D chair can be easily modeled with the 
Slab tool and saved as a library part. The saved library part can be made available 
for the rest of the design team members, enhancing the productivity of the team. You 
can revisit Chapter 5, Project Setup and Modeling Part 2 – Healthcare Building Project, for 
more information on library parts.

You can save a selection of model elements as a library part in two ways:
•	
First, you can go to File | Libraries and Objects | Save Selection as with 
a floor plan view active. Choose Object from the available options to 
create a generic library part. The other options allow you to create custom 
library components. For example, you can design and model custom door 
leaves or cabinet doors, which you can use to create detailed, model-based 
interior elevations. You can also create custom drawing titles with one of the 
available options by drawing a custom drawing title with 2D elements and 
saving them as a library part.

•	
You can select File/ Save as and choose ArchiCAD Object File from the Save 
as type drop-down list, with a 3D view active. When you view the model 
elements in 3D, ArchiCAD will prompt you to select a top, side, or bottom 
view to visualize the model elements in 3D. This feature allows you to define 
the default orientation of your library part in 3D space. For example, if 
you view and save the model elements from a side view and place the new 
library part on a floor plan, you will notice that the model elements will be 
placed sideways.
Specific file formats
Understanding the basic concept of how ArchiCAD handles different file formats is 
important in order to collaborate effectively with design team members using other 
programs. The process of exchanging content between different software packages is 
called interoperability. Now that we have covered the basics, let's look at specific file 
formats and their export setting in detail.
DWG
As we mentioned previously, DWG is perhaps the most commonly used file 
format to exchange information with consultants. ArchiCAD has a robust DWG 
translation system, which is partly due to a long history of developing the translation 
capabilities of the program. Although DXF is a separate format, the translation 
settings are similar. We will focus on the DWG format, since it is more likely that 
you will use them.
Translators
The core of the DWG file interaction within ArchiCAD is Translator. When you 
save or open a DWG file, you assign a DWG/DXF translator to the process. A 
translator is a predefined collection of settings that ArchiCAD uses to translate the 
information in the DWG file. You can customize these settings and save them as 
a custom translator. You can access the DXF-DWG Translation Setup dialog by 
clicking on the Settings button, next to the Translator in the Save Plan or Save 
Document dialog.

We used a prebuilt translator called 01 For further editing when we saved and 
published DWGs earlier in this chapter. You can access the settings of this translator 
by going to File | File Special | DXF-DWG Translation Setup. This will activate the 
translation setting dialog. You will notice that the 01 For further editing translator 
is listed at the top of the Available Translators list with blue and green arrows. The 
blue arrow indicates that this is the default translator for exporting DWG/DXF files 
and the green arrow indicates that this will be the translator used in the current 
setting to export the file. A similar arrow pointing left indicates the default translator 
and the translators in use for importing DWG/DXF files.

The setting to customize translation is in the Settings in Selected Translator area 
of the dialog. As you will see, there are many options and details that can help you 
fine-tune the translation process. We will now highlight a few important settings that 
define how the DWG file will be handled.
Drawing Units allow you to specify what a DWG unit will be equal to in ArchiCAD. 
Typically, the default Working Units are specified in feet and fractional inches, in 
which case you need to select feet in this area.
There are various versions of DWG files and some programs only handle older DWG 
types. You can select the File Format in the Save Options area.
The Attributes area lists the detailed setting options to customize the DWG 
translation. You have the ability to create custom conversion tables for Layers, 
Pens and Colors, Linetypes, and Fills. One specific setting can make a difference to 
how the converted DWG file will look in AutoCAD. Enter 4 in the LTScale value 
in output File area, under Line-types | Methods, to achieve an optimum line type 
scale conversion. This means that the length of dashes in a dashed line type will 
remain the same after converting your file into DWG. Although there is a detailed 
explanation about why this value needs to be set, the end result is more important 
for our purposes.
There are more options, such as the ability to convert ArchiCAD labels to AutoCAD 
leaders under Custom Functions | Save Extras. You can review and adjust these 
settings to achieve the optimal translation process of your choice.

The dialog has a feature that is useful in setting project standards. Adjusting all 
the settings would be time consuming if we needed to do that in every project file 
individually. You can export the combination of settings—a translator—as an XML 
file by selecting the translator in the Available Translators list and clicking on the 
Create New button; import it in to other projects by clicking on the Browse button at 
the upper-right side of the dialog (see Chapter 9, Visualization and Model Management, 
for more information on standards and model management).
PDF files
PDF files are also important tools of collaboration for several reasons. PDFs are 
compact. They can include both vector and raster content, and multiple-page 
PDFs are easy to navigate. The only software that is needed to view and interact 
with PDF files is the free Adobe PDF Viewer, which is already installed on nearly 
everyone's computers.
Project managers and clients, who don't necessarily want to work in the BIM 
environment, can easily mark up PDF sketches saved from ArchiCAD. This makes 
this file type a popular choice of collaboration platform outside the modeling 
software.
Save or print?
We need to distinguish between two different methods of generating PDF files in 
ArchiCAD. They are as follows:
•	
If the Adobe PDF printer driver is installed on your computer, you can create 
PDF files the same way as you would send a drawing or layout to a printer. 
Selecting the Adobe PDF printer driver as the "printer" will allow you to save 
a PDF file instead of physically printing the content.
•	
ArchiCAD has its own built-in PDF driver. You can create PDFs with 
ArchiCAD's PDF driver by selecting the PDF File type directly in the 
Save Plan or Save Document dialog as mentioned earlier. This method 
will usually create a better and more compact file because Graphisoft has 
integrated this driver into ArchiCAD.
Publishing multiple layouts into a single PDF file using the built-in PDF driver 
will generate an interactive digital document set. This means that ArchiCAD will 
automatically create hyperlinks in the document for navigating through the pages. 
You can click on an elevation marker on the floor plan view in the PDF file and 
it will automatically jump to the page of the referenced elevation. This feature is 
particularly useful when you want to create a software agnostic representation of 
your work which has multiple layouts.

Let's look at how this works in action:
1.	 Open the Publisher in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Select the Layouts to PDF.
3.	 Click on the Publishing Properties button at the lower part of Navigator. 
The Publisher Set Properties dialog will appear.
4.	 Specify a file path of your choice by clicking on the Browse button under the

7.	 Click on the plus sign next to the A-1 PLANS and A-2 ELEVATIONS folders 
if the tree structure is not unfolded.
8.	 Select the following layouts while holding down the Ctrl key:

A-204 WEST ELEVATION
9.	 Then click on the Set to Output button next to the Publish button at the 
bottom of the Navigator palette and select selected items. The Publishing 
dialog will appear.
10.	 Once the publishing process is finished, you will see a green check mark next 
to the published layouts.
11.	 Finally, click on Close to finish the saving process.
You will be able to click on the elevation markers on the two floor plan pages of the 
PDF file. Clicking on the markers will bring up the referenced elevation page.
BIMx Hyper-model
Graphisoft developed its own BIM presentation format called BIMx Hyper-model. 
The company is aiming to share content in a rich and interactive way with this 
format, which is more reflective of the complex BIM environment than other 
previously existing file types.

The main advantage of the BIMx format is that it allows someone who is not 
working in the BIM modeling environment to interact and view the model in 3D as 
well as 2D. The different views of the model are connected with interactive links and 
presented in the intuitive interface of the free BIMx Viewer.
BIMx Hyper-models can be viewed on desktop computers as well as mobile devices. 
In addition, the format supports stereo 3D viewing with 3D headsets.
You can publish a BIMx Hyper-model of your project by selecting File | Publish 
BIMx Hyper-model.
IFC files
The IFC (stands for Industry Foundation Classes) file format is an open-source 
BIM file format. You can share the building information model and its attributes 
with ArchiCAD and other BIM authoring software (for example, Autodesk Revit) 
using this format. IFC files are required by some large public clients because of 
their software agnostic and open structure. There are also free IFC model viewers 
available, making it simple to share your model with non-ArchiCAD users.
When you convert an IFC model that originated from another software, walls will 
be converted to ArchiCAD walls, slabs will become ArchiCAD slabs, and so on. The 
program can recognize these elements' natures based on the attributes saved in the 
IFC file.
As well as the advantage of the format being software independent, it's worth 
mentioning one of the disadvantages. This drawback is related to how the IFC 
format stores information about the equivalent of library parts.
The productivity and efficiency of using multiple library parts of the same kind is due 
to creating instances of the same model element. The IFC format does not recognize 
instances. The content of the individual library parts converted in an IFC file is 
achieved by repeating the geometry multiple times as separate elements. Although 
the developers are working on a solution for this problem, it is not yet available.

Even with this disadvantage, the IFC format is useful in collaborating with 
consultants using other BIM software.
Similar to the DWG/DXF translators, ArchiCAD has a detailed translator system 
available for IFC files. You can access the IFC translation settings by going to File | 
File Special | IFC 2 x 3 | IFC Translation Setup. With multiple preset translators 
and the ability to customize your translation, you can exchange BIM content that is 
specifically formatted for structural engineers, MEP, or other consultants.

Other file formats
ArchiCAD can translate other file formats besides the ones we highlighted in the 
previous section. In particular, we should address XLS and TXT formats here 
because you can save Schedules and Lists in these formats for further editing or 
just sharing with others. When you activate Door Schedule by double-clicking on 
Door Schedule under Schedules | Element in the project map, you can save it in 
Excel Workbook (XLSX or XLS) or Tabbed Text (TXT) format. You can import these 
file formats directly in Microsoft Excel for viewing or editing. Lists of elements, 
components, or zones can be saved as TXT files.
Collaboration
Collaboration is bidirectional by definition. So far in this chapter, we have 
discussed how you can export certain file types. Let's review the second half of 
the collaboration process, which is receiving information and importing it into 
ArchiCAD.
Many of the settings that we mentioned previously apply to importing as well as 
exporting different file types with slight variations. The active project environment 
and the nature of the specific file type also define how you can reference the 
information in your project.
Let's look at DWG files again in this context to illustrate some of the slight variations 
of the importing process.

Referencing DWG files
We will discuss four different ways that you can use to reference a DWG file next. 
Each of them relies on an assigned translator, similar to the process of exporting 
DWGs. They are as follows:
•	
Perhaps the most straightforward way of referencing a DWG file is by going 
to File | Open. This will bring up the Open File dialog, where you can 
choose the DWG File format from the Files of type drop-down list. You can 
then browse to the particular DWG file and specify the translator of your 
choice from the Translator drop-down list. Notice that the 02 For editable 
import translator is selected when you open the dialog, which is the default 
translator for importing DWGs. Opening a DWG will close the previously 
opened project file and ArchiCAD will create a new project based on the 
DWG file.
•	
You can go to File | File Special | Merge if you would like to import the 
content of the DWG file as editable elements into an existing project. Once 
selected, the Merge DXF-DWG dialog will appear. You can specify here 
whether you would like to merge the content of Model Space into the current 
view or append paper space(s) to Layout Book. This part of the process is 
unique to importing, since you need to link the concept of AutoCAD's Paper 
Space and Model Space to the ArchiCAD project environment.

•	
ArchiCAD has an Xref management system to support the concept similar 
to external references in AutoCAD. You can attach a DWG file as an Xref by 
navigating to File | External Content | Attach Xref. This will bring up the 
Attach Xref dialog, where you can specify the DWG file; you can also specify 
where you would like to reference the file and translator of you choice for the 
process. Xrefs have their own management system in ArchiCAD, which can 
be accessed by going to File | External Content | Xref Manager.
•	
The fourth option for referencing a DWG file is using the Drawing tool or 
by going to File | External Content | Place External Drawing. In either 
case, the DWG will be handled as a drawing element in ArchiCAD with an 
assigned layer and properties. The Place External Drawing command will 
use the default settings specified in the Drawing Default Settings dialog. 
You can access this dialog by double-clicking on the Drawing tool icon.
The Drawing tool is also useful in referencing other types of files, for example, 
scanned sketches in JPG format or PDF files. A good way to keep your views clean 
and organized is by creating Independent Worksheets and placing drawings or 
sketches that you would like to use as reference on them.
Using worksheets
You can imagine these worksheets as individual sketches in your model structure 
that you can reference in virtually any view using ArchiCAD's Trace tool (View | 
Trace). Once you have created the worksheet and placed the sketch or drawing from 
another file on it, you can right-click on it in the project map, and select Show as 
Trace Reference.
Let's look at how that works in action. We will use the Xref process for this exercise 
to reference a DWG file on the worksheet:
1.	 Open the project map in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Right-click on Worksheets and select Create New Independent Worksheet.
3.	 You can leave the default values for Reference ID and Name in the New 
Independent Worksheet dialog. Then click on the Create button.
4.	 Navigate to File | External Content | Attach Xref.
5.	 Browse the 1 SECTION.DWG file.
6.	 Uncheck the Specify On-Screen option under Insertion Point. This way we 
will place the DWG based on its own origin.
7.	 Click on the Attach button.

8.	 Leave the layer settings unchanged in the DWG/DXF Partial Open dialog 
and click on OK. When you zoom out, you will see that the section is placed 
on the worksheet.
9.	 Activate the 1st floor plan view by double-clicking on 1st FLOOR PLAN in 
the Navigator palette.
10.	 Right-click on the newly created worksheet and select Show as Trace 
Reference.
11.	 The section will appear aligned under the floor plan.
12.	 Then, navigate to Window | Palettes | Trace & Reference.
13.	 The Trace & Reference palette will appear, which you can use to adjust the 
visibility of the referenced worksheet.
14.	 You can turn off the visibility of the referenced worksheet either by clicking 
the top left button of the palette or by pressing Alt + F2.
Collaboration with IFC files
As we previously mentioned, we can use IFC files to exchange models with 
consultants using other BIM platforms. A typical example of such a scenario is 
working with structural engineers. Structural engineers often use Autodesk Revit, 
which can export their models in IFC format. The structural model is an important 
component of the building and it is a good practice to keep an updated copy of it 
referenced in the architectural project.
You can merge the structural model directly into your project (File | File Special 
| Merge) but it is better to open it in a separate file and reference that file into your 
project by selecting File | External Content | Place Hotlinked Module. This way 
you can keep your project clean and organized no matter what the content of the 
structural model includes.

[ 275 ]
IFC management
ArchiCAD has IFC management features that are helpful for updating IFC files. 
For example, when you receive an updated version of the structural model in IFC 
format, you can open the separate file that you used to originally convert the model 
and automatically update its content.
Of course, you could create a new separate ArchiCAD file altogether from the 
updated structural model, but that way you would lose the original elements that 
you might have already linked in to your project. For example, if you dimension 
the structural column that is referenced in to your project from the separate file 
and recreate the structural model in a new separate file, the dimension will lose its 
dynamic connection to the original structural column and will be deleted.
Instead of recreating a separate file, you can open the original converted structural 
model and select File | File Special | IFC 2 x 3 | Update with IFC Model. Only 
new elements will be added and the original elements will be updated in this way, 
maintaining all references and dynamic links in your project.
You can even review changes before updating the IFC model by navigating to File 
| File Special | IFC 2 x 3 | Detect IFC Model Changes. After merging the changes 
this way, the difference will be highlighted with the Mark-Up tool.
Teamwork
We will discuss two meanings of the word Teamwork in this section. First, we will 
look at the details of how ArchiCAD's Teamwork function works and then address a 
broader definition of teamwork. The second, broader definition refers to how design 
teams collaborate and share work in the BIM environment from the user's perspective.

[ 276 ]
Before we get into discussing the task-related details, let's shed some light on a 
few of the important elements of the underlying technology, which is called the 
Graphisoft BIM Server.
BIM Server
The Graphisoft BIM Server technology has a true server approach, which means that 
the information is managed securely in a database form. The server backs up the 
data automatically. In case of a system failure, the project file can be recovered or a 
previously saved state can be regenerated.
Another advantage of this technology is its speed. Only a small amount of data needs 
to be transmitted over the network when you save your work in a Teamwork project. 
For example, if you place a wall on the 1st floor plan and save your work, only the 
data related to that one wall will be transferred back to the server, as opposed to the 
whole project file. This feature reduces related time delays to the point where you 
will almost feel that saving the work happens instantly. Of course, this depends on 
network connection speed and other factors as well.
Users
The BIM Server Manager allows the registration of multiple users with various 
predefined roles. User roles can be established based on the level of interaction with 
the BIM project, ranging from advanced users capable of changing project level 
settings, to project managers only reviewing the work of the other team members. 
Every user has a unique Login name and Password that needs to be entered when 
logging in to the BIM Server.

Teamwork projects
After logging in to the BIM Server, the Open/Join Teamwork Project dialog will 
appear, listing the available Teamwork projects under the selected BIM Server. 
You can select a project of your choice from the list and click on the Open or Join 
button at the lower-right corner of the dialog. Depending on whether you had joined 
that particular project in the past or not, the same button's function will change 
accordingly. The list of Teamwork projects will also include information about 
whether you had already joined the project, in the Status column.
Teamwork libraries
We need to mention here that the BIM Server can host BIM Server libraries as well, 
to allow multiple users to work on the same content. You can see the list of available 
BIM Server Libraries by going to File | Libraries and Objects | Manage BIM Server 
Libraries. Your user status needs to be Server or Project Administrator in order to 
make any changes in the Manage BIM Server Libraries dialog.

Working in the Teamwork environment
When you join a Teamwork file for the first time, ArchiCAD needs to download the 
whole project on your local computer. This process can take several minutes but it 
only happens once, at this point. When you open the project the next time, only the 
changes made by the other users need to be downloaded and synchronized with 
your local copy, which takes significantly less time.
It is useful to have the Teamwork palette open when you work with a Teamwork 
file. You can bring up the Teamwork palette by going to Teamwork | Teamwork 
Palette or Windows | Palettes | Teamwork Palette. You can review the areas of 
the Teamwork palette in the following screenshot.
The Teamwork palette consists of three main parts. You can interact with the 
Teamwork project in the Workspace area of the palette. You can send your changes 
to the server and receive the changes made by other users simultaneously by clicking 
on the Send & Receive button. This command will effectively synchronize your local 
copy of the Teamwork project with the server.
You can also select a free element in the project and reserve it for modification by 
clicking on the Reserve button. While an element is reserved by you, no other team 
member can work on it. Once you are done adjusting an element, you can click on 
the Release All button to make it available for the rest of the team.
As you work with other team members in the Teamwork environment, don't forget 
to click on Release All at the end of the day. Surprisingly, many project management 
issues stem from ignoring this common step.
ArchiCAD allows you to visually filter the project elements on the screen with the 
options listed in the drop-down list under Colored workspaces. You can highlight 
your reserved elements and color other users' elements with this option, which is 
useful in effectively working with others. Clicking on the My Workspace button 
will reveal the areas where you have elements reserved for your work.
The Users list shows all active and inactive users working on the Teamwork project. 
You can send a message, change the user's color on your screen, and look at the 
user's settings by selecting a user and clicking on the respective button at the 
lower-right, under the Users list.
The Messages feature works as ArchiCAD's internal text messaging application, 
with the additional function of managing reservation requests between users. If you 
need to work on an element that is reserved by another user, you can notify that user 
and request the element with this tool.

Working in the Teamwork environment is intuitive and supportive of complex 
production processes. Coordinating the work of large teams requires other 
considerations as well, which we will discuss next. The Teamwork palette is

Division of work
One of the challenges of managing a BIM project is related to assigning work to 
individual team members and coordinating their efforts. Even though ArchiCAD can 
technically handle a large amount of content and many users working at the same 
time on a single file, the effective division of work can be hindered when multiple 
users try to adjust the same elements.
A solution to this problem is dividing the project into different files or Teamwork 
projects, representing logical sections, and linking the files or Teamwork project into 
each other.
Using module files
Module files are useful in creating and placing repeating parts of the building. For 
example, you can save the repeating model and annotation elements of a patient 
room and link it into the project several times. You only need to make changes 
affecting all the linked patient rooms once in the module file and the change will 
be reflected in all of the placed instances. This concept is similar to using repeating 
library parts but it's extended to a collection of the elements that you want to keep 
separately editable.
Using Hotlink Manager
With Hotlink Manager, you can view the list of placed module files, change their 
links, and even break the links making the module's content regular, editable 
elements of the project. You can access Hotlink Manager by going to File | External 
Content | Hotlink Manager.

Efficiency with module files
Let's look at a useful technique to save a module file in action:
1.	 Open the view map in the Navigator palette.
2.	 Click on the plus sign next to Design Development Floor Plans.
3.	 Double-click on 1st FLOOR PLAN to activate it.
4.	 Zoom in to the top-left area of the floor plan.
5.	 Select the following library parts in 1001A BATHROOM by holding down 
the Ctrl key:
°°
Shower Cabin 17
°°
Towel Bar 01 17
°°
Basin 17
°°
Grab Bar 01 17
°°
WC 17
6.	 Navigate to File | External Content | Save Selection as Module.
7.	 Navigate to a folder of your choice.
8.	 Enter Bathroom Module in the File name field.
9.	 Make sure that the Replace selection with this hotlinked module file option 
is checked.
10.	 Lastly, click on Save to save the module file.

You can quickly create modules from a collection of elements with this technique. 
Once the module files are created, you can place instances of them at other locations 
of your floor plan. Notice that the placement anchors of the library parts change from 
round to square, indicating that the library parts belong to a placed module file.
Collaboration between offices
Working with other team members in the same office has its own challenges, but 
sharing work between different geographic locations adds a whole other level of 
complexity to the process. ArchiCAD's BIM Server, Teamwork process, and some of 
the additional techniques we mentioned earlier on can be useful in supporting inter-
office collaboration. Aside from technical solutions, talking to other team members in 
different offices on the phone can save a lot of time when you want to resolve issues.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the Publisher and its functions in the 
documentation and collaboration process. We explored how different project 
environment areas are related to various file types and how non-ArchiCAD files 
can be used as references in your work. You also learned about the Teamwork 
environment and how the Graphisoft BIM Server technology can support your 
team's collaboration efforts. We will conclude our lessons with model management 
concepts and visualization in the next chapter.

Visualization and Model 
Management
In this chapter, we will look at ArchiCAD's material system in detail and the basic 
concepts of architectural visualization. We will learn about:
•	
The basics of visualization
•	
Different rendering techniques with ArchiCAD
•	
How to create different types of presentation graphics
•	
How model management and troubleshooting are closely related to 
each other
Issues with display settings and file management can be often resolved simply, if you 
know how the elements and their attributes are connected.
Visualization concepts
Architectural visualization is a large topic, which alone is the focus of many books 
that are available today. We will have an overview of ArchiCAD's visualization 
capabilities in order for you to have a basic understanding of them. You can learn 
more about this subject from various online resources and publications. There are 
video tutorials available at https://www.youtube.com/user/Archicad about 
rendering with ArchiCAD.

The purpose of rendering
Rendered views of a proposed building have been important tools for centuries 
to communicate the design to clients and users. The process of translating the 
designer's ideas into visual representations is an important early step toward 
realizing a building. It can secure support for the project or stop it altogether. It 
requires skills that were traditionally related to hand drawing and painting. Good 
visualization is based on considering viewpoints, colors, light, shapes, and other 
basic graphic concepts.
In past decades, the use of computers has substituted the manual process of drawing 
and painting. Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the basic graphic 
concepts in order to create good renderings. One of the challenges of creating 
computer visualization is related to softening the inherent mechanical and lifeless 
look of the renderings, which we will discuss later in this chapter.
Rendering programs
A good way to approach realistic computer rendering is to consider it as virtual 
photography. You can create realistic representations of the smallest parts of the 
building and its surroundings with ArchiCAD and take a virtual photograph of the 
overall effect from a specific view point. While it is still important to understand the 
basic graphic concepts of composition, colors, and so on, learning about the basics of 
photography will support you in your work as well.
Realistic computer rendering programs are based on two methods:
•	
Simulating the effects of light on geometry and materials
•	
Calculating the effects of light on geometry and materials
Rendering programs that simulate the effects of light are also referred to as biased 
rendering software and programs that calculate the effects of light are also known as 
unbiased rendering programs. Both methods can generate high quality results and are 
available in the ArchiCAD workflow. ArchiCAD has two internal rendering engines 
that are based on simulating effects. With the use of add-ons, third-party programs 
are available to render to building model as well. An example of programs based on 
calculating the effects of light is Maxwell Render, which has a well-established add-on 
for ArchiCAD.

Chapter 9
[ 285 ]
Programs based on the calculation of the physics of light have settings that tend 
to be simpler and closely resemble the use of a real camera. The simulation of the 
effects of light relies on approximating algorithms, which can be complex. The 
detailed settings of the simulation programs require additional knowledge of these 
algorithms. To simplify this issue, ArchiCAD has preset scenes for various scenarios 
as we will see later on.
Even the simulation-based programs have settings that are based on the use of a 
physical camera, with which you can treat the process as virtual photography.
The basics of photography
Let's review some of the basic settings of a real camera next. This knowledge will be 
useful for us when we adjust some of the rendering settings. The most commonly 
used camera type that allows the user to manually adjust settings is called the Singe 
Lens Reflex (SLR) camera. Its name refers to a mirror in the body of the camera that 
allows the user to see directly through the lens, which tilts out of the way to expose 
the film or digital sensor when the shutter is released.
The lens has an aperture, which can open or close, letting more or less light 
pass through the lens. The shutter can control the length of time through which 
the aperture is open, regulating the amount of light that enters the camera. The 
combination of the aperture size and the shutter speed has a fundamental effect 
on what the picture will look like.
The settings of rendering programs are related to SLR camera settings and their 
names follow the standards of photography.
Shutter speed
In bright and daylight conditions, we would typically set a fast shutter speed 
because there is plenty of light around our subject. On the other hand, if we were in 
an interior of a building or in night time conditions, we would probably need to set 
a slower shutter speed to allow more time for the exposure because the amount of 
light is significantly less. The value of shutter speed is measured in seconds.
To illustrate this, in the following set of images, the first image in daylight is 
rendered with 1/250 seconds shutter speed, which is considered fast. The third 
image in night time is rendered with 1/2 seconds shutter speed, which is much 
slower. The shutter speed is considered in combination with the aperture size as 
you will see in the next section.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Visualization and Model Management
[ 286 ]
The next image shows examples of aperture size - shutter speed combinations. Note 
that the two values are inversely proportional to each other.
Aperture size or f-stop
In theory, regardless of the lighting conditions, you can set a small or a large 
aperture size. Imagine setting a large aperture size and therefore, creating a wide 
opening for the light to enter the camera without adjusting the shutter speed. In such 
a scenario, your film or sensor will be overexposed because too much of light will be 
captured by it. If you set a small aperture without adjusting the shutter speed, then 
your image can be underexposed. In both the cases, you will lose the clarity of the 
details of your subject because they would either be too bright or too dark to see.
The shutter speed and aperture size both seem to control the amount of light; 
however, there is a significant difference in the effect of adjusting one or the other. 
With a small aperture size, all of the details of your subject will be in focus regardless 
of their distance from the camera. With a large aperture size, parts of your subject 
around the camera's target will be sharp and the parts that are farther behind or in 
front of the target will be blurred.
Depth of field
The area around your camera's target where the objects are sharp is called depth 
of field. If you would like to achieve a shallow depth of field with a large aperture 
size, you will need to counter balance with a fast shutter speed in order to reduce the 
amount of light entering the camera. This could be desirable if you would create an 
interior, rendering to focus on a furniture arrangement and blurring out objects in 
the background or in the foreground.
The shallow depth of field effect is more pronounced when the camera is close 
to its target. Focusing on close objects in interiors tend to produce more blurred 
backgrounds than exterior views of the building.

[ 287 ]
If you would like to create an overall sharp image, you will have to choose a small 
aperture size and slow shutter speed. A typical example of this would be an overall 
exterior image of the building. Let's take a look at the following images:
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Visualization and Model Management
[ 288 ]
ISO or exposure value
The ISO or exposure value refers to the camera's overall sensitivity to light. This 
value also reflects the combination of the shutter speed and aperture size. As we 
discussed before, the same exposure value can be achieved with different shutter 
speed and aperture size combinations, however, the effect will not necessarily be the 
same. Higher ISO values allow the shift to lower light conditions. We can use ISO 
100 in a typical daylight condition and ISO 1600 with an evening image.
Let's imagine that we want to create a sharp exterior image in the middle of the day, 
using the combination of shutter speed 1/250, f-stop 11, and ISO 100. If we want to 
take the same image in the evening with the same f-stop, we would need to allow for 
a much longer shutter speed to compensate for the low light conditions.
This could create a problem in physical photography because long shutter speeds 
would require the camera to be stable for the time of exposure. If we didn't have a 
tripod to stabilize the camera, we could have used a higher ISO value (for example, 
ISO 1600) to set a higher overall camera sensitivity and maintain the shutter speed of 
1/250 with the same f-stop of 11. This way, even if we held the camera in our hand, 
the image would be sharp.

Although the virtual camera in ArchiCAD does not need to be stabilized, this 
concept is carried over from the world of physical photography and represented 
in the ISO or exposure value.
Active virtual environment
Although our main subject is the rendering of still images with ArchiCAD, this is a 
good place to mention that we can create active virtual environments of our model 
as well. The active virtual environment is one of the visualization concepts that can 
be utilized to present your ideas. Let's discuss two options that are available in the 
program. Both of them could be useful in presenting your design intent.
3D Document
ArchiCAD's 3D Document feature allows you to create a specialized 3D view, which 
you can use as a locked background for annotation. A newly created 3D Document 
will be listed under 3D Documents, in the project map.
When you add annotation to a 3D document, you can snap to the elements in 
the view and orientation of the annotation, which will be adjusted to the view's 
3D settings. This means that dimension lines will be presented parallel to the 
dimensioned elements. If the 3D Document is based on a perspective view, the 
dimension line will be displayed in perspective as well.

Visualization and Model Management
[ 290 ]
When you update the model, the content of the 3D document will be automatically 
updated as well, including dimensions that are linked to model elements. You can 
create a new 3D document or adjust the default 3D document settings by going to 
Document | 3D Document | New 3D Document or 3D Document Settings.
Active 3D models
We discussed several 3D output file formats in the previous chapter (see Chapter 8, 
Work Sharing with ArchiCAD, for more information). Let's look at two of them that 
you can use to create an active visualization of your model.
VRML stands for Virtual Reality Modeling Language. The VRML file format 
is designed to carry 3D model information, independently from any particular 
software packages. There are numerous free VRML viewers available that can run 
on desktops or as plugins to web browsers. You can even create websites with a 
dynamic representation of your model with the web plugin. You can zoom, orbit, 
and pan around the model directly in the website, making your building design 
easily accessible to your target audience.

Chapter 9
[ 291 ]
The 3D PDF is a somewhat more updated version of the same concept. PDF files 
can contain 3D models and only require the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view and 
navigate around them. ArchiCAD can save your model in a U3D file format, which is 
the preferred format for 3D content in PDF files. Adobe Acrobat Reader has several 
lighting and rendering options to customize the viewer's experience. Perhaps, one of 
the most important benefits of this format besides the widely available free viewer is 
that it can contain large models at a fraction of the original file size.
After reviewing the basic concepts of visualization, let's look at some of the specific 
rendering settings next.
Rendering
Before you can click on the rendering button, you need to address three components 
that contribute to the look of the final image:
•	
Content (materials assigned to geometry)
•	
Light (artificial and natural lights)
•	
Camera (views)
It is recommended that you consider material assignments at the beginning of the 
project when you first start modeling the elements. It's even better if you create 
a template file that has most of the commonly used elements setup with proper 
material assignments.
Rendering also refers to non-photo realistic visualization. For example, materials can 
be displayed in line-based elevations and sections to create a detailed representation 
of the building. We will see later in the chapter that ArchiCAD has the option 
to create sketch style renderings that simulate hand-drawn effects. Sketch style 
visualization also falls into the category of renderings.
Content
We will look at the setting of the modeling elements next, as they relate to rendering. 
We will review the material assignment of the parts of the building model and 
additional elements (for example, planting) that can enhance the presentation of 
your project.

Material assignment - attributes
ArchiCAD has a comprehensive system for representing different materials 
in different views. The following map describes the structure and relationship 
between the material representation concepts in the program:
Building Materials in ArchiCAD consist of two components. The Cut Fill is a 2D 
representation of the material, which will appear in floor plans and sections when 
the element is cut. The Surface is a 3D representation of the same material, which 
will define the look of the element in sections, elevations, 3D documents, and 3D 
views when the element is not cut as well as in renderings.

You can access the Building Materials settings by navigating to Options | Element 
| Attributes | Building Materials. You can assign additional information to the 
material in the Building Materials settings dialog. For example, you can specify 
a manufacturer or Physical Properties of the material, which could be used in 
energy modeling.

Surface refers to the visual qualities of the element's surface in different views 
when the element is not cut. The Surface settings define what kind of texture will 
be assigned to the element and how it will interact with light. You can access the 
Surface Settings dialog by navigating to Options | Element Attributes | Surfaces.
In the Surface Settings dialog, you can adjust the color and exposure settings in the 
Exposure to Light area. You can select an image file as a texture map and adjust the 
surface qualities in the Texture area. You can select a fill in the Vectorial Hatching 
area, which will be displayed in sections, elevations, 3D Documents, and 3D views 
when the Internal Engine is used to project the model. For example, you can assign 
a brick pattern fill here for a brick material and the lines of the brick pattern will be 
displayed on an elevation.

You can create a new surface by clicking on the New button in the top area of the 
Surface Settings dialog. This will activate the Add New Surface dialog. You can 
duplicate an existing surface and adjust its settings by selecting the Duplicate option.
It is useful to play with the different Exposure to Light settings of the 
Surface Settings dialog with a new surface. You can study the effect 
of different setting combinations this way without unintentionally 
affecting an already assigned Surface in you project.
You can also access predefined surfaces with the New from Catalog or Replace 
Settings from Catalog option. There are more than 500 predefined surfaces available 
in the Standard ArchiCAD Catalog and you can also download surfaces from http://
www.BIMComponents.com. If you have a software service agreement with Graphisoft, 
you can access the Additional Surface Catalog as well.

The basic modeling tools are listed under the Design section of the Toolbox palette. 
Typically, you can assign Building Materials in the Geometry and Positioning area 
of the tool's settings dialog with the exception of walls, library part type elements 
(doors, windows, skylights, stairs, curtain walls, and objects), and zones.
The material assignment of the library part type elements are primarily driven by 
parameters that are coded in the GDL script. These parameters are listed in the tool's 
Settings dialog. You can also make exceptions to the default material parameter 
settings by overriding the Surface assignment. The Override Surface setting is 
available in the Model area of the tool's Settings dialog.
Walls, slabs, roofs, and shells in ArchiCAD have a designated system to represent 
their structure. This system is called Composites. You can access the Composites 
settings by navigating to Options | Element Attributes | Composites. The Edit Skin 
and Line Structure area of the Composites Structures dialog allows you to create 
layers (skins) within elements and assign appropriate Building Materials to them. 
You can also define the thickness of the skin and type of lines separating them here.
Walls, beams, and columns can have profiles assigned to them, which will define 
their shapes as extrusions. For example, you can assign the W8X31 standard steel 
profile to a beam that will specify the beam's cross section shape and size. You can 
access the Profile Manager by navigating to Options | Element Attributes | 
Profile Manager.

The Components - Default area of the Profile Manager allows you to assign a 
specific Surface to the Profile, which will be extruded along the element. The 
type of fill used to create the profile will define the look of the cross section.
When the Use Building Material option is selected, the profile will inherit the 
Surface and Fill properties of the fill's Building Material that is used to create the 
profile. This is a unique area in ArchiCAD, where Fills represent Building Materials 
instead of Fill Patterns due to the nature of profiles.

Using fills
There are four Fill Types available in ArchiCAD:
•	
Solid Fills
•	
Vectorial Fills
•	
Symbol Fills
•	
Image Fills
You can access the Fill Types settings dialog by navigating to Options | Element 
Attributes | Fill Types.

The top portion of the Fill Types settings dialog allows you to select, create, rename, 
and delete a fill type. The Availability and Screen-only pattern area includes 
the settings to select the use of the fill type and a window to create a pixel-like 
screen-only pattern.
Except for the Image Fills type, you can use these fill types as Drafting Fills, Cover 
Fills, or Cut Fills. Image Fills can only be used as Drafting Fills or Cover Fills.
Drafting Fills
You can select Drafting Fills when you want to use the fill type with the 2D Fill 
tool as an annotation or drafting element. Cover Fills can be assigned as Vectorial 
Hatching in the Surface settings dialog.
Cover Fills
Cover Fills can also be assigned to Slabs, Meshes, Roofs, Shells, and Morphs in the 
Floor Plan and Section area of the tools' settings dialog and Zones in the Floor Plan 
area of the Zone Default Settings dialog, if the Use Fill from Surface option is not 
selected. The Vectorial Hatching of the assigned Surface will be applied if you select 
the Use Fill from Surface option.
To simplify these concepts, imagine that Cover Fills can be used to create visible 
patterns on the surfaces of the elements of your building model in various views. 
Cut Fills can be visible patterns on a cut surface of a model element.
Cut Fills
Cut Fills can be assigned to Building Materials in the Structure and Appearance 
area of the Building Materials settings dialog. You can also use Cut Fills as 2D fills. 
For example, you can add 2D Cut Fills to the details, to enhance the definition of 
your documentation.
The Screen-only pattern window is an 8 x 8 pixel grid. You can create a simplified 
representation of your fill in this area by drawing the individual pixels. When you 
un-select the Vectorial Hatching options under View | On-Screen View Options; 
all vectorial hatching will be visually substituted by the simplified version of the fill 
from this window. This requires fewer resources from the computer. The purpose 
of this feature was more relevant years ago, when computers were not as powerful 
as today.

The lower area of the Fill Types settings dialog includes settings specific to setting 
up Solid, Vectorial, Symbol, or Image Fills. You can adjust the size, scaling, and the 
angle of your fill patterns among other settings here.
Solid Fills, as the name suggests, are solid color fills. You can adjust the transparency 
of these fills.
There are several Vectorial Fills available in the basic ArchiCAD library. You can 
adjust the spacing of these fills, which essentially means changing the size of them. 
You can also set the angle and the scaling of Vectorial Fills.
Creating new fill types
When you create a new fill type, you will notice that the Vectorial Fill option is not 
available. You can duplicate an existing Vectorial Fill and modify its settings to 
create a new one. To create an entirely new vector type fill, you will need to select 
the Symbol fill type, which is a special type of Vectorial Fill.
In order to create a new Symbol Fill, you can draw a pattern in a floor plan or 
worksheet window using simple lines, circles, and hotspots. You can copy the 
pattern to the clipboard and paste it in the Fill Types settings dialog by clicking 
on the Paste button in the Edit Symbol Pattern area of the dialog. Once you have 
pasted the custom pattern, you can adjust the new fill's size, angle, and scaling here.
Image Fills are based on image files. For example, you can use the texture image 
of a floor pattern to create an Image Fill from it. You can adjust the size, angle, and 
scaling of the Image Fill in the Fill Texture area of the Fill Types settings dialog. A 
unique setting option for Image Fills is the Mirroring Method setting, which allows 
you to adjust the way the image file will be repeated in the fill. You can fine-tune the 
tiling effect of the image by selecting one of the available Mirroring Methods.
The following image illustrates the Mirroring Method settings using the Wood 
Parquet fill type, which is a part of the basic ArchiCAD library. Note the different 
tiling effects as a result of selecting one of the available four options:

The Element Attribute settings that we have discussed so far are connected to each 
other and are applied in a coordinated fashion. You can override these settings at 
the element as well as at view level. Although this means that you have a great 
amount of freedom to set up your project, it can also lead to file management issues 
especially with a larger design team.
We will discuss the override options later in this chapter, as they relate to management 
(see Chapter 9, Visualization and Model Management).
Exterior improvements
The basic ArchiCAD library includes objects that are designed to add the details of 
the building's surroundings. You can select these objects under 2. VISUALIZATION 
| 2.2 Site Improvements in the library.
These objects make it easier to relate to the building's scale and soften the sterile 
look that is typical of some lower quality computer renderings. 3D computer artists 
spend a significant amount of time developing small and realistic details. For 
example, details of gutters or wet pavement surfaces with puddles can all enhance 
the quality of a computer rendering even if the viewer perceives those details in 
their peripheral vision.

While your project's schedule may not allow you to spend as much time as 3D artists 
spend on enhancing the details of your renderings, you can still add a few elements 
that will make a difference. A few strategically placed objects in a good composition 
will help you to achieve a reasonable quality for your renderings.
For the purposes of this chapter, we will discuss exterior renderings. The basic 
ArchiCAD library has objects to improve the details of the interior images as well.
ArchiCAD Library elements for rendering
An important issue to address before you select the exterior improvements is the 
complexity of your model. The complexity of your model is directly related to the 
time it takes the computer to develop the rendering.
3D tree objects that simulate the look of real life trees can be composed 
of many polygons; and adding only a couple of them to the model 
can significantly lengthen the rendering time. It is advisable to 
consider the size of the individually inserted objects because they can 
significantly contribute to the overall project file size as well. 
A set of special objects is available in the basic ArchiCAD library to address these 
issues. For example, the Deciduous Trees object under 2.2 Site Improvements | 
Garden represents trees with 2D images that are automatically oriented vertically 
and toward the camera. You can create the look of a realistic tree with this object 
without having to burden the model with a great amount of polygons, representing 
the individual leaves of the tree.
One disadvantage of these types of objects is that they can only cast the shadow of 
the vertical rectangle, which is the bounding box of the tree image. While it might 
be acceptable to place them farther away from the camera, it is recommended to 
avoid placing them in the forefront of the view where their shadows would be 
clearly visible.

An alternative option to consider is placing them in the shadow of the building 
where the objects' own shadow will not create an issue.
The Tree Model Detailed object has a feature that is based on the capabilities of 
GDL. The object can recognize its distance from the camera and change its shape 
accordingly. If you place these objects farther away from the camera, for example, 
modeling a line of trees in the background, it will simplify its 3D crown model 
automatically and therefore, reduce the count of polygons required to represent 
the trees.

The trees in the distance can create a realistic look even with the simplified model.
Plants, people, and vehicles are helpful in visually clarifying the scale of the building. 
The human eye can naturally relate to the scale of these elements and in return relate 
to the scale of the building that is adjacent to them.

Representing people is one of the most challenging aspects of computer renderings. 
The human face recognition is very sensitive. This is why a computer-generated 
person's face is easily recognizable as artificial. A good technique to take this 
problem into account is to have the models of people face away from the camera 
whenever possible.

Light
For exterior images, you can adjust the position of the sun as the main light source in 
the 3D Projection Settings dialog. You can access the 3D Projection Settings dialog 
by navigating to View | 3D View Options | 3D Projection Settings.

You can create interior and exterior artificial lights with the Lamp tool, which you 
can find in the Toolbox, under More. The basic ArchiCAD library has a collection 
of light fixture models and light sources.
Some of them have settings to simulate the real physics of light distribution 
and color properties based on photometric files (for example, IES Light 
under 16 Electrical, in the library). You can also download Photometric 
Data Files (IES is an abbreviation of Illuminating Engineering Society of 
North America) from many light fixture manufacturers. For example, you 
can download Philips IES files from http://www.colorkinetics.com/
support/ies/.
The 3D Projection Settings dialog has two modes, which are Perspective Settings 
and Parallel Projection Settings. You can switch between the modes by clicking on 
the button at the top-right area of the dialog. In both the modes, an icon represents 
the sun and its position, which is relative to the camera and the building model. You 
can drag the icon to a position of your choice and adjust the sun to fit your desired 
lighting conditions.
You can also change the Azimuth and Altitude parameters of the sun parametrically 
in this dialog. If you would like to set the sun position accurately according to a 
certain day and time of the year, you can access the Sun dialog by clicking on the 
More Sun button at the lower part of the 3D Projection Settings dialog. You can 
specify the exact time and date relative to the geographic project location here. 
Specifying the precise location and time is necessary for creating Sun Studies. The 
Light Parameters area of the dialog has options to specify the intensity and color 
of the Sunlight, contribution to ambient light, and intensity and the color of the 
Ambient Light.

You can also specify the color and intensity of Fog and whether you want to use fog 
in your rendering.
Camera
You can set up a specific 3D view by either using the 3D Projection Settings dialog 
or placing a camera with the Camera tool. You can find the Camera tool under More 
in the Toolbox.
The Camera tool allows you to place a camera and point to its target in a floor plan 
view. Once you have a camera placed on the floor plan, you can see its icon appearing 
in the 3D Projection Settings dialog Perspective Settings mode, which is similar to 
the icon of the sun. You can adjust the position of the camera and its target in this 
dialog as well by dragging them to a new location. You can fine-tune the position 
and orientation of the camera by adjusting the camera parameters in the Perspective 
Settings dialog.

The position of the camera of an axonometric or parallel projection 3D view can be 
adjusted similarly with the camera parameters in the Parallel Projection Settings 
dialog. There are also preset parallel views that you can activate by clicking on the 
button at the top-right corner of the dialog.
Once you have placed a camera on the floor plan, you will notice that it appears in 
the project map under 3D along with its assigned camera path. You can access the 
camera and path settings by right-clicking on the camera icon in the project map and 
selecting Camera Settings.
The top area of the Camera Settings dialog allows you to create and manage camera 
paths consisting of several cameras. We will mention these paths later in this chapter 
as they are used to create multiple instances of Fly-Through.
You can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + F3 to access the 
3D Projection Settings dialog.
Rendering parameters
Now that we have covered the three basic components of rendering (that is, content, 
light, and camera), we can discuss the actual process of rendering in ArchiCAD. We 
will review the available rendering settings next with the help of practical exercises.
For the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on exterior scenes and perspective 
views. As we referred to it earlier on, you can create interior renderings as well as 
renderings of parallel projection views (for example, elevations, axonometric views, 
and so on).

Let's start with opening the PhotoRendering Settings dialog, which you can access 
by navigating to Document | Creative Imaging | PhotoRendering Settings.
ArchiCAD has three built-in rendering engines that you can use to generate 
presentation images. These engines are:
•	
The Internal engine
•	
CineRender by MAXON
•	
The Sketch engine.
The Internal and the CineRender by MAXON engines can be primarily used to 
create photorealistic images. ArchiCAD also has a Sketch engine, which you can 
use to simulate hand-drawn sketch renderings. We will use the CineRender and 
the Sketch rendering engine for our examples.
We have mentioned the issue of the "sterile look" of computer generated renderings 
before. In addition to that issue, designers using computers are also challenged by 
specific, inaccurate details too early. For example, you can use a preset window 
object on the exterior of your building, which the computer will render in full details.

At the beginning of a design phase, you might not necessarily be able to decide if the 
modeled window will end up being of the actual type that you would like to select 
for your project. If your team members or clients see a rendering of that particular 
window object, it might mislead them into believing that this is the specific choice for 
the project.
The Sketch engine can be useful in early design phases because you can create 
renderings with it that do not look very specific in detail. On the other hand, you 
need to balance the sterile, or even the fake look of the sketch renderings. It is 
recommended that you use the sketch renderings as backgrounds for actual 
hand-drawn sketches. This way you benefit from the rapid generation of perspective 
as well as the outline of sketches, and yet you can always add the necessary natural 
touches by hand.
Let's see how the Sketch rendering engine works in action next. When you activate 
the PhotoRendering Settings dialog, you can see two main tabs on the top of the 
dialog under the preview window. The Settings tab includes all of the settings for 
the selected scene and engine.
The Size tab allows you to set the size of the image. You can also apply a Render 
Safe Frame here, which helps you to visually identify the area of your rendering in 
the 3D view. You can avoid unexpected elements being cut off from your rendering 
with this feature.

[ 312 ]
The top area of the Settings tab consists of two drop-down menus. The Scene 
drop-down menu allows you to select, save, and manage a combination of rendering 
settings. The Engine drop-down menu lists the available three rendering engines 
that you can choose from.
The Basic settings area of the Sketch engine allows you to specify the main Line 
Style and Line Color. The other setting areas include options to adjust the paper 
roughness, line, shadow line thickness, background selection, as well as other 
adjustments. It's recommended that you play with the various settings to achieve 
a desired sketch rendering style. Once you are satisfied with a setting combination, 
you can save it as a scene in the Scene drop-down menu.
We will start with a preset scene to test the Sketch engine. Open the Commercial_
Bldg-Shell-Rendering.pln file. You will see exterior improvements already placed 
in this file as well as a camera that we will use in the following examples.

Once the rendering process is done, you can save the image as a JPG file. To do this, 
perform the following:
1.	 Go to the File menu and select Save as. Or press the key combination of 
Ctrl + Shift + S. The Save Picture dialog will open.
2.	 Navigate to a desired location and enter a name of your choice in the File 
name field.
3.	 Click on the Save button to finish the process.
Keep the PhotoRendering Settings active on your screen because we will continue 
working with it in the next exercises.
Rendering with CineRender
We will use the CineRender by MAXON engine to create a photo realistic image. 
MAXON has developed an advanced rendering solution and integrated it into 
ArchiCAD. We need to mention, that the CineRender engine works with its own 
set of specialized materials that are different from ArchiCAD's internal materials.
The CineRender and ArchiCAD materials are synchronized and appropriately 
matched in the basic ArchiCAD library. You can review and adjust the CineRender 
Settings of a material in the Surface Settings dialog by selecting CineRender by 
MAXON from the Engine Settings drop-down menu.
We will use Physical Camera in CineRender to see an example of how the basic 
photography concepts we discussed earlier work in action. We will modify a preset 
scene to achieve the desired results, as follows:
1.	 Turn on the L-SITE layer. This will reveal the plant objects around 
the building.
2.	 Select Outdoor Daylight Medium option from the Scene drop-down menu. 
This will activate the CineRender engine with the preset options.
3.	 Make sure that the Detailed Settings option is selected.
4.	 Select Use Physical Render under Detailed Settings.
5.	 Click on the plus sign next to Use Physical Render if the tree structure is 
not unfolded.
6.	 Click on Physical Camera under Use Physical Render.
7.	 Check the box next to Camera Exposure and set Camera ISO value to 100.
8.	 Set the Camera F-Stop value to f/11.0.

9.	 Set the Camera Shutter Speed value to 1.
10.	 Click on the PhotoRender Projection button to start the rendering.
The camera settings mentioned here are appropriate for a daylight condition if we 
want to create an overall sharp image. You can experiment with different camera 
settings to achieve different effects. Once finished, your rendering should look like 
the following image. You can save it at this point.
HDR rendering
HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR background images in the basic 
ArchiCAD library are panoramic images that have a higher bit depth than normal 
JPG files. HDR images can be used as environmental light sources because of this, 
which can be useful to create natural looking atmospheres in your renderings. To do 
so, do as follows:
1.	 Unselect Sunlight under Render Settings | Detailed Settings | Light 
Adjustments.
2.	 Click on Environment and select HDRi Sky from the Sky Setup 
drop-down menu.
3.	 Click on HRDi Sky and reveal the settings under HDR Image.

4.	 Click on the button with the three dots next to the File Name field. The Load 
Image from Library dialog window will open.
5.	 Select Trees 02 GS.hdr under Libraries | ArchiCAD Library | [HImg] HDR 
Images | High Res Luminance.
6.	 Finally, click on OK.
7.	 Click on the PhotoRender Projection button to render the image.
You may notice in your finished rendering, that the trees in the background HDR 
image are reflected in the windows of the building. There is also a green tint in 
the image and you can only see ambient shadows. The green tint and lack of 
sharp shadows are realistically contributing to the representation of a forest-like 
environment.
You can use HDR background images to simply create realistic lighting in your 
renderings. They also serve as backgrounds for your presentation images.

White model rendering
The CineRender engine has a feature that you can use to render images that look like 
scale models. This option along with the Sketch rendering engine's features can also 
be useful in rendering schematic images at the early stages of the design process:
1.	 Unselect Sky Visibility under Render Settings | Detailed Settings | 
Environment | HDRi Sky.
2.	 Click on the box next to the White Model option under Render Settings | 
Detailed Settings | Effects.
3.	 Click on the PhotoRender Projection button to render the image.
Your rendering will be similar to the following image:
The four images above illustrate the basic rendering concepts in ArchiCAD. You can 
explore the additional settings available in the different rendering engines and see 
their effects on the images.
It is recommended that you start your exploration with a preset scene, 
modifying only one or two settings first, in order to understand the 
changes, resulting from adjusting the settings.

Fly-Through animation
Fly-Through is an animation in which the camera moves along a path around, or 
inside the building model. The cameras placed in a floor plan view define the path.
You can see 00 Path 1 under 3D, in the Project Map in our Commercial_Bldg-Shell-
Rendering.pln example file, which only includes one camera that we used for the 
exterior renderings. In order to make a Fly-Through, you can copy the existing camera, 
move it to a different location, and set a different target for it. Fly-Throughs require at 
least two cameras in a path, since they need a start and end frame.
You can right-click on the path and select Camera Settings. This will activate the 
Camera Settings dialog where you can adjust the settings of each camera assigned to 
this path separately. Clicking on the Path button in the lower left area of the dialog 
will reveal the Path Options window. This dialog has Motion Controls and Display 
Options as well as the Motion Resolution setting area. The In-between frames 
setting is important to mention for our purposes here. This is the setting that will 
specify how many frames ArchiCAD will add between each camera of this path.
You can access the Create Fly-Through dialog by navigating to Document | 
Creative Imaging | Create Fly-Through.
The Source area of the dialog allows you to set whether the animation will be 
generated in the 3D Window or PhotoRendering Window. You can also specify the 
frames and select the Rebuild Model for Each Frame option here that is related to 
camera-position-sensitive objects.

We mentioned the automatic crown geometry adjustment feature of the Tree 
Model Detailed object. This object is a good example for illustrating the effect of the 
Rebuild Model for Each Frame option. When this option is selected, ArchiCAD 
will regenerate the tree model, adjusting the complexity of its geometry frame by 
frame. This means that the tree model geometry will be optimized throughout the 
whole animation.
The Result area of the dialog has options to set the file type, frame rate, and the 
color depth of the animation. The In-between frames of the Path Options and the 
Frame rate setting of the Create Fly-Through dialog define together the smoothness 
of the animation.
If the value for In-between frames is set to 60 and the Frame rate is 60, it will mean 
that the animation will transition between the cameras in one second. A typical video 
has a frame rate of 24. This means that the video will display 24 frames per second. 
If we set the Frame rate to 24 and leave the value of In-between frames at 60, the 
animation will transition between the cameras in 2.5 seconds (60/24 = 2.5).
You can finally show the animation on the screen or save it as a file by clicking on 
one of the buttons in the lower-right part of the dialog window.
Model management and troubleshooting
Model management and troubleshooting are advanced topics that are connected to 
each other. Mostly BIM managers handle tasks related to these subjects; however, the 
way you build and organize your work contributes to how the project is managed 
from the BIM perspective.
If the project model(s) are well managed, troubleshooting becomes easier. For 
example, the reason for elements showing incorrectly on your floor plan can be 
easily tracked down if standard visibility settings are applied in the project.
We mentioned earlier that it is recommended that you start thinking about materials 
and their visibility in different views and renderings from the beginning of the 
modeling process. Trying to assign and organize the materials of the individual 
elements of a complex model takes a lot of time after the elements have already 
been placed. This is an example of a model management problem.

Using project templates and attribute files
Template files are useful for starting with preassigned materials and visibility 
settings. ArchiCAD offers two basic templates to start with, for typical residential 
and commercial projects. If you don't have access to a custom project template, 
these templates are good starting points for your work.
There are other useful features to help you keep a well-managed project besides 
template files, which we mentioned earlier in this book. Attribute sets can be 
saved as Attribute Manager Files (AAT) from the Attribute Manager dialog. You 
can access the Attribute Manager by navigating Options | Element Attributes | 
Attribute Manager.
You can also import individual, or sets of attributes with the Attribute Manager and 
override existing settings in your project file.
Many of the model management issues are related to the appropriate visibility of the 
elements in different views and therefore, troubleshooting is often necessary when 
elements are displayed incorrectly.
From the user's perspective, a thorough understanding of ArchiCAD's model 
and document structure (see Chapter 7, Documentation – A Commercial Project) and 
material system (see Chapter 9, Visualization and Model Management) is important 
to maintain and build an organized model.

[ 321 ]
Large projects and project teams require model management and troubleshooting 
tasks related to linking files, updating referenced content, and managing users, which 
are typically performed by BIM managers (see Chapter 8, Work Sharing with ArchiCAD).
For example, referencing and updating model content from IFC and DWG files can 
be streamlined by saving export and import settings in XML files as we discussed in 
the previous chapter.
Controlling visibility
Let's look at an example and illustrate a visibility issue. As we saw earlier in this 
chapter, you can override the Surface assignment of elements on an element level 
in the Model area of the elements Default Settings dialog.
There are two other ways to override attribute assignments. Knowing about these 
concepts can help you in basic visibility troubleshooting.
You can override Cut Fills on a view level with the Model View Options dialog. 
You can access the dialog by navigating to Document | Set Model View | Model 
View Options.
www.it-ebooks.info

Visualization and Model Management
[ 322 ]
The Override Fill Display area of the dialog includes an option for overriding 
cut fills. For example, you can select a Solid Foreground fill for all the walls in the 
view regardless of their individual settings and turn off the visibility of the Skin 
Separator Lines.
On an element level, you can select a specific Cut Fill Pen for an object that is 
different from the assigned fill in its GDL script. Unless you know about this option, 
it is hard to find out why a single object is not displayed with a proper cut fill in 
some cases.
You can select the Override Cut Fill Pens in the Floor Plan and Section area of the 
object's settings dialog at some point for an individual element and forget about it 
later. It is easy to forget these kinds of individual settings when you are preparing 
for a deadline. This is why it is recommended that you avoid them and use global 
attribute assignments as much as possible.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about visualization concepts including some basic 
knowledge about photography. We saw examples of ArchiCAD's rendering 
capabilities and reviewed the material system that drives the visibility of elements 
in different rendering styles. Finally, we discussed model management and 
troubleshooting issues that you, as a user, need to consider in your work.
We hope you have found this journey through ArchiCAD 19 - The Definitive Guide to 
be enjoyable and beneficial. Whether you went step-by-step through every task, in 
every chapter, or just went to the more advanced subject matters, it was our goal for 
you to become enlightened and educated.

and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books

Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should

like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, then please contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
