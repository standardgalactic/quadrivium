About the Authors
Shirley Slater and Harry Basch are a husband-and-wife travel-writing
team whose books, articles, and photographs have been published inter-
nationally over the past 25 years. Former stage, film, and television
actors, they have written their syndicated column Cruise Views for the
Los Angeles Times and other major newspapers for more than 20 years,
produced six annual editions of the North American Ski Guide for Prodigy
Computer Services, and written Shirley and Harry’s RV Adventures (a
monthly newsletter) plus four books on worldwide cruising.
In 1990, at the 60th World Travel Congress in Hamburg, Germany, the
authors were only the third writers (and the first freelancers) to receive
the prestigious Melva C. Pederson Award from the American Society of
Travel Agents for “extraordinary journalistic achievement in the field of
travel.”
On assignment for publications as diverse as Bon Appétit and Travel
Weekly, they have covered 188 countries by barge, elephant back, hot-air
balloon, luxury cruise ship, cross-country skis, paddle-wheel steamer,
and supersonic aircraft, but their favorite method of transportation is by
RV. In their former 27-foot Winnebago Brave motorhome and their new
36-foot Itasca Sunflyer, they have logged more than 100,000 miles travel-
ing across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Aboard other RVs —
from mini-motorhomes to 36-foot widebodies with slideouts — they have
traveled an additional 60,000 miles exploring the back roads and camp-
grounds of America. These journeys are all based on the authors’ per-
sonal experiences.
They’re the authors of five editions of Frommer’s Exploring America 
by RV and appear on informational RV videos featured at www.rvtv
direct.com.

Introduction
C
ongratulations! After looking at all those recreation vehicles (RVs)
rolling down the highway and wondering what driving one would be
like, you decided to find out. You’re probably like us — a few years ago,
an RV vacation never crossed your mind.
But as the world grows louder and closer, and job stresses pull you 
in all directions, you find yourself yearning for meaningful time alone
with those closest to you. At the same time, you want some control over
your life and a sense of self-sufficiency. That’s what an RV vacation can
give you.
As travel writers, we’ve spent the past 25 years visiting the most exotic
parts of the world. Today, when we travel abroad, we look forward to
going back home, unpacking the sequins and tuxedos, and heading out
for a back-roads getaway in our motorhome. Our trip may be for only a
weekend or for an entire glorious month, but the experience recharges
our souls, rejuvenates our bodies, and reinvents our relationship.
“How can a specialized motor vehicle do all this?” you may ask. Well,
that’s what we’re here to tell you. Now, we can go out to see our world
and take all the comforts of home — kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, sofa,
refrigerator, and TV/DVD — along with us. We can park our RV by the
ocean one day and on top of a mountain the next, but we’re always at
home.
On the road, we meet families with children, independent young couples
who bring their offices along and work on the road, pet owners who
don’t want to leave their animals behind, retirees who have been plan-
ning for years to discover America gradually, fussy diners who don’t
want to down another fast-food franchise meal, fussy sleepers who don’t
want to wonder who slept in their bed the night before, and those with
disabilities or those with dietary restrictions who know that their spe-
cialized adjustments in the RV enable them to travel safely and securely,
and on their own terms.
About This Book
In the first chapters of this book, we tell you everything you ever wanted
or needed to know about RVs and RVing, filtered through our hands-on
experience and our total lack of knowledge when we started RVing nearly
two decades ago. Then, we give you an insider’s look at some of our
favorite drives particularly suited for RVs in what we think is the most

diverse, beautiful, and exciting travel venue in the world — the United
States of America. And, finally, we offer some timely tips that make all
this travel easier.
Throughout the drives — 14 in all — we give you the information you
need to find your way and point out only the highlights rather than
every musty museum or historic home. We share some of our favorite
campgrounds with you, and because, in most cases, you’re carrying
your own kitchen, we steer you to places where you can pick up local
produce, regional delicacies, or one-of-a-kind takeout meals to pick up
and eat later.
Use RV Vacations For Dummies as a reference guide. You can, of course,
start at the first page and read all the way through. If you’re a more expe-
rienced RVer, you can flip to our favorite drives, and start checking out
the itineraries. The main thing is that you can move from chapter to
chapter, picking and choosing what interests you.
You won’t find much in this book about repairing a malfunctioning RV.
We learned early on to leave that to the experts. That said, through the
years, we’ve acquired a few handy maintenance tips, which we pass on
to help you and your RV stay in shape and cut down on repair bills.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — this is especially true of prices. And with an RV, any noticeable
change in the cost of gas will make an equally noticeable difference in
your budget, because your home on wheels has a particularly large
appetite for petroleum! We, therefore, suggest that you write or call
ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors, edi-
tors, and publisher can’t be held responsible for the experiences of read-
ers while traveling.
Your safety is important to us, so we encourage you to stay alert and be
aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and
wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets. And always lock
your vehicle in or out of campgrounds.
Conventions Used in This Book
To keep this book from being longer than the Harry Potter series, we use
a number of abbreviations in the driving and campground sections.
Campground amenities are abbreviated as follows:
CATV: Cable TV hookup
SATV: Satellite TV hookup
Wi-Fi: Wireless Internet connection
RV Vacations For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2

Here are the abbreviations for credit cards:
AE: American Express
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
And we use the following abbreviations for road names:
I- #: Interstate highway
SR #: State road
CR #: County road
FM #: Farm-to-market road
We divide campgrounds into two categories — our personal favorites
and those that don’t quite make our preferred list but still get our hearty
seal of approval. Sometimes those on the second list may offer more
amenities than our favorites — such as whirlpool spas and line-dance
lessons.
We also use some general pricing information to help you as you decide
where to camp. The following system of dollar signs is meant to be a
guideline only and denotes the range of costs for one night in a camp-
ground.
Cost

$
Up to $10
$$
$11 to $20
$$$
$21 to $30

$31 to $40

$41 or more
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and your
needs as an RVer. Here’s what we assume about you:
 You may be an inexperienced RVer looking for insight and advice
about what RVs are and what RVing is all about.
 You may be an experienced RVer looking for new experiences, new
attractions, or new roads to conquer, and you don’t want to miss a
good bet.
Introduction 3

 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about RVing or that lists every campground, attraction, or
food venue available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that
focuses on the most important information and the best or most
unusual experiences as you travel the highway.
If you fit any of these criteria, then RV Vacations For Dummies, 4th
Edition, gives you the information you’re seeking!
How This Book Is Organized
Although divided into six parts, the book consists of three major sec-
tions. Parts I and II provide the how-to info that you need to get started
before you hit the road. Parts III, IV, and V include 14 fabulous driving
itineraries, each in a different area of the United States. And, finally, Part
VI gives you the lowdown on the country’s best campgrounds and zany
attractions for RVers who want to explore beyond the itineraries in this
book.
Part I: Getting Started
What is an RV and what is RVing? You find out in this part, and you see
why we think it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread. We tell you where
to go and when, offer a bit of RV history, fill you in on some bests of
RVing, and debunk some RV myths.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details
Here you discover what kind of RVs are out there and how to choose the
best one for your particular needs and budget. This part includes tips for
getting started — what to plan for, how to prepare, and what you need to
know about packing, cooking in your RV, campgrounds, and more.
Part III: Exploring the East
In Chapters 12 through 16, we explore the eastern United States by RV.
The driving routes in each chapter offer a variety of scenery and activi-
ties, and each includes at least one designated scenic roadway, sight-
seeing attraction, or national park. Two routes — The Coast of Maine:
Lobster Land and The Gulf Coast: Tallahassee to New Orleans — follow
the sea. Blue Ridge Mountains: Skyline Drive and Blue Ridge Parkway
brings together two great American roadways with the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park — all without the hassle of commercial traffic.
Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls lets you see a museum
for baseball greats (some fans allow three days to see it all) and witness
the majesty of Niagara Falls. The Natchez Trace: Natchez, Mississippi,
to Nashville, Tennessee, takes you through the old and new South, past
the birthplaces of such icons as Elvis Presley, W. C. Handy, and Oprah
Winfrey. And of course, we share our favorite campgrounds and cafes
along the way.
RV Vacations For Dummies, 4th Edition

Part IV: Discovering Mid-America
Chapters 17 through 20 take you through the heartland with a choice of
four itineraries, at least one of which should be within a reasonable driv-
ing time from a Midwestern home base. Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets
and Barbecue tells you when to catch the optimum wildflower shows
and where to find the best barbecue. The Heart of Ohio: A Circle
around Circleville carries you on a loop from aviation history to rock-
’n’-roll, with a pause in the world’s largest Amish community. Northern
Minnesota: Paul Bunyan Country visits an American icon that delights
kids of all ages, takes you to the source of the great Mississippi River,
and leads you to North America’s largest shopping mall. The Ozarks 
and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield lets you in on how to get good
deals in an area that’s the second most popular travel destination in the
United States.
Part V: Seeing the West
In Chapters 21 through 25, we follow the trail of American icons through
some of the world’s most dazzling scenery. Montana and Wyoming:
Tracking Buffalo Bill follows the famous showman through Yellowstone
National Park and to the town of Cody, Wyoming, which is named for
him. New Mexico: Billy the Kid Meets E.T. lets you visit a notorious real-
life cowboy and the alien visitor from the film E.T. (whose space alien
relatives once may have dropped in on Roswell, New Mexico). The
Oregon Coast: California to Washington combines scenery with
seafood, taking you beachcombing, kite-flying, and wine-tasting, while
California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey explores what some
people (including us) think is the most beautiful place on earth. Route
66: OK to L.A. follows the remnants of the famous road and digs out
some little-known and big-name landmarks along the way.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens highlights campgrounds and destinations beyond the
itineraries in this book. We know that after RVers get started, they soon
want to travel more and more. This part includes our choices for the ten
best winter getaways for snowbirds, fascinating factory tours where
you can watch the manufacture of everything from Crayolas to Jelly
Bellies (and get free samples), and some of our favorite zany museums
saluting Jell-O, Lucille Ball, Spam, UFOs, mustard, and more.
Appendix and worksheets
Here are the facts you need to know to complete the final details for
your RV vacation, including toll-free telephone numbers and Web sites
to expand your research. We also include a list of common RV and camp-
ground terms and some worksheets to help you with budget planning,
selecting an RV, choosing a campground, organizing your schedule, and
creating itineraries.
Introduction 5

Icons Used in This Book
Sprinkled throughout the margins of this book are icons. What they’re
for is drawing your attention to certain kinds of information. Here’s the
lowdown on what the icons mean:
This icon pegs the best bargains and money-saving tips for your RV
vacation, from where to buy gas or groceries to campgrounds that repre-
sent a good value for the buck.
Look out for tourist traps, scams, and rip-offs when you see this icon,
which also saves you money by pointing out places that aren’t, in our
opinion, worth the price of admission. We give the warning; the rest is
up to you.
This icon is to let you know when something special is available for the
younger set. It helps cut down on the “Are we there yet?” syndrome.
Accompanying this icon are special warnings for RVers, whether you
face a low bridge ahead or a difficult parking situation.
For hints, tips, or insider advice to make your trip run more smoothly,
look for this icon. Although the point of a travel guide is to serve as one
gigantic tip, this icon singles out little nuggets of knowledge that may be
new to you.
This icon tells you when special sights along the way may take you 
off the direct route. Follow the detour to discover special places and
experiences.
Where to Go from Here
It’s time to enjoy the freedom of the open road. How you use this guide
is up to you. You can start from the beginning and read straight through,
or dip into the middle and extract information as you want or need it.
Throughout, think of us as your interested, experienced guides. We help
you pick out your RV, stock it with your favorite supplies, and choose
when and where you want to travel. With your RV as home and all the
highways of America on the other side of the windshield, you can be
king or queen of the road.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
You like being outdoors, sitting around a campﬁre, hiking
in the wilderness, and breathing in fresh air — the free-
dom of getting away from it all. But you don’t relish sleeping
on rocky ground, cooking over an open ﬁre, and washing up
in cold water. You’re ready for RVing.
In this part, we give you several reasons for hitting the open
road in an RV — just in case you’re not convinced yet. Then
we get down to basics, discussing where to go and when, how
to save money in campgrounds, some of the “bests” to be
found in RVing, and a bit of RV history.

Chapter 1
Top Reasons to 
Take an RV Vacation
In This Chapter
 Doing it your way
 Finding something for every RVer
 Saving money
 Discovering some bests of RVing
 Divining your RV personality
W
hen we first discovered RVing, we couldn’t believe how perfectly
the experience fit our lifestyle, how comfortable and convenient
it is, and how liberating it makes travel. After less than two weeks on 
the road, we began plotting ways to buy and keep the motorhome we’d
rented. (To be honest, we also didn’t look forward to unpacking when 
we got home.)
To help us with our first RV experience, we looked for a book like this.
Because we couldn’t find one, we wrote this book for you.
Being Your Own Boss
Freedom! If you want to sum up RV travel in one word, that’s it. You’re
freed from fighting the battle of airports, from arriving at hotels only to
find that your reservation was lost or your room isn’t ready, and from
waiting an hour past your reservation time at a restaurant or tipping the
host to get a better table. In your RV, you’re the boss. You go where you
want to go, when you want to go, and at whatever pace you please.
That’s freedom!
Discovering Something for Everyone
For families with children, the drives include a wealth of show-and-
tell and how-I-spent-my-summer-vacation material, from discovering
how baseball was invented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in

Cooperstown, New York (Chapter 13), to seeing curious rock formations
underground at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in Carlsbad, New
Mexico (Chapter 22), and finding out why President William McKinley
always wore a red carnation at the McKinley Museum in Canton, Ohio
(Chapter 18). Kids remember the McKinley story because they hear it
from the animatronic version of the man himself. Families who want to
explore beyond the drives in this book can seek out factory tours show-
ing kids such wonders as how Crayola crayons and Jelly Belly jelly-
beans are made (Chapter 27).
Hikers and bikers can pinpoint state or national parks with great walk-
ing and bicycle trails. The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area
(Chapter 23) is just one of the many parks in that state with hiking trails
that skirt the coast. Cyclists can take advantage of 45 miles of carriage
roads in Maine’s Acadia National Park (Chapter 12) or wooded roads
regularly closed to traffic in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
(Chapter 14) on the Tennessee–North Carolina border. Best of all, after a
day of breaking a sweat, you can return to a comfortable RV bed instead
of an air mattress on the ground.
Do you want to settle into the driver’s seat and just cruise? We have the
roads for you. Scenic highways such as the Blue Ridge Parkway and
Skyline Drive (Chapter 14), Natchez Trace (Chapter 16), and California’s
Pacific Coast Highway (Chapter 24) were built for slow, easy driving and
frequent stops to admire the view or set out a picnic. For a slice of
Americana, drive what remains of old Route 66 between Oklahoma and
California (Chapter 25).
For more of what makes America unique, look no farther than the coun-
try’s colorful icons. New Mexico brings Billy the Kid to life again along
the Billy the Kid National Scenic Byway (Chapter 22), while Buffalo 
Bill Center in Cody, Wyoming, celebrates yet another figure from the
American West (Chapter 21). From folklore and the imagination comes
Minnesota’s Paul Bunyan (Chapter 19), who pops up in living color by
the side of the road in Bemidji and Akeley.
For delicious tastes of America, sample fresh-from-the-sea Maine lob-
ster with melted butter (Chapter 12), Texas barbecued brisket smoky
from the grill (Chapter 17), Santa Maria barbecue along California’s
Central Coast (Chapter 24), succulent shrimp and oysters around the
Gulf Coast (Chapter 15), Virginia country ham on a fresh-baked biscuit
(Chapter 14), or New Mexico’s spicy chile dishes (Chapter 22).
Music lovers can tap their toes to the rich sounds of America. Enjoy
authentic mountain music at the Ozark Folk Arts Center or pop/country
music productions in Branson (Chapter 20), hear funky blues and soul
at the Alabama Music Hall of Fame or visit the birthplaces of W. C.
Handy and Elvis Presley (Chapter 16), and listen to rock in all its forms
at Cleveland’s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum (Chapter 18).
Part I: Getting Started 
10

Good sports find great entertainment in Cooperstown’s National
Baseball Hall of Fame (Chapter 13) with its gloves, bats, and uniforms
from famous players; the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum
(Chapter 16), where you can make like a sports announcer and tape your
own play-by-play commentary; and the United States Hockey Hall of
Fame (Chapter 19) where you can take shots at an electronic goalie.
Saving Money in a Campground
RVing can be a very cost-effective way to travel, but opportunities to
make your dollar go further are around every bend. Here are our recom-
mendations for ways to save money in a campground:
Chapter 1: Top Reasons to Take an RV Vacation 11
Becoming a campground host
Energetic retirees and full-timers on a budget can camp free and sometimes pick up
a little extra income by becoming campground hosts. You find hosts in many camp-
grounds, both public and privately owned; they double as troubleshooters when the
office is closed or the rangers are off duty. They’re usually camped in a conspicuous
spot near the entrance with a sign indicating that they’re your hosts.
In theory, being a campground host is a great idea — you live in your RV in a lovely
campground with free hookups, maybe even with your choice of sites. In practice,
however, veterans of the job seem to either love it or hate it. Some mutter darkly of
being treated like migrant labor, while others describe the experience as a highlight
of their lives. Much depends on how thoroughly you check out the campground and
its management ahead of time and how realistic you are about doing hard and some-
times unpleasant chores, such as cleaning toilets and showers or telling noisy
campers to turn down their radios.
If you already have a specific campground in mind, contact them with a résumé that
includes personal and business references; you may also be asked for a recent photo.
Many campgrounds prefer a couple to a single host, or require a single person to work
30 to 40 hours a week as compared to the 15 or 20 hours a couple would work.
If you want to volunteer in a national park or forest service campground, contact the
National Forest Service or the National Parks Service. (See the appendix for contact
information.)
Good Sam Club members can apply through that organization to work as hosts in Good
Sam member campgrounds, which require a 60-day minimum stay. When you contact
Good Sam, include the size and type of your RV; the first, second, and third choice of
the states where you’d like to be; and the months you’re available for work. (See
Chapter 10 for contact information.)
If you get a positive response, before making a commitment, ask the campground man-
ager for references so you can interview people who previously worked for him or her.

 Never pay for more park than you’ll use. Posh playgrounds with
swimming pools, spas, tennis courts, and miniature golf are usually
pricier than simple, clean, mom-and-pop campgrounds. The latter
are adequate for an overnight stay. If there is a charge per hookup,
take the electric and water hookup and forgo the sewer unless you
really need it.
 Camp without hookups. You can do it comfortably for several
nights as long as you don’t insist on using the RV air conditioner, 
or microwave, both of which require an electrical hookup. Read a
book or listen to a tape or CD for entertainment, and cook on your
gas cooktop or outdoors on a grill. You’ll still have running water,
lights, refrigeration, heat, and hot water for dishes and shower.
 Watch out for campground surcharges. Some campgrounds charge
extra fees for running your air conditioner or hooking up to cable
TV, a surcharge for 50-amp electricity, or “extra person” charges 
for more than two people when you’re traveling with your kids or
friends. Some of the campgrounds that accept pets may also levy a
fee on your animal companion’s head.
 Join membership clubs that offer discounts to member camp-
grounds, such as KOA (Kampgrounds of America) and Good 
Sam, which usually discount 10 percent. KOA promises the dis-
count whether you pay by cash or credit card; some Good Sam
campgrounds will only grant the discount if you pay cash. In most
cases, you can join up right at the campground when you register.
 Take advantage of age. If one of you is over 62, you should apply
for a free America the Beautiful Pass, National Parks and Federal
Recreational Lands Pass (now that’s a mouthful!), which has
replaced the Golden Age Passport. With this pass and proof of 
age at a national park visitor center, your vehicle enters the park,
national monument, recreation area, or wildlife refuge free, and you
get a 50 percent discount on overnight camping areas administered
by the federal government.
 Look for free campgrounds, such as those in the southwestern
desert, administered by the Bureau of Land Management.
 Invest in a current campground guide (such as Frommer’s Best RV
and Tent Campgrounds in the U.S.A., 3rd Edition [Wiley]) or request
a state tourism office’s free campground listing. County, city, and
national forest campgrounds range from free to considerably less
expensive than most privately owned campgrounds, although they
do not often offer the luxury of hookups.
 If you arrive late at a campground, ask about staying overnight
self-contained in an overflow area at a reduced price. Some
campground owners are amenable; others are not.
 Stay longer than a week and you can negotiate discounts, usually
from 10 percent to 20 percent or more, depending on the season
and length of stay.
Part I: Getting Started 
12

 Consider volunteering as a campground host if you’re interested
in staying a long time in one area. You can camp free and may
pick up a bit of pocket change for performing specified duties on
the premises. (See the “Becoming a campground host” sidebar in
this chapter for more information.)
Best New England Lobster Spots
 Nunan’s Lobster Hut, 11 Mills Rd., Cape Porpoise, Maine (% 207-
967-4362): At Nunan’s, the crustaceans are steamed to order in a
little water rather than boiled in a lot. A bag of potato chips and a
hard roll with butter fill out the dinner tray. Finish off with a slice 
of homemade apple or blueberry pie. Open Thursday through
Sunday evenings from 5 p.m. No reservations or credit cards.
 Beal’s Lobster Pier, 182 Clark Point Rd., Southwest Harbor, Maine
(% 207-244-3202): Beal’s serves soft-shell lobster, steamer clams,
corn on the cob, and onion rings. You sit at picnic tables at the end
of the pier and feast. Open Memorial Day through October daily 7
a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Lobsterman’s Co-op, 97 Atlantic Ave., Boothbay Harbor, Maine 
(% 207-633-4900): On Atlantic Avenue, near the aquarium, you’ll
find a wooden pier with outdoor picnic tables and a choice of hard-
shell or soft-shell lobster (defined on a hand-printed sign as SOFT
SHELL = LESS MEAT, SWEETER TASTE). To that definition, we can add
“easier to crack open.” While fat gulls perched on the rail look on,
you can devour lobsters with melted butter, a bag of potato chips,
corn on the cob, onion rings, steamed or fried clams, and jug wine
by the glass or pitcher. Open Memorial Day to Columbus Day daily
11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 The Gloucester House, Rogers Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts
(% 978-283-1812): At the Gloucester House, waitresses call you
“dearie” and serve an inexpensive assembly-line clambake with

Chapter 1: Top Reasons to Take an RV Vacation 17
Ten personalities ideal for RVing
So is RVing for you? See whether you fit any of these personality types:
 Garbo Gourmets: Alone together luxuriating in the best that life can offer, these
epicures carry their own wines and food, sleep in their own beds, and select their
own surroundings by serendipity.
 Sportsmen: Skiers, fishermen, surfers, golfers, and mountain bikers get into the
heart of the action with all the comforts of home.
 Weekenders: The stressed-out get out of the rat race and into the countryside to
delete the pressures of the workweek from their hard drives.
 Families on Vacation: Offsetting the pricey amusement park, these families think
of their motorhome as their own budget hotel and round-the-clock self-serve
restaurant. For the kids, RVing means no more “Are we there yet?” or “I have to
go potty!” or “I’m hungry!” Everything is here.
 Eco-Tourists: Getting back to nature the easy way, eco-tourists bird-watch at
dawn and spot wildlife during twilight. Photography and hiking lay fewer burdens
on Mother Earth than heavy hotel and resort infrastructures.
 Ultimate Shoppers: Hitting all the antiques shops, estate sales, and the world’s
biggest swap meets, shoppers enjoy comfort and style with room to take home
all the treasures easily in the RV.
 Pet Lovers: Taking Fifi and Fido along for the ride and enjoying their company,
animal lovers avoid facing rebellious and destructive pets after a spell of board-
ing them in a kennel.
 Travelers with Disabilities: A customized RV can open up the world with familiar
and accessible surroundings.
 Special-Events Attendees: Tailgating for a football game or hitting a jazz or arts
festival on the spur of the moment, RVing fans sidestep overbooked hotels and
restaurants and invite friends in for a meal.
 Relatives: Visiting family and friends, RVers can take along their own beds and bath-
rooms. When parked at home, RVs provide an extra guest room with a bathroom.

 Great Smoky Mountains National Park (North Carolina and
Tennessee): Located at the end of the Blue Ridge Parkway, the 
park has an 11-mile, one-way, loop road off Newfound Gap Road
that is a must-see. (See Chapter 14.)
 Vicksburg National Military Park (Mississippi): This is the site of
one of the most decisive battles of the Civil War. A 16-mile auto tour
runs through the park and its monuments. (See Chapter 16.)
 Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park (Texas): The park is
divided into two parts with the visitor center located in Stonewall.
This is the only way you can enter the ranch. (See Chapter 17.)
 Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming): With an abundance of
attractions from Old Faithful to bubbling hot springs, this national
park can have problems from overcrowding and poorly maintained
roads, but it’s worth the frustrations. (See Chapter 21.)
 Carlsbad Caverns National Park (New Mexico): A variety of cav-
erns offer exciting and colorful underground tours. Join the evening
crowd to see the Bat Flight of 300,000 bats soaring out of the cave
for their evening meal. (See Chapter 22.)
 Grand Canyon National Park (Arizona): This spectacular attrac-
tion can be crowded in summer; a good way to visit is to take the
Grand Canyon Railway for a round-trip train ride out of Williams,
Arizona. (See Chapter 25.)
 Petrified Forest National Park and Painted Desert (Arizona): 
Stop in the visitor center at the entrance to the Petrified Forest 
to get a map and then take the loop road through both areas.

RV History: The Tin Can Tourists
They called themselves “Tin Can Tourists.” They braved the dust 
and mud to drive their tin lizzies across the United States before
transcontinental roads were paved, camping by the side of the road,
heating tin cans of food on a gasoline stove, and bathing in cold water.
They dressed in their Sunday best. A photograph of one 1920s camping
club shows owners in front of their Weidman Camp Body vehicles, the
men in fedoras, suits, and ties, and the women in dresses, cloche hats,
stockings, and high-heeled shoes.
It took ingenuity to travel across the country in those days before the
first motel, which opened in 1925 in California. In 1921, for instance, Lee
Scoles of Fort Wayne, Indiana, converted his 1916 Federal truck to “a
house on wheels” and drove it on an eight-month, round-trip journey to
San Francisco with 11 relatives aboard! Such additions as solid rubber
tires, a canvas awning, cots, a stove, and washtubs added to their com-
fort, according to his granddaughter Alice Worman, herself a motorhome
owner, who chronicled the story in Lifestyles, one of many such publica-
tions dedicated to RVing.
According to a story in RV West magazine, the family of Charles Ulrich
set out for California in 1929 in a General Motors truck body mounted on
a Ford chassis, with built-in bunks, overhead wardrobe storage, and a
dining table with six folding chairs. The interior was polished mahogany
and on the rear was a caboose-type open platform with iron railings.
After their “once-in-a-lifetime” trip, which continued on to Hawaii aboard
a cruise ship, the Ulrichs stored the camper until the 1960s, when it was
purchased by hunters to serve as a forest base camp.
A fire-engine red 1929 Ford Model A converted to a mini-motorhome
camper complete with pop-up top still carries the Ray Glenn family on
trips around the Seattle area, according to MotorHome magazine.

Originally, auto camping was regarded as a rich man’s hobby. The well-
publicized outings of auto manufacturer Henry Ford, inventor Thomas
Edison, naturalist John Burroughs, and tire manufacturer Harvey
Firestone, who called themselves “the four vagabonds” as they camped
in America’s parks, paved the way. Interestingly, it was the affordability
and popularity of Henry Ford’s Model T, which made its debut in 1909,
that helped bring auto camping to the average American.
Nobody knows more about the early history of recreation vehicles than
David Woodworth of Tehachapi, California. Woodworth owns the largest
collection of antique camping equipment, photography, and literature
around. Much of his material appeared in the Smithsonian Institution
exhibit At Home on the Road, which he helped produce.
Alaska-born Woodworth attributes his fascination with RVs to his child-
hood, a time when his family traveled around the country in a Detroiter
travel trailer following his carpenter father from job to job.
At RV shows and state fairs he exhibits vehicles like his Art Deco–style
1937 Hunt House Car, designed and manufactured by Hollywood cine-
matographer and inventor J. Roy Hunt. (Among Hunt’s many credits was
the 1929 film The Virginian, starring Gary Cooper.)
The sleek, 19-foot, teardrop-shaped motorhome, crafted on a Ford truck
chassis and powered by a Ford flathead V8 engine, includes a bathroom
with hand-pumped shower, lavatory, and toilet (which has to be manu-
ally removed to empty); a stove with two burners; an icebox; a sofa and
a dinette (both of which convert to beds); even a kitchen sink.
Woodworth proudly claims membership in the Tin Can Tourists, whose
last surviving affiliates have appointed him “Grand Can Opener.”
Among the 30 or so antique camping vehicles in Woodworth’s collection
are 1928 and 1931 Covered Wagon Travel Trailers manufactured in
Detroit; a 1935 York Rambler built in York, Pennsylvania; a Hays from
Grand Rapids, Michigan; and a Harley Bowless created by the builder
who oversaw the construction of Charles Lindbergh’s historic transat-
lantic aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis. Woodworth says that Airstream later
used the Harley Bowless as inspiration for its famous, aerodynamic
travel trailer back in 1936.
He can also spout nonstop historic information about auto camping and
the early campers. Here are some of his revelations:
 The first campgrounds were free, built and maintained by towns
hoping to attract affluent travelers who would spend money while
they were in town. In the days before World War I, only the affluent
had the time and money to go auto camping. When Ford’s Model T
made auto camping affordable for everyone, campgrounds started
charging fees to discourage some of the overflow crowds.

 One early pair of auto campers was a couple who were fearful their
new travel trailer might pull the rear end off their car, so the hus-
band drove and the wife sat in the trailer for the entire journey
watching the car’s rear end to make sure nothing happened to it.
 Highways were notoriously bad in the early days. Woodworth
quotes from the memoirs of some 1924 auto campers who termed
themselves “Modern Gypsies” and wrote about a local resident
telling them, “That’s a good road; somebody just made it through
there yesterday.” Later, he says, the travelers commented, “When
we left New York for Chicago, we were motorists. When we left
Chicago for California, we were pioneers.”
Remembering Our First RV Journey
We encountered RVs during our years as actors in film and television,
where the self-contained vehicles are used as dressing rooms. At first,
we didn’t even realize they moved! But when we had a writing assign-
ment that involved traveling across the country, we rented a motorhome
and learned a lot — the hard way! This section contains some excerpts
from our road diary on our (unforgettable) first RV journey. Our initial
trip was rough, but soon we learned to master the details. Why do we
share this? Because if we can do it, anybody can.
August 14: The day before we’re scheduled to leave, we lay out newspa-
per on the floor of our apartment folded to fit the measurements of the
RV’s cupboards. Then we set out the items that we intend to put in those
places and pack them in a box labeled for that section.
August 15: Unfortunately, life isn’t that rational and orderly. On packing
day, we’re forced to double-park in our crowded neighborhood and relay
boxes of books, cartons of cooking utensils, and hangers full of clothes
from our apartment to the street. We keep a constant watch so that
nothing is stolen. We dump the gear anywhere there’s space, which
mostly is on the plastic-wrapped mattress and in the bathroom shower.
When we set out, the soothing noise from the air conditioner drowns out
many of the crashes and thuds from the back as our possessions settle
in on their own, with only an occasional loud thunk making us glance
furtively backward.
Some hours later, exhausted, we agree that it’s time to stop. Just in front
of us, between the gas station and the freeway, is an RV campground.
Although we can see the sign, we cannot figure out how to get to it,
because a used-car lot and a strip mall are in the way.
At about this point, we give up the fantasy of waking to birdsong and the
breeze wafting through the pine trees.

Notable dates in RV history
ca. 1901: The first motorhomes are built as special-order units by auto-body builders.
1907: Henry Ford introduces the first mass-produced Model T Fords, with 2.9-liter, 
4-cylinder engines that make auto camping affordable for most Americans for the first
time.
1910–1915: The first manufactured, mass-produced RVs — folding camping trailers —
start coming off the line from Los Angeles Trailer Works; Auto-Kamp Trailers in
Saginaw, Michigan; and other pioneers.
1917: The first fifth-wheel trailer is built by airplane manufacturer Curtiss-Wright; its
name probably originated from the trailer hitch, which is located in the center of the
towing truck’s bed and could be considered a “fifth” wheel after the four on the trailer
unit bottom.
1919: The Tin Can Tourists gather for their first rally, in a Florida campground near
Tampa called DeSoto Park, with 20 members present, most of them Model T owners;
by the mid-1930s, the club numbered 150,000.
1922: Fifteen million auto campers hit the road, according to The New York Times —
most of them sleeping on cots, in tents, or in “newfangled houses on wheels.”
1923: There are 7,000 free campgrounds in the United States, including Denver’s
Overland Park, with 800 campsites, piped water, a garage, a restaurant, a salon, a bil-
liards hall, a soda fountain, and eight electric washing machines.
1926: Fords equipped with Weidman Camp Bodies are first produced in Tonawanda,
New York; the 1929 model sells for $1,900.
1962: John Steinbeck publishes Travels with Charley about his RV journey around
America with his elderly poodle.
1966: Winnebago becomes the first mass-production motorhome assembly line, turn-
ing out its early models (with moldings above the windshield that resembled eyebrows)
in lengths of 17, 19, and 22 feet.
1966: David Garvin begins selling RV parts and camping accessories at his family’s
campground in Bowling Green, Kentucky; by 1993, his chain of Camping World stores
(which he calls “Toys ‘R’ Us for grown-ups”) has become the world’s largest retailer
of camping supplies with 29 stores, 10 million mail-order catalogs distributed annu-
ally, and a sales base of $150 million.
1967: Charles Kuralt rents a Dodge motorhome to begin broadcasting On the Road, his
famous series of CBS-TV news features that brought small-town Americans and their
stories into the living rooms of people everywhere. During his 27 years on the road,
Kuralt used six different motorhomes; the last, a 29-foot FMC motor coach, is installed
at the Henry Ford Museum near Detroit.
1976: Winnebago Industries introduces the Heli-Home, a helicopter camper for off-
road exploration that could sleep six; we note that it’s no longer included in the com-
pany’s published brochures.

Not far away, we find a second campground and something better than
birdsong — a space called a pull-through, which means we can drive the
motorhome in one side, plug in the electrical cord, and then drive out
the other side the next morning without backing up — something we
haven’t exactly learned how to do yet.
Stunned, almost stupid with exhaustion, we microwave some soup, wash
the dishes, close the blinds and curtains, and move back to the bedroom
to make the bed. Clearing it is easier than we expect, because most of
the gear piled on the bed already has fallen onto the floor. We raise the
mattress to remove its plastic cover, and the hinged supports on the
base of the bed lock into the open position, leaving the bed firmly set 
at a rakish 45-degree angle. By this time, we’re so tired that we probably
could’ve slept on it that way, but we get out the toolbox and unscrew the
supports, so we can flatten the mattress again. Somehow we manage to
simultaneously make the bed and fall asleep in it. . . .
August 20: We get lost in Kansas City looking for Arthur Bryant’s barbe-
cue restaurant, so once again darkness has fallen by the time we check
into a small RV campground in the neighboring town of Independence,
where a kindly campground manager with a flashlight loans us a sewage
hose (because ours is too short for the hookup) and talks us, step-by-
step, through the dumping procedure for the holding tanks, which by
now have reached their capacity. The same helpful manager shows us
where to push a black button that activates the TV set. Harry, I don’t
think we’re in Kansas any more.
September 1: A great comfort can be found in riding along listening to
the sounds in the motorhome behind us. We recognize the clatter of 
the cutlery drawer swinging open, the more subdued sounds of the mug
of wooden utensils spilling onto the stove top, the rolling thud of the
canned food swaying back and forth in its bin, the rattle when the bed-
room blinds come unhooked from their pins and sway, and the bump
when a camera forgotten and left on a chair falls onto the floor.
After repairing the bed supports, the bed develops a mind of its own and
pops up occasionally, while we’re in transit, as if to have a look around.
September 15: We drive into Yellowstone, suddenly aware of how 
special it is to travel in a motorhome like this with wide scenic views
through the big windows from comfortable high seats, as if looking down
from a bus. Huge herds of bison shamble around in the roadway, in no
hurry to move along, and our vantage point is ideal for photographing
them. We stop for lunch by the Yellowstone River in a grove of trees,
their leaves turned golden, and for the first time, talk about perhaps
buying a motorhome of our own.
September 27: Partly because we despair of ever having to unpack, we
buy the motorhome from the dealer, driving off with the feeling that
we’re now full-fledged RVers.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into RVing 23

Uncovering the Myths about RVing
Because we enjoy RVing so much, we shudder at the frequent misuse of
terms, the leaping to conclusions, and frequent clichés from the unin-
formed. In the following list, we set the record straight.
 The cliché of the RV lifestyle turns off many likely candidates for
RV travel. Some believe that after you join the ranks of RV vacation-
ers, you sit around a campfire in groups swapping yarns or head 
off with a caravan of other RVs to some scenic area. Although some
people enjoy doing just that, if you’re like us, you take RV vacations
to spend time alone with each other.
We’ve discovered that as many RV lifestyles exist as there are
RVers. You can match your own lifestyle to the type of RV you
select, your choice of destination, and the pace of your journey.
 A mobile home is not an RV. Mobile homes are manufactured hous-
ing, towed by large trucks from the factory or dealer to the home-
owner’s lot (which may be in a community of other manufactured
homes.) After they are set in place, these so-called “mobile homes”
rarely move again. Motorhomes, on the other hand, are recreation
vehicles that move frequently along the highways and back roads
of America. Motorhomes take their occupants on vacation to the
mountains, to the seashore, to special events, or to visit friends
and relatives in other parts of the country.
 Likewise, a Winnebago is only one of many brands of RVs. They are
manufactured by Iowa-based Winnebago Industries. And although
all Winnebagos are RVs, not all RVs are Winnebagos. The misuse of
the term is similar to that of referring to all adhesive bandages as
Band-Aids and all facial tissues as Kleenex — like Winnebago, they
are trademarked brands.
 In a magazine story by a fellow travel writer, we read a reference to
RVers as “wheezing geezers willing to take a short walk from
motorhome to overlook.” Puh-leeze, wheeze us no geezers! Studies
show the average RV owner is 49 years old, married with children,
owns a home, and has a household income of around $56,000 a
year. Studies predict that the average owner during the next decade
will be college educated and younger than 45.
 Well-meaning environmentalists like to say that unlike backpacking
and tent camping, RVing pollutes the environment and guzzles 
gas and water resources. As graduates from the ranks of backpack-
ers and tent campers, we count ourselves among the 98 percent of
all RVers in a recent Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA)
poll that practice one or more forms of “green” RVing.

In our case, our low-flow toilet and quick showers use much less
water than public facilities in parks and campgrounds. All our
wastewater goes into holding tanks to be properly disposed of at a
sanitary dump station, rather than being poured onto the ground
or into streams. We never build campfires, because we can keep
warm and cook food in our RVs. We don’t dig up the ground, hang
clotheslines from trees, or toss away paper plates and plastic uten-
sils after every meal. We use real dishes and silverware.

schedule. We also let you know when traffic is light or heavy and discuss
rewards and drawbacks of each itinerary for certain types of travelers.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Summer is the most popular vacation time for families because the kids
are out of school. But for RVers looking for more solitude and milder
weather, spring and fall may be preferable. In the southernmost parts of
the United States, winter is best for its mild, sunny weather, but in resort
areas, prices can climb with popularity, peaking between Christmastime
and the weekend of President’s Day.
In RV parlance, retirees from northern regions fleeing winter weather are
known as snowbirds, and they’re warmly welcomed in the south, partic-
ularly southern Texas along the Rio Grande, along the Gulf of Mexico
from Florida to Louisiana, in southern Arizona and New Mexico, and in
the California deserts. Snowbirds usually flee the Northeast, Midwest, or
Northwest when the first cold weather hits, spend the winter months in
the sun, and then head back north in the spring.
Summer is prime time almost everywhere in the North, but it’s too hot
for optimum comfort in the snowbird winter retreats of the South.

Off-season means smaller crowds and lower prices, but it also can mean
that some campgrounds, restaurants, and shops are closed. In each driv-
ing chapter, we list opening and closing dates for seasonal campgrounds
and attractions, so pay close attention if your trip is scheduled during
transitional months, such as April or October.
Traffic almost always is heavy on the interstate highways, no matter
what the season. On the first and last days of a holiday weekend, the
highways, and even some back roads, are more crowded than usual.
Smart RVers often opt to stay over an extra night at the campground to
avoid the rush and drive home after most people already have returned
to work.
Scoping Out Your Perfect RV Vacation
We had enough trouble narrowing our favorite RV drives to the 14 in 
this book, so we know that you’ll have trouble choosing among them.
The following sections offer a rundown of each drive, including what you
can see, the best times to go, who should go, who shouldn’t go, and how
much time to allow. In the “Getting There” sections of each drive, we
suggest a starting point, and distance references begin there; however,
you can jump in at any point along the drive and do what you please.
Obviously, some geographic areas we describe are closer to you than
others. So if you plan to rent an RV for your vacation, take note that you
don’t have to rent one close to home. With nationwide rental companies
(see the Appendix), you can fly to another part of the country and rent
your RV there.
Regardless of your starting point, consider planning a route that enables
you to visit friends or relatives along your drive. They’ll be glad to see
you, not the least because you’re carrying your own bedroom and 
bathroom!

Packing It In
In This Chapter
 Balancing the load
 Shopping for “optional” essentials
 Packing your paraphernalia
 Carrying cool clothes for all occasions
T
he biggest difference between owning and renting an RV is that
owners can pack their RVs once — and never unpack. But seriously,
happy campers, this chapter tells you how to put some thought and
organization into the chore of packing.
Beginning RVers may want to write a checklist to follow when packing
and preparing the vehicle or setting up and breaking down camp. Some
veterans suggest laminating the list and then checking off the items with
an erasable marker so that the list can be wiped clean and used again.
For a packing list that you can use now, see the Cheat Sheet at the begin-
ning of this book. You can laminate it if you want! 
Stepping on the Scales
Before you load everything but the kitchen sink, you need to know the
following important information. The manufacturer of every RV stipu-
lates a maximum weight allowance called a gross vehicle weight rating
(GVWR), which indicates the maximum weight that the vehicle’s chassis
can carry. You can check the weight of your loaded RV at a public scale.
Look in the Yellow Pages, or ask local moving van and storage compa-
nies or recycling centers if you can use their scales for a fee. Get a read-
ing for each wheel and, for a trailer, the tongue weight, which is the
weight the trailer coupling puts on the tow hitch.
To determine whether your vehicle is overloaded, take the total weight
and subtract your unloaded vehicle rate, which is the weight of the RV
before the weights of the water in the tanks, the people in the seats, the
awnings, the generator, the air conditioners, and so on, are added. The
manufacturer also stipulates the unloaded vehicle rate. If the amount
exceeds the GVWR, then your RV is overloaded. Overloading the vehicle

not only means your driving costs are higher but also that you may seri-
ously damage the vehicle.
An unbalanced load also can cause damage. You want to distribute the
weight as evenly as possible on both sides of the vehicle. Heavier items
are best placed above or in front of the rear axle rather than behind it.
Note, however, that your holding tanks often are located behind the rear
axle. Heavy items stored behind the rear axle can cause the front of the
vehicle to lift or the rear end to drag when you turn into service stations
or other ramped roadways.
Stocking the “Optional” Essentials
In the old days of tent camping, you were a real dummy if you forgot to
bring matches and a can opener. Today, a basic checklist can be as long
as the one on the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book. For info on
equipping your RV with the “must-haves” — sewer hose, water hose,
electric adapters, and more — see Chapter 7. For details on what to put
in the kitchen, see Chapter 8.
A big difference exists between what you have to carry and what you
want to carry, but some so-called optional items have become essentials
to us:
 Binoculars are important for helping you see a great distance ahead
on the road to determine whether you need to be in the right or left
lane for a turn or to access or exit the interstate, to figure out which
service station on the exit road has the lowest gas prices, and to
read the highway signs ahead when you’re looking for an address.
 A folding, artificial-grass cloth or mat large enough to go under the
picnic table and around the entrance to the RV helps keep sand
and dirt from being tracked in. It also makes a dirt or sand camp-
site seem more hospitable.
 Folding outdoor chairs are a must, because some campgrounds
provide no outside table or furniture. We also carry small folding
tables, so we can have snacks, drinks, or lunch outside even with-
out a picnic table.
 We always take some sort of grill along for outdoor cooking.
Although some campgrounds and many public parks provide grills,
they’re often so rusty and dirty that you won’t want to put food
directly on them. You can, however, carry a wire grill that looks like
a popcorn popper with a sliding wire top to keep the food inside.
We find that carrying a portable grill is easier. We started with one
of the cheap charcoal grills that you can buy in most supermarkets
or hardware stores and then graduated to a propane-fired portable
grill with a lid that sets atop a folding base. Neither the charcoal
grill nor the propane-fired grill requires an electric hookup. Now 
Chapter 4: Packing It In 39

we also carry a new electric grill (which uses the same base) with
lid, because the grill cook thinks it’s easier to clean up afterward.
 In the kitchen, a burner igniter, which sparks to light the propane
stove burners, is easier and cleaner to use than matches. You may
not need one, however, if your RV has an igniting device built into
the cooktop.
 Because picnic tables provided in most campgrounds have seen
plenty of wear and tear and may be dusty and pocked with bird
droppings, we carry a small whisk broom to brush the table and
seats, a plastic tablecloth held down with clamps, and plastic
bench covers with tie-ons to secure them. These items are found 
in camping supply stores.
 Because we work on the road, our office supplies are always
packed in the drawers near the bedroom desk and in small plastic
stacking bins that fit under the kneehole of the desk. We always
make sure to have Post-it notes, envelopes in several sizes, pens,
pencils, staples, highlighters, and paper — everything we have in
our home office but in smaller quantities.
 We like to take games and puzzles along for lazy days in camp. Our
chess set and Scrabble board are travel editions, meaning they’re
smaller and store more easily than the standard issue. The Scrabble
game has little indents to hold each letter on the board so that
bumping or jarring doesn’t upset the game. With the chess set, how-
ever, we bought a travel set with a durable folding wooden board
that stores the pieces inside, but then we exchanged the lightweight
pieces that came with the game for heavier-than-normal pieces so
they stay in place if we’re playing outdoors on a windy day.
 Jigsaw puzzles are a favorite pastime, and after we finish one, we
usually donate it to the game room of whatever campground we’re
occupying at the time. Occasionally, the time to move on comes
before a puzzle is finished, or we start putting it together outside
on the picnic table but don’t finish before dark. That’s when puzzle
caddies or felt cloths come in handy; you can fold up the puzzle
carefully with all the pieces inside, store it, and unfold it some-
where else later on.
 When traveling with children and/or pets, be sure to pack all their
favorite playthings and security blankets — these items are rarely
stored in the RV. (For more about traveling with children and pets,
see Chapter 10.)
Stowing Your Gear
Ask yourself two questions about each piece of gear before you stow it:
 Where will I use it most?
 How weatherproof is it?

With older RVs, no matter how well built, seams are not solidly sealed,
so driving winds in sandy terrain, splashing from deep puddles, or tor-
rential rainstorms can force dirt or water inside a storage bin. This prob-
lem usually doesn’t occur with new RVs.
RVs have more storage space than you might imagine. Bins that are
accessible from the outside only carry items that you use outdoors,
while items stored inside need to be put as close to their point of use as
possible. Work with the storage space you have to suit your needs.
Because we may have more food items on hand than galley storage
allows, we may store extra canned goods in some otherwise impractical
long narrow drawers in the bedside night tables or put bottles or dry
goods in a plastic container on the floor of the closet.
Outside the RV
We keep our folding camping chairs, grills, and outdoor plastic table-
cloths in the outdoor bin closest to the entry door of the RV. Because
this is where we keep the folding outdoor table and outdoor electrical
connections, we also store the electric single burner that we use for 
outdoor cooking here.
Seldom-used items, such as Christmas decorations, ladders, and skis,
are stored in the bins underneath the living room slideout, storage areas
that we can’t easily access when we’re on the road.
Inside the RV
Both motorhomes that we’ve owned have had beds that you can lift up
to reveal a large storage area underneath, along with various tubes,
ducts, and built-in equipment. We use this area to store lightweight,
bulky items, such as extra bedding, backpacks, and a small roll-aboard
suitcase, in case we need to travel by air or train in the midst of a long
RV journey. In a camping store, we recently discovered a canvas shoe
bag that fits neatly on the foot of the bed frame; it is concealed by the
bedspread overhang and holds four or five pairs of shoes in individual
compartments, which frees up closet floor space.
Most RVs provide hanging closets that can be shirt-length or full-length
or some of each. If your closets have only shirt-length hanging space,
you have to double long items over the hanger to keep them from wrin-
kling at the bottom. If you want to figure out how many clothes your
wardrobe can handle, measure the length of the pole, then measure your
closet pole at home, and count how many garments are hanging in that
space.
If you plan to carry many clothes on your closet pole, reinforcing it
before packing is a good idea. Some poles are lightweight and collapse
easily. We bought a sturdy wooden dowel that’s the length of the closet
and covered it with ribbed plastic hose, the kind that’s used for vacuum
cleaner hoses. The ridges keep the hangers from sliding back and forth.

For tips on how to pack glassware and china, see the sidebar “An ode to
Bubble Wrap,” in this chapter.
Selecting the Right Kind of Wardrobe
One big advantage to having an RV is that you can always have your
basic wardrobe packed and ready to go in the drawers and closets of the
unit. Like most RVers, we always have a wardrobe stowed in our
motorhome that can cover any situation we may encounter on the road,
from an impromptu dinner in a fine restaurant to an outfit for cold-
weather camping or white-water rafting.
Except on the largest motorhomes and fifth-wheels, wardrobe and
drawer space is fairly limited, so you want to confine your permanent
carry-along wardrobe to carefully selected basics and add seasonal or
special apparel whenever the journey requires it.

An ode to Bubble Wrap
®
Mel Brooks, in the classic comic routine “The 2,000-Year-Old Man,” lauded plastic
wrap as the greatest invention of the past two millenniums, but we’d have to say
Bubble Wrap is a close second — at least in the wonderful world of RV cupboards.
Preferring heavy ceramic plates — bistro or restaurant grade — that can withstand
microwave cooking, we confess to a bias against paper and plastic plates. We also
refuse to sip wine from plastic stemware. But stacking dishes and glasses in an RV cup-
board without some protection to keep them from chipping or breaking if you hit a rough
stretch of highway is unrealistic. That’s where Bubble Wrap comes into the picture.
The cylinder-shaped Bubble Wrap containers that come around bottles in airport duty-
free shops make great sleeves for mugs and glasses, while the flat sheets that come
in packing boxes are easy to slide between plates or pots and pans to protect them.
You can also buy commercially produced plastic foam sleeves for glasses and pan
and plate protectors in camping supply stores, such as the Camping World chain.
Alternately nesting baskets and metal bowls also keeps down the clatter from the cup-
boards. And lining the bottoms of drawers and cupboards with waffle-patterned rubber
matting, available by the yard at hardware stores, RV dealers, and camping stores,
makes a nonskid surface for dishes.
We store fragile items, such as tulip-shaped champagne glasses, in their original
boxes and use other boxes or shaped Styrofoam packing protectors that come around
appliances to wedge them firmly in the cupboard. Whenever possible, we use real
dishes and utensils and cloth napkins that are recycled instead of disposable paper
and plastic products. If we have guests for dinner, we like to surprise them with a
dinner party comparable to one we’d have at home, including china, crystal, linens,
and candles, when they’re otherwise expecting paper plates and hot dogs on a stick.

We concentrate on basic clothing that’s machine washable, stretchable
with elastic waists, comfortable but loose fitting, and in styles and colors
that harmonize with the other items in the closet. For cold-weather
camping, even in parts of the California desert in winter, a set of long
silk underwear is invaluable to wear under sweatshirts and pants. A
loose cotton gauze or linen shirt and a pair of shorts always are on
hand for unusually hot weather, such as the heat wave we encountered
in New England one summer.
A spare pair of hiking or jogging shoes is handy to have, along with a
comfortable pair of slippers to wear in the evenings after outside chores
are finished. We each take one pair of slightly worn but acceptable dress-
up shoes, and one business or evening outfit in case of an important
appointment en route. Anyone planning to use the public showers in 
the campground also needs to take a pair of rubber shower shoes.
Several changes of underwear, socks, pajamas, and a bathrobe are
folded and tucked into nightstand drawers beside the bed. We even carry
spare bottles of prescription medication and a full supply of toiletries,
so we can slip away on the spur of the moment yet still have everything
we need aboard the RV.
Knit clothes that can be folded and stacked rather than put on a hanger
take up less room and don’t need ironing. We often take travel- or
sample-size toiletries and stow them at home in a special RV box that’s
ready to be taken along on the next trip.
On our initial six-week journey, we took far too many clothes, forgetting
that many campgrounds have coin laundries and that items of clothing
can be worn more than once. Remember: At a campground, nobody
pays much attention to what anyone wears anyway.

O
kay, you’re ready to do some research, to climb in and
out of vehicles at RV shows until your knees ache, and
then make a deal to rent or buy the best vehicle for your
upcoming vacation. In these chapters, we help you work out a
budget, give you some tips on driving your rig, furnishing it
the way you like, stocking your pantry with your favorite
foods, hanging up cool clothes in your closet, picking out the
best campsites, and keeping your home-on-wheels clean and
tidy, because you really don’t want to drive your mess

B
udgeting a trip in an RV has a few different wrinkles to it than a
vacation where you’re not driving your accommodation around, 
so in this chapter, we provide you some basic information, tips, and
how-to instructions for planning the budget for your upcoming RV trip.
Adding It Up: Your Vacation Budget
You’re not going to be able to figure out how much you’ll be spending 
to the last cent, but the Making Dollars and Sense of It worksheet at 
the back of this book, and the information in this chapter can help you
develop some reasonable parameters for your budget.
Transportation
The cost of transportation — renting an RV, buying an RV, filling the gas
tank, and maintaining your RV — is the biggest chunk of your budget.
For information on renting and buying, see “Testing the Waters: RV
Rentals” and “Taking the Plunge: RV Purchases,” later in this chapter.
Even after you own an RV, you still must pay attention to the cost of 
filling the gas tank and maintaining the vehicle in top working order. 
And you’ll want to prorate your annual maintenance costs, insurance,
license, lubes, and minor repairs while also crediting any tax benefits
that you may receive from depreciation and loan interest payments.
(Ask your accountant about that at income tax time.)
The total cost of gas obviously depends on how much time you plan to
spend on the road. Your gas price per day goes down considerably if 
you spend some days hiking, fishing, or doing local sightseeing. To get
an estimate, drive yourself mentally through your trip, adding up the
mileage as you go based on the estimates in this book (you can confirm

the mileage on an Internet site like Google maps, which lets you figure it
out from point to point).
Next, settle on a per-gallon price for gas. You can take an average figure
per gallon from your local service station. Knowing the exact price of
gas in the future or even two or three states down the road is impossi-
ble. However, www.gasbuddy.com can give you current retail prices
throughout the country (including the lowest prices in a particular
area). Divide the daily mileage or the total trip mileage by the estimated
miles per gallon your RV gets, and you can get an idea of how many gal-
lons you’ll use per day or for the entire drive. For our tips on saving
money on fuel costs, see Chapter 7.
Maintenance costs vary according to the type of RV you have. Of course,
a towable has fewer motor-related costs than a motorhome. However,
your towing vehicle may require some maintenance. A rental unit should
be in tip-top condition when you pick it up, so maintenance costs will be
minimal. If you own the RV, you face the usual road costs — we’ve had
roofs blow off, windows shatter, and tires blow. Your warranty or RV
insurance may cover such incidents.
Along with regular engine and vehicle upkeep on a long haul, spend that
little bit of extra money on RV service when necessary. The added
expense saves money in the long run.
Be aware that when you travel on back roads, you not only drive slower
(not a bad idea when sightseeing), but you also avoid the toll roads that
charge fees based on the number of axles on your rig. Parking charges
may double or triple for RV drivers. Our 36-foot motorhome takes up two
parking meters and both must be fed. Parking lots may charge additional
fees depending on the size of your rig.
RV and camping supplies
You can purchase most RV and camping supplies at your local super-
market. Specialty items, such as storage tank deodorizers, biodegrad-
able toilet paper, and other RV items, can be found in RV stores, such 
as Camping World, or auto supply shops. For a list of what we consider
essentials, see the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book.
Campgrounds
A family of four can vacation in a family campground for less than $250
per week, and a snowbird can spend the winter in a full-service, warm-
climate resort for less than $2,500, according to the National Association
of RV Parks and Campgrounds. To determine your expenses, add up the
costs of campground fees for each night you’re spending on the road.
(We list the fees per night for each campground.)
For tips on saving money on campground costs, see Chapter 1.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
48

Food
A great money-saving feature of RVs is being able to carry and prepare
your own food instead of eating out. Even buying takeout lunches or
making picnics at lunch stops keeps the price lower than eating inside a
restaurant. Figure on spending one-fourth to one-third more than you’d
spend at home on food, allowing for splurges and snacks on the road.
For tips on trimming food costs on the road, see Chapter 8.
Attractions and activities
We list admission fees for attractions and activities throughout this
book. You can easily include the must-sees and maybes in your budget
and leave out the ones that don’t interest you. We also recommend free
attractions that you can visit without adding to the bottom line.
Shopping and entertainment
Budgeting for something as personal as shopping is difficult unless, of
course, you’re honest about your own weaknesses. We buy only what we
really need, plus some discounted items, such as candies from the facto-
ries that make them or one-of-a-kind artworks. You’ll figure it out based
on your own idea of what’s a bargain, and your idea of a great souvenir.
The good thing about a large RV — that it can accommodate large sou-
venirs — also can be the bad thing.
Because we like to do our sightseeing during the day and spend
evenings in the campground, our entertainment costs are minimal. Many
campgrounds offer free movies or live music during summer. If you’re
taking the Ozarks and Branson drive in Chapter 20, however, factor in
the cost of buying tickets to one of the shows — the highlight of that
itinerary. We list average show prices in that chapter. Matinees usually
are less expensive than evening shows, although ticket prices in
Branson generally are not as high as those for other major venues,
nationally.
Testing the Waters: RV Rentals
For our first RV experience, we leased a 27-foot motorhome for six
weeks. We’d rented the unit for a book assignment that required us to
visit many remote ski areas. If we’d rented the RV for only a weekend,
we’d probably have returned it and said RVing was not for us (see the
excerpt from our road diary in Chapter 2). However, three or four weeks
into the journey, we decided not only that RVing was fun, but that we
also had to have that very motorhome. So we bought it from the dealer
and drove it for 50,000 miles before deciding to move up to a larger vehi-
cle. We now own a 36-foot widebody motorhome with two slideouts —
and 70,000 miles on the odometer since January 2000.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49

When to rent
If you don’t already own an RV, you need to rent or buy one for your trip.
But how do you decide which way to go? In the following circumstances,
renting an RV makes the most sense when:
 You’re setting out on your first RV journey.
 You’re thinking about replacing your current RV with a different
type.
 Your family is taking only a two-week vacation once a year and
wants to do so in an RV. That way, you can test-drive different
models each year, and when the time comes to buy, you’ll know
what you want.
 You want to travel for several weeks from a location that’s far from
home. Fly-and-drive packages are available from several rental com-
panies. (See the Appendix for a list.)
 You want to drive along a rough or rugged stretch of road without
subjecting your own RV to wear and tear.
 You want to travel a long haul (such as Route 66), in only one 
direction.
How to rent
Several companies rent RVs. To find one near you, see our recommenda-
tions in the Appendix, go to the Recreational Vehicle Rental Associa-
tion’s Web site (www.rvra.org), or look in your local Yellow Pages.
Make reservations for your RV three months in advance, especially for
use during holiday periods and peak travel seasons when tourists from
Europe, Australia, and New Zealand like to rent them for visits to national
parks or drives along the coast of California. During the off-season, how-
ever, you may be able to book a spur-of-the-moment rental for a few days
or a week, especially from a nearby dealer.
The most common unit available is the motorhome — either the larger
Type-A or the Type-C mini-motorhome (see Chapter 6 for definitions) —
which accounts for 90 percent of all rentals.
Prices begin around $975 per week. For tips on negotiating the figure,
see the next section, “How to get the best rate.” Keep in mind, however,
that your rental rate doesn’t include:
 The use of the generator: You need the generator only for operat-
ing the ceiling air conditioner, microwave oven, and TV in places
without electrical hookups. When you return the RV, the dealer
reads the generator counter, which usually is located by the on/off
switch, to find out how much time you logged.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
50

 A supply of certain furnishings and utensils: Some companies
offer a furnishings package with bedding, towels, dishes, cooking
pots, and utensils for a flat price of about $85 per trip. Others offer
add-on kits containing power cords and hoses, plastic trash bags,
toilet chemicals, and a troubleshooting guide. Sometimes purchas-
ing these packages, or bringing items from home, makes more
sense than spending vacation time searching for them. So you
know what’s needed, get a detailed list of what’s included in your
rental from the company.
 Connections for travel trailers: When you find a company that
rents travel trailers, you may find that it requires you to furnish
your own tow vehicle, hitch, and electrical hookups on the tow
vehicle.
 Insurance: Insurance on a rental RV normally isn’t covered on your
own automobile insurance, so ask your insurance agent for a
binder that extends your coverage to the RV for the rental period.
Many dealers require the binder before you can rent a vehicle.
Most rental centers request a cleaning deposit, which isn’t returned if
you bring the vehicle back with the holding tanks full or the interior
dirty or damaged. Some companies offer free airport pickup and return
if you notify them of your flight number and estimated arrival time.
At the dealership, be sure the dealer demonstrates all the components
and systems of the RV you’re renting. Take careful notes. As is true with
rental cars, check for dents and damage from previous use before leav-
ing the lot.
Be sure you’re provided with a full set of instruction booklets and emer-
gency phone numbers in case of a breakdown. Having a 24-hour emer-
gency toll-free number to call in case of a problem is best.
If you fall in love with your rental vehicle (as we did with ours), you may
be able to negotiate a purchase price that subtracts your rental fee from
the total. You can get a good deal if the vehicle is a couple of years old,
because most dealers get rid of vehicles after two or three years.
How to get the best rate
For the best rental rate, follow these five tips:
 Check prices with several companies before making a decision.
Establish exactly what the lowest-priced rental includes, such as
free miles, the price per mile beyond the daily or weekly limit,
amenities such as dishes and linens, and breakdown service.
Organize your data using the Right Rig: Choosing Your RV work-
sheet in the Appendix.
 Try to plan your trip during the off-season or shoulder season,
the period between the most popular and the least popular travel
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 51

times. The times of year for these seasons vary depending on the
area where you’re renting.
 Find out in advance whether your own automobile insurance
agent covers your rental insurance for an RV. Your agent usually
can provide a cheaper rate than the rental company.
 Try to plan your trip in a loop, with the rental agency serving as
the starting and ending point, so you can avoid drop-off charges.
 Negotiate based on selection. The more RVs a rental company has,
the wider your range of choices, but if you’re flexible about what
sort of rig you rent, you may be able to negotiate a better price
when the selection is limited.
Taking the Plunge: RV Purchases
Buying an RV is a big moment and certainly not a time for a fast-talking
salesman to steer your emotions into a hasty purchase. Use the Right
Rig: Choosing Your RV worksheet in the Appendix to list the amenities
that you want to include in your purchase and make comparisons with a
variety of manufacturers and dealers.
For a first-time buyer, renting an RV of the type you’re thinking about
buying can be a big help in making up your mind. Just be sure to allow
enough time to get comfortable with the RV. A week is the minimum; two
weeks is better. You need enough time to relax into the day-to-day logis-
tics of handling the RV on the road and hooking it up in the campground
to evaluate the design properly. For more tips on selecting the right RV
for you, see Chapter 6.
An RVIA Seal, clearly affixed near an RV’s doorway, certifies that the
vehicle complies with 500 specifications established under the American
National Standards Institute for fire and safety, plumbing and electrical
systems, and liquid propane gas systems. The Recreation Vehicle
Industry Association, representing builders of more than 95 percent of all
RVs sold in the United States, makes periodic unannounced plant inspec-
tions to ensure that members maintain acceptable levels of compliance.
Why go to an RV show?
When the bug to buy an RV first strikes, one of the best places to look is
at an annual national or regional RV show. These shows usually take
place during the winter months. They make especially safe hunting
grounds for three types of people:
 “Looky-loos” who have no idea what they want but aren’t about to
succumb to the first smooth-talking salesman they encounter
 Well-researched potential buyers who know exactly what they want
and are ready to make a deal
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
52

 RV owners who want to see the latest technical and design innova-
tions, but are basically happy with their existing vehicles
What you get for the price of admission to an RV show is a chance to
compare different types of RVs, different brands, and different models.
Salesmen on-site are happy to spend time answering your questions,
handing out brochures with floor plans and operating statistics, and
pointing out features that distinguish their particular vehicles.
The action gets hot and heavy during the last day or two of a show when
prices may be reduced and stumbling across an offer that you can’t
refuse is possible. On the other hand, if you’re susceptible to sales talk,
tread carefully or you may be driving a brand-new RV home from the
show — not that there’s anything wrong with that!
For a free listing of RV shows, contact the RVIA, or watch local news-
paper or TV ads for a show in your area.
How to deal with dealers
Check the Yellow Pages for local RV dealers and spend an afternoon
walking around the lot looking at various types of vehicles and mentally
moving into them. Dealers usually can give you a brochure that details
all the features, floor plans, and specifics to take home and study.
Every dealership has a number of previously owned vehicles that they’ve
taken as trade-ins or that they’re selling for other owners. Generally, a
used vehicle can be one-third to half the price of a new model. Purchasing
from a reputable dealer improves the chance that the RV is in good con-
dition and gives you some place to come back to if you have a problem
later. For a few issues to keep in mind, see the “Buyer beware: Used RVs”
sidebar, later in this chapter.
Don’t worry about taking up a salesman’s time if you’re not yet ready to
buy. Sooner or later you will be, and dealers are accustomed to the
allure of a new-yet-unfamiliar RV to wannabe and veteran owners.
Expect the best buys in December and January, when dealers want to
get the previous year’s still-new models off the lot to make room for the
new year’s models. Ask to be put on dealers’ mailing lists for any sales
that they may have in the future.
Where not to shop for an RV
Avoid parking lot and campground “distress” sellers who give you a spiel
about bad luck and desperate need for cash. A nationwide group of con
artists, calling themselves “Travelers,” makes a big profit selling cheaply
made travel trailers that also serve as living quarters and office head-
quarters for numerous other scams.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 53

Be extremely careful buying from any private party unless you’re famil-
iar with the RV and can make a clear-eyed evaluation of it before signing
the deal. If the RV looks beat up and shows wear and tear inside and out,
walk away. Chances are, if the owner has treated the superficial areas
badly, the critical working systems that you can’t see are also flawed.
Remember: With motorized vehicles, you’re buying both a used car and
a used house.
How to finance your purchase
Because RV buyers generally are considered more reliable for a loan
than car buyers (only 1.39 percent of all RV loans are delinquent), loans
are easier to get. Check with banks, savings and loan associations,
finance companies, credit unions, or the RV dealer. Loans for big new
RVs typically range from 10 to 12 (and even 15) years, and many lenders
ask for a 20 percent down payment or less. A few lenders may require a
25 percent down payment. Financing packages for used RVs can run up
to eight years. (For a description of RV types and costs, see Chapter 6.)
Interest on the loan is deductible as second home mortgage interest, 
as long as the unit contains basic cooking, sleeping, and toilet 
accommodations.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
54
Buyer beware: Used RVs
Before buying a used RV, you want to protect yourself from making the wrong pur-
chase. Consider the following five precautions before you buy:
 Take a long test drive. Watch gauges closely and check out all systems person-
ally from toilet flush to water pump and heater. Look particularly for dry rot in any
areas with wood or water stains that may be signs of leaks.
 Ask questions. Ask the owner direct and specific questions about all systems in
the vehicle.
 Have the RV inspected. Ask a knowledgeable friend or, better still, hire an RV
mechanic to look at the vehicle.
 Check the book value of the unit. Look at the current value in Kelley Blue Book or
NADA Appraisal Guide; your bank’s loan officer should have current copies.
 Shop around. Visit at least one other dealer’s lot to check comparable models and
prices.

Selecting Your RV
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on different types of RVs
 Deciding which type is best for you
 Calculating costs for each type of RV
W
hen you’re selecting an RV, you need to consider how you like to
travel, where you want to go, and how many other travelers will
be accompanying you. Carefully consider the pros and cons of each type
before going out to look at options to rent or buy.
For definitions of the RV lingo used in this chapter, check out the
Appendix. For information on renting and buying (and the reasons you
may do one over the other), see Chapter 5.
Getting to Know the RV Types
RVs break down into two basic types — towable vehicles and motorized
vehicles.
Towable vehicles, such as folding camping trailers, travel trailers, and
fifth-wheel travel trailers, are living units that can stand alone in camp
but must be hitched to motor vehicles to travel. Truck campers, which
are compact living units designed to fit atop the bed and cab of a pickup
truck, also are part of the towable team.
As the name indicates, motorized vehicles have their own engines, so
they do not need to be towed. Motorized RVs include motorhomes
(sometimes called Type-A RVs) and van campers (sometimes called
Type-B RVs), both of which are self-contained units, built on a truck or
van chassis with living, sleeping, cooking, and bathroom facilities acces-
sible from the driver’s area without leaving the vehicle. The cabover bed
or storage unit that overlaps the cab of the truck distinguishes the mini-
motorhomes, also called Type-C RVs. The dividing line between mini-
motorhome and camper van is becoming more and more blurred as
more van-style compact units fitted with all the necessities for self-
contained camping appear on the market.

Along with our definitions of each RV type in this chapter, we also give
you the average vacation cost for a family of four for 2, 7, and 14 nights
of travel. By comparison, a family of four, traveling in their personal car,
staying at motels or hotels, and eating their meals in restaurants, spends
an average of $903 for 3 days; $2,182 for 7 days; and $4,222 for 14 days.
The cost of an RV vacation can be as much as 50 percent less. Gas
prices may add to the vacation cost estimates that follow depending 
on how much you drive and what states you’re visiting. Check www.
gasbuddy.com for current prices across the country.
Folding camping trailers
In most cases, the family car can pull these neat little units; a sport util-
ity vehicle (SUV) or station wagon certainly can do the job. Affordable,
open, and airy, these lightweight RVs are the closest thing to tent camp-
ing (see Figure 6-1). They fit into a carport or garage and are easy to
hook up, tow, and store. From a compact trailer, the RV unfolds upward
to standing-room height with side walls that slide out to form two
screened, covered wings, each containing a double bed area.
Figure 6-1: Folding camping trailer.
The center section has a solid floor that supports cooking, dining, and
lounging areas. Some convert to provide even more sleeping space on a
sofa or dinette, and some have optional toilet and shower facilities.
Some models are equipped with heating and air conditioning options,
and most have a gas stove that can be used inside the unit or plugged
into outside connections.
Unit cost
Generally, the least expensive of the RVs, folding camping trailers, are
priced from $4,000 to $18,000 and may sleep as many as eight. The
average price is about $5,650. Although early folding camping trailers
had canvas and/or screen sides, newer models also offer the option of
vinyl or even hard siding of lightweight aluminum.
Budget-minded young families with small children, tent campers who
seek a bit more luxury without giving up the canvas-and-campfire ambi-
ence, and even veteran RVers seeking a simpler travel lifestyle enjoy
these vehicles.

Vacation costs
In a study commissioned by the Go Camping America Committee, the
average, national vacation costs for a family of four traveling in their 
personal automobile, towing a folding camping trailer, staying at camp-
grounds, and preparing all their meals in the RV came to $508 for 3 days;
$1,125 for 7 days; and $2,317 for 14 days.
Pros and cons
Folding camper trailers have the following advantages:
 Easy to tow, better gas mileage, and lower wind resistance: It
goes anywhere the family car can go, and it stays behind in camp
while the family explores by car.
 Lavish living for the cost: These trailers may contain many options
found in more expensive RVs — air-conditioning, heating, toilet
facilities, three-way refrigerators, awnings, and even roof racks to
carry boats or bicycles atop the folded unit.
 Easy to store: Your garage or carport can handle the storage;
folded, these units measure from 5 to 19 feet long and are usually
less than 60 inches high.
But keep these negatives in mind as you decide what RV is right for you:
 Not always convenient: Most folding camper trailers use a hand-
crank system for raising and lowering, which is simple when the
weather is nice but can be tricky in the rain when you’re trying to
keep wing mattresses dry.
 Limited on-road access: The unit is not usable when you’re under-
way unless you crank it open at rest stops. Some models have front
storage units that you can get to when the unit is folded, but
kitchen and toilet facilities are available only when the rig is fully
set up.
 May mildew when wet: If a canvas unit is closed when wet, it must
be unfolded at home and dried out completely before it’s stored;
otherwise, it can mildew. Vinyl units don’t have this problem, as
they can simply be wiped dry.
 Limited toilet facilities: Some models contain neither toilet nor
shower facilities, nor do they offer them as an option. Most contain
a storage area for a portable toilet that has to be removed and emp-
tied manually — you have to camp in areas that have public toilets
and showers.
Truck campers
If you already own a pickup truck, the easiest and least expensive RV for
you to consider may be a truck camper (see Figure 6-2), a unit that slides
onto the bed of a pickup, sometimes overhanging the cab or the rear of
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 57

the vehicle. Most models sleep two to six people. Because the unit slides
on and off, the truck continues to be useful as a hauling and transporta-
tion vehicle without the camper.
Figure 6-2: Truck camper.
Sportsmen like the rugged outdoorsy capability of truck campers,
because they can remove the camper and set it up in camp, and then
use the truck to go to and from ski areas, fishing holes, or trail heads.
You can also tow a boat, snowmobile, or horse trailer behind a truck
camper — something not permitted with other towables.
Low-profile pop-up models are available, as are units that have optional
electrical systems to load and unload the camper from the truck bed.
Units range from 7 to 18 feet in length with a cabover bed extending over
the pickup’s cab. Truck campers usually are equipped with a small bath-
room and kitchen unit. Sofa or dinette built-ins may convert to form a
second sleeping area, but the beds usually are fairly short. A step leads
from the lower floor area up to the cabover bed.
Unit cost
Most models cost between $4,000 and $26,000, with the average price
about $14,490.
Buyers of truck campers need to plan to spend extra time matching
camper to pickup in categories such as weight, tow bar, and other 
essentials.
Vacation costs
In a cost comparison survey, a family of four traveling with a light-duty
truck and truck camper, staying in campgrounds, and preparing all their
meals at campsites spends $525 for 3 days; $1,150 for 7 days; and $2,350
for 14 days.
Pros and cons
Truck campers have the following advantages:
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
58

 Economical: These are cheaper to buy, maintain, and operate than
most other towables, with better gas mileage.
 Versatile: The camper unit can be removed and stored at home or
set in place at the campground, so the truck can be used for utility.
With a self-contained camper and a four-wheel-drive truck, you can
go almost anywhere.
 Durable: Most models are made to endure tougher road conditions
than other towables.
 Passenger convenience: In most states (except Maine, Mississippi,
New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and
Wisconsin), passengers are permitted to ride inside a truck camper.
California permits passengers to ride inside only if communication
is possible with the driver and if the door can be opened from both
inside and outside.
But keep in mind the downside:
 Limited floor space: Two adults can’t move around freely inside
the unit at the same time. However, some new models have slide-
outs that expand the living area.
 May be hard to handle: Weight distribution and a higher center of
gravity often mean more difficulty handling these units on the road.
Travel trailers
Vans, autos, or pickup trucks can tow these soft- or hard-sided RVs,
depending on the weight of the unit (see Figure 6-3). They sleep from
two to eight people, range from 10 to 40 feet long, and usually contain
full bathroom and kitchen facilities. Models come in traditional box
shape, teardrop shape, and a hard-sided telescoping unit that can be
lowered for towing and storage and raised for campground living.
Figure 6-3: Travel trailer.
Slideouts (a portion of the vehicle that slides open when the RV is
parked to expand the living area) add more walking-around room inside;
today’s models may offer as many as three slideouts. Campgrounds with
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 59

narrow sites may prohibit RVs from using slideouts. Ask about this
restriction before checking in.
Before choosing a travel trailer to be towed behind a vehicle that you
already own, check that vehicle’s weight limit. Remember that you’ll be
adding food, water, clothing, books, and sports gear — be sure your tow
vehicle is capable of handling it all.
Unit cost
Prices for travel trailers range from $8,000 to $76,000, with an average
cost of about $15,700.
Vacation costs
A family of four traveling in their personal car or light truck, towing a
travel trailer, and staying in campgrounds, where they prepare all their
meals, spends an average of $623 for 3 days; $1,376 for 7 days; and
$2,837 for 14 days.
Pros and cons
Travel trailers offer the following pluses:
 Easy to unhitch: Travel trailers can be unhitched at the campsite,
releasing the tow vehicle for local errands and touring.
 Versatile: Choose from various floor plans, furniture, colors, and
cabinet finishes. Some models have two doors; some offer a for-
ward bedroom and rear bunkhouse design to sleep the whole
family without converting sofas and dinettes into beds.
 Can be pulled by most vehicles: Thanks to a variety of tow-pack-
age options, travel trailers can be pulled by 4-by-4s, SUVs and light
trucks, full- and midsize cars, station wagons, and minivans.
But note these disadvantages:
 Can be hard to handle: Handling a travel trailer, especially when
backing up, takes extra skill until you get the knack.
 Not always convenient: Wind resistance is greater with travel trail-
ers than with other towables, and hitching or unhitching can be a
nuisance in bad weather.
 Costs more in tolls: Road tolls based on axles are higher for travel
trailers and fifth-wheels than they are for other towables.
Fifth-wheel travel trailers
The most luxurious of the towables, fifth-wheels (see Figure 6-4) are pop-
ular with full-time RVers and snowbirds because of their ease of maneu-
vering and towing, generous storage areas, large living spaces, and
homelike design. The raised forward section that fits over the truck bed
allows a split-level design and is usually allotted to bedroom space.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
60

Figure 6-4: Fifth-wheel travel trailer.
Numerous floor-plan, décor, and furnishing options are available. Many
offer up to three slideouts that further expand the living space. Fifth-
wheels often include a washer/dryer, bedroom TV, entertainment or
computer center, or even a kitchen island. Fifth-wheels are from 22 to 
40 feet long.
Unit cost
Fifth-wheels sell from $13,000 to $102,000 and up, with an average cost
of around $35,500.
Vacation costs
A family of four traveling in their personal car or light truck towing a
travel trailer and staying in campgrounds, where they prepare all their
meals, spends an average of $623 for 3 days; $1,376 for 7 days; and
$2,837 for 14 days.
Pros and cons
Fifth-wheels offer the following advantages:
 Maneuverability and towability: Fifth-wheels are easier to handle
than travel trailers because the hitch is in the bed of the truck with
less vehicle trailing behind. This setup also creates a shorter turn-
ing radius.
 Easy to unhitch: Like the other towables, the fifth-wheel can be
unhitched and left at the campsite, thus leaving the truck free for
touring or shopping in the area.
 Extra storage in your pickup: The truck bed still can be used for
storage with the addition of a pickup bed cover.
But keep in mind these negatives:
 You can’t carry passengers on the road: In 29 states, passengers
aren’t permitted to ride in the fifth-wheel.
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 61

 Limited headroom: In many forward-bedroom models, except
those labeled “high profile,” anyone more than 6 feet tall cannot
stand up straight in that part of the unit.
 No entry from towing vehicle: As with all towables, you have to
exit the towing vehicle and go outdoors to enter the RV, an incon-
venience in bad weather.
Van campers (Type B)
Also called Type-B motorhomes (see Figure 6-5), these van conversions
are built within the framework of a van but with raised roofs or lowered
floor sections that enable passengers to stand upright at least in the
center of the vehicle. Galleys, freshwater hookups, sleeping and dining
areas that convert to beds, and even toilets and showers are available 
in these versatile vehicles.
Figure 6-5: Van camper (Type B).
Ranging from 18 to 22 feet in length, van campers sleep from two to four
people by turning the sofa or dinette into a double bed and converting
the two rear seats into single beds. This design can also carry four to six
adults as a weekday commuter vehicle.
Unit cost
Van campers sell from $42,000 to $74,000, with an average cost of
around $58,500 — comparable in price to an entry-level motorhome.
Custom van conversions also are available from a number of manufac-
turers at an average price of around $28,500. For a complete list of man-
ufacturers who make van conversions, contact RVIA (see the Appendix).
Vacation costs
A family of four using their own van camper or van conversion, staying
in campgrounds, and preparing all their meals in camp spends an aver-
age of $615 for 3 days; $1,350 for 7 days; and $2,837 for 14 days.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
62

Pros and cons
Van campers offer the following pros:
 Multipurpose use: These RVs can double as a second car.
 Easy to drive and park: Van campers go anywhere a passenger car
can, including places where larger RVs may be restricted, and can
fit into tent and RV spots in campgrounds.
 Better gas mileage: Van campers usually get much better mileage
than motorhomes or mini-motorhomes.
 Cozy (the good kind): Self-contained van campers mean you don’t
have to leave the vehicle to use any of the facilities.
But keep these cons in mind:
 Cozy (the bad kind): Although a van camper can sleep four people,
they’d better be very good friends. The arrangement is best for a
couple with one or two small children. The living area is very tight
for a family to spend a rainy day inside.
 Racks up extra miles: Because the van doubles as a second car, the
greater mileage accrued by selling time may make it harder to sell
or trade than a larger motorhome.
 Not easy to set up: Making up some of the optional beds in these
vans can knock your back out — even before you lie down.
 Limited storage space: You must carry fewer clothes and supplies
and make more frequent laundry and grocery stops; the minifridge
inside doesn’t always have a freezer compartment.
Mini-motorhomes (Type C)
Familiar, convenient, and affordable, the Type-C motorhome (see Figure
6-6) packs plenty of living into a compact space. Also called mini-
motorhomes, the units are built on truck or van chassis and range in
length from 19 to 31 feet long. Slideouts, widebody designs up to 102
inches across, and diesel engine options are available. Low-profile
models can be streamlined to less than 8 feet high for travel and storage.
Figure 6-6: Mini-motorhome (Type C).
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 63

Normally, a cabover bed is above the driver’s seat, while a sofa turns
into a second bed. A dinette, kitchen, and bathroom complete the inte-
rior. Some models have an additional bedroom and an entertainment
center in the cabover space.
Unit cost
Type Cs are priced from $48,000 to $140,000 or more, with the average
price around $63,000.
Vacation costs
A family of four traveling in their own mini-motorhome, staying in camp-
grounds, and preparing all their meals in camp spends an average of
$647 for 3 days; $1,491 for 7 days; and $2,996 for 14 days.
Pros and cons
Mini-motorhomes offer the following advantages:
 Easier to drive: Type Cs are more maneuverable for beginning RV
drivers than the longer Type-A motorhomes.
 Comfortable and compact: Mini-motorhomes are as livable as
larger motorhomes but take up less parking and campground
space.
But keep these disadvantages in mind:
 So-so sleeping accommodations: The cabover bed doesn’t appeal
to claustrophobic adults, but kids love it. Except in units that have
a rear bedroom, the sleeping accommodations are less private than
in the Type-A motorhome when more than two people are traveling.
 Limited driving visibility: Because of the overhang from the
cabover bed, visibility is limited to that of a normal-size windshield.
Most Type-A motorhomes, on the other hand, provide large,
panoramic windshields.
 Limited gas mileage: Based on our experience, with the exception
of lightweight models, a Type-C mini-motorhome gets about the
same gas mileage as a Type A of comparable length.
Motorhomes (Type A)
A self-propelled motor-vehicle chassis with a living unit built on its
frame, the Type-A motorhome (see Figure 6-7) offers the widest range of
choices in the entire RV fleet, from small, 22-foot, fully equipped entry-
level vehicles to enormous, 45-foot, buslike widebody coaches with
slideouts, icemakers, washer/dryers, richly appointed furnishings, and
marble bathrooms.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
64

Figure 6-7: Motorhome (Type A).
Décor can vary from the old-fashioned but tough velour fabrics in slate
blue or green in the lower-priced vehicles to cushy leather furniture,
brass trim, parquet floors, mirrored ceilings, and sculpted area rugs.
A fairly standard entry-level 28-foot model contains cockpit seats that
swivel, a sofa and dinette — either of which can be made into a bed, a
bathroom, and rear bedroom with an option of queen or twin beds.
Unit cost
Motorhomes are priced from $58,000 all the way up to $1,400,000 for
the most deluxe models, with the average around $145,000.
Vacation costs
A family of four traveling in their own motorhome, staying in camp-
grounds and preparing all their meals in camp, spends an average of
$647 for 3 days; $1,491 for 7 days; and $2,996 for 14 days.
Pros and cons
A Type-A motorhome offers the following pros:
 Always accessible from the front seats: In a Type-A motorhome,
you can pull over to fix lunch, use the bathroom, or take a quick
nap in a parking lot or rest area without going outside.
 Bigger windshield and windows than the Type C: The Type A
offers more visibility when traveling, more light inside, and better
vantage points for photographs than the Type C.
 Livability: A big, open sense of space and luxury makes this the
most comfortable of the motorized RVs.
 No setup required: In most Type As, living and sleeping areas are
set up and ready for two people. For sleeping more than two
people, however, a sofa or dinette usually has to be made up.
But keep in mind these cons:
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 65

 It’s your only transportation: Unless you’re towing a car, a Type-A
motorhome has to be unplugged and moved if you need to go shop-
ping or sightseeing away from the campground.
 Tough to maneuver: The larger Type-A motorhomes have difficulty
maneuvering in narrow streets with heavy traffic and are tough to
park almost everywhere except mall and supermarket parking lots.
Height and width limitations prohibit you from entering most park-
ing garages and can present problems in clearing low overhanging
roofs and narrow tunnels or bridges.
 Low mileage: Gas mileage is quite low, usually less than 10 miles to
the gallon. And filling up a 40-gallon gas tank can be a mind- (and
budget-) blowing experience.
 Sometimes too big for parks and campgrounds: Choosing a size to
match your travel style is critical in this category because larger
units can’t be accommodated in some rustic campgrounds and
aren’t permitted to enter certain roadways and campgrounds in
some national parks.
Selecting the RV for You
This section helps you narrow down the choices so that you can match
an RV to your lifestyle and needs.
Matching an RV to your lifestyle
When selecting an RV that’s right for you, you need to consider the kind
of vacation you want to take and the level of comfort you desire.
If you want a close-to-nature experience but a good mattress for your
aching back, check out the folding camping trailer. Each of two side
panels slides out to hold a large mattress, and the screen windows and
canvas roof provide a feel that’s closer to the outdoors.
When you’re venturing down rough roads in potentially extreme weather
on a hunting or fishing trip, the truck camper may be the right choice.
This efficient hard-sided unit fits into the bed of an existing truck and
can be removed and set up to stand alone at a campsite.
If you want a relatively small, easy-to-handle RV that you can store in the
driveway or garage at home, consider a camper van. You can purchase
one as a camper or as a van that has been converted to a camper. One
big advantage: These RVs can double as commuter vehicles.
For camping conditions that approximate home comfort, travel trailers,
fifth-wheels, and motorhomes offer the optimum in comfort but also are
the largest and most expensive RVs. Pricing ranges from an entry-level
motorhome in the $58,000 bracket to an elegant bus-type motorhome
that can cost over $1 million.

Asking yourself ten questions
These questions will help you decide what you need, and what you can
expect as you decide what kind of RV is right for you, starting with how
many people you need to accommodate, how much privacy you want,
what are your storage needs are, and more.
 Do I already have part of an RV unit? If you have a pickup, for
example, depending on its size, you’re already capable of handling
a towable, such as a travel trailer, truck camper, or fifth-wheel.
Most family cars can pull a small travel trailer or folding camping
trailer. On the other hand, if you have a smaller or compact car, a
towable may be beyond its capabilities.
 How many people does the RV need to accommodate on a routine
trip? You find a big difference between a salesman’s estimate of 
how many people a vehicle can sleep and the reality of the number
of adults and children the unit can comfortably and conveniently
accommodate. Some people dislike the idea of making a bed out of a
sofa or dinette night after night during a vacation. Others don’t want
someone climbing over them in the middle of the night to go to the
bathroom.
 How will I be using the vehicle? People who like to stay in one
place, say a country-club-type private campground with swimming
pools and putting greens, want a more luxurious vehicle than
campers who want to go out in the woods in a national park or
forest, build a campfire, and cook outdoors. Travelers who want to
stop at a different campground every night while touring a large
region need to give priority to ease of setting up camp and fuel effi-
ciency. Snowbirds who want to stay in one place without hookups
for a long time need to look for greater capacity in water storage
and holding tanks.
 Which is more important to you: generous living space in the
vehicle or more flexible handling, parking, and roadway
options? In making a decision on vehicle size, as little as 1 foot in
length or 4 inches in width can make a tremendous difference in
the long run. Spend plenty of time mentally moving around in the
floor plan or even physically moving around in the vehicle at the
dealer or the RV show to assess its livability. Know your size
requirements before setting out to look at vehicles, especially if
you’re considering a motorhome.
 How important is your personal privacy? Some types of RVs offer
more solid-door privacy areas than others. In particular, the
shower and toilet facilities in folding camping trailers or camping
vans (when they’re provided at all) may offer minimum privacy,
while travel trailers, fifth-wheels, motorhomes, and some truck
campers provide facilities in completely closed-off areas. Sleeping
facilities also may be open or shielded with curtains rather than
doors, which is true of many folding camping trailers, truck
campers, and even Type-C mini-motorhomes.
Chapter 7: Selecting Your RV 67

 What kind of fuel — gasoline or diesel — do I want the vehicle to
burn? The general consensus is that diesel engines cost more on
initial purchase but less in the long run to operate. Some complain
about the high cost of oil and filters for diesel engines. Diesel
engines usually seem quieter in the cockpit than gasoline engines
because they’re positioned in the rear of the vehicle.
 Will I be happy with a standard, “off-the-rack” model RV, or do I
want some special features and options? Every year, manufactur-
ers come up with new toys and gimmicks for today’s younger
market. High-tech elements, such as computer stations, satellite
dishes, and electronic navigational systems, have joined rearview
backing cameras and slideouts as common optional equipment.
Lots of accessories add to the overall cost (obviously!), but if they
improve your enjoyment of the RV experience, then you should
consider the expense as you decide what you want and what you’re
willing to spend.
 How often will I use the vehicle? Some RV owners in cold climates
have to winterize and store the RV, while others use it year-round,
either driving south for the winter, going skiing or winter camping,
or just living in or near mild climates. (If you think you’ll use your
RV only once a year for a two-week family vacation, renting, rather
than buying, an RV may be cheaper.)
 Where will I store the vehicle? City-dwellers (like us) must rent
storage space for our vehicles. Even suburbanites, however, can
face parking regulations that forbid keeping an RV in the driveway
or on the street in front of the house. Owners with a large garage
may consider folding camping trailers, truck campers, or telescop-
ing travel trailers that are compact enough to store inside. Some
travelers who like to visit the same park or campground year after
year may want to store the vehicle permanently at the vacation
location.
 How much money can I spend? Budgeters and young families
often begin by buying an entry-level RV in whichever category they
want. With sticker shock being a strong factor these days, more
and more manufacturers are offering lower-priced models in all cat-
egories. Previous RV owners often, but not always, look toward
buying a larger, newer, and more expensive model. In many cases,
interest paid on your loan to purchase an RV is tax deductible as a
second home. (For more info about buying an RV, see Chapter 5.)

 Securing your RV when you’re not using it
A
n RV can seem like a great new toy for grown-ups, but as a vehicle
and substitute house, owning a rig brings new responsibilities on
the road and in the campground. Check out the cautions, tips, and han-
dling hints in this chapter to make your maiden voyage safe and comfy.
Driving Your RV
Driving an RV isn’t difficult, but the experience is different from handling
the family car. No special license or driver training is required. However,
before hitting the road, you’ll want to know a few basics and brush up
on your road etiquette.
Focusing on the basics
Wherever you rent or buy your RV, someone will go over all the details
with you, from driving the rig to hooking it up. Don’t nod along, pretend-
ing that you know what he’s talking about. If something isn’t clear, ask
questions until you understand.
If you’re a novice RV driver, or even an experienced one, getting accus-
tomed to a different model or type may mean a round of practice driv-
ing in a large empty parking lot. After you get into the driver’s seat and
adjust your mirrors, ask someone to walk around the vehicle so you
identify your blind spots. Many newer motorhomes have rearview
backup TV cameras mounted on the rear of the rig with a monitor on the
dash; they help considerably when the time comes to back up.
The increased length and width of an RV makes turning more awkward,
but making this adjustment is easy. You have to make wider turns. When
turning right, for example, keep your vehicle closer to the left than you

would with your car, and drive farther into the intersection before turn-
ing the steering wheel to the right. When turning left, make comparable
adjustments: Keep your vehicle closer to the right and turn when you
get farther than usual into the intersection.
Always signal your intention to turn or change lanes well ahead of time,
so drivers behind you have plenty of warning. Your vehicle isn’t as agile
as the ones around you.
When backing into a campsite or getting out of a tight situation at a gas
station, you want someone outside and behind you, giving you hand
signals or, better still, giving you directions via a walkie-talkie.
On the road, check your position often in the rearview mirrors, side or
center mirrors, or the backup camera. Always be aware of the relation-
ship of your vehicle with the painted lines marking traffic lanes or the
edges of the roadway.
Wind speed is one special consideration to bear in mind when driving 
an RV. The large, flat surfaces of a trailer or motorhome can rock or sway
when hit flat-sided with a heavy wind. Be aware that you’ll feel gusts of
wind when heavy trucks pass you at high speeds.

Road etiquette
Only the most self-centered RVer is bad mannered on the road, but like you, we’ve
been in the position of following a big, tall, slow-moving RV that doesn’t pull over to let
us pass when the opportunity arises. To maintain harmony on the road, we offer these
tips:
 Don’t hog the highway. Pull over at turnouts or into slow-moving lanes, so that
vehicles behind you have a chance to pass. (In some states, laws stipulate that a
slower-moving vehicle must allow following vehicles to pass at the first opportu-
nity when five or more of them are trailing.) Allowing cars to pass, as often as pos-
sible, not only makes people behind you happy, but it also makes you more relaxed.
 Stay in the right lane except when passing another vehicle. When you do pass,
make sure you have the speed and space to do so quickly and easily. Some
motorhomes don’t have the necessary power to overtake vehicles on an incline
(uphill), especially if the other driver happens to speed up as you attempt to pass.
 Turn off your high beams. As with your car, turning off your high beams for an
approaching car is a must. Doing so when driving into a campground after dark
also is a good idea.
 Make a friendly wave to oncoming RVs. This customary practice is especially
important if the other vehicle is a make and model similar to your own.

The biggest chore is mental. Take it easy on the road, slow down, and
allow more room to change lanes or stop.
Going beyond the basics: Our tips
Having logged more than 100,000 miles in RVs, we consider ourselves
experts on the subject. We went beyond the basics years ago. What fol-
lows are just a few of the driving tips we’ve picked up along the way:
 Buckle your seat belt. When the vehicle is in motion, everyone
inside needs to be in a seat with the seat belt fastened. Wait until
the RV is safely parked before getting up and walking around, fetch-
ing a cold drink from the refrigerator, going to the bathroom, or
cooking something on the stove. Wearing a seat belt is also
required by law in every state except New Hampshire.
 Drive with headlights on in the daytime. This safety measure
makes your vehicle visible in marginal light and from a greater dis-
tance, especially on long, straight expanses of highway. More and
more states require the use of headlights during the daytime, and
we favor making this practice mandatory.
 Memorize your RV’s height, weight, and girth. You need to know
quickly whether your vehicle fits the parameters when you see a
sign ahead warning of a bridge with a 5-ton limit or a tunnel with 
10 feet of clearance.
 Watch for cautionary road signs. Everyone in the RV, not just the
driver, needs to keep a look out, especially for signs denoting a
tunnel ahead and giving its maximum clearance.
 Take action if you don’t see cautionary road signs. Sometimes 
on streets in a town or city, you don’t get ample warning of low-
clearance tunnels or bridges. We were driving through Clarksdale,
Mississippi, looking for the Delta Blues Museum and not paying
attention to other signage, when the road dipped down to go under
a railroad track. The pilot stopped the vehicle on the incline and
the copilot got out to make an assessment. No, our RV wouldn’t
clear the underpass. So the copilot went into the roadway and
directed traffic out of the way to enable the pilot to back the RV to
the last intersection. Fortunately, motorists in Clarksdale were very
polite (and more than a little amused); one helpful citizen gave us
directions to the museum that avoided the in-town railroad track.
 Slip on a pair of yellow sunglasses (sold in ski shops as ski gog-
gles) to combat glare, fog, snow, or headlights when driving after
dark. You can also clip a pair over your regular glasses.
 Scan the road ahead with binoculars. Before changing lanes 
in heavy traffic, the copilot can use binoculars to check out the
road signs ahead. Binoculars are useful when trying to determine
Chapter 7: Dealing with Your RV 71

whether interstate entry/exit ramps require you to be in the right
or left lanes. They also help the copilot read signs at intersections.
 Avoid driving at night. We prefer early morning starts and stop-
ping for the day by midafternoon. This enables us to hit the road
before most vehicles and see what there is to see. After all, why
drive along the spectacular California coast, for example, if you
can’t see it?
 Drive defensively. Other drivers don’t seem to realize that
motorhomes are like big tractor-trailer rigs; they can’t stop on a
dime. So drive a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you in
case you need to slow down or stop unexpectedly. Many other driv-
ers also make the erroneous assumption that RV drivers are elderly
slowpokes, when most of us drive at the prevailing speed limit with
the rest of the traffic. So we’re always half-expecting a driver to pull
out of a side road in front of us, and we’re rarely disappointed on
that account. One rule to follow: If you see a pickup truck waiting at
a side road to pull into traffic, you can count on it pulling out in
front of your RV.
Controlling your speed
Although exceeding the speed limit is never a good idea, doing so can
also be extremely inconvenient for residents of California, Alaska,
Hawaii, Montana, Oregon, Michigan, and Wisconsin — states that aren’t
signatories to the Non-Resident Violators Compact — when traveling
out of state. What that means is that drivers with license plates from
these seven states are subject to having their licenses confiscated and
being required to go to the nearest office of a judge, sheriff, or justice of
the peace to appear before an officer, post bond, and/or pay a fine. If the
official isn’t available, the individual may be jailed until a court appear-
ance can be arranged, which may be several hours later.
Saving Money on Fuel
Fuel conservation is important for all RVers. Cutting down on the amount
of gas you use helps not only your budget but also the environment. What
follows are tips for conserving gas and finding the best fuel prices:
 Consider staying longer in one location. Because we’re so happy
and comfortable in our newer, larger motorhome, we find ourselves
staying longer in each place than we used to. Doing so cuts fuel
costs by reducing the average number of miles driven per day.
Interestingly enough, we get almost the same gas mileage in our 
36-foot motorhome as we did with our old 27-footer.
 Forget the tow-along and walk or bike. We still don’t tow a car —
another fuel savings — but instead enjoy a walk of a mile or two to
the market, a museum, or a restaurant. Other RVers carry bicycles
for short trips from and around the campground.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
72

 Mind and maintain the speed limit. Experts say that observing the
speed limit saves fuel because fuel economy of your vehicle (RV or
car) decreases at higher speeds. Cruise control, for those vehicles
that have this feature, also contributes to fuel savings, because you
maintain a constant speed. Being light-footed with the gas pedal
rather than applying too much throttle also saves gas.
 Keep your air filter clean. Make sure your air filter is checked and
replaced often. U.S. Department of Energy studies claim that a dirty
air filter can raise the consumption of fuel as much as 10 percent.
Keeping your engine tuned and not carrying any extraneous weight
also help, the study points out.
 Take advantage of gas competition. We carry binoculars to check
out posted gas prices along an interstate exit or in the outskirts 
of a town. Always go for the cheaper price, even when doing so
requires turning around. Even in the same area, the prices can vary
a lot; a helpful Web site to find the lowest prices in any area is
www.gasbuddy.com.
 Pay cash when you can. Sometimes the cash price for gas is lower
than if you pay by credit card. If you prefer using a credit card,
watch for stations where prices are the same. If nothing is posted,
ask before filling your tank.
Detecting Gas and Smoke
Remember that you’re most likely driving a vehicle that contains a
propane tank. The propane tank simplifies your daily life by enabling
heating and refrigeration to take place while your RV isn’t hooked up to
a campsite’s power source; however, it also complicates your life
because it’s flammable. Some experts recommend driving with the
propane tank turned off. Many long, highway bridges and tunnels
require the tank to be turned off before entering. You must always turn
off the tank before pulling into a service station to fill up with gas.
Propane gas-leak detectors are mandatory in RVs. Most new RVs come
equipped with them. If you hear the signal, leave the RV, turn off the
propane valve at the tank (reached from an outside door) and leave the
RV open to let the gas escape.
Occasionally your gas-leak detector may go off when you’re cooking
garlic because the odor is similar to the odorant that’s added to propane
to make leak detection easier. If that happens, turn off the burner, and
remove the pan to make sure that this is the source of the alarm; if the
alarm stops, turn off the detector, turn the burner back on, and finish
cooking, but be sure to reactivate the detector after you’re done.
Install a smoke detector in your RV, if you don’t already have one
(they’re mandatory). Always check the gas-leak and smoke detectors
installed in your RV to make sure their batteries are fresh.
Chapter 7: Dealing with Your RV 73

Carbon monoxide detectors also are mandatory in RVs. You want to
inspect your RV regularly to make sure the floor, sidewalls, doors, and
windows have no holes or openings through which toxic fumes can
enter the vehicle while you’re driving. If you find any, seal them up with
silicone adhesive or make repairs before driving again.
Never run the generator while you’re sleeping, and always open one of
the roof vents when using the generator. In roadside rest areas, don’t
park for long periods in the vicinity of any tractor-trailers running their
motors (to keep their refrigeration operating). The carbon monoxide can
seep into your RV. Note: A generator won’t operate when the gas level
falls below one-quarter tank.
Equipping Your RV
Although an RV usually comes fully furnished and ready to go from the
manufacturer, you’ll probably want to pick up a few practical tools and
gadgets. You can usually find these items at camping supply stores or
even, sometimes, at the small convenience stores at campgrounds.
Marching into a specialty store and buying only what’s on the shopping
list is difficult for novices and experts. As you browse through the shelves,
murmuring, “Gee, look at that!” or “I didn’t know there was a gadget like
this,” you start dropping other items into your shopping cart that you
suddenly realize you must have. (For suggestions about optional essen-
tials, see Chapter 4; for kitchen items, see Chapter 8.)
Picking up a basic tool kit and an inexpensive auto tool kit is a practical
way to start. Although we leave major repairs to experienced mechanics,
numerous small jobs can be done easily with the right tools.
Most RVs arrive with a short sewer hose and sometimes (but not always)
a water hose. The thing you’ll notice the first time you hook up is that
both hoses are too short to be really useful in many campgrounds, so
the next items on your shopping list are new longer sewer and water
hoses. Look for a 15- to 20-foot sewer hose with clamp and coupling
devices that enable you to secure it to the campground’s sewer connec-
tion. You want a 25- to 50-foot plastic garden hose, preferably one for
drinking water (rubber hoses leave a taste in the water). Also helpful are
a quick-connect appliance that enables you to make quick, snap-on,
watertight connections with the campsite water connection and a water-
pressure regulator to keep the water pressure balanced between the
campground water supply and your RV.
If you have a big new motorhome with plenty of air-conditioning, your
ideal electrical hookup is 50 amps, but many older campgrounds may
offer nothing higher than 30 amps or, in some state parks, a maximum of
20 amps. You have a clue right away at the campsite if your plug doesn’t
fit the receptacle in the electrical box. What you want are adapters that
convert 50-amp to 30-amp service, and 30-amp to 20-amp service. To
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
74

use a 20-amp outlet with your 50-amp system, you plug the 50-to-30-amp
connector into your main electric shore line, plug the 30-to-20-amp con-
nector into the 50-to-30-amp connector, and then plug everything into
the 20-amp outlet or look for a 50-amp to 20-amp connector. For issues
to keep in mind when dealing with amperages, see the next section,
“Monitoring Electrical Hookups.”
At the campsite, you want your RV to be level for sleeping comfort and for
keeping the refrigerator level — a must. Although many new motorhomes
come equipped with automatic hydraulic levelers installed under the
body, older RVs may require the use of manual levelers, which can be
anything from a couple of pieces of board for each tire to a commercially
produced wood or plastic device. Make sure to evaluate a leveler carefully
before buying it. Some of the plastic ones may not hold the weight of your
RV; some stack-up versions are hard to maneuver the vehicle across. A
spirit level (those little things with moving bubbles inside) laid on a coun-
tertop inside the RV lets you see how level the RV is at the campsite.
For TV lovers, a 50-foot length of antenna cable with male connectors
on each end keeps everyone happy when the campground offers cable
TV hookup. Also take a female connector, because some campgrounds
are so equipped.
In your cabinets, shelf liner in a ridged pattern helps keep items from
sliding while the vehicle is moving; match the color to your countertop
or woodtone, if you want. Tension rods of various lengths also are useful
for installing across your refrigerator or cabinet shelves to keep the
items contained within from shifting. We find Bubble Wrap, an item we
usually get free in shipping boxes, a godsend when packing up glassware
and dishes (see Chapter 4).
Finally, two all-purpose items are a heavy-duty extension cord for out-
door use and duct tape, the wide silver-backed tape (called gaffer’s tape
in the film industry) that can hold just about anything together until you
can get to a repair shop. On our first RV trip, we carelessly left a roof
vent open when picnicking near a Colorado lake during a heavy wind. We
even wondered about a white plastic object that we saw cartwheeling
down the hill . . . until a rain shower came up and rain started coming in.
A hasty retrieval of the plastic vent cover, a trip up the back ladder to
the roof of the RV, and most of a roll of duct tape repaired the damage
and kept out the rain.
Monitoring Electrical Hookups
Many older campgrounds, especially in state parks, may have 20- or 
30- amp electrical hookups when your ideal electrical hookup is 50 amps.
Plus, modern RVs have three-prong plugs requiring adapters for older two-
prong sockets. (See the preceding section, “Equipping Your RV,” for info on
adapters.) You can use the lower amperage so long as you remember not
to run the air-conditioner, microwave, and TV set at the same time. As
Chapter 7: Dealing with Your RV 75

larger RVs with more electrical appliances and conveniences come on
the market, the requirement for additional amperage raises the limits up
to 50 amps. Consequently, many campgrounds have modified some of
their sites to handle this greater need.
The total amperage of all electrical units that you’re using in your RV
shouldn’t exceed the amperage limitation of your campground hookup.
Amperage limitations vary from one campground hookup to another and
are offered at 15, 20, 30, or 50 amps. We include specific limitations in
the campground listings in this book. Manufacturers note amperages
used by their appliances, such as TVs, refrigerators, microwaves, or air
conditioners. Make a list of these and refer to it when in doubt.
If you do exceed the hookup amperage limitation, the power goes off.
That usually isn’t a huge problem if you’re in a campground that’s
equipped with circuit breakers, but some older campgrounds may still
use fuses, and resetting them can be difficult.
To keep from going over the limit, make it your routine to turn off one
appliance before you turn on another. We find that simply turning off the
electric water heater often solves the problem, because it uses an abun-
dance of power. Small appliances, such as toaster ovens, also draw
much more power than you’d expect.
Preparing for Winter Camping
Our first winter camping trip was strictly an accident. Our desert trip
included a swing north to the Grand Canyon, where we experienced an
early snowfall. After a cheerful ranger pointed out a site that still had
water connections along with electricity, we dutifully hooked up for the
night and woke the next morning to find that our hose had turned into a
25-foot-long Popsicle. That explains our first rule in the following list:
 Avoid the big freeze. Don’t connect your water hose to an out-
door faucet overnight when temperatures are expected to fall below
freezing. Instead, use water from the RV’s supply and refill when
necessary. Don’t forget to set your furnace thermostat inside to 
a low temperature, usually around 60°F, to keep onboard water
pipes from freezing, and add antifreeze to holding tanks to keep
drains from freezing.
 Keep charged up. Watch your battery strength. Batteries discharge
quicker as temperatures drop.
 Don’t get buried. Avoid parking under trees, because branches 
can give way under the weight of ice or snow overnight, and don’t
let snow accumulate on the refrigerator’s exhaust area — some
exhaust units are located on the side of the RV, some on the roof
with a protective cover that may be blanketed in heavy snow.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
76

 Heat things up a bit. If you’re spending time in a very cold climate,
you may want to add thermostat-controlled heaters to the freshwa-
ter and holding tanks; RV supply companies sell them.
 Use the right blend of liquid propane (LP). Liquefied petroleum
gas is used for heating, cooking, and refrigeration in RVs. Exhibiting
different characteristics in different temperatures, the liquid is
specifically blended for the climate. If you’re heading for the snow
country from the desert, you should ask the LP dealer if you need
to empty your tank and refill it with LP specifically blended for cold
weather.
 Handle snow with care. If you’re going into snowy or icy weather,
carry chains or have snow tires for your tow car or RV. And drive
with extreme care. Even an experienced RVer finds handling a
motorhome or towing a trailer much trickier in snow and ice. Note:
A heavy motorhome can be difficult to stop on an icy surface.
For recommendations on storing an RV in a cold climate, see the “Storing
Your RV” section, later in this chapter.
Furnishing Your RV
Manufacturers furnish the average Type-A or Type-C motorhome at 
the factory with these built-in features: a kitchen counter and cabinets; 
a cooktop; a refrigerator/freezer; a dinette or free-standing table and
chairs; a sofa or easy chair; a double or queen-size bed (twins are avail-
able on special order); wardrobe and drawer storage; a bathroom with
toilet, sink, and shower; air-conditioning; a heating unit; a TV; and a
microwave. The driver and front passenger seats (pilot and copilot
seats) can swivel around to face into the living area, adding two more
comfortable seats to the arrangement.
Depending on the vehicle size and the manufacturer, the RV may also
contain a swivel and/or reclining chair, an oven, a microwave or convec-
tion oven, a second TV in the bedroom, a shallow tub with shower head
above, a washer/dryer combination, an icemaker in the refrigerator, a
pull-out pantry with wire or wooden shelving, desk/dressing table com-
bination in the bedroom, and a pull-up table adjacent to the sofa or
swivel chair. Some manufacturers add a folding table that stores in its
own bag and goes into place when the living room slideout is opened,
adding more living space. Travel trailers and fifth-wheels contain all
these items except the driver and navigator chairs. In many cases, these
units have more living space and storage areas.
The clever design of RV interiors incorporates more furnishings than
you’d imagine in such small spaces, so all you need to add are decora-
tions. We like to add fresh flowers and pots of herbs for color, small rugs
on top of carpeting or wood floors, covered baskets for both decoration
Chapter 7: Dealing with Your RV 77

and storage in the kitchen/dining area, and additional cushions for color
and comfort on the sofa and the bed. In built-in niches around the cabi-
nets, we added wooden carvings picked up in our travels and anchored
down with putty. Books and magazines brighten up a tabletop, but you
want to remember to stow them and any plants or cut flowers safely
before hitting the road.
Cleaning Your RV
We find keeping the RV as clean as possible day by day while we’re on
the road is easier than going through the equivalent of spring cleaning
every week or two.
Outside the vehicle
Although car owners are accustomed to wielding a hose around in the
driveway or in one of the little wash-it-yourself bays at a car wash, clean-
ing the outside of a motorhome by yourself is akin to bathing an ele-
phant; you can’t do it in your driveway or the average carwash even if
you wanted to. Even a coin-operated carwash with an extra-large bay is
far from satisfactory for us. We run out of quarters or patience long
before the job is done. And most campgrounds don’t allow you to wash
the vehicle at the campsite.
Washing
For a big-time RV wash, which you want to do after it’s been in storage
or slogged through some dusty terrain, look for a truck wash. You’re
most likely to find them along interstate highways adjacent to truck stops.
Simply get in line behind the trucks (if you’re lucky, two or three bays
may be working on a busy day) and ease your way into the wash bay
where an energetic team armed with hoses cleans your RV — soaping,
rinsing, wiping, and waxing (optional) until your home on wheels is
sparkling. For this service, which takes 15 to 30 minutes after you get
into the bay, expect to pay from $30 to $45. You want to be sure that all
the windows and roof vents are closed tightly before you pull into the
washing bay. While the truck wash cleans the outside, you can also put
some of your own elbow grease into cleaning some of the inside —
washing mirrors or polishing the woodwork and cabinetry.
Dusting and debugging
To cut down on costly full-vehicle wash jobs, we found that buying a 
dry dusting mop at the supermarket cuts down the number of washings.
Each evening after hooking up and settling in, do a quick once-over on
the exterior with the dry mop and get the day’s dust and grime off
before overnight dew cakes it. And don’t forget the windshield and the
vehicle’s front end, which need a scrubbing with a wet brush or wind-
shield scrubber to remove the bugs that have accumulated during the
day’s drive. Putting the job off until morning lets them solidify into
something like cement and doubles your job of cleaning.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
78

Waxing
Regardless of whether it’s a motorhome, travel trailer, or fifth-wheel,
waxing an RV is a major job and costly if done professionally. Many
campground and RV supply stores, such as Camping World, offer a
number of waxes and protective materials. The work is up to you. We try
to spread the joy around — doing the front of the vehicle one day, half
the driver’s side a few days later, the rest of the driver’s side more days
later, and so on until after a couple of weeks the vehicle has been com-
pletely covered, and you’re not a physical wreck. But no matter how you
approach the job, it’s one that needs to be done regularly to save the
finish of your exterior. Waxing is much cheaper than a new paint job.
Inside the vehicle
Keeping the interior clean is a matter of tidying up daily. Regular tasks,
such as cleaning the windows and mirrors, can be done when you stop
to fill up with gas; a 50-plus gallon tank takes 10 or 15 minutes to fill.
 Woodwork: Spray-and-polish wood cleaner repels dust and does a
good job of keeping the cabinets and wood furniture looking and
smelling clean.
 Upholstery: Even with modern fabrics that appear comparable to
home interiors, RV upholstery is usually tough and hard to stain.
We find spot-cleaning with a spray rug-and-upholstery cleaner that
comes with a brush attachment does the job well.
 Glass: Windows and mirrors simply need a spray-and-wipe glass
cleaner and a paper towel to be spotless and shiny again in no time.
 Floors: A small, portable vacuum cleaner that can run on recharge-
able batteries is handy for quick cleaning or even heavy-duty clean-
ing in an area as compact as an RV.
Spot-cleaning spills on the carpeting rarely is a problem because
most carpeting in motorhomes is stain-resistant. We put a washable
rug over high-traffic areas, such as the residential entrance, in front
of the sink, beside the bed, and between the sofa and easy chair
when the slideout is open.
 Kitchen: Wiping up kitchen spills when they happen helps keep the
galley clean. We usually clean out the refrigerator when we bring
the RV back home from a week or weekend away, or we clean it
once a week when we’re on the road. We give the sink a quick wipe-
over every evening after doing the dinner dishes.
Holding tanks
Most RVs have two holding tanks — one for gray water (the water 
from the kitchen and bathroom sinks and shower) and one for black
water (the waste from the toilet). Ongoing maintenance of these tanks
requires the use of a liquid or powder, made especially for RV tanks, that
Chapter 7: Dealing with Your RV 79

deodorizes and dissolves solids. RV manufacturers recommend using
biodegradable toilet paper, which breaks up more readily in the tank.
When hooked up to the sewage drain in a campground, keep the black-
water tank outlet closed while the gray-water outlet can remain open.
When the time comes to empty the tanks, close the gray-water tank
outlet to allow water to build up in the tank, and then empty the black-
water tank first. Flush it out at the end with water poured in the toilet.
(We store an empty 1-gallon plastic water jug for this job.) When you’re
finished, close off the black-water valve. Next, run about a gallon of fresh
water into the gray-water tank from the kitchen or bathroom faucets and
then open the gray-water valve. This flushes out the hose as the gray-
water tank empties. Close the valve, unhook the hose, and flush out the
hose again before storing. Wear disposable rubber gloves when handling
the sewage hoses and draining the tanks.
Storing Your RV
Because we live in a city condo, finding an RV storage area is a fact of life
for us. Many of our friends in the suburbs face parking restrictions for
their RVs as well. A smaller unit, such as a folding camping trailer or
truck camper, can be stored in most garages, and a camper van can usu-
ally be kept in the driveway because it resembles a family car. But
motorhomes and trailers often need to be stored somewhere away from
the residence. Our storage fee averages $75 a month for a 36-foot
motorhome. We go out and check the battery and crank up the motor at
least monthly, and take the rig out at least every three months or so.
When storing the vehicle, do the following:
 Clean and defrost the refrigerator. Leave the door open to prevent
mildew and put an open box of baking soda inside.
 Disconnect all electrical devices.
 Empty the holding tanks but leave a bit of water with deodorizer in
the tanks to keep the seals moist. If the seals dry, they may crack
and leak and may have to be replaced.
 Close the propane-tank valve.
 Draw all the shades and close the windshield curtain to keep the
interior cooler when your RV is parked in the sun.
 Lock all doors and outside compartments.
 Fill the battery to the top with distilled water, if you’re going to
store it for a long time.
When putting an RV in storage in a cold climate, you need to drain all
the water tanks, add nontoxic antifreeze, and drain and replenish the
cooling system with water and antifreeze.

Eating on the Road
In This Chapter
 Setting up a galley
 Browsing around for the best local products
 Trying out our quick and easy recipes
O
ne of our favorite things about being on the road in an RV is the
access to great food. We have our choice of fresh fruits and vegeta-
bles from farm stands and farmers’ markets. Some of what we eat, we
pick ourselves, saving even more money. We also carry lists of great
takeout places, and with our own stove and refrigerator, we can pick up
whatever we want to go and reheat it whenever we’re ready to eat.
Stocking Your Kitchen
Because we both enjoy cooking, after so many years of dining out — we
wrote food and travel articles for Bon Appétit magazine for more than
ten years — our permanent equipment includes a food processor, spice
rack, and pots of fresh herbs.
A large, stainless steel stockpot that doubles as a spaghetti pot is the
biggest item in our cookware collection. We also bring several small
French enameled cast-iron skillets and pans, a nonstick sauté pan with
lid, a well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan, several microwave-safe meas-
uring cups and dishes, a small whistling teakettle and an earthenware
teapot that always travels in an old-fashioned, padded tea cozy. For
coffee drinkers, most RV manufacturers offer the option of a built-in
electric coffeepot that fits into a cabinet near the sink.
We also recently added a pressure cooker, which cuts down cooking
time, saving propane. In hot weather or to keep cooking odors outside
when we have a hookup at the campground, we plug a single burner 
hotplate into the outlet near the counter of the outdoor entertainment
center; if we’re cooking something like fried chicken, boiled shrimp, or a
long-simmering stew, we again save on the propane consumption. A slow
cooker that plugs into this outlet or inside the RV lets dinner cook while
the family takes a hike or goes for a swim.

For eating, we have a set of sturdy French bistro plates and soup 
bowls, glass wine glasses, and two ceramic mugs that fit nicely into the
beverage-carrier on the cockpit dash. (See Chapter 4 for tips on packing
breakables.) New dish towels start out as place mats and/or napkins and
then become regular dish towels after a few washings. Preferring to recy-
cle, we try to avoid using disposable paper products.
A large wooden cutting board, padded with a rubberized mat on the
bottom, doubles as a cooktop cover when we’re traveling; the board
keeps the burners from rattling and has a slideout drawer that stores
four sharp knives safely. We store the food processor, electric can
opener, and utensils such as tongs, a funnel, and a long-handled cook-
ing fork in overhead cabinets or in drawers under the cooktop.
On nonskid matting, the same color as our countertop (you can buy it in
hardware stores, camping supply stores, and home-building emporiums),
we put the spice rack, a jar of coarse salt, paper towels on a wooden
spindle, and vacuum-topped canisters to keep dry items, such as cere-
als, chips, and snacks, crisp.
At one time or another, we’ve taken optional appliances, such as a
toaster oven (indispensable if you don’t have a regular oven and handy
if you dislike the bending it takes to light the regular oven), a sorbet
maker (you need a freezer that can be set extra low to use it), and a
bread maker (as handy and easy to use on the road as at home).
We enjoy the surprise on the faces of dinner guests who arrive at the
campground expecting a meal of hot dogs and hamburgers and end up
with a hearty soup or stew, homemade bread, and homemade ice cream.
Eating Takeout Food
We enjoy stopping for takeout food or patronizing campground restau-
rants or cookouts when we’ve had a long day of driving and sightseeing.
That way someone else prepares the meal, we can wear casual clothes
(or even a robe and slippers) and watch TV or listen to CDs while we
eat, and the cleanup is minimal.
Another advantage of takeout is that you can enjoy sampling the food 
of a famous restaurant or cafe, even if it isn’t mealtime or if you ate only
an hour before. Just get the food to go — as many different dishes as
you want to taste — and put it in the refrigerator for a later meal.
We often find, particularly in the South and Midwest where portions are
huge, that a single takeout meal often is enough for both of us, especially
when we add a fresh salad that we make in the RV.
Whenever we face a long day of driving, we find that getting takeout
lunches saves plenty of time over eating in a restaurant or even preparing
our own lunches in the vehicle (and fewer dirty dishes). We especially
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
82

enjoy takeouts, such as clam chowder in Oregon and in Maine, that are
satisfying on a cold day and ready in the time it takes the server to dish
them up.
Shopping for Food
In each of the drives we describe in this book, you find a section called
“Stocking the Pantry,” which suggests everything from local supermar-
ket chains to cheese factories and bakeries as sources from which to
purchase foods.
Checking out the day-old baked goods and bagged surplus fruits and
vegetables in a supermarket, we keep our budget firmly in mind, espe-
cially when we’re on a long trip. A few other tips to keep in mind:
 Buy local produce. Shopping roadside stands and farmers’ markets
not only nets the freshest and cheapest local produce but also gives
you a chance to chat with the locals and perhaps pick up tips on
interesting things to see and do in the area.
 Watch for pick-your-own farms in season. In Chapter 19, we give
you a list of pick-your-own fresh berry places in Minnesota, but you
can find lists of these farms in free brochures available in state
tourist information and welcome centers shortly after you cross
the state lines on major highways.
 Clip coupons locally. Pick up handout newspapers or brochures
(often available as you enter a local supermarket), or read the local
daily to find coupon discounts on groceries. Watch for the “use by”
date at the top. We also carry national coupons from home to use
when we need something on the road.
 Take food from home. When we’re leaving on a trip, we always
take the fresh food and open jars of condiments, such as mayon-
naise and mustard, from our home refrigerator instead of buying
new ones on the road.
Cooking across the U.S.A.
An RV galley has less space than many kitchens (but bigger than the one
we used to have in our New York apartment), so we worked out a bunch
of simple, quick recipes that taste good, don’t dirty many dishes, and
take less than 30 minutes to prepare. Each recipe uses a locally available
product from one of the drives in Chapters 12 through 25. All recipes
serve four unless otherwise noted.
Katharine Hepburn’s Brownies
Gourmet magazine published this easy recipe about ten years ago, and
it’s an appropriate salute to New England and Chapter 12.
Chapter 8: Eating on the Road 83

Preheat oven to 325°F. Butter an 8-inch-square baking pan; then put in
about 1 tablespoon flour and knock each side of the pan against the
counter to make the flour cover the pan in a light dusting. Knock out any
extra flour and discard. In a small heavy saucepan, melt one stick of
butter and two squares of unsweetened chocolate; then remove from
heat. Beat in 1 cup sugar, two eggs, and 1⁄2 teaspoon vanilla until well
mixed. Stir in 1⁄4 cup flour and 1⁄4 teaspoon salt. If desired, add 1 cup
chopped walnuts at this point. Pour into the prepared pan and bake at
325°F for about 40 minutes.
Mac and Cheese
For many, it’s the ultimate comfort food; this quick casserole uses some
of the New York cheddar you find on your drive in Chapter 13.
Preheat oven to 350°F and butter two small ovenproof baking dishes.
Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat and cook 1 cup elbow
macaroni, penne, or rigatoni until a piece of it pulled from the water
with a long fork or spoon is tender to your taste. (Al dente, slightly firm,
is considered perfect.) Drain the pasta and put in a bowl with 1⁄2 cup half-
and-half and 1 cup grated cheddar. Season with a dash of Tabasco, 1
teaspoon of salt, and some freshly ground pepper, and sprinkle with 
2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan. Spoon into the small buttered
dishes and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, until brown and bubbling.
Fried Green Tomatoes
Uncommonly delicious and easy to make, this Southern treat uses toma-
toes that haven’t ripened yet; you can find them at produce stands in
season throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains drive in Chapter 14.
Put a heavy-bottom frying pan on the stove and add 2 tablespoons oil,
butter, or (tastiest of all) leftover bacon fat. Slice three green tomatoes
in 1⁄2-inch-thick slices, dip each slice into cornmeal seasoned with salt,
pepper, cumin, and chili powder, and then fry it in the fat over medium
heat, about three minutes on each side. Serve hot.
Peel-and-Eat Shrimp
You find very inexpensive fresh shrimp in the shell on the Gulf Coast
drive in Chapter 15.
Allow 1 pound of shrimp in the shell for two people. In a large pot, pour
16 ounces of beer per pound of shrimp (you can substitute water for
some or all of the beer if you want), add a small onion cut into fourths,
one clove garlic chopped, juice of half a lemon, eight peppercorns,
and one bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and simmer five min-
utes. Raise heat to high, uncover pan, and add shrimp. When liquid boils
again, stir shrimp, reduce heat, cover pan loosely, so it won’t boil over,
and simmer about three minutes or until the shrimp turn pinky orange.
(It takes longer if the shrimp are big.) Remove from heat, drain shrimp,

and serve in soup bowls with cocktail sauce and melted butter for dip-
ping. For a full meal, make a quick coleslaw out of one packaged
coleslaw mix dressed with mayonnaise and a dash of vinegar to taste,
and warm a loaf of French, Italian, or sourdough bread.
Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies
Peanut butter reminds us of the Deep South where peanuts were first
grown in the United States; that fits the Natchez Trace drive in 
Chapter 16.
From a roll of refrigerated cookie dough (sugar cookies or chocolate
chip are good), scoop out a tablespoonful of dough, roll it into a ball and
fit one into each cup of a mini-muffin tin. Place in a 350°F oven and cook
until puffed and lightly browned, about six minutes. While the cookie
balls are in the oven, unwrap 6 to 12 Reese’s bite-size peanut butter
cups, one for every cookie ball, being sure to remove the crimped brown
paper on the bottom of each candy. When the cookies are done, take
them from the oven and immediately push one of the peanut butter
cups, crimped side down, into each cookie and let them set in the pan
until the cookie part is firm and the chocolate is melting, about five or
ten minutes. Then remove the cookies from the pan, using a table knife if
necessary to loosen them, and let them cool on a rack or plate.
Texas Hill Country Chili Cheese Dip
Ro-Tel tomatoes, canned in Texas, are a snap to find in supermarkets
throughout the Texas Hill Country (Chapter 17).
Open a 10-ounce can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with chilies (note that they
come in several degrees of hotness and with lime and other seasonings
added to some) and dump the whole thing in a small, heavy saucepan.
Add a 6-ounce package of grated cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese
and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the top. Heat at medium tem-
perature on a stovetop burner and stir frequently until the cheese melts
and the mixture starts bubbling. Pour into a serving dish and serve hot
with a big bowl of tortilla chips on the side. If the cheese dip starts to
congeal as it cools, pop it into the microwave for a minute or two to
reheat it. If you have leftovers, store them in the refrigerator and reheat
later in the microwave.
Fresh Corn Pudding
When you tire of fresh corn on the cob, make this easy recipe during
your drive through the farmlands of Ohio in Chapter 18.
Preheat oven to 350°F, and butter a shallow casserole or ovenproof dish.
Take four to six ears of corn, shuck and wash them, and stand them
upright on a large cutting board. Using a large knife and cutting down-
ward from the top of the ear to the bottom, cut off the fresh kernels. Put
the kernels of corn in a bowl along with any milky juice that you can
Chapter 8: Eating on the Road 85

scrape from the cobs. You need 2 cups of corn kernels with juice. In
another bowl, beat together three eggs, 1 cup heavy (or whipping)
cream, and 1⁄3 cup milk. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon sugar, and
the corn. Pour this mixture into the buttered dish and bake for about an
hour or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Yukon Gold potatoes were developed in northern climates like
Minnesota, which we feature in Chapter 19.
Wash four large Yukon Gold potatoes, cut each into four pieces, put in
a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Add four unpeeled garlic cloves
and cook until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Using a potato
masher or ricer, drain and mash the potatoes and garlic. Add 1⁄2 cup
milk, 1⁄4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and whip
with masher or spoon until smooth. Serve immediately.
Fast Apple Tarts
You can pick your own apples at a local orchard or buy some from a
roadside stand in Arkansas or Missouri in the autumn as you’re driving
the route in Chapter 20.
Preheat the oven or toaster oven to 400°F. On a floured board or piece of
wax paper, roll out one thawed piece of puff pastry (1⁄2 pound) from a 
1-pound box of frozen puff pastry until it’s 1⁄8-inch thick. (Pepperidge
Farm is the easiest brand to find in the supermarket freezer.) Cut it into
four squares and transfer to baking sheet. Peel one green or yellow
apple, such as Granny Smith or Golden Delicious, cut it in half length-
wise, then in quarters, and remove the core and seeds. Slice each quar-
ter into very thin slices and overlap them slightly on top of the pastry.
Mix 2 tablespoons sugar with 1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon and sprinkle it over
the apples; then dot them with butter, using about 2 tablespoons alto-
gether. Bake 25 minutes and serve plain or with vanilla ice cream.
Lentil Soup
Most of the dried lentils in the United States come from the northwest-
ern mountains of Washington, Idaho, and western Montana. This dish is
great for a cool day in Buffalo Bill country (Chapter 21).
In a large, heavy soup pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry one
medium onion, chopped, over low heat until it softens, about two to
three minutes. Add three medium carrots peeled and chopped and two
stalks of celery chopped, and cook, stirring, about five minutes longer.
Add 1 cup dried lentils and stir in the pan for about a minute. Raise the
heat to medium high, add 5 cups chicken broth or water, bring to a boil,
and then reduce heat. Cover pan partially and simmer for about 45 to 
50 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. Add more liquid while it’s
cooking, if necessary. Garnish with chopped onions or croutons and
serve hot.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details

Posole (Chicken and Hominy Stew)
This is a variation on a classic stew from New Mexico (Chapter 22).
Pour the contents of a 1-quart carton or can of chicken broth into a
large soup pot and turn the burner to medium or medium-high. While
the soup is heating, chop up 1 pound of boneless, skinless chicken
thighs into bite-size pieces and add them to the soup when it starts to
bubble. Reduce the heat to low and stir in 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon
dried oregano, 2 teaspoons cumin powder, and 1 tablespoon (or more,
if you like spicy foods) of ground red chili or chili powder. Let it
simmer for about ten minutes. Open two 16-ounce cans of hominy,
either white or golden or one of each. Drain the hominy and put it into
the soup, stirring so that it mixes in nicely. Continue to simmer another
ten minutes or longer if you need to do something else in the meantime
(like preparing the garnishes). Serve it in soup bowls with little dishes of
garnishes to sprinkle on top. Choose several or use all the following:
fresh limes cut into wedges, chopped fresh cilantro, diced ripe avo-
cado, tortilla chips, sliced raw radishes, thinly sliced raw cabbage
(either red or white) or lettuce (iceberg or romaine works best),
grated cheddar cheese, and chopped green onions.
Easy Salmon in White Wine
You can use any fresh fish steaks or filets you find on the Oregon coast
in this dish; see the names of fish dealers in Chapter 23.
Butter a glass pie plate or microwave-proof casserole dish (nonmetal)
and put two salmon steaks or one salmon filet (about 12–16 ounces) in
the dish. Put 2 tablespoons of dry white wine (or water) over it, put
little dots of butter, 1 tablespoon or so altogether, on top of the salmon,
and put on a little fresh chopped parsley (if you have it), along with a
sprinkle of salt and pepper. Cover the dish with microwavable plastic
wrap or its own lid and cook five minutes at high with the microwave
turntable running. If you don’t have a turntable, then open the microwave
once every minute to turn the salmon around a quarter-turn, and then
turn the microwave back on and continue; do this three times while it’s
cooking. When the five minutes is up, take the dish, still covered, from
the microwave and let it rest on a heatproof surface for another three
minutes before uncovering it. Serve at once.
Quick Enchiladas
Southern California may not have invented enchiladas, but it embraces
them warmly. Here’s a quick, easy version for the drive in Chapter 24.
Oil or butter an ovenproof casserole (about 8 inches square). Preheat
the oven or toaster oven to 375°F. Open one package of corn tortillas,
remove them one at a time, and cook them briefly (about 10 seconds) on
each side over medium-high heat in a small frying pan with 2 tablespoons
of vegetable oil. As you remove each tortilla, put a stick of natural (not
Chapter 8: Eating on the Road 87

processed) cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or pepper cheese), 1-inch
thick and 5 to 6 inches long, in the middle of the tortilla. Roll up the 
tortilla and fit it into the greased pan. Repeat this until you use as many
tortillas as you need, allowing two to three enchiladas for each person.
Then open a 10-ounce can of enchilada sauce and pour it over the top
of the stuffed tortillas, making sure that you get them all covered. Cook
in oven about 25 to 30 minutes, until sauce is bubbling. Serve at once.
Route 66 Breakfast Casserole
This dish is made the night before and put in the refrigerator, so all you
do in the morning is bake it and eat it. Try it one morning before you get
your kicks on Route 66 (Chapter 25).
Butter a 7-x-11-inch ovenproof casserole and line the bottom with six
slices of buttered bread. Sprinkle with 21⁄2 cups grated cheddar or
Monterey Jack cheese (from a package if you want) and 1 cup chopped
ham if you have some on hand. If not, leave it out. Beat six eggs in a
large bowl, and then add 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, a sprinkle of pepper, and a
dash each of Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce. Beat in 2 cups of milk.
Then carefully pour the mixture over the bread and cheese in the casse-
role, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate it overnight. In the morn-
ing, preheat the oven to 350°F, unwrap the casserole, and bake it 45
minutes or until eggs are set and casserole is beginning to brown on top.
Remove from oven and let stand for ten minutes before serving.

chapter, which tells you everything that you need to know.

Understanding Our Campground
Recommendations
In each driving chapter of this book, we give you two campground lists —
our favorite campgrounds and runner-up campgrounds. The camp-
grounds that are among our personal favorites tend to be ones with a
quiet ambience and natural surroundings, which we prefer to fancier
campgrounds that offer organized activities, such as square-dancing,
pancake breakfasts, swimming pools, and whirlpool spas.
Every camper has different priorities. Sometimes location is the most
important aspect (for example, when you want to be first in line the next
morning for a popular museum or attraction and therefore want to be as
close as possible to that place). At other times you want to get away for
a few days and hear nothing but birdsong, and you couldn’t care less
whether the proprietors are fixing a pancake breakfast the next morning.
At other times, you may want a miniature golf course, a heated spa, and
some square-dancing on Saturday nights.

Whereas the campsites listed as our favorite campgrounds may be long
on scenery and space but short on amenities or even campsite connec-
tions for electricity, water, and sewage, some of the runner-up camp-
grounds may be more elegant and highly rated. You find some of each
type of campground in the driving chapters later in this book.
To help you narrow down your campground choices, use the Choosing
Your Campground worksheet at the back of this book.
Using Campground Directories
Although we don’t always agree with their ratings, we find the big camp-
ground directories invaluable when traveling, particularly when we’re
making one-night stops and need to stay a place just long enough to eat
dinner and sleep. Being able to call ahead for reservations also is help-
ful, so having a cellphone comes in handy. Careful reading of a camp-
ground entry also can tell you the site width (important if you have an
awning or slideout), what electrical power you can expect, whether pull-
throughs are available, whether you can cool off under shade trees,
whether the campground is open year-round or seasonally, and whether
a dump station is on the premises. For tips on using directories to select
a site, see the “Choosing a site unseen” sidebar, below.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
90
Choosing a site unseen
If you’re picking out a campsite sight unseen from one of the voluminous park direc-
tories, here are some tips we’ve found useful through the years:
 Remember that ratings reflect the extras a campground offers, from playgrounds
to clubhouses to cafes on the premises. If these aren’t important to you, pay more
attention to the size, especially the width, of the sites and whether grass and trees
are mentioned. New ratings reflect access to Internet and phone jacks at the
campsite.
 Campgrounds with playgrounds, swimming pools, lakes, fishing, and game
rooms attract families with children. If you want to avoid families, look for simpler
surroundings.
 If you’re a light sleeper, study the directions to the park from the interstate care-
fully. “Convenient” or “EZ-on-and-off” can be code words for “beside the inter-
state.” Some RV parks are what we call three-point campgrounds — near enough
to hear the trucks on the interstate, the planes taking off and landing at the airport,
and post-midnight freight trains that sound loud whistles at rail crossings.
 Read between the lines. If a park has a large number of sites but only a few are
available, it usually means that plenty of year-round residents commute to daily
jobs, destroying some of the vacation atmosphere.

Directories also tell you whether a campground is privately owned or
public. Calling ahead for reservations and specific information at private
campgrounds is easy because charts and computer records of empty
and occupied sites are kept up to date. In public campgrounds, rangers
may be too busy to tell you anything beyond whether the campground is
full yet. Even if it isn’t full, don’t expect them to hold a site until you
arrive, because most public campgrounds don’t accept reservations.
Campers obtain sites on a first-come, first-served basis.
For a list of recommended campground directories, see the Appendix.
Comparing Private and Public Campgrounds
Privately owned campgrounds are convenient, offer full hookups, take
advance reservations, and have staff on duty during business hours. On
the downside, they sometimes offer narrow sites as close as 15 to 20 feet
apart and often are set up in a parking lot configuration, which usually
gives you a level setup and well-located hookups but no grass or shade.
We prefer finding private campgrounds that are members of a large
national group, such as KOA or Good Sam because they’re required to
meet certain standards of upkeep to retain their membership and
because they play host to traveling vacationers rather than full-time resi-
dents. See Chapter 1 for information about becoming a member with
these chains to obtain discounts.
Another kind of privately owned campground offers sites that are indi-
vidually owned, but like timeshare condos, they can be rented out when
owners don’t need them. These campgrounds may ban certain types of
motorhomes or trailers; they all ban tents.
When you buy a membership in a timeshare campground, you join a 
network of campgrounds where you can stay for a couple of dollars per
night. Although this deal may sound like a good one, the membership
fees usually are between $2,500 and $5,000 (plus an annual maintenance
fee), so you need to compute how many nights you plan to spend in
campgrounds during the next few years at an average of $20 or so a
night. The fee may equal 500 or more nights, which is perhaps more than
you think you can use. You also may want to consider whether that mem-
bership chain has enough campgrounds to keep you happy for those 500
nights, and whether they’re even located where you want to stay.
Some private campground owners go to plenty of trouble to create
attractive campsites with terraces, privacy plantings, and extras from
level concrete pads to small personal storage sheds on each site. An out-
standing example of lavish camping is the superdeluxe site at Buffalo KOA
in Buffalo, Wyoming (see Chapter 21). Campers who opt for the $82-per-
night price get a private hot tub, fenced site with gazebo, patio table, built-
in propane barbecue grill, glass and wrought-iron patio table with chairs,
planters full of bright petunias, and an abundance of trees and shrubs.
Chapter 9: Sleeping on the Road 91

But in general terms, if you’re looking for scenery and privacy, you often
find much prettier and larger campsites at the public campgrounds in
national forests or state parks, and even in some (but not all) national
parks. What you won’t always find are hookups or the ability to make
reservations.
Among our favorite public campgrounds is City of Rocks State Park in
southern New Mexico (Chapter 22), where gigantic boulders surround
sites that are far from each other and provide privacy. In Arkansas’s
Jacksonport State Park (Chapter 20), the sites are near a river and are
wide and grassy with mature shade trees. Oregon’s Sunset Bay State
Park is on the ocean with beachcombing, hiking trails, and a colorful
lighthouse nearby (Chapter 23). All three of these state parks also pro-
vide hookups.
Some of the most crowded campgrounds in the United States are in
national parks — Yellowstone, for example. During peak season, you
may want to stay in a private campground near a popular national park
rather than in the park itself.
Choosing a Site
When we first started RVing, we wanted only perfect sites, secluded
from other campers, surrounded by shade trees, preferably at the end of
a row facing a view. The site had to be level — you’d be surprised how
few sites outside paved parking lot campgrounds are really level — with
a nice picnic table and fire pit or barbecue. These characteristics still
are ideals to aspire to, but we had to get real. If we were the last RV to
pull into the only campground with a vacancy sign at Mount Rushmore
National Memorial at twilight on the Fourth of July weekend, we took
what was left and learned to like it.
When site selection is abundant, we have a long list of preferences, all
beginning with L:
 Large: The site must be big enough to park (and drive through or
back in) our 36-foot motorhome and still have space for slideouts
(portions of the living and/or bedroom walls open up to expand the
interior), chairs, table, and charcoal grill.
 Latitude: The width of a site becomes more important now that so
many RVs of all types offer one or more slideouts. Some older
campgrounds can’t handle slideouts and say so in their directory
listings. Others have room for the slideout but no leftover space for
you to use as a recreational area.
Any campsite less than 15 feet wide limits comfortable use of the
site for durations longer than overnight.
 Length: The umbilical cords from the vehicle to the electric, water,
and sewer connections must reach comfortably.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
92

 Level: Whenever you don’t have a big new RV with hydraulic jacks
that level automatically, you have to do plenty of running back and
forth inside and outside the vehicle to check spirit levels (those
little things with moving bubbles inside); sometimes you have to
wedge wooden blocks under the tires until that pesky little bubble
hits the center. (What happens if your RV isn’t level? Something
dire and expensive befalls the refrigerator’s hardware.)
 Location: We want to be away from the highway and campground
entrance and not too near the swimming pool, bath facilities, office,
laundry, dumpster, playground, or dog-walking area.
 Lookout: Watch for potentially noisy neighbors, any low-hanging
branches or wires that can damage roof air conditioners or TV
antennas, or wet or marshy ground that can mire you down if it
rains all night. In addition, check the location of trees that can
block opening slideouts or awnings, or interfere with reception if
you have a satellite TV.
A campsite may or may not contain a picnic table, grill, or fire ring (a fire
pit encircled by rocks) — all critical amenities for tent campers but luxu-
ries for RVers, who already have a table, chairs, and cooktop inside their
vehicle.
If you’re going to stay in one campground for a while, look for an end
site with hookups on the left side of the site. That means your door, fold-
ing chairs, and picnic table can face open space, perhaps even a view,
rather than the RV next door and its hookups.
If you have no choice but to make your rig the meat in an RV sandwich,
consider this: Unlike tent camping, where campers spend all their
waking hours outdoors, RVs, especially motorhomes and trailers, enable
you to go indoors for privacy. Even when you’re parked only a foot or
two away from the neighboring RV, you can close your curtains, draw
the shades around your windshield, turn on some soft music, and you’re
totally alone.
Parking Your Rig
Choosing the spot to put the RV overnight requires looking for the most
level area and lining up the hookups in your vehicle with their connec-
tions on the site. If you have a back-in site, ask your copilot (if you have
one) to get out and help back you in. If you have a pull-through, pull 
into the center of the site. In either case, make sure to leave room for 
the opening of slideouts and awnings. Your exact position depends on
your hookups, however, which are accessible from the left rear of the
vehicle. The electrical connection is usually a metal box mounted on a
small post, with the water connection on the same post or nearby and
the sewer connection somewhere in the general vicinity. You may have
to get out of the vehicle to pinpoint the sewer connection because it’s
Chapter 9: Sleeping on the Road 93

usually a small hole in the ground covered with a white plastic cap that
may or may not have a cemented area around it.
Occasionally, in older campgrounds, you may find side-by-side connec-
tions where two campsites share the same basic connections, with two
water faucets, two electrical connections, and two sewer holes in the
same area. Because all RVs hook up from their left rear, this means you
and the neighboring RV would park facing opposite directions.
After you’re in the position you want, level the vehicle by using your
built-in hydraulic system or blocks under the tires to achieve a level
state. This is essential not only for your comfort and convenience but
also for proper functioning of your refrigerator.
Hooking Up
First-time RVers may have some fears about the process of hooking up
when coming into a campground, but after a few times, you settle into a
routine like this: Park and level your vehicle (see the preceding section),
and hook up.
You want a pair of work gloves and, for the sewer connections, dispos-
able rubber gloves.
Here’s a blow-by-blow account of what to do:
1. Plug in your electrical shore cord to the campground outlet,
which is in the metal box affixed to a post and usually located at
the left rear of the site.
Your RV’s shore cord is the external electrical cord that connects
the vehicle to a campground electrical hookup. Inside the box, 
you may have several connector choices, which can range from 
20- to 50-amp.
Most outlets have an on/off switch that needs to be turned to the
off position before plugging or unplugging your line. Turning the
switch off prevents a surge that can knock out a circuit breaker in
the vehicle.
If your shore cord fits into one of the outlets, you won’t need to use
an adapter. If the shore cord doesn’t fit, then you need the proper
adapter for your unit (see Chapter 7). You’ll soon learn to recognize
the amperage of an outlet on sight.
2. After you’re plugged in properly, turn on the switch to the camp-
ground outlet.
A good check to see whether you have electrical service is the
timer light on your microwave, which lights up and perhaps even
starts blinking a series of 8s if you have electricity.

Chapter 9: Sleeping on the Road 95
Campground etiquette
In the popular RVing magazines, a large proportion of the letters deal with other
campers who failed to show what the writer believes is proper etiquette in a camp-
ground. Bad behavior ranges from failing to clean up after your pet to running your
generator after hours. To prevent you from becoming the subject of one of these let-
ters, here are ten good rules to follow:
 No claim jumping. Anything marking a campsite, from a jug of water on a picnic
table to a folding chair set out in the parking space, means that the site is occu-
pied and the campers are temporarily away in their car or RV. You may not set the
marker aside and move into the site.
 Mind your fellow campers’ personal space. Teach your kids never to take a short-
cut across an occupied campsite, but to use the road or established pathways to
get where they’re going. No one wants to watch a parade of kids and a dog troop
through his site.
 Keep your pets from roaming. Never let your dog roam free in a campground. Pets
should always be on a leash when outside of the RV and exercised in a desig-
nated pet area.
 Avoid using your generator whenever possible, even within designated gener-
ator-use hours, to keep from disturbing other campers with the noise and fumes.
If using electrical appliances, such as microwaves and TVs, is that important, you
should probably consider staying in a private campground with hookups where
you won’t ever need a generator.
 Avoid loud and prolonged engine revving in the early morning and late evening
hours. Fumes from your engine can easily go into the open windows of a nearby
RV, and the noise can wake someone who planned to sleep in.
 Don’t play radios or TVs loudly any time in a campground. Many of your fellow
campers are there for the peace and quiet. If you have to catch the latest episode
of your favorite show, make sure everyone else doesn’t have to hear it, too!
 Never, ever dump wastewater from holding tanks, even gray water, on the
ground. Although some claim it’s good for the grass, wastewater may contain fecal
matter from diapers or salmonella bacteria if raw chicken has been rinsed in the
sink. This material can be transferred to anyone touching or stepping on contam-
inated ground. Gray water, like black water, belongs only in a dump station.
 Do not cut trees for firewood. Most campgrounds sell firewood at stands or the
camp store. Even picking up or chopping dead wood is forbidden in many parks.
 Watch what you throw in the fire. Never leave aluminum foil, aluminum cans, bot-
tles, or filter-tipped cigarette butts in a campground fire ring or grill. They do not
burn but remain as litter. And never crush out cigarettes on the ground without
picking up the butts and putting them in the garbage.
 Don’t leave porch or entry lights on all night in camp. The lights may shine in
someone else’s bedroom window.

3. If you have an automatic switchover from propane to electric on
your refrigerator (which most RVs do), check the dials on the
refrigerator door to make sure the refrigerator has switched
from LP to AC.
Now your electricity is connected and should be working properly.
4. Connect your RV’s water hose, which is connected to your water
intake, to the campground faucet.
Using a water-pressure regulator (see Chapter 7) attached at one
end of the hose is wise because many campgrounds have strong
water pressure.
5. Next comes the part most novice RVers dread, although it’s as
simple as the other two connections: Connect your sewer hose to
your drain outlet and to the campground sewer pipe.
We suggest that you drain any fluid stored in the tanks when you
hook up rather than the next morning when you’re in a hurry to get
rolling. (If you stay several days, you drain the sewer tank both
when hooking up and when unhooking.) Drain the black-water tank
first, close off that valve (they’re labeled), and then open the gray-
water tank valve. This helps flush the hose while emptying the tank.
You can leave this valve open while camping, but you shouldn’t
leave the black-water valve open because solids that settle in the
tank are hard to clean out later. (For our tips on emptying the hold-
ing tanks, see Chapter 7.)
6. You’re finished: Relax with a cold soft drink, beer, or martini.
Sleeping by the Side of the Road: 
A Good Idea?
Although more than half the states permit some overnight parking in
highway rest areas except where posted, we wouldn’t consider parking
our RV overnight in a rest area, in a shopping mall parking lot, at a truck
stop, or by the side of the road except in an emergency, because so
many violent incidents occur in these areas. Some of our friends fre-
quently do, however, and they consider us money-wasting wimps for
insisting on overnighting at a secure private or public campground.
We’re amazed at how many owners of expensive motorhomes take the
risk of sleeping free in a parking lot or by the side of the road when the
cost of their vehicle advertises how much in cash, credit cards, and expen-
sive electronics may be inside. All this to save a few bucks? Campground
fees are a modest investment in security and peace of mind.

 Meeting up with other RVers with similar interests
W
hen we say RVing is for everybody, we mean it. No other form of
travel adjusts so readily to any sort of special need.
RVing with Kids
RV vacations are family friendly in the extreme. We can start with the
usual reasons: RVing is a cheap and convenient way of taking the whole
family on vacation. In most cases, having the kitchen and bathroom with
you makes the “I’m hungry” and “I have to go potty” whines easier to
deal with, and traveling together comfortably as a family fosters close-
ness and communication. The simple truth is that kids love RVing and
camping.
Veterans of family RV travel suggest involving children in the planning
stages, rotating seats in the car or RV en route to the campsite, and
assigning regular duties at the campsite. Older children can be responsi-
ble for packing certain items for the trip and handling last-minute duties
at home, such as locking doors and windows or removing perishable
food from the refrigerator.
Even infants can go camping happily. Experts recommend carrying a
toddler in a backpack carrier and an infant in a frontpack carrier — both
are made specifically for hiking. Bring along a folding stroller and playpen,
mosquito netting, and a baby guardrail for the bed to use while in camp.
A baby seat that clamps to a picnic table also enables a small child to
join the rest of the family at meals.

Packing sunscreen to protect children’s delicate skin is essential, and so
is bringing along a gentle insect repellant.

 Family Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com) offers
travel tips and reviews of family-friendly destinations, vacation
deals, and campgrounds.

an online magazine and advice on camping, cruising, and journey-
ing domestically or abroad with kids.
For information on traveling with other families, see the listings under
“RV clubs,” later in this chapter.
RVing with Pets
As you travel, you meet many RV owners who favor their particular
brand of travel because they can take their pets along with them. The
Travel Industry Association of America (TIAA) says 6 percent of all trav-
eling dog owners take their pets with them on vacation, while only 1 per-
cent of cat owners do. We’re willing to bet that some 50 percent of all
traveling dog owners (and probably 25 percent or more of cat owners)
take their pets along on their RV vacations.
Always check campground information in advance to make sure that
pets are permitted. Some campgrounds assess a surcharge; a few exer-
cise pet restrictions, which means they decide on an individual basis, per-
haps based on the pet’s breed or size. When in doubt, telephone ahead
and ask.
Although a few campgrounds have fenced dog runs where pets can frolic
off the leash, almost all require dogs to be on leashes in the campground
at all times. Owners also are required to clean up after their pets at all
times. Some campgrounds even provide dispensers of cleanup plastic
bags at the dog runs and receptacles for the used bags on-site.
Otherwise, carry your own cleanup bags and dispose of them properly.
Dogs never should be left alone in an RV at the campground or tied up
outside the RV while the owners are away. Never leave the pet in the RV
for more than 10 or 20 minutes in mild weather when running an errand,
and don’t shut them up at all when temperatures are hot.
The following tips can help you and Fido have an enjoyable RV trip:
 Feed pets at night. Feed pets after you’re finished driving for the
day, especially if they’re susceptible to motion sickness.
 Give pets water only during the day. Give your pets bottled water,
which you need to introduce at home in advance of the trip. As is
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
98

true with humans, we suggest using bottled water because mineral
content in water changes from one campground to the next. A 
contented tummy is something that you want to have with a travel-
ing pet.
 Bring familiar toys and bedding for the pet. Like security blan-
kets, objects from home can comfort your pet on the road.
 Help your pet become accustomed to the RV. If you have access to
the RV in advance of the trip, spend some time in it with the pet.
 Keep the cat’s litter box in the shower or tub. Encase the litter box
inside a 30-gallon plastic trash bag. Put the bottom of the box in the
trash bag, dump a 10-pound bag of cat box filler inside the box, and
snap on the litter box cover. You may also want to carry a folding
cat cage so your pet can enjoy the outdoors at the campground.
 Carry a couple of small washable throw rugs. Putting a small rug
over the RV carpeting can protect it from little cat or dog feet.
Debate continues as to whether pets are safer when kept in or out of a
kennel crate while in a moving RV. Defenders of the crate (many of them
professional dog handlers who travel to and from shows in RVs) say the
pet and the driver are safer with the animal confined while the vehicle is
in motion. On the other hand, people who favor freeing up a pet during
the ride claim that it enables the animal to better protect itself from injury.
A good online resource for information about traveling with your pet 
is www.petswelcome.com, which also dispenses medical tips and lists
the names of animal-friendly lodgings and campgrounds, kennels, and
veterinarians.
RVing for People with Disabilities
Recreational vehicles, especially motorhomes, can be made as accessi-
ble and comfortable for the physically challenged — especially those in
wheelchairs — as any home. Mechanical seat lifts, either installed at the
factory or retrofitted into existing units, can be added to motorhomes
for people who have trouble climbing steps. Wider doors, raised toilets,
roll-in showers, roll-under sinks, lower kitchen counters and cabinets,
and a permanent place to lock in the wheelchair while the RV is in motion
all are special options that can be installed at the factory or added later.
More campgrounds now offer handicap-accessible campsites with wide
level-paved sites to accommodate wheelchairs, walkers, or electric
scooters. They have also improved access to public toilets and showers
by installing ramps and handrails.
Not only can wheelchair travelers adjust well to RVs, but many other
handicapped travelers — from those on dialysis to people requiring a
constant supply of oxygen — also find much more comfort and security
Chapter 10: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 99

in a specially equipped motorhome than they do in an automobile,
plane, or train.
Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA; % 703-620-6003) pub-
lishes a directory with information about RV accessibility for travelers
with disabilities. Another valuable resource is the Society for Accessible
Travel & Hospitality (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org), which offers a
wealth of travel resources for people with all types of disabilities and
informed recommendations on destinations, access guides, and compan-
ion services. Annual membership fees are $45 for adults and $30 for sen-
iors and students.
For information on RVing with other travelers with disabilities, see the
listings for Good Sam Club and Handicapped Travel Club under “RV
clubs,” later in this chapter.
RVing for Seniors
For anybody who has ever been in a campground, “RVing for Seniors” is
redundant, because it appears that seniors make up at least half of the
RVing public. But for anyone nearing retirement age who’s thinking
about taking up RVing for the first time, we say, “Go for it!”
We’ve heard stories about couples who worked years saving for their
retirement, planning to buy an RV and travel full time, only to have one
of the pair fall ill and die. In a surprising number of cases, the surviving
spouse went ahead with the plans — often against the advice of other
family members — and not only managed but thrived.
Some smaller, residential-style RV parks advertise as “for seniors only”
or “for over 55.” Seniors who want to avoid children (except visiting
grandchildren) for a long stay can count on peace and quiet in these
places. But as transient RVers, moving every few days, we enjoy staying
in campgrounds with mixed ages, couples, and families with children.
Senior discounts on attractions and activities are becoming more
common all the time; always ask about senior discounts. We’ve even
found supermarkets in the Sunbelt that give senior discounts on grocery
or wine purchases on designated days.
The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) has replaced the Golden Age
Passport with the America the Beautiful Pass–National Parks and
Federal Recreational Lands Pass–Senior Pass that gives seniors ages 
62 and older lifetime entrance to national parks in the U.S. for a one-time
processing fee of $10. You can purchase these passports at any NPS facil-
ity that charges an entrance fee. Besides free entry, the passport also
comes with a 50 percent discount on federal-use fees charged for camp-
ing, swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours. For more informa-
tion, go to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.

AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), 601 E St.
NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277; www.aarp.org), offers
members travel information and a wide range of discounts and benefits,
including AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone 50 or
older can join.
For information on educational RV trips with other seniors, see the list-
ing for RV Elderhostel under “RV clubs,” later in this chapter.
Joining an RV Club
Although every campground is a place to find new friends when you stay
more than a day or two, many travelers want to find and stay in touch
with others who share the same interests. Joining an RV travel club
enables travelers to do just that. The sociability of this type of travel
attracts some, particularly singles who may otherwise feel like wallflow-
ers in a campground full of couples. Others find comfort in traveling to
new places in organized groups, particularly if the destination is a for-
eign country, such as Mexico, where the language and customs may be
unfamiliar.
Caravan tours and rallies
RVers who prefer to travel or camp with a group can join up with any
number of like-minded people for a paid vacation tour in their own rigs
rather than a tour bus. These caravans are the RV equivalent of a group
tour with structured itineraries, sightseeing, communal meals, and many
group social functions. RVers can also attend rallies, friendly get-togeth-
ers with other owners of the same brand of RV.
Popular caravan destinations include Mexico, Alaska, and New England
at autumn foliage time. To find out about caravan and club tours, read
general monthly RV publications such as Trailer Life and MotorHome,
available through subscription or from most magazine racks; Highways
(for Good Sam Club members); or other club or RV manufacturing-
company publications. For details about these publications, see the
Appendix. Some popular caravan groups include the following:

RV clubs
Many types of RV clubs offer membership to everyone from people who
drive certain brand-name RVs or manufacturers (you automatically get
mail about these if you buy a new RV from a manufacturer that has a
club or association) to associations such as Good Sam that also sell RV
services and promote membership campgrounds. Within Good Sam, you
find subdivision clubs for families with children, retired military, singles,
ham radio operators, and so on.
The following are some of the specialized RV clubs and associations that
aren’t affiliated with manufacturers:
 Baby Boomers, P.O. Box 23, Stoneham, CO 80754: For RV enthusi-
asts born between 1940 and 1960.
 Family Motor Coach Association, 8291 Clough Pike, Cincinnati, OH
45244 (% 800-543-3622 or 513-474-3622; www.fmca.com): Members
number around 170,000 families, each with its own ID number. The
group provides a handsome monthly magazine and other benefits,
including insurance. Costs are $35 for a family, including initiation
fee and first-year dues.
 Good Sam Club, 2575 Vista del Mar Dr., Ventura, CA 93001-3920 
(% 800-234-3450; www.goodsamclub.com): A broad-range club
with insurance, campground affiliates, financing, and other services.
Members number nearly a million, and the club also has special-
interest chapters for hobbyists, computer aficionados, singles, the
deaf, and others.
 Handicapped Travel Club, 604 Twilight St., Placentia, CA 92850 
(% 714-524-2700; www.handicappedtravelclub.com): For indi-
viduals with disabilities who enjoy traveling and camping; also wel-
comes persons without disabilities. For membership requirements,
send them a self-addressed, stamped, long-form envelope with first-
class postage.
 Loners on Wheels, P.O. Box 1060-WB, Cape Girardeau, MO 63702
(% 866-569-2582; www.lonersonwheels.com): Loners on Wheels is
a club for single RVers, numbering around 3,000 widowed, divorced,
or never-married members. Call for a sample newsletter.

 Finding the best maps
 Making connections — cable TV, computers, and more
 Insuring your RV
 Taking necessary precautions
 Packing a lethal weapon
S
o you’re ready to hit the road in your RV. But before you lock the
door behind you, wait a minute: Do you need to know anything else?
You definitely need maps and RV insurance. You may or may not opt 
to carry a cellphone, cable or satellite TV connections, a firearm, or a
computer — details on all of these follow.
Mapping the Way
We love maps. We pore over them the way fashionistas devour every
page of Vogue or bikers glue themselves to the latest Cycle World. Every
U.S. map we own shows somewhere we’ve been or plan to visit someday.
When we were young, back in the days before you filled your own gas
tanks and washed your own windshield, your friendly service station
owner not only filled your tank, checked your oil, and cleaned your
windshield, but also gave you a state map for free. You still can find
maps in service stations today, but you have to pay for them.
The best places to get free road maps these days are at tourist infor-
mation welcome centers as you enter different states. The offices are
usually located on main highways or interstates. If state maps aren’t
prominently displayed on the counter or in racks, ask someone behind
the desk for one. Besides official state road maps, these centers display
rack after rack of local, regional, and city maps, some of them pinpoint-
ing landmarks and other major attractions.
We always carry at least one U.S. road atlas, choosing from the many
bound collections containing all 50 U.S. states. Although most maps look

the same on the surface, each has certain features that are useful to RV
travelers.
 American Automobile Association (AAA) Truck and RV Road
Atlas (% 877-222-2665; www.aaa.com) features regulatory informa-
tion for big vehicles for each state, state fuel-tax rates, low-clearance
highways, route size and weight restrictions, and 1,900 truck stop
listings.
 Good Sam Club Road Atlas, 2575 Vista del Mar Dr., Ventura, CA
93001 (% 800-234-3450; www.goodsamclub.com), has icons on its
state maps designating the locations of Good Sam campgrounds
and repair facilities.
 National Geographic, The American Road Atlas & Travel
Planner, P.O. Box 98198, Washington, DC 20090 (% 888-225-5647;
www.nationalgeographic.com), highlights scenic attractions.
One version comes with a convenient spiral binding so the pages
lie flat when you’re using them.
 Rand McNally Road Atlas, P.O. Box 654, Skokie, IL 60676 (% 800-
333-0136; www.randmcnally.com), is updated annually with each
issue containing some 4,500 changes, so we find ourselves buying
the new edition every year. Rand McNally also issues a large-scale
road atlas that we particularly like because the larger print is much
easier to read in a moving vehicle.
Real road techies may also want to invest in a global positioning system
(GPS) receiver and high-tech navigation software, which promises that
you won’t get lost — at least you won’t most of the time. To us, these
tech toys take all the fun out of reading a map, but gadget fans may
enjoy them. A few good dealers who have units designated for RVs
include the following:
 Garmin International, 1200 E. 151st St., Olathe, KS 66062 (% 800-
800-1020; www.garmin.com)
 Magellan Corporation, 960 Overland Court, San Dimas, CA 91773
(% 800-669-4477; www.magellangps.com)
 Weems & Plath, 222 Severn Ave., Annapolis, MD 21403 (% 800-638-
0428; www.weems-plath.com)
Staying Connected on the Road
If you’re one of those people who likes to know what’s happening all the
time, you don’t have to lose touch on the road. With cable and satellite
TV, cellphones, and Internet connections, you can continue to watch
your favorite shows, call your friends, and even conduct business.
Part II: Ironing Out the Details 
104

Cable TV
Many private RV parks offer cable TV connections as an option, some-
times with a dollar or two added to the nightly fee. If you don’t have a
built-in exterior cable connection, you can use a length of coaxial cable
hooked to the campground connection at one end, and then route it
through a window to your RV’s TV set. Carrying your own cable is best,
though, because campgrounds rarely provide them. Don’t forget to turn
off the switch to your roof antenna. (Look for a little red light by the
switch that tells you when it’s on.) Having a male and female connector
is wise because campground cable connections often vary.
Satellite TV
Many newer RVs now have satellite dishes mounted to the roofs of the
vehicles with internal wiring that leads to a control box that’s usually
installed near the TV set. Software for whatever program system you use
usually is included with the package. The two major systems are DISH
Network and DIRECTV. One disadvantage of the mounted dish is that in
many campgrounds, trees always seem to be in the path of the satellite
signal, requiring you to move the vehicle to make a connection. Mention
whether you have such a system when checking in so the registrar can
assign you a tree-free site, if one’s available.
We carry a portable dish on a tripod using a secondary control box from
our home. Doing so means we don’t have to have a separate account for
the RV. The dish can be set down almost anywhere — on the ground or
on a picnic table, in front, beside, or behind the RV — making it much
more versatile than a fixed dish atop the RV.
Fixed or portable, satellite dishes are particularly advantageous when
you travel in rural areas with little or no local TV reception or when you
plan to stay in one area for several days.
Remember, your dish programming is set on your home time, so as you
move to other time zones, programs will air according to your television
schedule at home. West Coast travelers RVing on the East Coast, for
example, find that their 8 p.m. programs can’t be seen until 11 p.m.
Cellphones
We always carry a cellphone with us, but it provides almost as much
frustration as assistance. The places we like to drive and camp fre-
quently are, if not always, in borderline or no-service areas. Our previ-
ous cellphone featured a roaming system that, theoretically, could
forward our calls to almost anywhere in the United State or Canada that
we happened to be. Our editors have been able to reach us in the wilds
of British Columbia or when we’re driving down an interstate in West
Chapter 11: Tying Up Loose Ends 105

Texas, but they can’t seem to get through to us when we’re on a two-day
outing in a park in San Diego or Santa Barbara counties, only a hoot and
a holler from our Los Angeles base.
We find cellphones most helpful for dialing ahead for campground reser-
vations or for returning business calls we’ve picked up from our home
answering machine when campground or highway pay phones are too
noisy or not available. And we’re certainly happy to have one in case of
an emergency.
If you’re happy with your present cellphone service, then stay with it.
Otherwise, if you plan an RV vacation, find out in advance what kind of
service you can expect on the road and at your destination. Sometimes
the technology leaves much to be desired, with voices fading in and out
when you’re in fringe reception areas. Some pricing plans include long-
distance and roaming charges throughout the United States for a flat fee
for a certain number of minutes. Check out all available systems and
prices before deciding on one for your RV vacation.
If you don’t have a phone, or happen to be in a dead zone, most private
campgrounds and many public ones have a pay phone on the premises.
If you’re venturing deep into national parks, you may want to consider
buying or renting a satellite phone (“satphone”), which is different from
a cellphone in that it connects to satellites rather than ground-based
towers. Unfortunately, you’ll pay at least $2 per minute to use the phone,
and it only works where you can see the horizon. In North America, you
can rent Iridium satellite phones from RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or
905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
Computer online services
Online RV bulletin boards and chat groups, enable RV enthusiasts or
wannabe RVers to exchange dialogue, offer helpful hints, and discuss the
pros and cons of the various vehicle brands. So logging on to one of the
RV sites is fun and helpful before your trip. There’s a helpful list of a lot
of different forums at www.rv-info.net/rvforums.html. You can also
visit the popular RV Talk Forums (which have more than 8,000 regis-
tered users) at www.rvusa.com/forum/mbbs22/category-view.asp.
While on the road, you may want to access your e-mail. Most camp-
grounds offer e-mail access, sometimes free, through a kiosk or public
terminal in the main office, store, laundry room, or recreation room.
Many campgrounds have installed wireless Internet connections (Wi-Fi)
allowing you to get on the Internet from your own computer in the
motorhome. (In this book, campgrounds listed with Internet access are
designated as having dataports; those with wireless connectivity are
designated as Wi-Fi.)

106

Buying RV Insurance
We were pleasantly surprised to find that our RV insurance was very
affordable, even in costly Southern California. Safe driving records, a
shorter use period during the year, and slightly older drivers (on average)
mean less risk for the insurer. Before buying, check with your own automo-
bile insurance carrier and the following specialized RV insurance carriers:
 AARP Insurance: % 800-541-3717; www.aarp.com
 AON Recreation Insurance: % 800-521-2942;
www.aonrecreation.com
 Foremost Insurance Company: % 800-237-2060;
www.foremost.com
 Good Sam Club’s National General: % 800-234-3450;
www.goodsamclub.com
Securing towing insurance in case of a breakdown is a good idea; in
many cases, American Automobile Association (AAA) members can
extend that company’s towing coverage to their RVs.
If you’re renting an RV, the rental company usually carries basic insur-
ance on the vehicle covering bodily injury, property damage, uninsured
motorist, no-fault, and fire and theft. The renter may be liable for a
deductible on collision and comprehensive. Check it out before taking
out the vehicle. You may want to pay an additional sum for vacation
interruption protection in the event of a vehicle breakdown; the rental
agencies usually can provide this coverage.
Staying Safe and Secure on the Road
Staying overnight in a parking lot or truck stop instead of a legitimate
campground or public park just to save a few dollars is false economy.
Your RV, especially if it’s big and shiny, advertises your net worth to
anyone with thievery on the brain. If you’re stranded, it’s dark, and all
the campgrounds are full, then you take what you can get, but we often
see RVers who choose to stay for free in Wal-Mart or Camping World lots
with their folding chairs and even their charcoal grills out on a patch of
asphalt instead of heading for a real campground where the ambience is
so much more pleasant, even if it costs a few dollars more.
Campgrounds, on the other hand, generally are safe, but not the way
they used to be. Back when we were tent campers, we departed on hikes
leaving all our worldly goods protected only by the tent zipper. These
days, we lock our RV even when we’re just going to the campground store
or laundry for a while. Not everyone in campgrounds is on vacation.
Chapter 11: Tying Up Loose Ends 107

Privately owned RV parks probably are safer in the long run than public
campgrounds that aren’t sufficiently staffed to keep a constant eye 
on things. Reports of stolen folding chairs or bicycles are becoming
more common. We once left our sewer hose with its expandable drain
stand and water hose hooked up at a California campsite, guarded by a
red CAMPSITE OCCUPIED sign, while we went away for a few hours in our
motorhome; we returned to find the hose, the drain stand, and even the
sewer host had been taken. But the CAMPSITE OCCUPIED sign was still there.
In the long run, we recommend using the same precautions in a camp-
ground that you normally would at home.
Carrying a Gun
If you want to start a lively argument around a campground, open with a
question about RVers carrying guns. We personally never would carry 
a firearm in our motorhome, but then we don’t have one at home either.
Even though many frequent and full-timing RVers agree, many others dis-
agree, sometimes vociferously.
One RVer we know is a retired law enforcement officer who says the pur-
pose of a gun is to kill, and if you’re not prepared to kill, you need to
reconsider taking a gun along. If you insist on carrying one, he says, you
must take professional training in how and when to use it, and more
important, when not to use it.
Entering Mexico with a firearm of any sort can land an RV owner in jail —
and has, in several documented cases. Canada also prohibits you from
entering the country with guns of any sort. Don’t take a chance: The
days of RVs simply being waved through border crossings are gone.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the law in many states considers
the RV a motor vehicle when moving and a home only when parked.
Therefore, when in transit, any firearms you’re carrying must be
unloaded with the bullets stored separately from the weapon.
Firearms are prohibited in many state parks.
If we did choose to carry a firearm, we’d make it a point to keep abreast
of each state’s regulations, because they can differ radically. Everything
from the legal age to carry a gun to whether its owner must be licensed
can change from state to state, so it’s definitely in your best interest to
find out what the law is in your destination and the states you pass
through along the way. Forewarned is forearmed (so to speak).

Exploring the East

In this part . . .
T
his part guides you through ﬁve drives in the eastern
United States, from the Northeast to the Southeast, with
lots of beaches, mountains, historic places, and great food
(and scenery). Take the drive in Chapter 12 and ﬁnd yourself
at the seashore eating more lobster at cheaper prices than
you believed possible. Select the drive through western New
York in Chapter 13, and you’ll be reminded of why you love
Lucy, where Jell-O came from, and why baseball is a uniquely
American sport. Choose the drive in Chapter 14 to cruise a
scenic and historic road through the Blue Ridge Mountains,
where dogwood blooms and autumn leaves turn vivid crim-
son and gold. Dig your toes into sugary white sand along the
coast of the Gulf of Mexico in Chapter 15, or see historic
sights from the Civil War to the life of Elvis in Chapter 16.

Lobster Land

 Traveling the rocky coast of Maine
 Finding fantastic factory outlets
 Hiking and biking through Acadia National Park
 Discovering Andrew Wyeth’s world
 Feasting on fresh lobster
T
he rocky coast of Maine evolved through the centuries from a now-
submerged mountain range — a sheet of ice scoured and then
flooded the mountains, leaving only the peaks remaining above the ice
melt. Somes Sound, which bisects the lower half of Mount Desert Island
in Acadia National Park, is the only true fjord (a narrow sea inlet bor-
dered on both sides by steep cliffs) on the East Coast.
The mystique of the craggy shore and pounding waves, the sharp peeps
of shore birds and the clanging of a bell buoy, stalwart lighthouses punc-
turing lingering fog, the tangy saltwater scent, weathered buildings, and
peeling lobster pots all lend color, sound, taste, touch, and smell to the
experience that is Maine.
For us, Maine offers a blend of scenic and culinary sensations — the vivid
orange-red hue of a freshly boiled lobster; the creamy white-on-white
blend of Maine potatoes, cream, clams, and fatty bacon in a chowder; and
the puckery, purple, sweet-sour crunch of a handful of wild blueberries.
Getting There
Kittery, on the Maine/New Hampshire border at I-95, is one hour north
of Boston. Our drive follows U.S. 1, parallel to I-95, 72 miles to Brunswick,
and then turns east away from I-95 to follow the Maine coastline through
Bath to Rockland, Camden, Belfast, Bucksport, and Ellsworth. It then
drops south to Bar Harbor and Mount Desert Island by following SR 3 for
10 miles, taking the bridge across Mount Desert Narrows to the junction

with SR 102, and then turning east on SR 3 another 6 miles into Bar Harbor.
The distance is approximately 225 miles. For the route, see “The Coast of
Maine” map on p. 112.
If you encounter traffic snarls on U.S. 1, you can use the parallel I-95, a
much faster interstate route. Note, however, that between York Village at
Exit 1 and Portland at Exit 15, I-95 is also called the Maine Turnpike, and
a toll is charged. RV tolls vary, depending on the number of axles on the
vehicle and the mood of the toll taker, who may, if you’re lucky, elect to
charge RVs the same rate as cars. Otherwise, you usually pay 50 percent
to 100 percent more.
Roads around popular beach resorts such as Scarborough, Old Orchard
Beach, and Saco often are jammed with slow-moving traffic, but you’ll
find the going easier as you get farther north.
Planning Ahead
The best time to visit Maine is also the most crowded because everyone
enjoys the warm summer months and colorful fall season. May, which is
too early for the summer folk and the black flies, can be a good alternative,
as can late August and September, which see a lessening of tourists and
insect life. Unfortunately, after schools and colleges open in September,
many small-town New England establishments close down for the winter
because the minimum-wage crowd goes back to school and only a few
other workers remain.
You need to make campground reservations well in advance (think Mar
or Apr, if you’re visiting in summer) for the more popular RV parks, espe-
cially those in national or state parks, and particularly if you’re driving a
large motorhome (some New England campgrounds are short on long
sites) or planning a lengthy stay in any one campground. Most of the
campgrounds along this drive were built back in the 1940s and 1950s,
the days of tents and tiny trailers (the little two-wheel tow-alongs we
think of as Minnie Mouse trailers). Our big, widebody motorhome with
two slideouts fits into them like Queen Latifah trying to squeeze into
Jennifer Aniston’s dress. But we found out early on that it’s worth the
effort. Just make reservations as far ahead as possible and emphasize
your vehicle’s needs so you can guarantee a workable space. And if you
can remember to ask for a pull-through, plus a 30- or 50-amp hookup,
you’ll be able to reserve a campsite that fits you like a glove. (If you
don’t know what pull-through and hookup mean, see the Appendix in the
back of this book.)
When packing, taking along an umbrella and raincoat, hiking boots, hot-
weather gear, such as shorts and T-shirts, and cool-weather gear, such as
slacks and sweaters or sweatshirts, is a good idea. Maine coastal weather
changes frequently, sometimes several times a day. Fortunately, with an
RV, you’re carrying your own closet and dressing room with you, so you
can easily change when the weather does.
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 113

Although the distance covered isn’t great, you need to allow 10 to 14 days
for a leisurely visit with time for enjoying camping and seeking out lob-
ster pounds (a casual live lobster market with on-site cooking and take-
out service and/or picnic tables) and little antiques shops. If you want to
spend more time in New England, you can add on Cape Cod or a venture
north into Canada’s maritime provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
and Prince Edward Island. See our book, Frommer’s Exploring America
by RV, 5th Edition (Wiley).
Stocking the Pantry
If you want to restock on wine or other alcoholic items for your holiday
at prices much lower than Manhattan or Boston, try Kittery’s Maine
Discount Liquor Store at Exit 1 on 1-95 for northbound traffic, which is
open daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s.
An essential shopping stop for us in Kittery is the downtown Portland
City Market (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter), where we stock 
up on fresh Maine products from seafood, such as fresh-harvested
Damariscotta’s Maine Belon oysters, to farmhouse cheeses and three 
different varieties of local potatoes. Ready-to-eat foods also are on sale.
Driving the Coast of Maine
The crown jewel of New England is the rocky, windswept coast of Maine,
and we never tire of traveling its winding, scenic roads and searching
out its hidden treasures. For RVers, New England is an exhilarating blend
of incredible scenery, exciting shopping, and delectable dining that
counters the sobering prospect of easing a big motorhome or trailer into
the typical local campsite. Sticking to U.S. 1 or its interstate parallel, I-95,
is no problem for even the most inexperienced RV driver. Our driving
tour begins in Kittery, the first town in Maine after crossing the border
from New Hampshire.
The three Yorks — York Village, York Harbor, and York Beach — often
are crowded with summer visitors on a budget who gravitate to the
small motels and rooming houses that give this area its old-fashioned
aura. A bit more classic is Ogunquit, the next town north, with its well-
trod Marginal Way seaside walk, art galleries, and lofty allusions to
painters such as Edward Hopper.
Environmentalists and birders need to visit the Rachel Carson National
Wildlife Refuge north of Wells to grow acquainted with the salt-marsh
wilderness (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Continue north on SR 9 past the wildlife refuge to Kennebunkport,
the summer home to former president George H. W. Bush and his wife,
Barbara, a fashionable destination worth a thoughtful pause. The senior
Bushes are known to dine amid the kitschy clutter at Mabel’s Lobster
Part III: Exploring the East 
114

Claw in Kennebunkport, but the supercasual Nunan’s Lobster Hut at
Cape Porpoise is a hit with almost everybody (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter). The world’s largest collection of streetcars, some 250 of
them, is at the Seashore Trolley Museum (see “More cool things to see
and do,” later in this chapter). On view is one of New Orleans’s street-
cars named Desire.
Continuing north on U.S. 1, you come to Saco, Biddeford, and Old
Orchard Beach. The last is where you’re likely to hear more French than
English spoken on the beaches and in the amusement parks. Ever since
1853, when the Grand Trunk Railroad ran between Montréal and Old
Orchard Beach, thousands of French Canadians have flocked to the 7
miles of sandy beach lined with modestly priced lodgings and restau-
rants. This is the closest thing to Coney Island or the Jersey shore that
you’ll find in Maine.
Traveling a few miles farther north on U.S. 1 brings you to Portland, one
of America’s great small cities; it is colorful, accessible, and fairly easy to
navigate with an RV.
One of our favorite detours from Portland is a drive around Cape Elizabeth
to Portland Head Light, Maine’s oldest lighthouse (see “Must-see attrac-
tions,” later in this chapter).
But even a bright coastal light fades next to America’s most appealing
shopping mall, the town of Freeport. The center of town is the mail-
order giant L.L.Bean, open 24/7, surrounded by some 200 factory-outlet
retailers with every brand name you can think of from Coach to Nike
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Freeport always is full of shoppers, but don’t let that deter you from stop-
ping to snap up some bargains. The L.L.Bean Factory Outlet store, site of
the best bargains in town, is next to the special free RV parking area,
which, in turn, is just steps away from all the factory outlets. Although
you aren’t permitted to stay overnight there, the town has several camp-
grounds (see “Sleeping and Eating on the Road,” later in this chapter).
One of the great lobster pounds is also in Freeport, at Harraseeket
Lunch & Lobster Company (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 115
Damariscotta: Round Top Dairy
If your sweet tooth acts up as you’re dawdling along U.S. 1 between Wiscasset and
Nobleboro, take the Business U.S. 1 loop off the main highway so you can pause in
Damariscotta at Round Top Dairy, a family ice-cream shop. Choose from among more
flavors than you can imagine in a pretty little cafe decorated with 1940s and 1950s pic-
tures of 4-H kids with prize-winning cows.

Wiscasset calls itself the prettiest village in Maine, and nobody yet has
arm-wrestled it down on that claim. Many buildings in town are on the
National Register of Historic Places; one of them, The Musical Wonder
House, an 1852 sea captain’s house at 18 High St., displays and plays a
collection of 19th-century music boxes, gramophones, pump organs,
crank organs, player pianos, and mechanical musical birds (see “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Two miles east of Wiscasset you can take a 12-mile detour south on SR
27 to Boothbay Harbor, a colorful fishing, lobstering, and boat-building
town. From the harbor, you can take a day cruise on the Argo to Cabbage
Island for the traditional Cabbage Island Clambake (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
In Waldoboro on U.S. 1, Moody’s Diner (see “Good eats,” later in this
chapter) is the quintessential Maine diner, opened first in 1927 as a
three-cabin campground and outhouse for hunters and fishermen. In
1935, the diner joined the scene and quickly built a lasting reputation for
huge breakfasts at budget prices. We cheated on our midmorning repast
here, politely forking up the rather bland corned beef hash and eggs,
and then gobbling down a slice of fantastic chocolate cream pie for
dessert.
For art buffs, Rockland is the equivalent of hitting the jackpot on a $1
Vegas slot. All available on one easy ticket, the Farnsworth Art Museum
complex (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter) salutes three
generations of the Wyeth family and other artists who lived or worked in
this part of Maine, with its legendary light and mystique. Clustered in
town, you’ll find the furnished, Victorian Farnsworth Homestead; the
striking, contemporary, six-level, art museum (most of it underground);
and the Wyeth Center, austerely installed in a former church.
A few miles away outside the farm community of Cushing is the evoca-
tive Olson House (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter), the
remote farm with its unpainted house and barn that’s in the background
of Christina’s World, Andrew Wyeth’s masterpiece. Wyeth spent more
than 20 years painting in and around the Olson House, and today, visi-
tors can match a room or view with a print of a Wyeth work displayed
on-site in the otherwise unfurnished house.
A short detour south from Rockland takes you to the Owls Head
Transportation Museum, a dandy if sometimes-noisy place on weekends
when aficionados crank up pre-1930s planes, steam farm vehicles, and
antique automobiles, and take a ride (see “More cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter).
Rockport and Camden, where the mountains meet the water, are pictur-
esque enough to fill up your camera’s memory card, but you need to find
a parking spot big enough for your RV before you can settle down to
shoot. Several public parking lots are adjacent to the Rockland Harbor
Trail, a 4-mile footpath that winds through the historic waterfront. In
Part III: Exploring the East 
116

Camden, look for street parking along Elm Street (U.S. 1) on the hill
above the waterfront area.
Off U.S. 1 between Lincolnville and Belfast, Kelmscott Rare Breeds
Foundation Farm (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this
chapter), a working farm of rare livestock breeds — sheep, Shire horses,
and Gloucestershire Old Spots pigs — offers a diversion for pet lovers or
families with children in tow. The shoppers among you can hurry to its
shop to buy items made from wool shorn from the sheep on the premises.
On your way into Bar Harbor, you may want to stop at the Acadia
Information Center (% 800-358-8550) on SR 3 just after you cross the
bridge to pick up armloads of maps and brochures about the area and
some information about Acadia National Park. The center is open mid-
May through mid-October daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (from 8 a.m. in
summer).
We suggest lingering several days in Bar Harbor to browse in the color-
ful and whimsical town shops along Main Street, Cottage Street, and
Mount Desert Street around the Village Green, and to spend some time
exploring nearby Acadia National Park. If time is short, spend most of
the day in the park and hit the shops that evening after dinner; most
shops are open until 9 p.m. in summer. Seasonal shops open in early to
mid-May and close down by the end of October.
Don’t count on being able to park a trailer or large motorhome anywhere
in downtown Bar Harbor. A designated lot is on the edge of town at the
south end of Main Street, but your wisest choice if you have a large RV
or are towing an RV is to leave the unit at the campground and use a car
or utilize the free shuttle-bus service offered in the summer months.
Must-see attractions
Acadia National Park
Although you can cram the scenic wonders of Acadia National Park into
one day’s drive, you’ll be rewarded if you allow some extra time.
For a one-day visit, drive scenic Park Loop Road, which makes a 27-mile
circle out of Bar Harbor from SR 3 south of town, with all the attractions
pointed out by signage. If you start by heading south on the loop toward
the Wild Gardens and Sand Beach, you can cover the sometimes traffic-
clogged one-way stretch from Otter Cliffs to Seal Harbor earlier in the day,
take a lunch or tea break at Jordan Pond (see “Good eats,” later in this
chapter), and climax the day with the drive up Cadillac Mountain. At 1,530
feet, it’s the highest mountain on the Atlantic coast of North America.
If you have another day to spend in Acadia National Park, consider taking
a bike ride along some of the 45 miles of carriage roads between Hulls
Cove Visitor Center and Jordan Pond, where motor traffic is forbidden.
John D. Rockefeller, who hated automobiles, commissioned these gravel
roads for horse-drawn vehicles, walkers, and bicyclists.
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 117

Or you may opt for a hike up Acadia Mountain. A moderate, 2-mile, round-
trip trail through pines and birch trees sets out from the Acadia Mountain
parking area 3 miles south of Somesville on SR 102. (To get there from Bar
Harbor, drive west on SR 233, which turns into SR 198 at Somesville.) Then
afterward, treat yourself to a lobster lunch at Beal’s Lobster House in
Southwest Harbor (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Find the best detailed information and maps for Acadia at the Hull’s
Cove Visitor Center (% 207-288-3338; www.nps.gov/acad) on SR 3
north of Bar Harbor. The center is open daily mid-April through the end
of October from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 6 p.m. in July and Aug).
Although Park Loop Road, one of the park’s most popular attractions,
generally is accessible for RVs, we suggest you consider leaving your RV
in the campground, especially if you’re driving a large motorhome or
towing a trailer, because parking space is limited in many park turnouts.
Likewise, if you have an unusually tall RV, note that the SR 3 bridge under-
pass on Park Loop Road near Blackwoods does not clear vehicles higher

You can avoid knocking off your TV antenna by traveling the route in a car,
by bicycle (rentals are available from Acadia Bike and Coastal Kayak
Tours, 48 Cottage St. [% 800-526-8615 outside Maine or 207-288-9605], or
Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop, 141 Cottage St. [% 207-288-3886]), or by local
shuttle bus (Island Explorer [% 207-667-5796]), which makes frequent

national park during the summer. The shuttle buses are equipped with
bicycle racks.
See map, p. 118. The park’s main entrance is on SR 3 at Hulls Cove.
Farnsworth Art Museum
Rockland
When the Farnsworth family’s sole remaining member, an eccentric and
reclusive maiden lady, died in 1935 at 96, executors were astonished to
find that she left a sizeable estate, along with directions to preserve the
home and create an art museum. Today, the complex consists of the
Farnsworth Homestead, Farnsworth Art Museum, the Wyeth Center, and
a teaching center in Rockland and the Olson House in Cushing.
The Farnsworth Homestead is a well-preserved mid-19th-century home
with many of its original furnishings. There are also informative displays
about the Farnsworth family, and volunteer docents who tell you about
the history of the house and the town.
The seven galleries of the Farnsworth Art Museum (most of the floors in
this contemporary building are underground) showcase not only the
Wyeths — grandfather, N. C., son, Andrew, and grandson, Jamie — but also
American artists from Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Eakins to Winslow
Homer, Childe Hassam, and Rockland-born sculptor Louise Nevelson.
The Wyeth Center is housed in a converted church stripped down to bare
wood floors and movable sailcloth dividers framed in mahogany. The
ground floor displays book illustrations from patriarch N. C. Wyeth, who
lamented much of his life that his work wasn’t appreciated as fine art; the
upper gallery is dedicated to Jamie Wyeth, a strikingly original artist in his
own right, best-known for his portraits of John F. Kennedy and Andy
Warhol.
Allow a half-day for the complex.

L.L.Bean and Freeport’s Factory Outlets
Freeport
The L.L.Bean dynasty has been around since 1911, when Leon Leonwood
Bean sold 100 pairs of leather-and-rubber hunting boots and had 90 pairs
returned because the boot fell apart from faulty stitching. He returned the
money to the buyers, corrected the problems in construction, and went
into the mail-order sporting goods business backed by a retail store that
was kept open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Today, the company he
founded stocks more than 12,000 different items, and the main retail store
at 95 Main St. (% 800-341-4341) is still open for business 24/7.
But L.L.Bean no longer is alone in the pretty little town of Freeport. Now,
some 200 other name brands vie with Bean in an easy-to-stroll village
atmosphere. Our favorite bargain spot is L.L.Bean’s Factory Discount
Store (% 800-341-4341), across Main Street from the parent store and
around the corner on Depot Street. Allow a half-day to full day, depending

The Olson House
Hathorne Point near Cushing
In 1948, Andrew Wyeth painted Christina’s World in tempera, depicting a
young Christina Olson, wearing her favorite pink dress and dragging her
crippled body up the hill to the family home where she lived with her
brother Alvaro. Wyeth, who spent his summers in Cushing, continued to
devote many hours to the Olson farm, painting images of the house and
the views from its windows, even after Christina and Alvaro had died — he
on Christmas Eve 1967 and she a month later. Both are buried in the small
family graveyard by the sea, only a short distance in back of the spot
where Christina is depicted in the painting.
Today, the house and farm are preserved and tended by the Farnsworth
Art Museum, and to visit it on a foggy autumn day, as we did, is to summon
up the ghosts of the past in an incredibly moving setting. Allow one hour.
Hathorne Point Road. (Take Wadsworth River Road from the center of Thomaston,
turning east by the Maine Prison Showroom — which sells crafts turned out by
inmates of the state system — then follow the road 6 miles to Pleasant Point Road,
turn left and follow it 11⁄2 miles to Hathorne Point Road, which you then follow 2 miles
to its end, where the Olson House is found on the left. The signage is good all along
the route after you make the turn in Thomaston.) % 207-596-6457. www.
farnsworthmuseum.org. RV parking: Park along the shoulder of the roadway
rather than in the small lot behind the house if you’re driving a large motorhome or
towing a trailer. Admission (Olson House only, self-guided tours): $4 adults, free ages
17 and younger. Admission to the Olson House is also included with admission to the
Farnsworth Art Museum. Open: Memorial Day–Columbus Day daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m.

Portland Head Light
Cape Elizabeth
The historic Portland Head Light, commissioned by George Washington in
1790, built of “rubblestone set in lime” and finished in 1791, is the oldest
of Maine’s lighthouses. Still in service and virtually unchanged from 
its beginning, the lighthouse is part of Fort Williams, a military outpost 
for coastal defense. In the former lighthouse keeper’s quarters, a small
museum chronicles the history of the lighthouse along with anecdotal
local details. Allow one to two hours.
1000 Shore Rd., Fort Williams. (From I-295 in downtown Portland, take SR 77 south
and shortly after crossing the bridge, turn east on Cottage Road, which becomes
Shore Road. Follow signs.) % 207-799-2661. RV parking: Designated parking area.
Admission: $2 adults, $1 ages 6–18. Open: Early Apr–May 30 weekends 10 a.m.–4 p.m.,
May 31 to Labor Day daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
The family-friendly coast of Maine offers a number of things to see and
do. During your drive, you’ll run across many examples, particularly
commercial attractions that may not be included in the list that follows:
 Have a clambake. The Cabbage Island Clambake (% 207-633-7200;
www.cabbageislandclambakes.com) on Cabbage Island is a tradi-
tional lobster-and-clam supper served in summer at lunch and
dinner. You board the Argo at Pier 6 in Boothbay Harbor (12 miles
south of Wiscasset on SR 27), cruise over to the island, and feast on
local lobster, clams, corn on the cob, and boiled potatoes.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $50 per person
for the cruise and clambake. The clambake runs from late June to
Labor Day, daily. Reservations are required, and they don’t take
credit cards. Cruises leave at 12:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday,
and at 11:30 a.m. on Sunday.
 Get some Moxie. We met the Moxie Man, Frank Anicetti II, in his
Moxie Museum (% 207-353-8173), at the Moxie Bottling Company
and corner store, still selling America’s oldest soft drink. Moxie,
made from gentian root, started as a “nerve medicine” in 1884, but
gathered fame in the 1920s when its name entered the dictionary as
a synonym for “nerve, courage, and energy.” Anicetti ships Moxie
by the case across the entire United States and welcomes in-person
visits from fans such as mystery novelist Stephen King, who, on our
visit, had signed the Moxie guestbook four signatures above ours.
Besides Moxie in bottles and cans, Anicetti sells Moxie T-shirts and
other memorabilia and souvenirs in his free museum/store. Allow
half an hour unless you’re thirsty.
The museum is located in downtown Lisbon Falls, on Main Street
(which also is SR 196), where it crosses SR 125. SR 196 is the Lisbon
Falls exit off I-95 at Brunswick. RV parking is available on the street.
Admission is free. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 121

 Wind down. A wonderful collection of music boxes, player grand
pianos, and talking machines can be seen in The Musical Wonder
House, 18 High St., Wiscasset (% 207-882-7163; www.musical
wonderhouse.com), which offers three tours: a standard 35-minute,
3-room tour, an extended 75-minute, 7-room tour, and a deluxe 3-hour
version that tours the entire mansion (the last one requires a prior
reservation and a minimum of two people).
RV parking is available on the street. The standard tour is $10 adults,
$9 seniors and ages 17 and younger; the extended tour is $20 adults,
$19 seniors and ages 17 and younger; and the deluxe tour is $45 per
person (no discount rates). It’s open from Memorial Day to
Halloween daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Ride a Stanley Steamer. This museum isn’t one of those boring
ones where you walk past the exhibits. At Owls Head Transportation
Museum (% 207-594-4418; www.ohtm.org), you get to see machines
in action and maybe even ride on one if you visit on summer week-
ends. From the Red Baron’s World War I Fokker Triplane to Clara
Bow’s Rolls Royce and a hissing Stanley Steamer steam automobile,
the exhibits still are in working order. Call ahead to see what’s
going to be cranked up when you’re in the vicinity. Allow one to
two hours depending on your interest and available activities.
The museum is located 2 miles south of Rockland, on SR 73 at the
Knox County Airport; signage is plentiful. RV parking is available 
in a large lot. Admission is $8 adults, $7 seniors, $6 ages 12 and
younger. It’s open from April through October daily from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m., November through March daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.;
closed major holidays.
 Take a walk on the wild side. Environmentalists and birders need
to visit the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge to walk a self-
guided 1-mile nature trail through a pine forest and along the Little
River out to a salt marsh. Pick up the map at the resident manager’s
office near the entrance. You’ll find the trail head by the refuge
headquarters north of Wells. Allow one hour.
The refuge is on SR 9 north of Wells, 7 miles east of U.S. 1. RV park-
ing is available in designated parking areas, but it may be crowded
in summer and fall. Admission is free. It’s open daily year-round
from sunrise to sunset.
 Hop a trolley. The Seashore Trolley Museum, 125 Log Cabin Rd.
north of Kennebunkport (% 207-967-2800 or 207-967-2712), was
founded back in 1939 with a single $150 acquisition, a red open-sided
car from Maine’s Biddeford-Saco Line. Today, the museum houses
the world’s largest collection of rolling cars, some 250 of them, in
an exhibit hall or spread around an old railroad right-of-way with
overhead wires that power the still-working relics. Visitors ride 
one of the trolleys to the exhibit barn, where they can admire a 
San Francisco cable car from 1910, an ornate 1906 Manchester and
Nashua Street Railway car from New Hampshire, and examples
Part III: Exploring the East 
122

from Glasgow, Rome, Montréal, and Budapest. Allow one to two
hours.
To get to the museum, drive 31⁄2 miles north of Kennebunkport via
North Street, which becomes Log Cabin Road. RV parking is adja-
cent to the museum. Admission is $8 adults, $7 seniors, $6 ages 6 
to 16, free for those 5 and younger ($20 maximum per family). It’s
open from May to mid-October daily from noon to 5 p.m. (from 
10 a.m. July–Aug).
Weekend wonder
Urban residents of the Northeast seeking a getaway can squeeze the
highlights of this tour into a three-day weekend but must bear in mind
that, round-trip, the journey totals 450 miles from the Maine–New
Hampshire border to Bar Harbor and back. The drive between Portland
and Bar Harbor takes 31⁄2 to 4 hours with no stops. For details on the
sights listed in this section, check out the “Must-see attractions” section,
earlier in this chapter. For campgrounds and restaurants, see the next
section, “Sleeping and Eating on the Road.”
You can spend the first night at a campground on Maine’s southern
coast around Saco or Biddeford, drive through Portland to Freeport
Saturday morning, allowing a couple of hours of shopping at L.L.Bean
and the factory outlets, and then drive on to Rockland for a quick after-
noon tour of the Farnsworth Art Museum. If you’re a Wyeth fan, give
priority to the renovated church that houses the Wyeth Center; if you
want to see a variety of artists, go first to the museum itself; and if you
adore furnished Victorian houses, make your major stop the Farnsworth
Homestead.
Get to Bar Harbor in the late afternoon and stay in a campground that
provides shuttle service into town so you can have a leisurely stroll
through the shops and enjoy a lobster dinner before returning to your
RV for the night. Check out early and, as long as your RV can clear an
underpass that’s 11 feet, 8 inches high, spend the morning driving the
Park Loop Drive in Acadia National Park. If it’s a clear day, drive to the
summit of Cadillac Mountain, but if it’s foggy, you won’t find a view, so
don’t bother tackling the very curvy road. Return to U.S. 1 from Bar
Harbor, take Alternate U.S. 1 to Bangor, and return south via the fast I-95.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Along U.S. 1 between Kittery and Bar Harbor, you find no dearth of
campgrounds — nearly three dozen — and plenty of casual eating spots;
Maine virtually invented the roadside diner. You can make reservations
at most private campgrounds and some, but not all, public ones in state
and national parks; having reservations in July and August is a good
idea. If you’re visiting in May or September, you can rely on serendipity
to find a place.
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 123

All campgrounds listed below are open year-round and have public flush
toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated other-
wise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only. See
Chapter 9 for how we choose our favorite campgrounds.
Our favorite campgrounds
Bar Harbor Campground
$$$–$$$$
Bar Harbor
Contrary to its peers, this privately-owned RV park accepts no reserva-
tions and lets campers select their own sites rather than assigning them.
This gives all procrastinators and serendipity fans a chance to find a camp-
site in midsummer without planning ahead. The campground has both
pull-through and back-in sites, some with grass and shade.
RFD 1, Box 1125. Off of SR 3. (From the junction of SR 3 and SR 102, follow SR 3 for

Blackwoods Campground
$$
Acadia National Park
Located in the scenic heart of Acadia National Park, Blackwoods prefers
advance reservations for its 45 RV sites (no hookups) and stipulates no
slideouts and a 35-foot maximum vehicle length. The reservations office
begins accepting requests the first week of February for the summer
months. Most of the heavily wooded sites in the campground are for tents,
and the hardier backwoods aficionados may snub RVers as softies.
But if you’re willing to forgo your TV, microwave, and A/C (which you often
don’t need in Maine anyway), you can enjoy a genuine camping experience
by day and sleep in a comfortable bed by night. Your refrigerator, heater,
and water heater can run off your propane supply, and if you want to stay
for the maximum 14-day limit, you can fill up your freshwater tanks and
empty your holding tanks when necessary without leaving the camp-
ground. The 20-foot-wide sites are back-ins only.

Good eats
Because we carry our own kitchen, we usually opt for casual eateries
rather than fancy restaurants and often order takeout, so we control the
time and place we eat.
Lobster central
The best reason to travel through Maine in an RV is that you can buy
fresh lobster every day to eat in, take out, or cook later, even on a budget,
because of an establishment called the lobster pound. Every town has
at least one of these simple spots where the owner usually sends his
own fishing boats to haul the lobsters home every day and then dumps
them in a huge vat of seawater. This container isn’t one of those wimpy
lobster tanks that you see in fancy urban restaurants. Those tropical fish
aquariums contain a couple of desultory, over-the-hill crustaceans lan-
guidly waving what’s left of a claw. A lobster pound is a repository of
spunky, fighting specimens that a lobster wrangler must wrestle to get
on the scales and into a pot of boiling water.
Part III: Exploring the East 
126

You pay by the pound (around $10) to get your whole lobster cooked to
order; a 11⁄4 or 11⁄2 pounder makes a generous portion for one average
eater and takes about 20 minutes to cook. (If you want to buy a live lob-
ster and cook it later yourself, ask the lobster wrangler for his recipe.)
The server usually includes a dish of hot melted butter and sometimes 
a package of crackers or potato chips. Everything else on the menu —
fried potatoes, onion rings, chowder, steamed clams, and corn on the
cob — is extra.
If an entire lobster seems too much to handle, order a lobster roll,
which is hot or cold chunks of lobster mixed with melted butter (the
hot) or mayonnaise and chopped celery (the cold) and heaped into a
buttered, toasted hot dog bun sliced open across the top rather than the
side. Plan to pay around $5.95 to $8.95 for these.
What follows are some of our favorite spots for whole lobster or lobster
rolls. Many are open seasonally only (May–Sept) and may not follow a
regular schedule, so definitely call ahead (if they have a listed phone
number) if you’re heading for one of them.
 Bayley’s Lobster Pound, Pine Point, Scarborough (% 800-932-6456
from outside Maine or 207-883-4571), off U.S. 1 at the end of SR 9:
Bayley’s is the place to go if you want to ship live Maine lobsters to
a dear friend. (They have to be dear because the prices are high —
not for the lobster but for the air freight.) Open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
in summer.
 Beal’s Lobster Pier, Clark Point Road, Southwest Harbor (% 207-
244-3202): One of the greats, Beal’s serves soft-shell lobster and
steamer clams at the end of a pier with picnic tables. You can pur-
chase sides of steamed corn, onion rings, and even jug wine at a
subsidiary next door to the picnic tables. Be prepared to shoo away
the local gulls, who’ll land near your table, eyeing your lobster.
Open daily Memorial Day through October from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Cindy’s Fish and Fries, 4 miles south of Freeport on U.S. 1 (no
phone): This is a lobster-roll mecca. Cindy’s doting parents — they
named the place after their daughter— serve their creations from a
food wagon with a takeout window. The lobster rolls can be ordered
in sandwich form or as a lobster roll basket with fries and coleslaw;
the latter is neater to handle. You can eat at the picnic tables on the
site or in your RV. Homemade lemonade is also a Cindy’s special.
There’s an amusing photo essay about the place online at www.we
loveclams.com/cindys.html. Open daily in summer for lunch
only.
 Clam Shack, on Dock Square by the bridge in Kennebunkport
(Market % 207-967-3321, restaurant % 207-967-2560): The Clam
Shack excels in both fried clams and lobster rolls. (Who says you
can’t order both?) Year-round, the place opens daily around 11 a.m.
and closes around 9 p.m. in summer (weekends otherwise), but
staff isn’t always punctual. Note: The navigator needs to hop out of
Chapter 12: The Coast of Maine: Lobster Land 127

the RV to order while the driver moves along and comes back later;
no space is available to park in the vicinity.
 Harraseeket Lunch & Lobster Company, South Freeport Harbor
(% 207-865-3535): Swing by here for a quick picker-upper. Just
don’t try to go down the narrow road leading to the pier in a large
RV; the locals have passed an ordinance against it. Park up on the
main road (South Freeport Road) and walk the quarter-mile down
to the restaurant. If you don’t want to order the lobster from the
pound in back, you can line up at the lunch counter (which opens
at 11 a.m. daily) and order anything from lobster rolls to clamburg-
ers and homemade Whoopie Pies (two patties of devil’s food cake
sandwiched with marshmallow cream and dipped in chocolate). 
If you want beer or wine, bring your own. Open May 1 through
October 15 daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Lobster Shack, 225 Two Lights Rd., Cape Elizabeth (% 207-799-
1677): Located at Two Lights lighthouse since the 1920s, the Lobster
Shack sits atop a rocky plateau with plenty of picnic tables and a
view. The venerable, family-run eatery serves homemade clam
chowder, boiled lobster dinners, lobster rolls, fried clams, and 
even burgers and hot dogs. Open April to mid-October daily from
11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Lobsterman’s Co-op, Atlantic Avenue (near the aquarium),
Boothbay Harbor (% 207-633-4900): Here you find a wooden pier
with outdoor picnic tables and a choice of hard-shell or soft-shell
lobster (defined on a hand-printed sign as SOFT SHELL = LESS MEAT,
SWEETER TASTE). Open for lunch and dinner from Memorial Day to
Columbus Day from 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Mabel’s Lobster Claw, 124 Ocean Ave., Kennebunkport (% 207-
967-2562): Mabel’s wins the presidential endorsement of George,
Sr., and Barbara Bush. You can order a whole boiled lobster, a
baked stuffed lobster, a lobster roll dressed with mayonnaise and
garnished with lettuce, and (as if you needed a few more calories)
peanut butter ice-cream pie with hot fudge topping. Open April
through November daily from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 9 p.m.
 Maine Diner, on U.S. 1 at 2265 Post Rd., Wells (% 207-646-4441):
The diner serves the absolute best hot lobster roll slathered in
melted butter. Their famous lobster pie also is memorable. Open
daily year-round from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., except major holidays.
 Nunan’s Lobster Hut, 11 Mills Rd., Cape Porpoise (% 207-967-4362),
3 miles northeast of Kennebunkport on SR 9: The hut is famous for
steaming its lobsters in a small amount of water rather than tossing
the lobsters in a tank of boiling water, as most places do. They
throw in a bag of potato chips and a hard roll with butter, and also
sell homemade apple and blueberry pie. They take no reservations
or credit cards. Open every evening from 5 to 9 p.m.

More than lobster: Markets and meals
Although Maine is mainly about lobster in our book, you can also track
down goodies from chowders to popovers.
 Bar Harbor Inn, Newport Drive, Bar Harbor (% 207-288-3351): At
this classic inn adjacent to the municipal pier, you can get a great
(albeit expensive) hamburger at lunchtime in the Reading Room
open for dinner from 5:30 to 9 p.m. or outside on Gatsby’s Terrace,
which has a front-row waterfront view and is open from 11:30 a.m.
to dusk.
 Jordan Pond House, Acadia National Park, Park Loop Road, north
of Seal Harbor (% 207-276-3316): Despite the line during peak
season, you’ll want to queue up for a teatime feast of hot popovers,
homemade jams and ice creams, cookies, and pastries. They also
serve lunch and dinner, but teatime on the lawn, weather permit-
ting, is tops. Open mid-May to late October from 11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Moody’s Diner, U.S. 1, Waldoboro (% 207-832-7785): Breakfasts
are the big attraction. Open weekdays from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. (until
11:30 p.m. Fri and Sat).
 Opera House Restaurant and Internet Café, 27 Cottage St., Bar
Harbor (% 207-288-3509): Serve yourself tea, coffee, and home-
made breakfast pastries before or after perusing your e-mail. Open
in summer from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Portland City Market, Cumberland Avenue between Preble and Elm
streets, Portland (% 207-228-2016): At this good food-shopping
stop, vendors offer the best of Maine foods from farmhouse butter
and cheeses to organic fruits and vegetables to local seafood and
several different varieties of Maine potatoes. Visit on weekends
when plenty of street parking is available. Open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

F
rom the thundering cascade of Niagara Falls, the cliché honeymoon
destination for the first half of the 20th century, to the serene Finger
Lakes, flanked by vineyard-covered slopes, western New York has some
awesome scenery to lure the RVing vacationer.
We like the quirky aspects of the area — the Lucy and Desi Museum in
Jamestown, the squeaky cheese curds for sale at the cheese factories
around Cuba and Dewittville, the Original American Kazoo Company in
Eden, and the Jell-O Gallery museum in LeRoy.
The roads are good, the campgrounds spacious and appealing, the food
tasty and imaginative, and the natives friendly, so come on out to west-
ern New York for a unique journey through a slice of Americana.
Getting There
We start our drive in Cooperstown, 225 miles northwest of New York
City, and zigzag north, south, and west from there, ending up some 500-
plus miles later at Niagara Falls on the Canadian border. (For the route,
see the “Western New York” map in this chapter.) From Cooperstown, 
we head north via SR 80 to Ilion and Herkimer, then west to Utica and

Rome for the historic Erie Canal Village, and then west to Syracuse via
I-90 or the slower, more scenic back road, SR 5.
From Syracuse, we follow SR 175 to Skaneateles, then take U.S. 20 to the
junction with SR 89, which follows the western shore of Cayuga Lake to
Ithaca, and then we continue southwest on SR 13 to Elmira. From there,
the jog over to Corning on I-86 is a short one. Back up into the Finger
Lakes, we follow the western shore of Seneca Lake on SR 14 north to
Geneva, and then head west to Rochester on I-90.
From Rochester, we swing south again to I-86, following I-490 to SR 19,
and then 19A from Letchworth State Park, cutting off on SR 305 from
Belfast to Cuba. Follow I-86 west to Jamestown, and then drive along
Lake Chautauqua to the town of Chautauqua. Follow SR 58 to Cassadaga,
and then jog over to I-90 and drive northeast to Exit 57; take U.S. 62 to
U.S. 20A, and drive east to East Aurora. From that point, follow SR 400
into Buffalo, and then north to Niagara Falls on I-190. The total drive 
is 725 miles.

Major citywide construction has been going on in Buffalo for several
years and may not be complete when you’re there. Allow extra time for
getting around this town.
Planning Ahead
Any time of year when it isn’t snowing or freezing is a good time to visit
western New York, so cross out the winter months for a visit. The best
times for this drive are late spring and early autumn, with summer a
close second, only because campgrounds are busier when families with
children are on the road during school holidays.
You need to make campground reservations in advance whenever pos-
sible during the peak season, Memorial Day to Labor Day. Niagara Falls
KOA is almost always busy.

When packing, take along a range of clothing weights because you 
may face anything from very warm and humid summer temperatures 
to a sudden cool, rainy day when you’ll want a jacket or sweater. Clean
T-shirts and shorts with sandals or sneakers are acceptable summer
tourist garb throughout western New York, although we’d suggest dress-
ing up one notch if you’re in a city like Buffalo or Syracuse.
If you’re planning on crossing into Canada at Niagaa Falls, you’ll need
your passport to get back into the U.S.
Allow a week or more for this drive, especially if you want to spend
time in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown (baseball fans
can spend days there) or sightseeing at Niagara Falls.
Stocking the Pantry
You won’t have any problems finding good food stores and restaurants.
We find Top’s Friendly Markets to be a good chain throughout western
New York. Hannaford’s also sells high-quality products; we found one in
Herkimer, and others in locales around the state.
DiCamillo’s Bakery, with several locations in the Niagara Falls area, is a
good place to stock up on breads and cookies, especially biscotti. The
Cuba Cheese Shop in Cuba carries 100 varieties of imported and domes-
tic cheeses, some of which they make themselves. (For details on both,
see “Good eats,” later in this chapter.)
Farmers’ markets flourish all summer throughout the region. We particu-
larly recommend the Saturday morning market in Ithaca with a full range
of fruits, vegetables, meats, cheeses, and cut flowers. Cooperstown also
has a Saturday morning market in summer.
Driving through Western New York
In south-central New York, we start in Cooperstown, named for its founder,
who was the father of author James Fenimore Cooper. A good all-American
starting point for this drive, the town includes the National Baseball Hall
of Fame, Cooper memorabilia and a fine art collection in the Fenimore Art
Museum, and Farmers’ Museum with costumed living history characters
demonstrating crafts and farm work in 1845. (See “Must-see attractions”
and “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter.)
Pretty, tree-shaded Cooperstown has limited parking even for automo-
biles, not to mention RVs and trailers, so we recommend parking in one
of the free lots on the edge of town (signs direct you to them) and using
the trolley service to shuttle between all the major attractions.
From Cooperstown, we head north on SR 80 along the shores of Otsego
Lake, which Cooper called “Glimmerglass” in his stories, and past Hyde
Hall in Glimmerglass State Park, the ancestral home of the Coopers.
Part III: Exploring the East 
134

Turn west on U.S. 20, and then go north on SR 28 across the Mohawk River
to Herkimer. If it’s time to stop for the night, drive 7 miles north, contin-
uing on SR 28, to the Herkimer Diamond KOA (see “Our favorite camp-
grounds,” later in this chapter) and the Herkimer Diamond Mines (see
“More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). Not really dia-
monds, these naturally faceted quartz crystals are nice to display as min-
eral samples; prospecting season runs from April through mid-November.
From Herkimer, follow SR 5 south to Rome, and then take SR 69 to SRs 46
and 49, leading to the Erie Canal Village, a living history museum near
the spot where the first shovelful of earth was turned for the original
canal. The village is a reconstruction of a 19th-century canal village 
created by moving 15 historic buildings here from other places in the
region. Costumed reenacators re-create the 1840s (see “Must-see attrac-
tions,” later in this chapter).
Return to I-90 and continue west to Syracuse, where, if you enjoyed the
Erie Canal Village, you can visit the Erie Canal Museum (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter). Then take SR 174 and SR 175
to Skaneateles (pronounced sken-ee-at-tel-les and nicknamed “Skinny
Atlas”), a pretty little town full of boutiques, flowers, and cafes. From
Skaneateles, drive west on U.S. 20 through Auburn to the north end of
Cayuga Lake and turn south on SR 89 and follow the lakeside road, lined
with wineries, south to Ithaca.
Ithaca, notable as the home of Cornell University and Ithaca College,
is one of many New York towns named for classical cities. Built on steep
hills, the city is a challenge for RV drivers; if you want to look around,
Chapter 13: Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls 135
Seneca Falls: Feminist tour stop
In the same way that Memorial Day began in nearby Waterloo as a holiday honoring
the dead from the Civil War, the town of Seneca Falls devoted its energies to the rights
and achievements of women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a housewife and mother of
seven, organized and led the first women’s rights convention there in 1848.
So many powerful females are associated with this area — in Seneca Falls, Stanton
and Amelia Jenks Bloomer, who invented and paraded in the divided full skirt named
for her; in Auburn, Harriet Tubman, a major force on the Underground Railroad; and 
in Rochester, suffragist Susan B. Anthony — that serious feminists must pause for 
a look. Highlights in Seneca Falls include Stanton’s birthplace, 32 Washington St. 
(% 315-568-2991; open daily except holidays 9 a.m.–5 p.m.); the National Women’s
Hall of Fame, 76 Fall St. (% 315-568-8060; www.greatwomen.org; open daily 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.), honoring outstanding women from the arts, athletics, science, gov-
ernment, and philanthropy; and the Women’s Rights National Historical Park, 136 Fall
St. (% 315-568-2991; www.nps.gov/wori; open daily except holidays 9 a.m.–5 p.m.),
the restored home of Stanton and the site of the first convention.

park in one of the large lots downtown near the river around Buffalo
Street (where the lake cruises take off), and explore on foot.
Head out of town on SR 13, driving southwest to Elmira, home of Mark
Twain’s study, now ensconced on the campus of Elmira College (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). From Elmira, continue west
on I-86 to Corning, home of the famous Corning Glass Museum (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). If it’s snack time, try the
1880s ice-cream parlor at Ice Cream Works on West Market Street for
some imaginative flavors including wine ice cream.
From Corning, take scenic SR 414 north to Watkins Glen and drive the
west shore of Seneca Lake north to Geneva and Seneca Falls.
From Seneca Falls, the short drive west on I-90 takes you to Rochester,
where shutterbugs may want to visit George Eastman’s former home, now
the George Eastman House and International Museum of Photography
and Film (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). Suffragette
Susan B. Anthony and abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass also were
born and buried in Rochester.
From here we head south again, first on I-490 to SR 19, and then SR 19A
south to Belfast, where we turn west on SR 305 to Cuba. Cuba is home to
the Cuba Cheese Shop (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
The drive west along I-86 or SR 417 between Olean and Salamanca takes
us past Allegany State Park, a 65,000-acre park with plenty of hiking trails
and four different campgrounds with a total of 316 sites (see “Our
favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter).
From Salamanca, take I-86 over to Jamestown at the east end of Lake
Chautauqua. Native daughter Lucille Ball is remembered in the Lucy-
Desi Museum here (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Part III: Exploring the East 
136
Salamanca secrets
Salamanca is believed to be the largest American city on an Indian reservation — in
this case, the Allegany Indian Reservation. Two interesting museums in town are the
fine Seneca-Iroquois National Museum, 794–814 Broad St. (% 716-945-1738;
www.senecamuseum.org; open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.), which
combines history with contemporary arts and crafts, and the Salamanca Rail Museum,
170 Main St. (% 716-945-3133; open Mon–Sat 10am–5 p.m., Sun noon–5 p.m.), where
a 1912 passenger depot, now used for exhibition space, marks the spot where three
major railroad lines once converged.

Some of the Ohio Amish resettled in this part of New York in 1949 in and
around the town of Conewango Valley, 5 miles farther north on U.S. 62.
Mueller’s Valley View Cheese Factory (see “Good eats,” later in this
chapter) offers free samples of locally made cheese along with other
Amish cheeses from Ohio.
At the west end of Lake Chautauqua on SR 394 is Mayville, where Webb’s
Candy Factory offers free tours and samples of goat-milk fudge, a local
delicacy (see “Good eats”). Don’t worry if you don’t think you’d like it;
they also make several other types of candy.
From Mayville, SR 58 travels north to New York’s spiritualism centers,
Cassadaga and Lily Dale, where assemblies delve into mysterious mat-
ters for ten weeks every summer. From Lily Dale, take SR 60 to Fredonia,
home of a splendidly restored 1891 Opera House, but it bears no sign 
of the Marx Brothers, who borrowed the town’s name for their film 
Duck Soup.
From Fredonia, take I-90 to Exit 57A to Eden (see the “Do you kazoo?” side-
bar). And then, from Eden, drive north about 10 miles on U.S. 62 to the
junction of Alternate U.S. 20, where you turn east to go to East Aurora, one
of the most beguiling little towns in the state. Interesting to students of
architecture and furnishings is the Elbert Hubbard Roycroft Museum, the
American arm of the Arts and Crafts movement of the early days of the
20th century (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
On the way to Aurora, if bicycles are an interest, pause in Orchard Park
for the Pedaling History Bicycle Museum, displaying 300 bikes includ-
ing a replica of the 1817 Irish Mail four-wheel velocipede, the first ever
made, some late 19th-century “boneshakers,” and many historic acces-
sories (see “More cool things to see and do”).
Kids usually like the Toy Town Museum in East Aurora, which has a big
collection of antique toys, including many from the local Fisher-Price
plant (see “More cool things to see and do”).
Chapter 13: Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls 137
Do you kazoo?
In Eden, off I-90’s Exit 57A, about halfway between Fredonia and Buffalo (follow the
signs from the exit, 4 miles east to the town of Eden), you find the Original American
Kazoo Company, the only remaining factory in the world still producing the metal kazoo
at 8703 S. Main St. (% 716-992-3960; www.edenkazoo.com; open Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–
5 p.m.; closed Sun, Mon, and holidays). Visitors get a free look around the 1916 facil-
ity (or a free guided tour if they call ahead for an appointment).

SR 400 is the quickest way into Buffalo and is the way to go if you want
to taste what we consider the best roast beef sandwich in America —
the beef on weck at Schwabl’s in West Seneca (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
Buffalo, of course, is the birthplace of world-famous “Buffalo wings,” a
snack so popular it has created its own humor. (“What do you do with
the rest of the buffalo?”) To taste the original, we visited the Anchor Bar
and Restaurant (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter), in a fairly grungy
neighborhood near downtown where owner Teressa Bellissimo is cred-
ited with inventing the spicy treat in 1964. Do as we did — go by in the
daytime and get the wings to go. The bar is a dark neighborhood joint lit
inside primarily by neon beer signs night and day.
In North Tonawanda, north of Buffalo on SR 265/384, is the Herschel
Carrousel Factory Museum, with its own historic carrousel (see “Must-
see attractions,” later in this chapter); a ride is included in the basic
fare. On the way to or from the museum, plan a detour to Sheridan Road
(SR 324) in Tonawanda to Ted’s Red Hots, one of America’s great hot
dog emporiums (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Buffalo is only 25 miles from Niagara Falls (see “Must-see attractions”).
We like to camp on Grand Island, a big island in the middle of the Niagara
River near the falls. The KOA there can arrange rentals and tours to the
falls, so you can leave your RV plugged in and strike out on your own.
Must-see attractions
Corning Glass Museum
Corning
The striking exhibit hall displays fine contemporary glass art, including
several examples by Dale Chihuly. The Glass Sculpture Gallery, Hot Glass
Show, the Corning Museum of Glass, The Studio, Steuben Factory, the
Windows Gallery, the Glass Innovation Center, and the Glass Shops offer a
primer on everything that you ever wanted to know about art glass from
glassblowing to its 3,500 years of history. Allow two hours, more if you
want to browse through the shops.

Erie Canal Village
Rome
The Erie Canal, constructed between 1817 and 1825, opened up western
New York and the Great Lakes to settlement and trade. Near where the first
Part III: Exploring the East 
138

shovelful of earth was turned for the canal is a reconstruction of a 19th-
century village with 15 historic buildings moved there from around the
area. A horse-drawn packet boat takes visitors for a ride along the canal,
craftspeople work in the village and sell their wares, and several museums
and a movie highlight historic features and artifacts. The lively history les-
sons make most kids forget that they’re learning something. The oddest
exhibit is the so-called Cardiff Giant, a 10-foot figure dug up in 1869 on a
local farm and believed to have been a petrified prehistoric man. It turned
out to be a hoax, but P. T. Barnum took “the giant” on tour anyhow. A
narrow-gauge steam train tours the site. Allow a half-day.

George Eastman House and International 
Museum of Photography and Film
Rochester
Bank clerk George Eastman worked for years to turn photography into a
more portable art, and by 1888, he had his first Kodak on the market. Soon
afterward, he gained control of the celluloid coating process that made
film. His elegant mansion has been restored to his day with many original
furnishings, and modern galleries showcase masterworks of photography
and motion pictures. A collection of some 6,000 still cameras and a library
of 42,000 books and manuscripts about film and photography also are
open by appointment. Allow two to three hours.

how they were made and who made them. A self-guiding brochure takes
you through the various work areas in the factory and describes what went
on in each. A beautiful collection of carrousel horses plus a working 1916
Allan Herschell carrousel are on the premises. Both you and the kids get
a free ride with each admission. Allow two to three hours.

Lucy-Desi Museum
Jamestown
Lucille Ball, of I Love Lucy fame, was born in Jamestown in 1911, and this
museum was dedicated to her and her husband and straight man, Desi
Arnaz, in the summer of 1996. TV and movie clips, interactive displays,
collections of artifacts and clothing, and even a complete replica of Lucy’s
bedroom/study with original furniture are all on hand. A gift shop sells sou-

Mark Twain’s Study
Elmira
A glass-windowed octagon built in 1874 to resemble a riverboat pilot house
was created for Twain’s use as a study when he visited his wife’s sister’s
Quarry Farm outside Elmira. Inside, he wrote some or all of his most
famous works, including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn. In 1952, the study was moved to Elmira College.
(Previously, the Langdon family resisted all efforts from Henry Ford to buy
the study for his Dearborn, Michigan, museum.) Memorabilia, period fur-
niture, and photographs are on display. Allow one hour.
1 Park Place, Elmira College. % 607-735-1941. www.elmira.edu/academics/
distinctive_programs/twain_center. RV parking: Street or designated 
lot. Free admission. Open: Mid-June–Labor Day daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; the rest of the
year by appointment only.
National Baseball Hall of Fame
Cooperstown
This is one of America’s favorite family summer destinations. Many stay 
in the area several days to cover everything. The legendary “Doubleday
baseball” on display is believed to have been the ball used in 1839 when
Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Elihu Phinney’s cow pasture one
afternoon — if, in fact, that ever happened, which some experts doubt.
Additional artifacts also are on hand, from Jackie Robinson’s warm-up
jacket to Joe DiMaggio’s locker; Ty Cobb’s sliding pads to Yogi Berra’s
glove; and bats used for record-breaking home runs by Babe Ruth, Roger
Maris, Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, and Mark McGwire. The original game,
called “town ball,” involved anywhere from 20 to 40 people and is reen-
acted occasionally at the Farmers’ Museum (see “More cool things to see
and do,” later in this chapter). Allow three hours to three days.
25 Main St. % 888-425-5633 or 607-547-7200. www.baseballhalloffame.org.

Niagara Falls
Niagara Falls, New York and Canada
You can view the awesome trio of waterfalls — American Falls and Bridal
Veil Falls on the American side and Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side —
on foot, in a boat, from an observation deck, and from vantage points in
two countries. A first-time visitor, especially during peak season when
many of the 12 million annual visitors are milling about, should take a
guided tour and put up with being herded along rather than standing in
long lines. You also need to consider just how wet you’re willing to get in
pursuit of a great photo. Although virtually all the tours provide plastic
raincoats, you’re still going to get splashed.
If you’re staying in one of the nearby campgrounds, such as the Niagara
Falls KOA, you can book a bus sightseeing tour that picks you up at the
campground. The most praised vantage point (and one of the wettest) is
from the deck of the Maid of the Mist boats that cruise directly in front of
the three falls. (Maid of the Mist has its own parking lot accessed by
Prospect Street.) If you’re on foot, the Cave of the Winds tour begins with
an elevator ride from Goat Island down to the base of Bridal Veil Falls and
a stroll across a wooden walkway to within 25 feet of the falls.
If you want to do it on your own, allow even more time and try to leave
your RV back at the campground. Niagara Reservation State Park, south of
town off the Robert Moses Parkway, provides a close-up of American Falls.
Goat Island, with two big parking lots, is accessed from First Street by the
Niagara Rapids Bridge (also called Goat Island Bridge).
From Table Rock House on the Canadian side, reached by Niagara Parkway,
1 mile south of Rainbow Bridge, three tunnels open up to good vistas of the
falls. To cross the border into Canada, you need a passport or photo ID
and birth certificate. To get back into the U.S., you need a passport.
More cool things to see and do
Whether an attraction belongs in the “Must-see” or “More cool things”
category is often a tossup. The following are some mainstream and off-
beat places to go in western New York — you may find that some of
these qualify as “Must-sees” on your trip:
 Live in style. East Aurora became the home of the Roycroft design
style, strongly influenced and represented by designer Gustaf Stickley
and his Mission furniture. Perhaps the most stunning display of this
design is the elegant Roycroft Inn, 40 South Grove St. (where you
can stay overnight if you feel inclined to leave your vehicle!), and
the Elbert Hubbard Roycroft Museum, 363 Oakwood Ave., East
Aurora (% 716-652-4735; www.roycrofter.com/museum.htm),
Chapter 13: Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls 141

which displays examples from the American wing of the Arts and
Crafts movement from the early 20th century. Allow 1 to 2 hours;
more if you’re a fan of the style.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free, but a dona-
tion is requested. The museum is open June 7 through October 31,
usually Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, from 1 to 4 p.m.; call for
exact hours.
 Sing “Oh, the Ear-eye-eee was a’risin.’” A National Historic
Landmark, the Erie Canal Museum, 318 Erie Blvd., East Syracuse
(% 315-471-0593; www.eriecanalmuseum.org), is in the last of
the weighlock buildings that once served as weigh stations along
the canal. You can see crew quarters inside a replica canal boat and
find out about immigration along the canal during the 19th century.
Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot or on the street. Admission
is free, but a donation of $4 is requested. It’s open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 Farmers’ Museum is 1 mile north of town on SR 80, Lake Road,
Cooperstown (% 607-547-1450; www.farmersmuseum.org). RV
parking is available in a designated off-road lot. Admission is $11
adults, $9.50 seniors, $5 ages 7 to 12. A combination ticket with the
Fenimore Art Museum costs $18 adults, $8 children. A combina-
tion ticket with the Fenimore Art Museum and the Baseball Hall of
Fame is $29 adults, $12 ages 7 to 12.
If you want to visit the Farmers’ Museum and/or the Fenimore Art
Museum along with the Baseball Hall of Fame, note that the latter
two are closed from January through March. The Farmers’ Museum
is open from April 1 to May 12, Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m., closed Monday. Limited buildings are open and staffed, and
a reduced admission rate applies. From May 13 to Columbus Day,
the museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and fully staffed
and all buildings are open. From Columbus Day through October
31, it’s open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with limited
buildings and staff, and reduced admission. The Museum is closed
through the rest of the year, with the exception of Thanksgiving
weekend, and a Candlelight Evening in December.
 Follow Leatherstocking trails. A fine collection of American art and
examples of folk art from the permanent collection of the Fenimore
Art Museum, SR 80, Lake Road, Cooperstown (% 607-547-1400;
www.fenimoreartmuseum.org), fill the former home of author
James Fenimore Cooper. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $11 adults,
$9.50 seniors, $5 ages 7 to 12. A combination ticket with the Farmers’
Museum is $18 adults, $8 children. A combination ticket with the
Farmers’ Museum and Baseball Hall of Fame is $29 adults, $12
ages 7 to 12, but as mentioned above, the Farmers’ Museum and
Part III: Exploring the East 
142

Fenimore Art Museum are closed from January through March. 
The Fenimore museum opens on April 1 each year. Until May 12, 
it’s open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and closed
Monday. From May 13 to Columbus Day, it’s open daily from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. From Columbus Day until December 31, it’s open Tuesday
to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and closed Monday. It’s also
closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
 Glitter, New York style. All that glitters around the Herkimer
Diamond Mines, 5661 SR 5, Herkimer (% 800-562-0897 or 315-
891-7355; www.herkimerdiamond.com), is more likely to be doubly
terminated quartz crystals than diamonds, but beginners can keep
what they dig, and you can buy samples from a gift shop. Digging
equipment is available on-site. Allow two to three hours.
The mines are at the Herkimer Diamond KOA (see “Our favorite
campgrounds,” later in this chapter). There is plenty of space for
RV parking. Admission is $9 adults, $8 ages 7 to 12; $1 discount for
campground residents. The mines are open April through
November 15, weather permitting.
 Follow the Jell-O brick road. The brick walkway leads to the 
Jell-O Gallery, 23 E. Main St., LeRoy (% 585-768-7433; www.jello
museum.com), where a carpenter named Pearle Wait invented this
amazing dessert. His wife, May, named it Jell-O, taking her inspira-
tion from a local coffee substitute named Grain-O, but the pair
couldn’t seem to market it successfully (that was in the days before
Bill Cosby), so they sold the rights to Grain-O mogul Orator F.
Woodward for $450. This museum lovingly re-creates the product’s
history, including original advertising art, Jell-O jokes, and interac-
tive displays. Allow one to two hours.
The parking lot in this residential area is small, but RV parking is
available on the street. Admission is $4 adults, $1.50 ages 6 to 11.
It’s open from Memorial Day through Labor Day Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4 p.m.
 Pedal into history. The world’s largest bicycle museum with more
than 300 vehicles is the Pedaling History Bicycle Museum, 3943
Buffalo Rd., SR 240/277 (% 716-662-3853; www.pedalinghistory.
com), in Orchard Park, south of Buffalo. Find history, nostalgia,
technology, and a gift shop.
RV parking is available in the parking lot. Admission is $7.50 adults,
$6.75 seniors, $4.65 ages 17 and younger, $23 for families of up to
eight people. The museum is open Monday through Saturday from
11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1:30 to 5 p.m. From January 15 through
April 1, it’s closed Tuesday through Thursday.
 Toys R them. Rare, one-of-a-kind Fisher-Price toys manufactured in
East Aurora as early as 1930 are the focus of the antique collections
at Toy Town Museum, 636 Girard Ave., East Aurora (% 716-687-5151;
www.toytownusa.com). Tin windup toys, hand-carved carrousels,
Chapter 13: Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls 143

dollhouses, marionettes, and a fully stocked gift shop with famous-
label American and European toys highlight this unique museum.
Allow two hours.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free, but dona-
tions are suggested. It’s open Monday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Weekend wonders
This zigzag drive through western New York can be simplified and
stripped down to basic components if you start in Cooperstown, spend
half a day at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, then follow SR 28 to I-90,
head west to Rome and pause at the Erie Canal Village for a couple of
hours, and then on to Syracuse. Pause for a tip of the hat to the feminist
cause at West Seneca, take a quick photo of Seneca Lake, and shuffle off
to Buffalo, allowing a half-day to see Niagara Falls.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Western New York has plenty of private and public campgrounds, plus
New York’s excellent state parks, so you won’t need to worry about where
to sleep. Campground reservations are a good idea in July and August
anywhere around Cooperstown, Niagara Falls, and state parks that accept
reservations. If you’re traveling in spring or fall, you shouldn’t have a
problem finding room anywhere without reservations except during a
major annual event, such as an auto race at Watkins Glen or the New York
State Fair in Syracuse.
All campgrounds in this section are open year-round and have public
flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated
otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only. See
Chapter 9 for how we choose our favorite campgrounds.

Whether you’re in the mood for dining or snacking, western New York
has the spot for you. When you prefer to eat in, see details on area mar-
kets in “Stocking the Pantry,” earlier in this chapter.
The full-meal deal
Around western New York, almost anything can be breaded or batter-
dipped and deep-fried as a meal or snack. Local favorites both in and 
out of the fryer include such treats as grape pie (you’ll find it around
Naples in the Finger Lakes); white hots (mild) and red hots (spicy) in
Chapter 13: Western New York: Cooperstown to Niagara Falls 147

the frankfurter category; and Buffalo’s beef on weck (see Schwabl’s in
the list that follows), Buffalo wings, and chicken lips (breaded and fried
cubes of chicken breast — see Anchor Bar in the following list).
 Anchor Bar and Restaurant, 1047 Main St., Buffalo (% 716-886-8920;
www.anchorbar.com): According to a duly notarized proclamation
from the mayor of the city in 1977, this restaurant was the birth-
place of spicy buffalo wings in 1964. The late Teressa and Frank
Bellissimo, proprietors, created them as a late-night snack for
friends of their son, who dropped by the restaurant one busy Friday
night. Other claimants say the wings already were a local staple 
but that Teressa added the celery stalks and blue cheese dressing.
Sauce choices range from plain to mild, medium, medium-hot, hot,
or suicidal. Open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., and
Sunday noon to 11 p.m.
 Charlie the Butcher’s Kitchen, 1065 Wehrle Dr. at Cayuga,
Williamsville (% 716-633-8330; www.charliethebutcher.com):
This small, casual lunch counter near the Buffalo airport special-
izes in beef on weck, a sandwich with thinly sliced roast beef
stacked in a kummelweck, a Kaiser roll topped with coarse salt 
and caraway seeds. Open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 
10 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Eckl’s Restaurant, 4936 Ellicott Rd., Orchard Park (% 716-662-
2262): Another classic eatery featuring the beef on weck sandwich,
Eckl’s garnishes its version with hot, freshly ground horseradish.
This stop can be handy for an early dinner if you’re visiting the
Pedaling History Bicycle Museum in Orchard Park, because it’s
closed at lunchtime but opens at 4:30 in the afternoon. Open daily
from 4:30 to 11:30 p.m.
 Schwabl’s, 789 Center Rd., West Seneca (% 716-674-9821; www.
schwabls.com): This place makes the greatest roast beef sandwich
on Earth. The superlative beef on weck boasts tender slices of rare
round roast on a kummelweck moistened with a bit of pan juices
and a dab of horseradish. A civilized old-fashioned bar at the
entrance serves classic Manhattans and martinis. There’s no use
asking for takeout here; the proprietors won’t risk letting the sand-
wich wait beyond its perfect moment. Open Monday through
Saturday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday 1 to 8:30 p.m.
 Ted’s Red Hots, 2312 Sheridan Dr., Tonawanda (% 716-834-6287;
www.tedsonline.com): Order regular or foot-long hot dogs cooked
before your eyes on a charcoal grill until they’re dark brown, siz-
zling, and smoky. Add your choice of toppings — order the hot
sauce. Don’t walk out without a side of their shatteringly crisp
onion rings, crunchy on the outside and chewy sweet inside. The
local drink of choice is loganberry juice. Open daily from 10:30 a.m.
to 11 p.m. Note: Ted’s Ret Hots has eight other locations; check the
Web site for the others.

Nibbles along the way
Western New York produces plenty of cheese, mostly cheddar types, and
does a lively business in fresh cheese curds, which around Salamanca
may also be batter-dipped and deep-fried as a snack.
 Cooperstown Brewing Company, River Street, Milford (% 607-286-
9330; www.cooperstownbrewing.com): This English-style micro-
brewery produces Old Slugger, among other popular varieties.
Tours are available year-round daily at 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 
4 p.m., and 5 p.m., plus free samples in the tasting room.
 Cuba Cheese Shop, 53 Gesee St., Cuba (% 800-543-4938 or
585-968-3949; www.cubacheese.com): The shop carries more than a
hundred varieties of imported and domestic cheeses, including
some made on the premises. Fresh cheese curds are a big seller;
taste a free sample if you don’t buy a bag. Open Monday through
Friday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 DiCamillo’s Bakery, 811 Linwood Ave., Niagara Falls (% 800-634-
4363 or 716-282-2341; www.dicamillobakery.com): DiCamillo’s
has been turning out Italian breads, including flatbread and bis-
cotti, for more than 80 years, and the retail outlets (several in
Niagara Falls) pride themselves on displays and packaging in addi-
tion to the goodies inside. Open daily from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Mueller’s Valley View Cheese Factory, SR 62, Conewango Valley
(% 716-296-5821): Some 40 varieties of Amish cheese are made
here. Products from other Amish cheese factories in New York and
Ohio also are for sale. Open Monday through Saturday from 8:30
a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed Sunday.
 Webb’s Candy Factory, Route 394, Mayville (% 716-753-1381;
www.citruscandy.com): Goat-milk fudge started it all, but today,
this candy factory turns out many candies cooked in old-fashioned
copper kettles. Free tours take place between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Blue Ridge Mountains:
Skyline Drive and Blue
Ridge Parkway
In This Chapter
 Cruising the crest of the mountains
 Looking for down-home crafts
 Pigging out on country ham
 Scoping out the Smokies
T
he Blue Ridge Mountains once were America’s western frontier, and
the fiercely independent Scotch-Irish settlers who built isolated
homesteads with logs and mud chinking were pioneers of the same mold
as those who later set out from here in covered wagons to cross the
plains to Oregon. The men split dead chestnut into rails, calling the
zigzag fence patterns “snake,” or “buck,” or “post and rail.” The women
made quilts from clothing scraps and named them Double Wedding Ring
and Flower Garden and Crazy Quilt.
Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridge Parkway are the essence of the south-
ern mountains. They meander easily through time and space to touch 
a mountain homestead or a stretch of wilderness unchanged since the
days of Daniel Boone. Back roads and byways seem to beckon around
every curve (and plenty of curves are on these routes).
Skyline Drive mileposts are numbered from north to south, beginning
with 0.6 at Front Royal’s fee entrance station and ending with 105 at
Rockfish Gap and the entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway, which begins
numbering its mileposts north to south at 0 again, ending with mile 469
where the parkway intersects U.S. 441 in Cherokee at the entrance to
the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although frequent turnouts
are situated all along the way, not all are long enough for a motorhome
or a vehicle towing a trailer.

Map Area
Map Area

Expect sometimes long and slow-moving lines of traffic during spring
blossom, late summer, and autumn foliage seasons. Many of the facilities
along the route are closed during winter. Plan early morning starts, when
the air usually is clearest, and then stop in early afternoon to set up
camp and take a hike.
Getting There
This north-to-south journey begins just south of the Washington/Baltimore
urban area in Front Royal, Virginia, at the beginning of the Skyline Drive
in Shenandoah National Park (see the “Blue Ridge Mountains” map on
p. 152 for the route). The drive follows Skyline Drive to the place where
it merges with Blue Ridge Parkway and then continues along the park-
way through Virginia and North Carolina, all the way to the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park. For convenience — in case you want to fly 
in and rent an RV for the drive — we’ve made the southern terminus
Knoxville, Tennessee. The distance of the drive, without detours into
adjacent towns, is 643 miles.
The smooth, two-lane roads of Skyline Drive, Blue Ridge Parkway, and the
Newfound Gap Road across the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
are closed to commercial vehicles. Note: Posted speed limits are strictly
enforced. The maximum limit on the Blue Ridge Parkway is 45 mph.
Planning Ahead
All seasons are beautiful on these drives, but winter can bring heavy
fogs, even light snow or a glaze of ice on the roadway, so you need to
plan to travel in spring, fall, or summer.
In spring, flame azalea, pink rhododendron, and mountain laurel deco-
rate the roadsides, beginning sometime in March, with some color lin-
gering through the summer.
In summer, shade trees that follow the roadway provide a cool escape
from the lowlands heat; if you don’t believe us, take a few minutes to
drive off the parkways and down into a nearby town. The parkway, even
on the warmest days, is a good 10 degrees cooler than the valleys.
Autumn is magnificent. The route becomes a spectacle of crimson-leafed
black gums and sourwoods, maples and dogwoods, birch and buckeye,
orange sassafras, and purple sumac.
Fog can occur during any season in the mountains. When you run into
heavy fog on Skyline Drive or the Blue Ridge Parkway, try to exit and
drive to a lower elevation out of the fog. After you’re on lower ground,
take a break and do some shopping or sightseeing, or drive in your
Part III: Exploring the East 
154

intended direction parallel to the parkway. With no guardrails and the
narrow two-lane roads, maneuvering an RV, especially towing a trailer,
can be tricky. And if you’re driving slowly, you may become a hazard to
other drivers, who may not see you in the fog until they’re right on your
rear bumper.
Because this region, especially the Great Smoky Mountains, is one of the
most visited in the United States, you need to make campground reser-
vations wherever possible between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Even
spring and autumn weekends are busy in the Shenandoah and Great
Smoky Mountains National Parks.
You want to pack a variety of clothing weights, even in summer. The
mountains can get cool and rainy any time of year, and you’ll want a
jacket or sweater. Always take rain gear; we’ve experienced drenching
thunderstorms in the Smokies. Hiking boots are preferable to jogging
shoes on mountain trails, but take both along. (That’s another advan-
tage of RVing; you have plenty of room for everything, and your clothes
are already hanging in the closet.)
Plan to spend at least a week or two weeks, if time permits, and try to
get in some hiking, biking, golf, or fishing.
Stocking the Pantry
While on the parkways and in the park, you have little opportunity to
buy food supplies. Campground stores carry undersized and overpriced
bottles, cans, and jars of food if you run out of something at the last
minute, so you definitely want to do your major shopping off the route in
towns and cities.
If you’re stocking up before getting on Skyline Drive in northern 
Virginia, and it’s a Friday or Saturday, consider a short 10-mile detour to
Middletown, where “the world’s smallest potato chip factory” turns out
crunchy Route 11 and Yukon Gold potato chips that are sold only in the
region. The factory welcomes visitors Fridays and Saturdays. The rest of
the time you have to search for the chips in grocery stores in northern
Virginia. (See “Good eats,” later in this chapter.)
In Galax, Virginia, near the Virginia/North Carolina border, a large 
Wal-Mart has a full supply of groceries, fresh meats, and produce about
10 miles off the Blue Ridge Parkway on U.S. 58/221 (take U.S. 52 west
from the parkway to Hillsville, and then head south on U.S. 58/221 to
Galax). Closer still is a certified Virginia farmers’ market in Hillsville
open daily except Sunday spring through fall. A North Carolina farmers’
market is near Asheville. Both markets carry country ham, other
smoked meats, and home-baked breads and sweets.
Chapter 14: Blue Ridge Mountains 155

Driving on Skyline Drive and 
Blue Ridge Parkway
Stop at the first visitor center on Skyline Drive and on Blue Ridge
Parkway to pick up free mile-by-mile folders that list the highlights and
facilities along the routes.
The beginning of Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park is only an
hour away from the Washington/Baltimore area; zoom west on I-66 to
Exit 6 to Front Royal, Virginia, where Skyline Drive begins only 2 miles
south of I-66. Skyline Drive parallels the Appalachian Trail, a famous
hiking and riding trail that wends along the crest of the mountains more
than 2,000 miles from Maine to Georgia. It also skirts many of the Civil
War battlefields, including Manassas National Battlefield Park (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter), 40 miles east of Front Royal
and the beginning of Skyline Drive.
The first 28 miles of the route, Front Royal to Beahms Gap, climbs more
than 1,000 feet, past several overlooks. Dickey Ridge Visitor Center
at milepost 4.6 is a good place to pick up maps, postcards, and books.
Pocket-size identification guides for birds, trees, wild animals, and 
wildflowers also can be purchased at the center. At Elkwallow, milepost
24, you can buy food, ice, gasoline, and souvenirs between May and
October, and picnic in a designated area year-round.
At Thornton Gap, milepost 31.5, U.S. 211 to Luray and Warrenton
crosses the parkway, and a restaurant and gift shop are open in season.
At milepost 41.7, Skyland, at 3,680 feet, is the highest point on Skyline
Drive. It features a lodge with dining room and gift shop. The Limberlost
Trail at milepost 43 is accessible to wheelchairs, but some assistance is
needed. This 11⁄2-mile loop makes an easy circle through an abandoned
orchard and a grove of old hemlocks. You may see deer, and even wild
turkeys, through much of this area.
From Hawksbill Gap at milepost 45.6 to Big Meadows at 51.9, you see
low stone fences along the parkway and can camp at Big Meadows
Campground (reservations are usually required). Two other camp-
grounds, Lewis Mountain at milepost 57.5 and Loft Mountain at mile-
post 79.5, don’t accept reservations. Loft Mountain is our favorite of the
three. (See the “Shenandoah National Park campgrounds” sidebar in this
chapter.)
At Rockfish Gap, milepost 105.4, Skyline Drive runs right into Blue
Ridge Parkway, where milepost numbers revert to 0.
Twelve miles west of the parkway via I-64 is Staunton (pronounced 
stan-ton), birthplace of Woodrow Wilson and home of the Museum of
American Frontier Culture, an excellent living-history park that explores
the origins of the Shenandoah Valley’s first settlers, who came from
Part III: Exploring the East 
156

farms in England, Germany, and Ireland, and how they adapted architec-
tural and farming methods to the new world (see “Must-see attractions,”
later in this chapter).
Travel 30 miles east of Rockfish Gap and you come to Charlottesville,
home of the University of Virginia and Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello,
the magnificent (but not grandiose) home that he designed and built for
himself (see “Must-see attractions”). His gardens are also on display. An
avid vegetable gardener, Jefferson introduced eggplant to the United
States, so you probably either love him or hate him.
At mealtime around Charlottesville, the historic Michie (pronounced
mik-e) Tavern is famous for its fried chicken and biscuits, black-eyed
peas and cornbread; unfortunately, it’s also popular with bus tours, so
you may want to drive right on past if the parking lot’s full of buses, and
head instead to Hardware Store Restaurant for a gourmet sandwich.
Both restaurants also serve local Virginia wines. Thomas Jefferson, a
noted wine lover, cultivated some of the earliest wine grapes in this area
of Virginia. You get an instant introduction to the scenery and the type
of uphill and downhill climbing and curves that you must negotiate on
the Blue Ridge Parkway. The road climbs dramatically from 1,900-foot
Rockfish Gap past Wintergreen Ski Resort to Yankee Horse Ridge at
3,140 feet. Then it starts downhill again to the James River — at 649 feet,
it’s the lowest elevation on the parkway. Then you go up again in only 12
miles to the highest elevation on the Virginia stretch of parkway — Apple
Orchard Mountain at 3,950 feet. The name comes from the shapes into
which the winter wind has twisted the northern red oaks, making them
resemble apple trees.
The Peaks of Otter Visitor Center, milepost 85.6, features a lodge with a
restaurant that’s open year-round, a seasonal store, gift shop, and serv-
ice station. Just past the center, at mile 86, SR 43 turns east to Bedford,
the location of the National D-Day Memorial (see “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter).
The junction of SR 43 with U.S. 220 at milepost 121.4 leads to the city of
Roanoke, the largest urban area along the parkway. The short detour to
see the Roanoke City Market, a historic farmers’ market still vending
fresh produce and baked goods, is worthwhile (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter), and so is Virginia’s Explore Park, a living-history museum
open during the summer with crafts demonstrations and special events
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Mabry Mill at milepost 176.1 is a must-visit for the colorful old mill that
still grinds corn into cornmeal and the adjacent Mabry Mill Coffee Shop
that serves pancakes made out of the cornmeal with its wonderful coun-
try ham and eggs breakfasts (see “Good eats”).
At Fancy Gap, milepost 199.5, the parkway intersects U.S. 52. A 14-mile
detour south takes you into the town of Mount Airy, North Carolina,
Chapter 14: Blue Ridge Mountains 157

birthplace of TV’s Andy Griffith and said to be the real-life prototype of
Mayberry RFD. (One of this book’s authors also grew up in Mount Airy
but sees no resemblance whatsoever between her hometown and the
bucolic community of Mayberry. But hey, it brings in the tourists.) The
fried pork-chop sandwich at the Snappy Lunch (see “Good eats”), often
referred to on the TV series, is worth the detour.
At milepost 291.9, the parkway intersects U.S. 221 to Boone and Blowing
Rock. Eight miles west of Boone is the great-granddaddy of country
stores in the tiny hamlet of Valle Crucis — the original Mast General
Store, opened in 1883 (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
The flower-filled community of Blowing Rock was a big tourist attrac-
tion at the end of the 19th century for its Blowing Rock, an outthrust
ledge of stone with updrafts of wind that return lightweight objects like a
handkerchief dropped over the edge of the gorge. The rock even has its
own lovers’ legend. Today’s more sophisticated travelers tend to bypass
it in favor of the natural scenery of the region.
Back on the parkway at milepost 292.7 is the fine Parkway Craft Center,
just the place to pick up a handcrafted rocking chair, homemade quilt, or
distinctive hand-thrown pottery (see “Shopping along the Way,” later in
this chapter).
In Asheville, native son Thomas Wolfe’s childhood home, which he por-
trayed as a fictional Dixieland boarding house in Look Homeward, Angel
can be visited. Fire damaged the interior several years ago, but an inte-
rior reconstruction that took nearly six years (from 1998 until 2004) has
restored it (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Writer F. Scott Fitzgerald also is associated with Asheville, because his
wife, Zelda, spent the last years of her life in a hospital near there.
The most visited attraction in Asheville, however, is the palatial
Biltmore Estate (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter), the
largest private home in the United States, now a museum. Commissioned
by George W. Vanderbilt in 1895, the 250-room mansion may be familiar
to moviegoers who’ve seen the 1979 Peter Sellers film Being There or the
1994 Macaulay Culkin flick Richie Rich.
At milepost 469, Cherokee, North Carolina, is near the entrance to the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Skip the touristy side of town,
particularly the “Indian chiefs” who stand outside curio stands in feath-
ered headdresses borrowed from the Great Plains tribes, waiting to pose
for a $5 souvenir photo. Instead, discover the history of the Cherokee
and their arts and crafts at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian and the
Oconaluftee Indian Village (see “More cool things to see and do,” later
in this chapter).
Choose one of several ways to see Great Smoky Mountains National
Park — the quick tourist drive-through from Cherokee to Gatlinburg
Part III: Exploring the East 
158

across Newfound Gap Road, with the option of a side trip up to Clingman’s
Dome, the highest point in the park; a slower version of the same route
with side driving, biking, or hiking trips to Cades Cove and the Roaring
Fork Nature Trail; or an in-depth camping stay (see “Must-see attrac-
tions,” later in this chapter).
The nearest city on the Tennessee side of the park is Knoxville, where a
13-foot bronze statue in Haley Heritage Square (in Morningside Park)
honors native son Alex Haley, author of Roots.

Biltmore Estate
Asheville, North Carolina
As resplendent as any Loire Valley chateau, the massive 250-room Biltmore
mansion and its gardens, crafts shops, and winery give a full picture of
how the other half once lived. The Vanderbilts were American royalty, and
with the help of architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape designer
Frederick Law Olmstead (who also designed New York’s Central Park), cre-
ated their own kingdom in the mountains of western North Carolina in the
late 1800s. Today, for a price, anyone can tour this splendid estate. Allow
a half-day to a full day.

Cades Cove
Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee
An auto or bicycle tour to Cades Cove (an isolated mid-19th-century moun-
tain community) down an 11-mile, one-way, loop road off Newfound Gap
Road is a must for any visitor to the Great Smokies. The road is flat and
easy enough for older kids to bicycle and is closed to auto traffic on
Wednesday and Saturday mornings until 10 a.m. to allow bikers full access
to the roadway. You can rent bicycles at Cades Cove Campground store
for riding around the valley. The loop road is closed sundown to sunrise.
Passing isn’t allowed along the roadway, so if you’re an impatient driver,
plan an early morning start for your trip. You can leisurely drive through
in an hour; take more time if you plan to do some hiking or biking.

Manassas National Battlefield Park
Manassas, Virginia
Known as Bull Run to the Union forces and Manassas to Confederates, this
famous Civil War battlefield was the scene of two Southern victories in the
early days of the war, cementing the reputation of General Stonewall
Jackson as a strategist and hero. A visit to the 4,500-acre park includes an
audiovisual presentation of the battles, an electric map tracing the fight-
ing, and guides for auto tours through the battle sites. Allow three hours
or longer.

Mast General Store
Valle Crucis, North Carolina
A genuine piece of Americana, this country store has been in operation
since 1883, and some of the stock looks as if it’s been there since then.
Once known for selling everything “from cradles to coffins,” the store still
sells penny candies from a giant candy barrel, 5¢ cups of coffee from a pot-
bellied stove, and denims, bandannas, and tractor caps. Allow two hours.

Monticello
Charlottesville, Virginia
This gracious home of our third president, Thomas Jefferson, along with
its original furnishings, his gardens, and his grave tells a great deal about
the man and the statesman. The house is elegant but on a human scale,
designed by Jefferson himself, who hated the 18th-century brick buildings
of Williamsburg. Lewis and Clark brought back the moose and deer antlers
in the entry hall from their expedition. Always a generous host, Jefferson
was $100,000 in debt, a sum equivalent to a million dollars today, when he
died. Allow three hours.

Museum of American Frontier Culture
Staunton, Virginia
Scenic Skyline Drive and Blue Ridge Parkway take you past typical moun-
tain farmhouses, but where did the settlers of this region come from? The
Museum of American Frontier Culture presents exhibits of old-world 
farmsteads from England, Ireland, and Germany — the origins of the area’s

plants and rare breeds of farm animals are on display alongside costumed
inhabitants who work the farms and talk with today’s visitors. Kids enjoy
the hands-on experience with farm animals. Allow 21⁄2 hours for guided
visit; 3 hours for a self-guided visit.

More cool things to see and do
The Blue Ridge Mountains offer numerous activities from walking through
the Oconaluftee Indian Village to the exciting rides at Dollywood.
 Go home again. Novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote about his childhood
in Asheville in Look Homeward, Angel, not troubling to disguise 
the details much. For many years, he was snubbed or ignored by
his hometown, but today, the family home (his mother’s boarding-
house) is open as a memorial at 52 N. Market St. (% 828-253-8304;
www.ah.dcr.state.nc.us/sections/hs/wolfe/wolfe.htm). 
A destructive fire resulted in a lengthy restoration period (1998–
2004), but it is now complete and better than ever. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $1 adults, 50¢
students. It’s open November through March Tuesday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday 1 to 4 p.m.; April through
October Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 
1 to 5 p.m.
 Hooray for Dollywood! Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, once a tiny vil-
lage of farmers and potters, has been turned into Disneyland
Southeast by native daughter Dolly Parton. Despite the ticky-tacky
town, Dollywood, 1020 Dollywood Lane (% 800-365-5996;
www.dollywood.com), offers some appealing features, including an
1885 Dentzel carrousel with hand-carved animals, a train pulled by
an old steam locomotive, and fun rides for the kids. Allow a half-
day to a full day.
Don’t plan on driving by for a look-see; the road funnels the traffic
directly into the parking lot, and getting back out the entrance in an
RV can be tricky.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $48 ages 12
to 59, $45 ages 60 and older, $37 ages 4 to 11. It’s open daily from 9
a.m. to 8 p.m. The park is closed January through March, and cer-
tain days of the week depending on the season.
 Live history. Virginia’s Explore Park, milepost 115, Blue Ridge
Parkway, Roanoke, Virginia (% 800-842-9163 or 540-427-1800;
www.explorepark.org), is a living-history museum with an early

American settlement, colonial encampment, and Native American
village. Allow a half-day.
RV parking is available in a designated area. Admission is $9 adults,
$7 seniors, $5 ages 4 to 15. It’s open May through October Wednesday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.

U.S. 441 and Drama Rd., Cherokee, North Carolina (% 800-438-1601
or 828-497-3481; www.cherokeemuseum.org), uses everything from
“hear phones” to holographic images to tell the story of this civi-
lized tribe who occupied these hills for 10,000 years until forced
out on the Trail of Tears march to Oklahoma. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated area. Admission is $10 adults,
$7 ages 6 to 13. It’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Splash toward victory. The National D-Day Memorial, off I-81 and
Blue Ridge Parkway at the intersection of SR 460 Bypass and SR
122, Bedford, Virginia (% 800-351-3329 or 540-586-3329; www.dday.
org), commemorates the Allied troops who landed on the Normandy
beaches June 6, 1944, in an unprecedented military action under
the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Allow 30 minutes.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $5 adults, $3
children. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Drama Road, Cherokee, North Carolina (% 800-438-1601 or 828-497-
2315), re-creates community life in the 18th century in this authentic
replica of a village, populated by craftsmen who demonstrate basket
and beadwork typical of the Cherokees. Allow two to three hours.
RV parking is available in a designated area. Admission is $15
adults, $6 ages 6 to 12. It’s open May 15 through October 25 daily
from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Weekend wonder
For a shorter version of these routes, choose one drive, depending on
where you want to be based. You can travel Skyline Drive and see the
Shenandoah National Park easily over a weekend from the Washington
area. Anywhere in western Virginia and western North Carolina allows
access to the Blue Ridge Parkway for a weekend of touring. One thing
that makes the Great Smoky Mountains National Park the most visited is
its location, which is within a day’s drive of more than half of the popula-
tion of the United States.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
As you can see from the following sections, plenty of campsites are close
to the mountain drives in this chapter. Almost every exit from Blue Ridge
Part III: Exploring the East 
162

Parkway and Skyline Drive can lead to a private RV park where, even 
in peak season, you should be able to find an overnight campsite with
hookups.
A few lodges and restaurants serving food are spaced along Skyline
Drive and Blue Ridge Parkway, but again, most exits lead a few miles into
small towns where you can find a fast-food outlet, restaurant, or grocery
store. Produce stands and farmers’ markets sell fresh peaches, corn, and
tomatoes in season, so keep your pantry stocked.
All campgrounds listed in this section are open year-round and have
public flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless desig-
nated otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations
only. See Chapter 9 for more information on how we select our favorite

Good eats
Although all the classic Southern dishes from fried chicken to collard
greens and black-eyed peas abound throughout the region, the culinary
theme that ties together the mountains of Virginia, North Carolina, and
Tennessee is country ham. If your only previous acquaintance with ham
is the supermarket kind or the spiral-cut, honey-baked ham on a Super
Bowl Sunday or New Year’s buffet, this mahogany-colored, chewy, often
salty meat may surprise you. Pioneers who settled in these mountains
preserved meats without refrigeration, and the best way of holding
hams for a year or two was to rub down the fresh meat with a mixture of
salt, sugar, and perhaps saltpeter, and then cover it for four to six weeks
in a bed of salt. The ham then was hung in a smokehouse to be infused
with hickory smoke for several months.
In addition to other specialties, many of the home-style restaurants in
the following list offer country ham.
 Apple Barn, 230 Apple Valley Rd., off U.S. 441, Sevierville, Tennessee
(% 800-421-4606 or 865-453-9319; www.applebarncidermill.com):
What began as a barn where cider was made from the orchard’s
apples has turned into a complex of food production, viewable by
visitors. Apples are turned into cider, butter, pies, dumplings,
doughnuts, wines, and candies; if you want more, a restaurant and
grill are on the premises and so are a country-ham store and a

ugary white sand beaches, scrumptious shrimp, antebellum gardens
scarlet and pink with azaleas, and oak trees dripping Spanish moss
mark the Gulf Coast. And much of this scenic byway was changed drasti-
cally by hurricane Katrina. Reconstruction has been painfully slow and
much of the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts will take some time to
recover. However, some of what was, remains, and the courageous resi-
dents are determined to return the area to its former glory. In the mean-
time, tourists are coming for the casinos that have reopened, volunteers
have made their way here to help the locals rebuild, and others who
want to put their vacation dollars to good use are heading down to this
Hurricane update
In August 2005, hurricane Katrina slammed the Gulf Coast, killing hundreds of people
and turning some 90,000 square acres of land into a federally declared disaster area.
Reconstruction is underway, but some areas along the coast may never be the same
again. Eighty percent of the mansions that lined the ocean highway in Biloxi were
destroyed or damaged. Some are being restored to their former glory but others have
not been. The casinos were the first thing to reopen; new ones have been added to the
coastline, and all the casinos are booming. As this book went to press, some of our
favorite parks, campgrounds, and attractions had reopened and we include them here
with the most up-to-date information available at the time of publication. If you’re plan-
ning a trip along the Gulf Coast, be sure to call ahead for the latest news on reopen-
ings and reconstruction.

lovely area. This sunny vacation strip of land runs from Tallahassee
across Florida’s Panhandle, along the gulf shores of Alabama and
Mississippi, and straight into the partying town of New Orleans.
In the Florida Panhandle, where Mickey Mouse never paraded and
Cuban coffee is unheard of, you can meet old-timers who call themselves
“crackers” after the sound of a bullwhip wielded by their ancestors to
drive teams of oxen at lumber camps. They relish smoked mullet (the
fish, not the hairstyle) and swamp cabbage, and mix, sometimes reluc-
tantly, with the hotshot jet pilots of Pensacola Naval Air Station and the
chic residents of Seaside, the Panhandle equivalent of the Hamptons.
Florida writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (author of The Yearling) described
her cracker neighbors as people who made do, lived off the land, never
put on airs, and wore their Southern heritage with pride.
The fashionable coast between Apalachicola and Pensacola boasts some of
the top-ranked beaches in America, according to Dr. Stephen Leatherman,
known as “Dr. Beach,” a coastal geologist who puts out the listings of the

nation’s best. After a few years of his listings, the area’s tourist offices
began to call it “the Emerald Coast.” An older, less tourist-conscious
nickname for the region is “the Redneck Riviera.”
Alabama and Mississippi serve up all the lush romance of their Gulf
Coast in an economical 150 miles or so, with oceanside golf courses,
Vegas-style casinos, and RV parks and campgrounds so close to the
beach you’re lulled to sleep by the waves. A few more minutes on the
road, and you’re in New Orleans, the Big Easy, where you can let the
good times roll.
Getting There
Tallahassee, in the center of northern Florida on I-10, is the starting
point for this drive. (See the route on the “Gulf Coast” map in this chap-
ter.) We drive south on U.S. 319 for a few miles, then turn off on SR 363 to
the historic town of St. Mark’s, and then continue west on U.S. 98 and

319 to Panacea and Carrabelle on the Gulf of Mexico. St. George Island
and St. Joseph’s Peninsula, each with state park campgrounds, take us
on a detour off U.S. 98 around Apalachicola, and then we continue along
the Gulf Coast past Mexico Beach into Panama City.
Between Panama City and Pensacola lie the most fashionable stretches
of Florida’s Emerald Coast. From Pensacola we make a detour down to
the Gulf Islands National Seashore, follow SR 292 (the Gulf Beach
Highway) into Alabama, where it becomes SR 182, to Gulf Shores. A
circle around Mobile Bay highlights Alabama’s Gulf Coast attractions,
and then we follow U.S. 90 (or the faster I-10, which runs parallel) past
Pascagoula, Biloxi, and Gulfport, and then continue on I-10 into New
Orleans. The full distance of the drive is approximately 610 miles.
Planning Ahead
This Gulf of Mexico coastal drive can be made any time of year. Beach-
lovers should opt for summer, when the water is bathtub-warm (85°F)
for swimming, but the air temperatures are too high for hiking and
exploring. Flower fanciers love the route in early-to-late spring when the
azaleas and camellias are blooming everywhere, and days are mild and
sunny. In early fall, the weather still is warm enough for sunning and
swimming (the Gulf of Mexico water averages 75°F in Mar and Nov), and
in winter the weather is mild, encouraging beachcombing, bird-watch-
ing, and exploring small towns for antiques and local color.
Making campground reservations for RV camping is a very good idea
during summer, spring break, and around holidays, although you should
be able to find a good spot without reservations in winter and during
weekdays in early spring and late fall. Along our driving route between
Tallahassee and New Orleans are some 36 communities with RV camping.
Pack swimming apparel and light cotton clothes for spring, summer, 
and fall, and add a light jacket or sweater for most winter days. Dress is
casual everywhere along the coast, so don’t plan on bringing jackets and
ties, fancy dresses and high heels, unless you’re taking some time off
from the RV to stay in one of the expensive coastal resort hotels. Always
carry sunglasses, a sun hat, and sunblock. Having insect repellent is a
good idea; veterans of the mosquito wars recommend buying the most
effective local repellent.
Take along rain gear because this coast gets wind and rain periodically
throughout the year, especially in fall’s hurricane season. Stay tuned to
weather forecasts from July to November, and if a bad blow is expected,
head inland with your RV.
Allow three to seven days for this drive, depending on how much 
beach time you want to include. If you want to spend more time in the
area, you can easily add on the Natchez Trace Drive (Chapter 16). The
Part III: Exploring the East 
174

distance between New Orleans, where this drive ends, and Natchez,
where the Natchez Trace Drive begins, is only 176 miles.
Stocking the Pantry
With plenty of fresh fish and shellfish available along the route, with
roadside produce stands open all year, and with plenty of supermarkets
from Kroger and IGA, to Winn-Dixie, Piggly Wiggly, and other regional
chains, you needn’t worry about running short of food. You may even
encounter roadside stands selling boiled peanuts, a much-loved delicacy
in southern Georgia and northern Florida that we’ve never developed a
taste for; you need to try them, however, if you think you’d like soggy,
lukewarm peanuts.
Some of our favorite shopping spots along the way include the following
(see “Good eats,” later in this chapter, for information on all these spots):
 Bradley’s Country Store in Tallahassee for homemade sausages,
cracklings (crisp fried pork rinds), and grits
 Burris Farm Market, open all year in Loxley, Alabama, with fruits,
vegetables, and homemade breads for sale
 Pensacola’s Joe Patti Seafoods, with every imaginable kind of fresh
fish and shellfish, plus sauces and accompaniments
 Sweet Home Farm in Elberta, Alabama, for wonderful homemade
cheeses produced from the farm’s own cows
Driving the Gulf Coast
Tallahassee is a surprise for anyone familiar with Miami, Fort Lauderdale,
and even Orlando because it’s a romantic southern city — not a tropical
Florida resort. It was chosen as the capital of Florida in 1823 because
back then, when Miami was still a swamp, it was equally distant from 
the two most important cities in the state, Pensacola and St. Augustine.
Magnolia trees and azaleas surround the graceful old capitol building,
erected in the 1840s.
Perhaps the most unusual museum in the city, even the state, is the
Black Archives Research Center and Museum on the campus of Florida
A & M University in Tallahassee. This group of 5,000 artifacts from slave
days and the post–Civil War period is one of the nation’s largest collec-
tions of African American artifacts (see “More cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter).
From Tallahassee, we drive south, leaving town on U.S. 319 and almost
immediately turning off on SR 363 to Wakulla Springs State Park, where
the classic 1954 monster film Creature from the Black Lagoon was shot in
Chapter 15: The Gulf Coast: Tallahassee to New Orleans 175

the deep, still waters of the springs (see “More cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter). The old-fashioned Wakulla Springs Lodge
serves regional dishes including breakfast with biscuits, gravy, and grits,
and luncheon fried chicken with sawdust pie for dessert (see “Good
eats,” later in this chapter).
Five miles farther south on SR 363 is St. Mark’s, notable today for the
excellent National Wildlife Refuge, some historic remains from 17th-
century Spanish explorers.
From St. Mark’s, we turn west again on U.S. 98 and follow it to Panacea
and Carrabelle. Here you can relax and do some fishing while staying 
at the newly renovated Carrabelle Palms RV Park (see “Runner-up camp-
grounds,” later in this chapter).
At Eastpoint, 6 miles east of Apalachicola, County Highway 300 and a toll
bridge lead across the bay to St. George Island and its state park.
Follow U.S. 98 on to Apalachicola, famous around the world for its oys-
ters. But don’t ignore the local grouper, blue crab, and clam chowder at
places such as the Owl Café (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter). The
John Gorrie State Museum here salutes the inventor of ice cubes, refrig-
eration, and air conditioning (see “More cool things to see and do,” later
in this chapter).
West of Apalachicola, take CR 30, and then CR 30 East to the St. Joseph
Peninsula State Park, one of Dr. Beach’s prime picks, named Best Beach
in 2002. The park makes a great spot for beach camping (see the
“Runner-up campgrounds” section, later in this chapter).
Return to U.S. 98 and continue west, driving past the almost empty
stretches of perfect sand at Mexico Beach, and then on into Panama
City, the capital of the “Redneck Riviera.” If you should happen to be
driving through here any time during the college “spring break,” don’t
stop, don’t pause, and don’t linger. The beaches belong to the kids, and
it isn’t a pretty sight.
After you’re safely past Panama City Beach, however, you can slow 
down again. Don’t miss taking the back road off U.S. 98 through Seaside
(a marked left turn just past Point Washington) to get a quick look at the
award-winning architecture of the beach houses, but don’t attempt to
stop; streets are narrow, traffic is heavy, and parking is unavailable any-
where for RVs. If you’re a movie fan, you may recognize the town from the
movie The Truman Show (1998), which was filmed, in part, in Seaside. If
you’re a shopper, you’re in better luck — the big modern malls that line
the highway from Panama City to Pensacola, especially around Destin and
Fort Walton Beach, have big parking lots that can handle your vehicle.
Grayton Beach State Recreation Area, named Best Beach by Dr. Beach
back in the ’90s, allows RV camping in designated campgrounds (see
“Runner-up campgrounds,” later in this chapter).

When you’re enjoying the beaches of the Gulf Coast, especially during
hurricane season between June and October, always look at the flags
that denote water conditions. Blue means calm water safe for swimming,
yellow means take care, and red means don’t go in the water or get out
at once.
The Gulf Islands National Seashore extends 150 miles from Destin to
Gulfport, Mississippi (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Established in 1971, the park protects the barrier islands along this
coast, many of them undeveloped and unreachable. Only two camp-
grounds suitable for RVs are available on the national seashore: Fort
Pickens near Pensacola, Florida, and Davis Bayou near Ocean Springs,
Mississippi (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter, for
both). Unfortunately, both sustained extensive damage due to Hurricane
Katrina and, at press time, were closed.
Pensacola is a charming surprise of a city with a lovely old historic dis-
trict downtown and the Navy’s ace flying team the Blue Angels. In a soar-
ing glass tower, the National Museum of Naval Aviation displays A-4
Skyhawks in formation as if the Blue Angels were flying them, along with
flight simulators, cockpit trainers, and an IMAX theater (see “Must-see
attractions,” later in this chapter). The city also has Joe Patti Seafoods,
the biggest and best fresh indoor seafood market we’ve ever seen, and a
down-home, family-style restaurant called Hopkins House (see “Good
eats,” later in this chapter, for both food spots).
After you’ve explored the city of Pensacola, we suggest that you drive
south to see more of the Gulf Islands National Seashore; take SR 292 to
Perdido Key and across into Alabama, where it becomes SR 182 to Gulf
Shores. If you’re in a hurry, you can take U.S. 98 across Perdido Bay into
Alabama.
We like the Gulf State Park at Gulf Shores, Alabama, for beachfront
camping and plenty of shrimp sellers (see “Our favorite campgrounds,”
later in this chapter).
From Gulf Shores, food shoppers will want to drive north on SR 59 to
Foley and detour east to Elberta to visit Sweet Home Farm cheese shop
(see “Good eats,” later in this chapter). The 1-mile road to the farm is
unpaved but fairly smooth. If it’s been raining recently, however, you
shouldn’t drive down this road in a large RV because the red mud can be
slippery. Another favorite local food shop is Burris Farm Market in
Loxley, open daily year-round with seasonal produce, boiled peanuts,
homemade breads, and ice cream (see “Good eats”). From Loxley, drive
north to I-10 and make the quick 15-minute drive into Mobile.
From Mobile, it takes only 20 minutes or so to get into Mississippi via 
I-10. Where Alabama’s Gulf Coast consists of quiet towns and fishing 
villages on dead-end roads, Mississippi’s stretch of coastline is four-lane
U.S. 90 brightened by intervals of glitz.
Chapter 15: The Gulf Coast: Tallahassee to New Orleans 177

From the moment you cross the causeway from Ocean Springs to Biloxi,
the casinos — a dozen of them — pop up like glittering psychedelic
mushrooms. (So you won’t be taken as a Yankee, pronounce the town
bu-lux-ee, not bill-lox-ee.)
This new Las Vegas of the Deep South revives a sagging economy left
bereft by a lag in local shipbuilding. The good news is, Mississippi has 31
RV parks on or near the water on the Gulf Coast, all with hookups (see
“Our favorite campgrounds” and “Runner-up campgrounds,” later in this
chapter).
From Gulfport, following U.S. 90, it’s 34 miles to the Louisiana border;
just before you get to the border, you pass Buccaneer State Park (see
Part III: Exploring the East 
178
Eatin’ and antiquin’, Mobile-style
Mobile, 305 years old in 2007, was the French capital of America before there was a
New Orleans, and the city logo proudly shows off a historic home, the battleship USS
Alabama, an azalea in full bloom, and a shrimp. What does it all mean? The historic
home is to remind you that Mobile offers tours of antebellum houses. The battleship,
open daily for tours in Battleship USS Alabama Memorial Park, is a World War II vet-
eran. The azalea stands for world-famous Bellingrath Gardens and Home, a glorious
splash of seasonal flowers all year-round. And if the shrimp makes you think of Forrest
Gump, you won’t be surprised to discover that its author, Winston Groom, has a home
just outside Mobile. (See “Must-see attractions,” in this chapter, for info on the bat-
tleship and gardens.)
RVers seeking other gratification in the area need to make the scenic drive on U.S. 98
and 98A along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay. En route, you can visit the Bloody Mary
capital of the Eastern Shore, as Manci’s Antique Club, 1715 Main St. (% 251-626-9917;
www.manci.net), in downtown Daphne calls itself, to see the largest collection of
Jim Beam decanters outside the distillery’s own.
Fairhope is lined with antiques shops and art galleries, and punctuated with a long
pier jutting out into the bay. The notable Old Bay Steamer serves the region’s famous
Royal Red shrimp (see “Good eats,” in this chapter, for details).
Point Clear is home to the Grand Hotel, now a Marriott and the latest in a line of clas-
sic Southern resorts built on this spot, and to the Punta Clara Kitchen, where home-
made candies abound (see “Good eats”).
On the western side of the bay, SR 193 leads to Bellingrath Gardens and Home and
beyond to Dauphin Island and Fort Gaines, where you can look across to Fort Morgan,
the Civil War fortress barricaded with a string of underwater mines across the chan-
nel that inspired Admiral David Farragut’s famous command, “Damn the torpedoes —
full speed ahead!”
In Mobile, on the northwestern edge of the city on Old Shell Road, a super snack-time
stop, the Dew Drop Inn,has been serving up great hot dogs since 1927 (see “Good eats”).

New Orleans, take I-10.

The decommissioned World War II battleship that carried a crew of 2,500
is on display, along with the submarine USS Drum, a B-52 aircraft, cannons,
tanks, armored personnel carriers, and helicopters. Kids love to climb

Chapter 15: The Gulf Coast: Tallahassee to New Orleans 179
New Orleans: Easing into the Big Easy
Generally speaking, New Orleans is one of the friendliest cities on Earth — that is, to
everybody except RVers. It’s not that the good folks of Louisiana don’t welcome us;
they do. But their roads, even the interstates, are bumpy and rough, causing our pots
and pans to rattle as we bounce through.
Equally troubling are the confusing roadway markings for the interstate, expressway,
and surface street system, which can catapult an innocent RVer into the traffic-
clogged French Quarter or the Superdome before you can say, “Laissez les bon temps
roulez!” (“Let the good times roll,” a traditional Cajun partying cry).
So instead of driving into the heart of New Orleans in your RV, select an RV park in an
outlying area, preferably one that has frequent shuttle service to and from downtown
if you don’t have your own car, park and secure your living quarters, and then set out
to have footloose fun in a city that never sleeps.
Hurricane Katrina didn’t do much damage to the most popular tourist areas (the French
Quarter and the Garden District), and the Big Easy eagerly welcomes visitors, whose
spending helps restore the whole city. Even after taking the brunt of a giant hurricane,
local attitude is still “Let the good times roll.”

tropical landscape. The 15-room Bellingrath family home (he was the first
Coca-Cola bottler in the Mobile area) houses collections of antique china

cafe is also on the estate. Allow two hours for the gardens only, three hours

Gulf Islands National Seashore
Florida and Mississippi
Extending 150 miles from Destin, Florida, to Gulfport, Mississippi, the Gulf
Islands National Seashore is divided into 11 sections, six of them in Florida,
and five of them in Mississippi. Miles of uncrowded beaches famous for
acres of soft white sand and sea oats attract day visitors and overnight
campers in modest numbers. Two campgrounds, Florida’s Fort Pickens
and Mississippi’s Davis Bayou (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in
this chapter), are usually available on a first-come, first-served basis, and
are now reopened. Much of the parkland consists of offshore islands reach-
able only by boat. Areas accessible by motor vehicles offer hiking trails,
bike paths, and nature trails. There are still roads closed from Katrina
damage, so be sure to call ahead or check the Web site before planning a
visit to see what’s open to visitors.

Walter Anderson Museum of Art
Ocean Springs, Mississippi
This museum displays the astonishing works of an eccentric loner named
Walter Anderson. A master artist who painted plants, animals, and people
of the Gulf Coast, he sometimes isolated himself in primitive conditions
on an uninhabited barrier island for months at a time. After his death in
1965, his family went into the small cottage he used as a studio to find the
“little room,” every inch of its floor, walls, and ceilings covered with paint-
ings of plants, animals, and an allegorical figure thought to represent the
Mississippi River. The little room, his paintings and murals, and ceramic
pieces from the family’s Shearwater Pottery collection are on display here.
The museum sustained some damage from Hurricane Katrina but has been
completely restored and is now open for visitors. Allow two hours.

More cool things to see and do
Fascinating attractions fill the Gulf Coast. A few more of our favorites
follow, although you’ll no doubt make your own discoveries.
 Explore black history. With 5,000 items and 500,000 documents,
one of the most extensive collections of African American artifacts
in the United States, the Black Archives, Research Center and
Museum, Carnegie Center, Gamble Street (% 850-599-3020; www.
taltrust.org/blkarchv.htm), at Florida A & M University in
Tallahassee displays everything from slave-era implements and old
non-PC Aunt Jemima pancake packages to the first ironing board,
built in 1872, by a servant named Sarah Boone who got tired of
ironing on the floor and propped a board up on legs. A hands-on
Underground Railroad exhibit fascinates the kids. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated guest parking area or on the
street. Admission is free. The museum is open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed holidays.
 Meet the mad potter of Biloxi. George E. Ohr Arts Center, George
E. Ohr Street, Biloxi (% 228-374-5547; www.georgeohr.org), 
commemorates the mad potter of Biloxi, who had a genius for 
self-promotion, with 130 pots of his creation. In the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina, the pots were moved to storage to the Swetman
House, 1596 Glenn Swetman Dr. The museum itself is being restored
and should open in late 2009. Updates are posted on the Web site.
 See where they invented the ice cube. In 1851, Dr. John Gorrie
invented a machine to cool down the rooms of malaria patients, but
Chapter 15: The Gulf Coast: Tallahassee to New Orleans 181

when it kept clogging its pipes with ice cubes, he realized he was
on to something and invented ice cubes, ice making, and air condi-
tioning. The machine in the John Gorrie State Museum, 46 Sixth
St., Apalachicola (% 850-653-9347; www.floridastateparks.org/
johngorriemuseum), is a replica; the original is in the Smithsonian.
Allow one hour.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $1 for ages 
6 and older, ages 5 and younger free. The museum is open
Thursday through Monday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Tuesday
and Wednesday.
 Look out for alligators! Bike, hike, and canoe numerous trails and
streams in St. Mark’s National Wildlife Refuge (% 850-925-6121)
bordering Florida’s Apalachee Bay. An excellent visitor center has
maps and advice.
The refuge entrance is south of Newport on SR 59. RV parking is
available in designated lots at the visitor center or on trail heads.
Admission is free. It’s open during daylight hours. If you want more
information, you can contact the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Box
68, St. Mark’s, FL 32355.
 Trail Tarzan. Many of the early Tarzan movies with Johnny
Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan were filmed at Florida’s
Wakulla Springs State Park, 550 Wakulla Park Dr., Wakulla Springs
Lodge (% 850-922-3632; www.fws.gov/saintmarks), and so was
the 1954 horror classic The Creature from the Black Lagoon. The
clear, almost bottomless springs and the lush jungle foliage make
this a popular family vacation area. Take a glass-bottom boat ride
across the springs.
RV parking is available in designated parking areas in the park and
at the lodge. Admission is $4 per vehicle. Boat rides are $6 adults,
$4 children 11 and under. The park is open daily year-round; the
lodge is open for overnight guests.
Weekend wonder
If you want to take a shorter version of this Gulf Coast drive, make the
drive from Tallahassee southwest to Apalachicola, and then continue
west along the Emerald Coast to Pensacola, pausing at whatever beach
and campground strike your fancy. The distance between Tallahassee
and Pensacola on the route outlined earlier in this chapter is 310 miles.
To return from Pensacola to Tallahassee quickly (with a refrigerator
stocked with fresh seafood), take I-10 east back to Tallahassee. This loop
drive is 505 miles.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
The Gulf of Mexico is a favorite destination for RVers, whether family
vacationers, snowbirds, or full-timers, and plenty of RV parks, state

parks, and recreation areas with camping line the way. Supermarkets,
country stores, restaurants, cafes, and national fast-food outlets also
thickly dot the route.
All campgrounds listed below are open year-round and have public

Good eats
Southern cooking has a well-deserved reputation around the world, and
the Gulf Coast provides the best examples anywhere. In this section, you
can find perhaps more than you ever wanted to know about fresh
shrimp, and great home-style, all-you-can-eat cafes and restaurants. And
the prices are great!
Seafood markets
Delectable fresh shrimp in the big, bigger, and biggest giant size are for
sale all along the Gulf Coast at prices that are unbelievably cheap to
urbanites from the Northeast and the West Coast. The finest local shrimp
are called Royal Red; ask for them by name. For our tips on how to pre-
pare them, see the “Put another shrimp on the barbie” sidebar, in this
Part III: Exploring the East 
186
Put another shrimp on the barbie
Although you can buy boiled, fried, or grilled shrimp in every little restaurant and take-
out along the route, the most delicious are those that you buy fresh and cook yourself.
It only takes a few minutes until they turn red and are ready. What follows are our
favorite ways to serve ’em up.
 Steam them in their shells in boiling salted water or beer with a little bit of local
“shrimp boil” seasoning (bay leaves and dried herbs).
 Grill them in the shell on your barbecue grill.
 Peel them and stack them on skewers to lie over the coals.
 To turn out instant shrimp scampi, as some restaurants call them, peel them and
cook them quickly in a frying pan with a little butter or olive oil and chopped garlic
and herbs.
 Peel them, leaving the tail part of the shell for a handle. Dip them in flour that’s
been salted and peppered, then in a beaten egg with a little water, and finally in
dry breadcrumbs. (Japanese panko crumbs are best; you can find them in Asian
food sections of supermarkets.) Then deep-fry them in a half-inch of hot oil a few
minutes on each side — yummy!

onsider leaving the clogged arteries of crowded interstates behind
to enter a shaded, curved, rural highway that doesn’t allow com-
mercial traffic or speeding — 50 mph is the limit. Along the way, you find
campgrounds, crafts shops, picnic tables, and nature trails to explore,
including a boardwalk through an eerie swamp with lime-green water
and sunken trees.
In spring and summer, the route is green with thick, lush grass and
plenty of hardwood trees, with occasional glimpses of small farms and
villages through the foliage. The highway is easy and undulating but not
wide. Most, but not all, overlook turnoffs are spacious enough for large
motorhomes or vehicles pulling trailers.
The Natchez Trace meanders nearly 500 miles from a point northeast of
Natchez, Mississippi, to a point southwest of Nashville, Tennessee,
passing the places where TV megastar Oprah Winfrey, rock idol Elvis
Presley, and blues musician W. C. Handy were born, and where
Meriwether Lewis (of Lewis and Clark fame) died under mysterious 
circumstances.
An 8,000-year-old Indian trail, the trace — an old-fashioned term for a
path or roadway — was turned into a scenic highway drive in the 1930s.
The route preserves some 300 segments of the old trace that was com-
missioned in 1806 by Thomas Jefferson. And don’t worry about the
speed limit — it’s so peaceful and scenic along the way that you won’t
even be tempted to rev up the RV.

Getting There
Our Natchez Trace drive begins in Natchez and goes north to Nashville,
but it’s just as simple to begin in Nashville and drive south to Natchez.
(For the route, see “The Natchez Trail” map in this chapter.) If you’re
driving from Nashville to Natchez and have extra time, check out the
Gulf Coast drive between New Orleans and Tallahassee in Chapter 15.
The trace is unfinished at a couple of spots. It begins 8 miles northeast
of Natchez, so you travel on U.S. 60 from Natchez to the marked begin-
ning. Again near Jackson, you need to leave the parkway at the junction
of I-20, follow I-20 to I-220 north, and then continue on I-55 to Exit 105,
which reconnects you to the parkway.
Similar to the Skyline Drive and Blue Ridge Parkway drive described in
Chapter 14, the Natchez Trace has well-marked entrances and exits that
take you onto commercial highways and in and out of towns and vil-
lages. And the trace has numbered mileposts that double as addresses
for sites along the route. The route begins at milepost 8 near Natchez,
and finishes past milepost 440 near Nashville.
At the end of the parkway, you exit by a dramatic bridge (past milepost
440) that swoops you down onto Route 100 about 10 miles west of
Nashville. The total drive runs around 500 miles.
Planning Ahead
Although the parkway is comfortable to drive year-round, the best times
are in early spring and fall when the weather is mild, the flowers are in
bloom, and the pilgrimage tours through antebellum homes are on the
agenda (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Winter usually is mild but can be rainy and sometimes chilly; summers
are hot.
You don’t need campground reservations for any of the places in this
chapter except for Ratliff Ferry and the Ross Barnett Reservoir camp-
grounds in summer. You also need reservations for the Opryland KOA,
Nashville, in June when Fan Fair, a gathering of country music fans from
around the world, takes place. (See “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in
this chapter.)
Allow three to seven days for the drive.
Stocking the Pantry
You won’t find food outlets, restaurants, or stores along the Natchez
Trace, but this itinerary frequently detours off the trace through a
number of towns and villages. The major Southern supermarket chains
Part III: Exploring the East 
192

Chapter 16: The Natchez Trace: Natchez to Nashville 193
include Winn-Dixie, Kroger, Piggly Wiggly, and IGA, the Independent
Grocers Association.
Keep your eyes open as you pass through small towns in the South
during spring, summer, and fall; vegetable and fruit growers often put
out produce stands in their farmyards or even on their front lawns
during harvest time. The prices are always very low.
Driving the Natchez Trace
The Natchez Trace Parkway, like the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline
Drive described in Chapter 14, is a federally designated scenic drive along
a two-lane highway with a 50 mph speed limit where no commercial traf-
fic is permitted. Frequent turnouts are indicated with half-mile warning
signs shaped like arrowheads that tell you whether the spot ahead is of
historic interest, a trail head, or a segment of the original roadway.
Jefferson’s road: A 19th-century trade, 
mail, and military route
In 1806, Thomas Jefferson ordered a roadway “12 feet in width and passable for a
wagon” to be built along the trade routes originally used by flatboat men returning
upriver from delivering their furs, tobacco, pork, and farm products in Natchez and
New Orleans.
Although traveling downriver was easy, the Kaintucks, as they were called, were
unable to row or pole upstream against the current. After selling their goods, and
maybe their rafts, too, they had to walk or ride horseback to return home. The traders
had little enough remaining from their profits after the gamblers, cutthroats, and pros-
titutes of Natchez-Under-the-Hill had finished with them, but the toughest part of the
trip was yet to come — protecting themselves and their money from the highwaymen
who lurked along the trace. Jefferson was thinking not only about the traders but also
the postal service riders who would use the roadway to deliver mail and the military
troops who might need the wide clear pathway for wagons and cannons.
Ladies and gentlemen of fashion, circuit-riding preachers, frontier prostitutes, pioneer
families, medicine peddlers, and flatboat men — everybody used the Natchez Trace.
A despondent Meriwether Lewis died mysteriously along the trail in 1809, and in 1815,
a triumphant Major General Andrew Jackson, better known as “Old Hickory,” marched
his Tennessee militia along the trace back from the Battle of New Orleans.
But in 1812, the first steamboat arrived in Natchez, and by 1820, the boats dominated
the rivers. Eventually, except for a brief period during the Civil War, the little-used
Natchez Trace reverted to woods again. Only in the 1930s, under the administration of
Franklin D. Roosevelt, did restoration of the trace begin; today’s road closely follows
the contours of the original.

Plan on spending a day or two exploring the Natchez area before you set
out on the trace itself. Historic homes are open all year with hoop-
skirted hostesses to show you around.
When you’re ready to hit the road, drive northeast from Natchez on U.S.
60 about 8 miles to the designated entrance of the Natchez Trace. Just
before the entrance to the parkway, stop at the Mississippi Welcome
Center and pick up an official Natchez Trace map and guide, handy
materials to keep with you. Almost immediately after entering the park,
you come to the spot where a section of the original trace can be seen;
look for the arrowhead-shaped sign. At milepost 10.3 is Emerald Mound,
the second-largest Indian mound in the United States. The ancestors 
of the Natchez tribe built the mound around A.D. 1400. It covers some 
8 acres; you can walk to the top if you want.
At milepost 15.5, you come to Mount Locust, a restored historical house
that served as a “stand” or overnight stop for travelers along the trace.
Jefferson had encouraged innkeepers to open these primitive lodging
establishments to care for travelers; more than 20 were in operation by
1820, when the trace was at its peak.
Exit on U.S. 61 near milepost 37 to drive a short loop detour into Port
Gibson. General Ulysses S. Grant reportedly said this town was “too
pretty to burn,” and so Port Gibson survived the Civil War intact and
was the first town in Mississippi to be designated a National Historic
District. What strikes visitors initially today is the huge golden hand atop
the 1859 First Presbyterian Church at Walnut and Church streets, the
index finger pointing heavenward. Southwest of town are the haunting
ruins of Windsor, the largest antebellum house ever built in Mississippi,
used in a memorable scene with Alec Baldwin in Ghosts of Mississippi
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Back on the Natchez Trace at milepost 41.5 is the Sunken Trace section,
a five-minute walk along a deeply eroded section of the original trace. A
designated parking turnout is nearby. In the right light, this is one of the
spookiest parts of the trace.
At milepost 54.8, you come to Rocky Springs ghost town, formerly a
thriving metropolis with a population of 2,616. Take a short uphill trail
from the upper parking area to the site of the notorious Red House Inn,
where highwaymen sized up travelers and then robbed them later. The
town fell into decline during the Civil War, when first the war, then the
boll weevil, yellow fever, and soil erosion wiped it out. A campground
without hookups (see “Runner-up campgrounds,” later in this chapter,
for more on Rocky Springs Campground) and a foot trail are located
along a section of the old road.
Around milepost 67 is the exit to Vicksburg, SR 27. You can also go to
Vicksburg from Port Gibson at milepost 37, but you’d miss the points of
interest on the parkway.
Part III: Exploring the East 
194

Chapter 16: The Natchez Trace: Natchez to Nashville 195
The Civil War seems to be the main preoccupation of Vicksburg, with the
Vicksburg National Military Park on its northern boundary. Comparable
to Gettysburg in scope, Vicksburg is known not only for its fine old
houses but also for the bravery and endurance of its citizens during a
47-day siege in 1863, when General Grant’s troops bombarded the city
almost constantly. As if to add insult to injury, the Mississippi River itself
abandoned Vicksburg in 1876, changing its route to cut across the neck
of land that Grant had worked so hard to take. Years later, the waters of
the Yazoo River were diverted into the Mississippi’s old channel so
Vicksburg could have its harbor back.
Vicksburg is famous for two beverages. It was the first city to bottle
Coca-Cola; the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Company Museum displays repli-
cas of the original bottling equipment (see “More cool things to see and
do”). And the mint julep was invented in Vicksburg.
A family-style restaurant in Vicksburg, called Walnut Hills, is the epit-
ome of Southern home cooking with help-yourself bowls and platters
filled with fried chicken, pork chops, a dozen vegetables, salads, corn
muffins, biscuits, and ice tea (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Back on the Natchez Trace, the drive is interrupted just past milepost 
90 on the outskirts of Jackson. To return immediately to the trace,
follow the parkway detour signage along I-20 to I-220, and then to I-55,
rejoining the trace at milepost 102.
If you have a few hours, however, spend some time in Jackson, the state
capital. The expansive and excellent Mississippi Agriculture and
Forestry Museum — much more interesting than it sounds for adults
and children — features a 1920s town with costumed inhabitants and
craftsmen (and hand-pumped gas for 15¢ a gallon), a crop-dusting
museum, and an entire working farm that was moved here from south-
ern Mississippi (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
The Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum (see “Must-see 
attractions”) also is in Jackson, sharing the same big parking lot as the
Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum. Here you can broadcast
play-by-play action from a replica press booth that’s stocked with videos
of outstanding game highlights; walk through a museum salute to Dizzy
Dean, Mississippi’s own baseball great; stroll into a locker room housing
uniforms and equipment used by sports heroes; and try your skills in
golf, baseball, soccer, or football.
When you reenter the parkway at milepost 101.5, look for the sign for
the Mississippi Crafts Center, a marvelous collection of hand-woven
Choctaw baskets, pottery, weavings, jewelry, books, and carved wooden
toys, to mention only a few of the treasures (see “Shopping along the
Way,” later in this chapter).

Part III: Exploring the East 
196
At milepost 105.6, a road from a turnoff to the Ross Barnett Reservoir
follows the Pearl River and parallels the parkway for 8 miles, accessing
four campgrounds with hookups (see “Runner-up campgrounds,” later in
this chapter).
One of the prettiest spots along the route is a tupelo and bald cypress
swamp at milepost 122 with board walkways leading across yellow-green,
algae-covered water so smooth it looks like a chartreuse mirror that 
you could walk on. The nature trail takes about 20 minutes to walk: first
across the swamp, then along the other side through the woods, and
back across the swamp on a second walkway.
When you drive past Kosciusko (pronounced koz-e-esk-ko) at milepost
159.7, take a moment to remember that this is where TV diva Oprah
Winfrey was born on January 29, 1954. Liberty Presbyterian Church has
a sign outside pointing out that “she said her first piece here,” in other
words, made her first public appearance (see “More cool things to see
and do,” later in this chapter).
French Camp at milepost 180.7 comes to life every fall when it’s time to
demonstrate the making of sorghum molasses from sugar cane. The
parkway’s only bed-and-breakfast is here, along with a crafts shop,
exhibits, and a lunch cafe.
One mile east of milepost 259.7 is Tupelo National Battlefield, site of a
major Civil War battle in 1864. On this site, Union General A. J. Smith
trapped Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, famous for quick
strikes and tough fights. General William Tecumseh Sherman ordered
Smith to “follow Forrest to his death.”
Louisiana Purchase: The deal 
of the century
In the annals of real estate coups, few can match the 1803 Louisiana Purchase,
ordered by Thomas Jefferson and negotiated by future president James Monroe.
Three years earlier, Napoleon had traded with Spain, swapping the Italian kingdom of
Parma, home of Parmesan cheese, for the territory of Louisiana — in those days it
stretched from the west banks of the Mississippi River westward to the Rocky
Mountains and from Canada in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south.
Monroe paid Napoleon around $15 million, or 4¢ an acre. Ironically, all that Jefferson
wanted was to regain the port of New Orleans and the land along the Mississippi so
Americans could continue to use the river for trade.

Chapter 16: The Natchez Trace: Natchez to Nashville 197
Turn off the Natchez Trace on SR 6 for the Tupelo Battlefield and for the
Elvis Presley Birthplace and Museum in downtown Tupelo (see “Must-
see attractions,” later in this chapter). The rock icon was born in a
simple two-room house that his father built; sometimes a relative or
friend of Elvis is on hand to share personal memories. Tombigbee State
Park with RV camping is just east of Tupelo (see “Our favorite camp-
grounds,” later in this chapter).
Return to the parkway by the same route you took to go off into Tupelo,
so you don’t miss any of the highlights.
A Chickasaw village site at milepost 261.8 presents exhibits on Indian
life, and a nature trail displays plants that were used in daily life for
foods and medicine. The park headquarters at Tupelo Visitor Center,
milepost 266, also offers a 20-minute nature walk showing forest
regrowth. At milepost 269.4, a short walk along the old trace leads to the
graves of 13 unknown Confederate soldiers. A nature trail at milepost
275.2 into Dogwood Valley takes about 15 minutes to explore a grove of
dogwood trees.
Tishomingo State Park at milepost 302.8, shortly before the parkway
crosses from Mississippi into Alabama, offers camping, swimming,
canoeing, and picnicking (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this
chapter). At milepost 310, the parkway crosses into Alabama.
Although the parkway traverses only a 38-mile corner of northwestern
Alabama on its way north, this little stretch of land is full of fascinating
discoveries. Just past milepost 320, turn east on U.S. 72 to Tuscumbia,
which, with its nearby sister towns of Sheffield, Muscle Shoals, and
Florence, offers a great place to eat down-home Southern cooking and
four not-to-be-missed attractions.
Plan to spend a day in lively northwestern Alabama, where attractions
include the following:
 Ivy Green, birthplace of Helen Keller, immortalized in the play and
film The Miracle Worker (see “More cool things to see and do,” later
in this chapter). Here you find the world’s most famous backyard
pump where she learned to say, “Water!”
 Alabama Music Hall of Fame, a splendid museum saluting
Alabamians from Jimmie Rodgers and Tammy Wynette to Nat King
Cole and Jimmy Buffett (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this
chapter).
 W. C. Handy Birthplace, Museum, and Library, celebrating the
blues composer and musician who wrote “St. Louis Blues,”
“Memphis Blues,” and other classics (see “More cool things to 
see and do”).

Part III: Exploring the East 
198
 Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial Graveyard, the only grave-
yard in the world dedicated solely to coon hounds, dating from
1937 (see “More cool things to see and do”).
 Rocking Chair Restaurant where staff serves meat specials, such
as roast turkey, fried chicken, or pork roast, accompanied by your
choice of any three vegetables from the lengthy menu, and hot 
biscuits and cornbread, all for under $10 (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
At milepost 341.8, the parkway crosses the border from Alabama into
Tennessee. Another section of the sunken trace is open for walking at
milepost 350.5, and a nature trail along Sweetwater Branch crosses a
section of brilliant wildflowers in spring and early summer. The walk
takes 20 minutes.
You find the grave of Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark fame at mile-
post 385.9, along with a campground, picnic area, ranger station, rest-
rooms, and a reconstruction of the log inn called Grinder’s Stand, where
Lewis died. The famous explorer, only 35 years old, was on his way back
to Washington, D.C., on government business when he died mysteriously
here on the night of October 11, 1809, of gunshot wounds in an incident
that history never has decided was suicide or murder.
At milepost 401.4 is a tobacco farm with a barn and field on exhibit, and
a 2-mile drive along the old trace.
The Natchez Trace ends with a dramatic soaring double-arch bridge at
SR 100 some 10 miles southwest of Nashville.
Must-see attractions
Alabama Music Hall of Fame
Tuscumbia, Alabama
From the first touring motorhome used by the band Alabama to artifacts
from jazz innovator Sun Ra, this modern, interactive museum salutes the
great musicians who were born in or lived in Alabama. The list includes
Hank Williams, Nat King Cole, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmy Buffett, Tammy
Wynette, Emmylou Harris, Big Mama Willie Mae Thornton, Odetta, Martha
Reeves, Bobby Goldsboro, Dinah Washington, Lionel Richie, Toni Tennille,
and Wilson Pickett.
The museum was built here instead of in a major Alabama city because
nearby Muscle Shoals in the 1960s and 1970s housed popular recording
studios where Percy Sledge recorded the rhythm-and-blues classic “When a
Man Loves a Woman,” Aretha Franklin cut early soul records, and a young
Duane Allman was a studio guitarist. Listening on individual earphones,

Elvis Presley Birthplace and Museum
Tupelo, Mississippi
This little two-room cottage was built by Elvis’s father Vernon, who bor-
rowed $180 and had the house finished in time for the birth of Elvis Aron
and his stillborn twin brother, Jesse Garon. They were evicted two years
later when they couldn’t repay the loan. Besides the birthplace, you can
see a small memorial chapel and pick up the map for a local driving tour
that takes you past other Elvis shrines, such as the local Tupelo Hardware,
where his mother bought him his first guitar for $12.98. Some Tupelo rel-
atives say Elvis really wanted a BB rifle instead. Allow one to two hours.

Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum
Jackson, Mississippi
Far more fun than it sounds, this sprawling complex includes a 1920s rural
Mississippi town, complete with craftsmen and shopkeepers, and a work-
ing farm (moved here in its entirety from southern Mississippi) that
includes several Mississippi mules, a breed famous for its stubbornness.
Kids enjoy wandering about the area and experiencing “the olden days”
and then ending up at a general store that sells cold soft drinks and a
staple of Southern snack fare, the Moon Pie.
Inside the main building is a well-arranged historical museum, and around
the complex in separate buildings are the Mississippi Crafts Guild display
area and shop, the museum cafe, and the National Agricultural Aviation
Museum and Hall of Fame, saluting crop dusters. All these can be entered
on the same ticket. The adjacent Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and

Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame and Museum
Jackson, Mississippi
This museum salutes sports heroes of Mississippi and automatically
makes every fan, young and old, who enters a hero, too. With interactive
machines, visitors can play golf, check the speed and impact of their base-
ball pitch, or take penalty kicks against a soccer goalie. A “press box”
mockup lets wannabe sports announcers call the play-by-play for a game,
and the locker room displays uniforms and equipment that famous play-
ers have used. A special second-floor museum salutes Mississippi base-
ball great Dizzy Dean, and touch-screen kiosks let visitors look up archival
sports information and interviews. Allow three hours.

Vicksburg National Military Park
Vicksburg, Mississippi
The battlefield commemorates one of the most decisive battles of the Civil
War. General Ulysses S. Grant and 50,000 men held the city under siege for
47 days. The national cemetery contains the graves of some 17,000 Union
soldiers. A 16-mile auto tour around the park passes markers, monuments,
and re-created breastworks. In the museum, you can see the gunboat Cairo,
which was pulled up from the Yazoo River 100 years after it sank in 1862.

Alabama (% 256-383-4066; www.helenkellerbirthplace.org),

the birthplace and childhood home of Helen Keller, a lecturer and
essayist who lost her sight and hearing at 19 months of age, has
been restored to the way it looked during her childhood. A produc-
tion of The Miracle Worker, depicting how she overcame her handi-
caps, is presented here every summer. In the backyard is the famous
water pump where the child first made the connection with lan-
guage. Allow two hours.
To get there from U.S. 72, follow Woodmount Drive to Commons. 
RV parking is available in a large parking lot and on the street.
Admission is $6 adults, $5 seniors, $2 ages 5 to 18. It’s open daily
8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Closed Mondays.
 Howl with the hounds. Key Underwood Coon Dog Memorial
Graveyard (% 800-344-0783 or 256-383-0783; www.colbertcounty
tourism.org) is the only cemetery in the world dedicated to the
raccoon-hunting hound. More than 160 champions are buried here,
some with elaborately carved granite tombstones such as that of
Doctor Doom, listing his awards. Others have simple wooden mark-
ers with handwritten sentiments like, “He wasn’t the best coon 
dog there ever was, but he was the best I ever had.” Allow at least
30 minutes.
To get there from Tuscumbia, Alabama, take U.S. 72 west for 7 miles,

tionary war, was the birthplace and early childhood home of Oprah
Winfrey, and a road named for her goes past her first church, her
family cemetery, and the site of her birthplace. Allow one hour.
For information, contact the Kosciusko Tourist Promotion Council,
124 N. Jackson St. (% 662-289-2981; www.kosciuskotourism.

W. C. Handy Birthplace, Museum and Library, 620 W. College St.
(% 256-760-6434; www.alabamamuseums.org). The blues genius, a
trained musician with his own brass band, wrote a campaign song
for Memphis political boss Edward R. Crump that introduced jazz
breaks into a composed piece for the first time. Retitled “Memphis
Blues,” it’s the first composition recognized as jazz. Allow two hours.
It’s in downtown Florence just off U.S. 72. RV parking is available on
the street. Admission is $2 adults, 50¢ ages 17 and younger. It’s
open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Tishomingo State Park
$$
Tishomingo, Mississippi
The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built this park in the 1930s, using
rock quarried on-site. Over Bear Creek, note the swinging bridge, which
dates from those days. Sites are paved and mostly shaded. Haynes Lake
provides freshwater fishing and boating; a ramp, dock, and boat rentals
are available. A fishing license is required; the state tourism board can tell
you how to get one. (See “Fast Facts,” at the end of this chapter, for the
board’s contact info.)
Off CR 90. (From junction of Natchez Trace Parkway and SR 25, go north 1⁄2 mile on 25

mansion still evokes the ghost of the antebellum South. It survived
the Civil War but succumbed to a fire in 1890 caused by a cigarette,
a newly fashionable way to use tobacco at that time. Allow 30 min-
utes; photographers may want more time.
To get there, take U.S. 61 south from Port Gibson, turn right on SR
552, and follow the signs. There is plenty of open area at the site for
RV parking, but a short, narrow dirt road with bushes leads to it.
Admission is free. It’s open from dawn to dusk.
Weekend wonder
The easiest way to make a shorter version of the drive is simply to
follow the 444-mile trace, overnighting at one of the campgrounds along
the way, without turning off to see the attractions in Port Gibson,
Vicksburg, Jackson, and Nashville, or the state of Alabama.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
The Natchez Trace provides plentiful overnight camping all along the
route, either directly on the parkway or a few miles off on a side road.
Few public campgrounds accept reservations, so if you’re making the
trip during a busy season, such as spring, plan to stop earlier in the day
than usual to be sure that you’ll have an overnight spot, or reserve a day
or two in advance at privately owned campgrounds near the parkway.
The same convenience isn’t true for eating on the road, so you’ll be
happy to have a stocked refrigerator and your own kitchen. Even where
a town is near the parkway, that doesn’t mean any special treats await;
some of the small communities in Mississippi, for instance, don’t even
have fast-food places. A grocery store or small-town drugstore may be
the only place to find something already prepared for lunch. To help you
find tasty food to eat in or take out, we guide you to some simple, homey
places in the “Good eats” section, later in this chapter.
All campgrounds in this section are open year-round and have public
flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated
otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only. The
only campground with RV hookups is at Ratliff Ferry. See Chapter 9 for
more information on how we select our favorite campgrounds.

You find plenty of vegetables in this part of the world, but don’t expect
them to be cooked al dente. Southern vegetables are cooked until very
well done as a rule and made tastier by the addition of outside seasonings,

Part III: Exploring the East 
206
often butter, bacon fat, pot juices, even sugar. You mustn’t expect to find
fresh herbs and olive oil or a judicious sprinkle of balsamic vinegar, but
if you’re willing to be open-minded, you may find some unfamiliar side
dishes that please you. Take a chance and order fried green tomatoes,
corn pudding, collard or turnip greens, yams, hominy, black-eyed peas
or field peas, okra, squash, lima beans, or green beans, often called snap
beans, cooked in water with a little chopped bacon or bacon fat until
tender and succulent.
You can always find a wedge of lemon to squeeze over everything
because lemon is an essential accessory in this land of iced tea. By the
way, iced tea usually comes sweetened here; if you don’t want sugar, ask
for unsweetened tea. When ordering tea at breakfast, be sure to specify
hot tea, or you’ll get iced tea. Don’t ask for a “soda”; carbonated drinks
are called “pop” or “soda pop” in the South.
Hot breads, usually biscuits and/or cornbread, are the general rule as
well. By the way, unlike the cornbread and corn muffins in other parts of
the United States, Southern cornbread rarely has sugar added. You won’t
find hot breads at barbecue joints; there, multiple slices of soft white
bread straight from the grocery-store package come as a side dish.
Southern cooking, state by state
In northwestern Alabama, breakfasts can be feasts with grits, ham, biscuits, sausage,
eggs, and gravy. Fried chicken stars at lunch and dinner (the former sometimes called
“dinner” and the latter “supper” in the rural South), and you may run across dessert
curiosities, such as Coca-Cola cake and mile-high meringue pies.
Mississippi cuisine is high on fried catfish — hardly unusual, as the state turns out 70
percent of all the catfish farmed in the United States. In fact, the catfish capital of the
world is Belzoni, a few miles west of the Natchez Trace. Fried fish of all sorts usually
are served with hush puppies, which are deep-fried balls of cornbread seasoned with
onions, and hot tamales. The hot tamales are a mystery; nobody is sure where they
originated, but most Mississippi restaurants, especially in the delta, serve them as
appetizers or side dishes. Rolled in parchment paper rather than cornhusks and
ordered by the half-dozen or dozen, Mississippi hot tamales are smaller and spicier
than the Mexican version.
Down-home Tennessee restaurants around Nashville serve what they call meat-and-
three, meaning your choice of a main dish of meat and three side vegetables. Country
ham on a Southern menu, especially in Tennessee, describes a smoked or dry-cured
ham that spends weeks in a bed of salt and turns out as a salty, densely textured, and
intensely flavored meat that can be sliced and fried for breakfast or boiled whole and
then baked and served cold in paper-thin slices. And don’t miss Nashville’s famous
Goo Goo Cluster candy bars with peanuts, chocolate, marshmallow, and caramel.

Chapter 16: The Natchez Trace: Natchez to Nashville 207
Servings are large in this part of the country; we find that one takeout
meal often is enough for both of us. If it seems skimpy when we open the
takeout box, we add a homemade green salad or a dessert.
The following restaurants and food suppliers are some of our favorites
for regional cooking at moderate prices. Many may require cash rather
than credit cards. Most don’t serve beer or wine with meals; even when
dining out in fancy restaurants, many Southerners drink iced tea, colas,
hot coffee, or even a cocktail with their meals. For information on buying
the basics, see “Stocking the Pantry,” earlier in this chapter.
 Carl’s Perfect Pig, U.S. 70, White Bluff, Tennessee (% 615-797-4020):
A pretty, pink barbecue joint by the side of the road serves pulled
or chopped sandwiches from pork shoulders that have been slow-
cooked on a bed of hickory coals for 24 hours and then steeped in
a vinegar sauce overnight. Open Wednesday and Thursday 10:30
a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Friday and Saturday until 7 p.m., Sunday until 
2:30 p.m.
 Cock of the Walk, 2624 Music Valley Dr., Nashville, Tennessee 
(% 615-889-1930): An easy stroll from the Opryland KOA camp-
ground, this popular casual eatery provides sit-down and takeout
service, and the latter, with its own order window, is much quicker.
The fried catfish is delectable, and so are the fried shrimp and a
sampler dinner that adds fried chicken. Side dishes include fried
dill pickles (don’t laugh ’til you taste them), fried onions, and a
cooking pot of beans or greens. Cocktails, beer, and wine also are
served. Two locations are in Mississippi: 200 N. Broadway, Natchez
(% 601-446-8920), and Madison Landing, Ridgeland (% 601-856-
5500). All locations are open Monday through Thursday from 5 a.m.
to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Loveless Motel & Cafe, 8400 SR 100, Nashville, Tennessee, about 
10 miles southwest of town (% 615-646-9700; www.lovelesscafe.
com): A motel by the side of the road with a neon sign that says
LOVELESS in pink and green serves the world’s best breakfasts —
country ham, grits, gravy, eggs, homemade biscuits, and home-
made jams and jellies. Lunches and dinners are great, too, with
meals built around country ham or fried chicken. (Get one of each
and trade tastes.) The same generous servings of hot biscuits,
butter, and homemade jams come with every meal, and they sell
jars of the jam to go. Open Sunday through Thursday from 7 a.m. 
to 9 p.m., and Friday and Saturday until 9 p.m.
 Rocking Chair Restaurant, U.S. 72 West, Tuscumbia, Alabama 
(% 256-381-6105): The Sunday lunch turkey special came with
mashed potatoes and green beans, while a four-vegetable plate
came crowded with black-eyed peas, candied yams, white beans
with ham, fried okra, and hot biscuits and cornbread. The whole

Part III: Exploring the East 
208
thing cost under $10. Open Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m., and Friday through Sunday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Walnut Hills, 1214 Adams St., Vicksburg, Mississippi (% 601-638-
4910): We covered this restaurant for Bon Appétit magazine and 
will never forget the help-yourself bowls and platters heaped with
Southern fried chicken, ribs, smothered pork chops, stuffed pep-
pers with Creole sauce, rice and gravy, green beans with potatoes,
lima beans, fresh-field peas, yellow squash with onions, glazed car-
rots, coleslaw, corn muffins, iced tea, and blueberry cobbler. The
cooks were amused when we asked for such “everyday” recipes.
Open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and Sunday
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Closed Saturday.
Shopping along the Way
Mississippi Crafts Center, 1150 Lakeland Dr., Natchez Trace Parkway,
Jackson, Mississippi (% 601-856-7546; www.mscraftsmensguild.org),
sells handicrafts created by local artists and craftsmen, including weavers
from the local Choctaw and Chickasaw people. Items are attractively
arranged in this little unpainted mountain cottage. Standouts include
quilt-work handbags, pottery, Choctaw baskets, and books about the
region. Prices range from affordable to expensive. The center is open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Discovering 
Mid-America

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re from America’s heartland or visiting 
the country’s midsection for the ﬁrst time, you’ll ﬁnd
Mid-America full of surprises. Among your various choices of
things to eat, see and do, we show you where to kick back
with tasty Texas Hill Country barbecue (mmm . . . Chapter
17), to see the Wright stuff and talk to dead presidents in
Ohio (Chapter 18), to paddle through the Land of Lakes or
ﬁsh in northern Minnesota (Chapter 19), or to dig for dia-
monds or tune in to toe-tapping music in Branson and the
Ozarks (Chapter 20).

Texas Hill Country:
Bluebonnets and Barbecue

T
he heart of Texas is hardscrabble country, pink and gray granite and
white limestone, longhorn cattle ranges, and flood-washed gullies.
But the tough terrain has a soft, loving heart. As the singing cowboy
said, the stars at night are big and bright (clap clap clap clap), and the
sage is like perfume. In a good springtime, the hills are blanketed with
intensely beautiful wildflowers — bluebonnets, scarlet Indian paint-
brush, buttercups, and poppies as thick as those that put Judy Garland
to sleep in The Wizard of Oz.
The Texas Hill Country is full of surprises — zany San Antonio where
every day brings another chance for a celebration; barbecue a billion
times tastier than those boring racks of chain-restaurant ribs coated
with thick, sweet, red sauce from a bottle; Austin with its rock-’n’-roll
and country music ties to such artists as Janis Joplin and Lyle Lovett;
laid-back Luckenbach where Willie Nelson sometimes hangs out; cool
jazz spots along San Antonio’s River Walk; and German Fredericksburg
with bratwurst and beer gardens.
Texas also is probably the most RV-friendly state, with plenty of camp-
grounds, including state parks with hookups, great bargain-priced take-
out food, and well-paved back roads. What are you waiting for? Yee-haw!
Let’s hit the road!
Getting There
San Antonio is an excellent starting point for a circle tour of Texas Hill
Country. (See the “Texas Hill Country” map in this chapter for the route.)
From here, you drive northeast 30 miles on I-35 to New Braunfels, a

prominent community first settled by Germans, then strike out on back
roads east to Luling and Lockhart, center of barbecue country, and then
north to the colorful old town of Bastrop and the hot sausage capital of
Elgin. From here, you head north to Taylor for more barbecue, then
west again to the Texas capital of Austin, and then due west to Johnson
City and Fredericksburg on U.S. 290. Go north to Llano on SR 16, a
scenic back road, and then west to Mason through bluebonnet fields on
SR 29, turn southwest to Junction, and make a fast loop back into San
Antonio on I-10 through Kerrville. The entire route covers around 400
miles plus a few side road detours.
Planning Ahead
The absolute best time to go is in spring when the wildflowers are at
their peak. That can be any time from the end of March through April
and into early May, depending on winter rainfall and spring weather. Call
the Texas Wild Flower Hot Line at % 800-452-9292 to get information
on the best times and areas for maximum bloom.
But you can enjoy an RV vacation in the Texas Hill Country year-round.
Winter usually is mild, summers are warm to hot but not sweltering, and
fall is almost perfect, except the wildflowers are not at their peak.
When bluebonnets are in bloom, any Texan with a motor vehicle heads
for the hill country for a leisurely drive along the best wildflower routes,
especially on Saturdays and Sundays. RVers need to plan to drive the
scenic routes on weekdays, and then spend weekends in and around the
cities of San Antonio and Austin when all the urban dwellers have gone
to the country.
If you know your exact dates and itineraries for the Texas Hill Country,
especially in spring wildflower season, you need to make campground
reservations for the private RV campgrounds.
You want to pack light, all-cotton clothes for summer in Texas, along
with some safari-type long pants and long-sleeved jackets for hikes in
the wild year-round. Spring brings frequent rain showers, so be prepared
with umbrellas and raincoats. Winter can be chilly on overcast days;
bring a jacket or heavy sweater and plan to layer your clothing.
Allow a week for a leisurely drive around the hill country; add more
time if you want to spend more than a day or so each in San Antonio and
Austin.
Stocking the Pantry
Because so many wonderful barbecue spots with extra-large portions are
located throughout the hill country, we wind up with plenty of extras in
plastic bags in the refrigerator. Under “Good eats,” later in this chapter,
Chapter 17: Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets and Barbecue 215

we offer some ideas for using leftovers. Mexican bakers, such as Mi Tierra
Café y Panaderia in San Antonio’s El Mercado (market square), sell
breads, breakfast pastries, and tortillas. Jardine’s Texas Foods in Buda,
south of Austin, sells gourmet salsas, sauces, and seasonings at lower
prices than the fancy food shops around the country. New Braunfels
Smokehouse sells not only cooked meats and meals but also has a full-
service deli with smoked meats, German breads, and mustards. (For
details on these establishments, see “Good eats.”)
Keep your eyes open for only-in-Texas food products, such as Bob’s
Texas-style potato chips, manufactured in Brookshire, and creamy Blue
Bell ice cream, made in Brenham and distributed in a limited market in
and around Texas. Also look for local peaches in season at roadside
stands around Fredericksburg, the peach capital of Texas.
Driving the Texas Hill Country
One convenient gateway to the hill country is the hospitable city of San
Antonio, where no sooner than one fiesta or celebration ends than
another begins. What else can you say about a city that dyes its river
green for St. Patrick’s Day, celebrates New Year’s Eve by breaking con-
fetti-filled eggshells called cascarones for good luck, and still has a big
party in late April called Fiesta San Antonio, created in the late 19th
century to honor a visit by then-president Benjamin Harrison? Everyone
was having such a great time that few noticed that the guest of honor
failed to show up.
San Antonio is full of places to go and things to see. Don’t miss the old
downtown market square called El Mercado with Mexican shops and
restaurants; the enchanting River Walk, a meandering pedestrian walk-
way lined with restaurants and jazz clubs along the banks of the San
Antonio River; the Institute of Texas Cultures (not an oxymoron); and,
of course, you remember The Alamo. (See “Must-see attractions,” later
in this chapter, for details on all these spots.)
You may also enjoy the San Antonio Zoo, the Buckhorn Hall of Horns,
Fins, and Feathers in the Buckhorn Saloon, and the Witte Museum of
History and Science, where you can step into an exhibit and punch but-
tons to see, hear, and smell the world the way animals do. (For all these
attractions, see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter.)
You may want to divide the San Antonio city attractions into two sec-
tions: some to see before you set off on your RV drive and some to catch
when you come back.
From San Antonio, drive northeast on I-35 to New Braunfels. Regardless
of whether it’s time to eat, you need to stop at New Braunfels
Smokehouse for some smoked meats and sausages (see “Good eats,”
later in this chapter). If you visit in November, plan to attend the ten-day
annual Wurstfest to celebrate local sausages. From New Braunfels, drive
southeast on SR 46 to connect with I-10, and then travel east to Luling,

home of the annual Watermelon Thump and Watermelon Seed Spitting
Festival in late June. Luling is home to the City Market barbecue spot,
more gentrified than most from the outside but authentic on the inside
(see “Good eats”).
From Luling, Lockhart and three more magical barbecue takeouts are a
short 13 miles north on U.S. 183. (We warned you that you’d have left-
overs.) Kreuz Market, founded in 1900, always was the leader here, with
Black’s Barbecue, founded in 1932, playing Avis to Kreuz’s Hertz. Not
long ago, a split in the Schmidt family that owns Kreuz resulted in a third
establishment called Smitty’s in the original Kreuz Market building; the
original Kreuz is now in a new location in Lockhart. (See “Good eats,” for
details on all three.)
Next, you’re going to head northeast on SR 21 bound for Bastrop, an old
city (est. 1832) that predates the birth of Texas statehood. A casual
stroll along Main Street takes you past a 19th-century drugstore called

Lock’s with an ice-cream parlor and lunch counter. Drive north on SR 95
another 18 miles to Elgin (pronounced with a hard g as in good), home of
the world’s most delicious hot links. Don’t groan; just walk up to the
counter at Southside Market and Bar-B-Q and buy a pound of grilled
links (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter). While they’re hot, take a
bite of one with the saltine crackers that accompany them, and store the
rest in the refrigerator to reheat later. (On our first visit, it was 9 a.m.,
and we’d had nothing for nourishment but some hot tea from the
Thermos. The fragrance from the sausages filled the RV, and we tore into
the package while we still were in the parking lot. The taste was incredi-
ble, smoky and a bit spicy but full-flavored and rich, leaving us craving
more.) You need to restrain yourself, however, because you still have
one more world-class barbecue joint to hit before Austin.
Louie Mueller’s in Taylor, 15 miles north of Elgin on SR 95, is our candi-
date for the best barbecue in Texas, but some days the place runs out
around noon (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter). Then they just
clean up and close up for the day. Besides the delicious taste, there’s a
good reason for the sellout — Mueller’s opens early to feed local rail-
road workers, whose favorite breakfast is a good plate of barbecue.
Well fortified for the rest of the drive, continue west to Austin on U.S.
290, another 18 miles or so. Besides being home to the University of

Bluebonnets in bloom
The first time you see a field of bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis), you probably won’t
believe your eyes. This isn’t a cute little cluster or a photogenic patch, but a blue carpet
of thousands and thousands of bluebonnets in every direction. Up close, they bear a
strong resemblance to a California wildflower called lupine (Lupinus subcarnosus),
but because this is Texas and they’re the state flower, bluebonnets they are.
In a good spring, you witness one floral spectacle after another, each seemingly more
magnificent than the one before. Sometimes splashy red Indian paintbrush kicks in; at
other times, you see lavender verbena; sometimes, what the Texans call yellow but-
tercups appear, looking very much like black-eyed Susans. Herds of Texas longhorns
lying lazily about among the flowers treat the lavishness of the displays offhandedly.
You see bluebonnets from a spot between West Texas and central Texas, somewhere
around Sonora and Junction, east to the hill country around Austin and almost to the
Louisiana border. Some good wildflower spotting areas are along U.S. 377 from
Junction on I-10 east to Mason and then east along SR 29 to Llano. In the same vicin-
ity, the Highland Lakes Bluebonnet Trail meanders a back road from Austin north along
FM (“farm-to-market” road) 1431 past man-made lakes and small wineries, through
the little towns of Marble Falls, Burnet, Buchanan Dam, Kingsland, and Llano. Some
stretches are narrow, so if you’re driving or towing a large RV, check on road condi-
tions locally.

Texas, a thriving arts center, and the “live music capital of the world,”
with 25 years of producing Austin City Limits for PBS, this sophisticated
city has a variety of good restaurants and plenty of metropolitan parks
with hiking, rock-climbing, and biking.
In Austin, take a horse-and-buggy tour around town and check out the
largest state capitol in the nation, Old Pecan Street restaurant row, and
the Mexican freetail bats that live under the Congress Avenue Bridge.
(See “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter, for info on
buggy tours and bats.)
From Austin, drive south on I-35 to Buda to pick up some Texas sauces
and seasonings from Jardine’s Texas Foods, and then zigzag west on FM
967 to Driftwood, where you find The Salt Lick, another barbecue dis-
covery. Continue north from Driftwood on SR 12 to join U.S. 290 at
Dripping Springs, and then turn west to Johnson City. (See “Good eats,”
later in this chapter, for info on Jardine’s Texas Foods and The Salt Lick.)
The famous Pedernales River, where Lady Bird and Lyndon Johnson
used to play host to huge barbecues on their ranch, lends its name to 
a state park with camping — Pedernales Falls State Park (see “Our
favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter). In Johnson City, named
for the late president’s ancestors, is one division of the Lyndon B.
Johnson National Historical Park, where a visitor center and his boy-
hood home are open to the public. To visit the second division (Lyndon
B. Johnson National and State Historical Parks), drive another 14 miles
west to Stonewall for a bus tour from the visitor center through the LBJ
Ranch, the only way to see the property. (See “Must-see attractions” for
both park divisions.)
To follow or precede the 90-minute bus tour, depending on bus availabil-
ity, take a walking tour through the Sauer-Beckman Living History
Farm, which includes a good look at some grazing longhorn cattle (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Another 15 miles west from Stonewall on U.S. 290 brings you to
Fredericksburg, home of the outstanding Admiral Nimitz Museum &
Historical Center and the National Museum of the Pacific War (see
“Must-see attractions”), a dulcimer factory, a brew pub, an herb farm,
wineries, a working wildflower seed farm (the nation’s largest), and the
Pioneer Museum Complex (see “More cool things to see and do,” later
in this chapter).
Luckenbach is an eccentric little town that’s famous thanks to a song
about it by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson (see “More cool things to
see and do”). The beer-drinking, guitar-picking community that roars in
on weekends often slumbers during the week, leaving the town empty
and quiet. A writer compared Luckenbach to Brigadoon — “You’re
almost afraid to go back because it might not be there again.”
Chapter 17: Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets and Barbecue 219

From Fredericksburg, especially in spring when the bluebonnets are
blooming, take a scenic drive 38 miles north to Llano via SR 16, pausing
to sample the famous barbecue at Cooper’s outdoor pit (see “Good
eats,” later in this chapter). The drive west to Mason on SR 29 is another
outstanding wildflower area in good years. From Mason, head west on
U.S. 377 to Junction and an easy return south to San Antonio on I-35. En
route, the little town of Comfort, 2 miles off Exit 523, is famous for its
antiques shops and laid-back little restaurants.
Must-see attractions
Admiral Nimitz Museum & Historical Center and the National
Museum of the Pacific War
Fredericksburg
This monument to a famous World War II admiral is much more than mili-
tary history; the Nimitz family was among the early German settlers in the
area, and the museum is housed in the restored Nimitz Steamboat Hotel,
owned by the family and birthplace of the admiral. Film clips, interactive
exhibits, and major displays indoors and out make this museum a fasci-
nating trip through time. An expansion of the original museum now
includes the extensive Museum of the Pacific War. Allow three hours.

space on side streets around the museum. Admission: $7 adults, $6 seniors, $5 stu-

Deep in the herz (heart) of Texas
In the overpopulated old country, Prussian nobility recruited German immigrants, the
first major nonnative settlers in this part of Texas, to settle the New World. Thousands
landed on the Gulf Coast between 1845 and 1847; those who survived the sea journey
and the diseases of the new land settled in the areas around what is now
Fredericksburg. The Germans started farms in the outlying terrain, but because they
came into Fredericksburg on Saturdays to do their shopping and wanted to stay over
for church on Sunday morning, they built “Sunday houses” from local limestone, tack-
ing on an extra bedroom or two as the family grew and then adding outdoor stairways
and a room or two on top when necessary. Today, the Sunday houses are in great
demand as retirement homes and bed-and-breakfasts.
The early German settlers also brought sausage- and beer-making to the region. Today,
their descendants speak a long-forgotten dialect of German, and most have never
been to their homeland. Still, they happily grill sausages, drink beer, and celebrate an
annual Oktoberfest with just as much gusto as their European ancestors.

The Alamo
San Antonio
If all you remember about the Alamo comes from the John Wayne movie
of the same name, filmed on a special set constructed way down on the
Rio Grande near the Mexican border, you may be startled to see the real
thing hunkered down in the middle of downtown San Antonio. A high-rise
hotel and office buildings dwarf the Franciscan mission that was the site
of that bloody battle between Mexicans and Texans in 1836. The adjacent
museum relates the story. In front of the Alamo, note the cenotaph, which
lists the men who died in the battle. The facade of the chapel is one of the
most photographed spots in the nation. Allow three hours.
300 Alamo Square. % 210-225-1391. www.thealamo.org. RV parking: Some
nearby public parking lots can handle RVs. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 
9 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed Christmas Eve and Christmas Day; lim-
ited hours Mar 6 (the anniversary of the fall of the Alamo).
El Mercado
San Antonio
A commercial Mexican-theme market, El Mercado is fun for strolling, but
better for eating a hearty, inexpensive Tex-Mex meal in one of the outdoor
cafes, which make good spots for margarita-sipping and music-listening,
too. (See “Good eats” for our favorite restaurants.) You can also shop here
for typical Texas and Mexican souvenirs. Allow one hour for looking
around; add more for a meal or margarita stop.

Institute of Texas Cultures
San Antonio
This museum really comes to life on weekdays during the school year
when busloads of children attentively listen to museum docents explain-
ing the history and traditions of some 25 ethnic groups that settled Texas.
Meanwhile, a fiddler plays “Irish Washerwoman” and talks about early Irish
settlers in one area, while in another, a man near a chuck wagon discusses
trail cooking: “They ate this same meal, beans and biscuits and meat, every
single day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.” Allow three to four hours.

Lyndon B. Johnson National and State Historical Parks
Stonewall
The larger part of the divided national park is in Stonewall, 14 miles west
of Johnson City and 16 miles east of Fredericksburg. Go first to the visitor
center, where you can take an air-conditioned tour bus through the
famous LBJ Ranch, the late president’s pride and joy. (This tour is the only
way visitors can enter the ranch itself.) Depending on the bus schedule
(tours last 90 minutes), take a walk through the Sauer-Beckmann Living
History Farm adjacent to the visitor center before or after the ranch tour,
but do take it in. You see a herd of longhorns, and at the farm, women in
long cotton dresses and sunbonnets boiling wash in a big iron pot out-
doors, clabbering milk to make cottage cheese, churning butter, and pre-
serving ham and bacon. (They also cook lunch here for the park rangers.)

fortable, if sometimes accident-prone, childhood. Gain insights at the vis-
itor center and then walk down into the Johnson Settlement where his
grandparents and other relatives lived. Allow three hours.

River Walk
San Antonio
An already delightful city multiplied the fun back in 1939 by creating River
Walk, a meandering walkway one level below the downtown streets along
the San Antonio River. River Walk is the city’s beating heart, the pulse of its
party mood. The sidewalk wends its sun-dappled way through downtown,
a few stair steps below traffic in a pedestrian-scaled world of sidewalk cafes,
paddleboats, sightseeing barges, and morning-through-midnight street life.
In one trip, you may walk by musicians playing Dixieland and Cajun music
and by an Irish tenor singing “Danny Boy.” Don’t leave San Antonio with-
out taking a stroll here day or night!
Entrance access from city streets including South Alamo, Lojoya, Presa, Navarro, St.
Mary’s, Market, Commerce, and Crockett. www.thesanantonioriverwalk.
com. RV parking: Large parking lots are located at Commerce Street near the
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
222

Convention Center and at the Southwest Craft Center, 300 Augusta St., near Navarro;
you may also park your RV in the lot near El Mercado, and then walk the 6 or so blocks
along Commerce or Dolorosa Street to River Walk. Admission: Free for strolling.
Open: Walkway always open; restaurants and bars operate late morning until late
evening; shop hours vary.
More cool things to see and do
Attractions from nature’s Enchanted Rock to a fine collection of circus
artifacts and miniatures fill the Texas Hill Country. The San Antonio Zoo
is world famous for its breeding-in-captivity program, and the Buckhorn
Hall of Horns, Fins, and Feathers always is good for a surprise or two.
 Go batty in Austin. Summer evenings at sunset is the best time to
see the bats of Congress Avenue Bridge, the nation’s largest urban
colony of bats. They fly out from under the bridge in search of their
evening meals, 20,000 pounds of mosquitoes and other pesky
insects. This colony of Mexican freetail bats is in residence from
late March until the end of October. Watch from the bridge. Allow 
5 to 15 minutes for their exit after they start. Find out more about
these bats and the species at www.batcon.org/home/index.asp?
idPage=122.
 Fish got to swim, birds got to fly. Located in a century-old saloon,
the zany Buckhorn Hall of Horns, Fins, and Feathers, 318 E.
Houston St., San Antonio (% 210-247-4000; www.buckhornmuseum.
com), has 4,000 exhibits, including Ol’ Tex, a stuffed longhorn with
an 8-foot, 9-inch spread on his horns. Gunfighters face off at high
noon on weekends, and an arcade and gift shop offer chances to
spend even more money. Allow one to two hours.
RV parking is available in a small parking lot adjacent the museum,
as well as on the street. Admission is $12 adults, $9 seniors, $6 ages
17 and younger. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Like a rock. Rock-climbing, hiking, and picnicking are great 
at Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, 18 miles north of
Fredericksburg, off FM 965 (% 325-247-3903; www.tpwd.
state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/enchanted_rock), 
but unfortunately, the rest of the world already has discovered it,
so restrictions are plentiful. During heavy use periods, the park
closes for the day when a maximum number of visitors is reached.
Don’t even think of visiting on weekends, holidays, or during 
spring break. Local tribes venerated the rock, a National Natural
Landmark. Allow a half-day to a full day, if you’re able to get in.
RV parking is available in a large lot below the office. Admission is
$6 ages 13 and older. It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.; the
office closes at 9 p.m. No RV overnighting is allowed.
 Giddyap! Did you bring the champagne? The most romantic way
to see Austin, Texas, is to book a horse-drawn carriage for a tour
Chapter 17: Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets and Barbecue 223

around downtown. Call Austin Carriage Service (% 512-243-0044),
which is $40 per half-hour for up to six people.
 This Bud’s for Hondo. The late Hondo Crouch, Texas writer and 
all-round character, purchased the tiny town of Luckenbach (www.
luckenbachtexas.com), which was made famous in a song by
Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. It’s busiest on Sunday after-
noons, when many people show up with guitars and drink longneck
bottles of Shiner Bock beer to live out the song’s lyric, “in
Luckenbach, Texas, ain’t nobody feelin’ no pain.”
Don’t count on signage to help you find it; the signs are torn down
almost as quickly as they’re put up. From Fredericksburg, drive
east on U.S. 290 for 6 miles, turn south on FM 1376 and continue
another 4 miles, and then take the second left where the sign (if it’s
there) says Luckenbach Road.
 A Sunday kind of house. The local historical society created 
the Pioneer Museum Complex, 309 W. Main St., Fredericksburg 
(% 830-997-2835; www.pioneermuseum.com), a replica of old
Fredericksburg, with an eight-room furnished home and store from
1849, a wine cellar and brewery, barn, blacksmith shop, Sunday
house, log cabin, and fire museum with period equipment. Allow
two hours.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $4. It’s open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 
1 to 5 p.m.
 It’s a jungle out there. One of the best zoos in America, the San
Antonio Zoo, 3903 N. St. Mary’s at Brackenridge Park, San Antonio
(% 210-734-7183; www.sazoo-aq.org), is notable for its success
with breeding in captivity and its sanctuaries for endangered
species, such as snow leopards, whooping cranes, and white
rhinos. The wide expanse of open exhibits gives kids a chance to
run and see a variety of exotic animals. Allow half a day.
RV parking is available in a lot at the zoo under U.S. 281. Admission
is $9 adults, $7 seniors and ages 3 to 11. It’s open daily from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. (June–Aug until 6 p.m.)
 Climb a tree. With hands-on exhibits for all ages, the Witte Museum
of History and Science, 3801 Broadway, San Antonio (% 210-357-
1900; www.wittemuseum.org), presents dioramas and exhibits
about Texas flora and fauna. The two-level H-E-B Science Treehouse
by the river even has binoculars for wildlife viewing. Allow two to
three hours.
RV parking is available across the street in the back lot of the IHOP.
Admission is $7 adults, $6 ages 11 to 17, $5 ages 4 to 11; free Tues 3
to 9 p.m. It’s open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday noon to 5 p.m.

Weekend wonder
If you’re going to be in the area and want to make a quick trip around the
Texas Hill Country in a couple of days, you can do so if you cut out a
couple of small towns and barbecue joints. Begin in San Antonio as the
main driving tour does, take a quick look at the Alamo and River Walk,
and then head north to New Braunfels for a stop at the Smokehouse for
some smoked meats. From there, strike out on CR 12 north to its junc-
tion with CR 697, turn east to Driftwood, and stop at The Salt Lick for a
barbecue lunch or dinner. Continue north to rejoin U.S. 290 at Dripping
Springs, and then turn west to Johnson City, pausing for the Lyndon B.
Johnson National and State Parks there and in nearby Stonewall. Drive
into Fredericksburg, look at the Admiral Nimitz Museum, have a
German meal or snack, and then follow U.S. 87 to rejoin I-35 at Comfort.
You can pause here for a little antiquing, if time allows; then follow I-35
back into San Antonio.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Texas is an RV-friendly state, so you find plenty of privately owned and
state-owned campgrounds, all with hookups. As for good eats, they’re
inescapable in this land of barbecue and Mexican restaurants. Because
the Texans themselves are big-time RVers, you want to make camp-
ground reservations whenever convenient, especially in the spring 
on weekends when the bluebonnets are blooming. During the heat of
summer, campgrounds are less crowded than in the spring — spring
break is very busy — or fall when the summer weather cools down. In
the middle of the summer, Texas is hot, topping 100°F on occasion. In
the winter, weather is mild, and campgrounds aren’t crowded.
All campgrounds listed in this chapter are open year-round and have
public flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless desig-
nated otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations
only. See Chapter 9 for information on how we select our favorite

Good eats
Regional cooking, takeouts, rural family restaurants on a side road with
long lines of patrons waiting for Sunday dinner in the midday — all these
are signs of good-eats establishments. Because the Texas Hill Country is
about barbecue, we begin there, and then tell you about some equally
ethnic places from Tex-Mex to German.
Barbecue joints
Texans like beef, so the pride of a pit boss (barbecue chef) is almost
always slow-cooked cuts of beef, most often from the brisket or shoul-
der. Cooking fuel depends on local supply, with mesquite dominant in
the hill country and pecan wood as you move east. Sometimes it seems
that everybody in central Texas has a barbecue establishment, rusty tin-
sided contraptions by the side of the road with crude hand-painted signs
faded by time. Most don’t keep regular hours, but if smoke is coming out
and you can smell the meat, it’s open.
The best barbecue joints in Texas are casual places where the clients
line up to order their food and then eat it wherever it’s convenient — at
a nearby table, an outdoor picnic table, or back in their RV. We have sev-
eral rules about barbecue places:
 Never stop at a barbecue joint that advertises along the freeway
with a string of billboards.
 Be wary of proprietors who sell their own bottled barbecue sauce;
they may be putting more effort into the bottling than the barbecu-
ing.
 Never try to impose your own tastes in barbecue on the proprietor;
the reason he’s famous is because he makes it his way.
 Be wary of a barbecue joint that has its own Web site. (Though
because this is the 21st century, if one of the joints we list actually
has a Web site, we list it.)
 Watch out for fancy decorations, such as tablecloths and silver-
ware, or numerous side dishes; they just add clutter and confusion
and take the attention away from the meat.
 Don’t add any sauce or additional seasoning before tasting the bar-
becue. The best Texas barbecue speaks for itself and stands up to a
taste test without any sauce or seasoning.
 Always know what you want to order before you get in line; never
stand dumbfounded and ask the server what’s good today — the
mark of a rank amateur.

Street parking for RVs or empty lot parking is generally easy to find near
most barbecue vendors because they’re in small towns or, in the case of
Bob’s Smokehouse in San Antonio, a residential/industrial area. Some,
notably Smitty’s and Southside Market, have their own parking lots with
plenty of room for RVs.
The following list includes some of our favorite Texas Hill Country bar-
becue vendors:
 Black’s Barbecue, 215 N. Main St., Lockhart (% 512-398-2712):
Despite a display of tacky roadside signs such as, BLACK’S IS OPEN 8
DAYS A WEEK, this barbecue turns out a wonderful smoked pork loin,
tasty enough when it’s hot but delectable cold the next day on
sandwiches spread with chipotle (smoked chilies) flavored mayon-
naise. Don’t bother with Black’s rather bland serve-yourself sauce.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 The Smokehouse, 3306 Roland Ave., San Antonio (% 210-333-9548;
www.thesmokehousesa.com): This place was formerly known as
“Bob’s Smokehouse,” and is still called that by some. Take Exit 578
from I-10 and drive south on Roland Avenue (at Rigsby). An
unpainted building in southeastern San Antonio is covered with 
slogans from Bob (BOB KNOWS: BAR-B-Q MUST COME OFF A PIT, NOT
FROM UNDER RED LIGHTS). Ribs (pork, beef, and lamb) and brisket 
top the takeout orders, with double sauce on the side. Open
Monday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., Friday and Saturday
until 9 p.m. Closed on Sunday.
 City Market, 633 E. Davis St., Luling (% 830-875-9019): Business
types in suits line up at lunchtime for briskets, ribs, and sausages;
it looks gentrified from the outside but is the real thing inside. Open
Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Closed Sunday.
 Cooper’s, 604 W. Young St., Llano (% 325-247-5713): All the cook-
ing is done outdoors under a big roof. Brisket, sausages, chuck and
club steak are cooked on mesquite; weekends, you can also get
cabrito (kid goat) and thick pork chops. Open Sunday through
Thursday from 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Dozier’s Grocery, 8222 FM 359, Fulshear (% 281-346-1411): Take
Exit 720 from I-10 and drive 12 miles south on SR 36 to CR 1093, and
then turn east 5 miles to Fulshear. A bit to the east of hill country
proper, this rural store dishes up pecan-smoked brisket and
sausages and a hearty barbecue sauce. Dozier’s also has a sales rack
of Bob’s Texas-Style Potato Chips, made in nearby Brookshire and
distributed locally only. Open Tuesday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Hinze’s Barbeque & Catering, 2101 SR 36 S., Sealy (% 979-885-
7808): Take Exit 720 from I-10 and drive 1 mile north to Sealy. Pecan
wood cooks the barbecued beef brisket and side dishes of pinto
Chapter 17: Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets and Barbecue 229

beans, okra gumbo, and onion-bacon potatoes, served cafeteria-
style. (We know that we said no side dishes, but Hinze’s is an
exception.) Open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Kreuz Market, 619 N. Colorado St., Lockhart (% 512-398-2361;
www.kreuzmarket.com/index.shtm): Our favorite ambience is
gone now that Kreuz (pronounced kritz) has left its ancient, no-frills
location and reopened in a new building with character, but the
flavor of the beef is as good as ever. You buy here by the pound,
not the sandwich. Open Monday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m.
to 8 p.m. Closed Sunday.
 Louie Mueller, 206 W. Second St., Taylor (% 512-352-6206;
www.louiemuellerbarbeque.com): This venerated establishment
is the only business still existing in an ancient block marked by
vacant buildings, broken sidewalks, and years of neglect. Open the
creaking screen door and inside several neon beer signs provide
just enough light to see the quiet, dark room, smoky from decades
of wood fires. Barbecued brisket doesn’t get any better than this;
order the thin, peppery, oniony sauce (one customer mistook it for
onion soup until he tasted it) on the side. Open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. or until barbecue is sold out, usu-
ally early to midafternoon. Closed Sunday.
 The Salt Lick, 18001 FM 1826, Driftwood (% 512-858-4959; www.
saltlickbbq.com): Driftwood is 20 miles southwest of Austin on
FM 1826 between FM 967 and FM 150. An old stone ranch house out
in the boonies, open since 1969, The Salt Lick is an institution.
Open-pit-barbecued brisket, ribs, and sausage, served with potato
salad, coleslaw, beans, pickles, onions, and bread make up the
family-style meal, but you also can order a la carte. BYOB in your
RV refrigerator. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Smitty’s, 208 S. Commerce St., Lockhart (% 512-398-9344; www.
smittysmarket.com): In the place where Kreuz Market (which is
still in Lockhart, in a new location) used to be, the place has the
genuine reek of authenticity and decades of barbecued meats. You
enter from the dirt parking lot in the rear into a hot, dark backroom
with four or five workers who fork up the meats you order, slap
them down on a big wood slab, and slice them, wrapping every-
thing in pink butcher paper. Both the brisket and the beef shoulder
roast are charred crunchy and black on the outside, juicy and
tender on the inside. Serious eaters don’t douse them with sauce.
Open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Sun to 3 p.m.).
 Southside Market and Bar-B-Q, 1212 SR 290, Elgin (% 512-285-
3407): The sausages, called Elgin Hot Guts and served with cello-
phane-wrapped saltine crackers, are fantastic, but they also sell
brisket, mutton ribs, and barbecue sandwiches, and have a well-
stocked meat market on one side and a Blue Bell ice-cream cone
bar on another. Open Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 
8 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., and Sunday 
from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.

Beyond barbecue: Old-timey good eats
Texas is full of good eats. Try these hill country places:
 Altdorf’s, 301 W. Main St., Fredericksburg (% 830-997-7865): This
homey German biergarten and dining room serves German dinners
indoors and out in the beer garden, along with Texas chow, such as
charbroiled rib-eye steaks, tacos, and enchiladas. Try a sausage
dinner, such as bratwurst, knockwurst, or bockwurst, or a meat
specialty, such as wiener schnitzel, sauerbraten, or rindsrouladen,
a rolled slice of beef stuffed with pickles, onion, and mustard. 
Open daily except Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday 
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 El Mercado, Market Square, 514 W. Commerce St., San Antonio 
(% 210-207-8600): This historic Mexican market began in the days
of the “chili queens” when local women served a spicy meat-and-
beans concoction called “chili con carne” at night, first from stalls
set up around the Alamo and later from this marketplace, and local
farmers sold produce during the day. Today, you can sample any-
thing from Blue Bell ice-cream cones to pecan pralines, sip margari-
tas and listen to strolling mariachi bands who take requests (and
expect a tip), and shop for Southwestern art, dried herbs, Kahlua,
embroidered peasant blouses, and big sombreros. Open daily 
10 a.m.–8 p.m., summer; 10 a.m.–6 p.m., winter. Stores closed
Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, and Easter.
 Jardine’s Texas Foods, Jardine Ranch, Buda (% 512-295-4600;
www.jardinefoods.com): From I-35, Exit 221, take loop 4 to Buda,
and then go 11⁄4 miles and turn right at the sign. Although selling its
products to many high-priced gourmet food dealers, Jardine’s has
the best, cheapest, and freshest food available. You can buy every-
thing from its unique Texas Champagne Cayenne Pepper Sauce to
Chapter 17: Texas Hill Country: Bluebonnets and Barbecue 231
Ways to use leftover barbecue
Never let those leftovers go to waste! Try one of the following four ways to create new
meals the second time around:
 Gently reheat the meat in the sauce for sandwiches or a main dish — it doesn’t
get easier than this.
 Sauté chopped bits of the brisket with chopped cooked potatoes and raw onions
into a smoky Texas version of corned beef hash.
 Reheat and slice leftover hot links to impale with a toothpick for cocktail snacks.
 Thinly slice beef brisket, adding minced hot peppers and shredded lettuce and a
dressing to serve as a Texas-Thai beef salad.

peach salsa and gift boxes of goodies for chili-heads. Open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Closed on weekends.
 Mi Tierra Café y Panaderia, in El Mercado (see listing earlier in this
list; % 210-225-1262; www.mitierracafe.com): On a first-come,
first-served basis, this cafe and bakery seats local families on holi-
days, paging, “Rodriguez, party of 20; Martinez, party of 14.” Wend
your way past the bakery and settle into one of the tables by the
mural-filled wall. If you’re lucky, on the menu will be the world’s best
carne machaca, beef braised in broth until the liquid evaporates and
the meat browns, then cooled and shredded and recooked in oil or
lard with garlic, onions, and chilies, and served for breakfast with
eggs, refried beans, tortillas, and salsa. In the pastry shop, you can
buy crisp hot churros (grooved sticks of fried pastry), bunuelos (thin
fried pastries sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar), and ricardos (a
custard-filled pastry sprinkled with pecans and named for the chef
who invented it). Open 24 hours a day year-round.
 New Braunfels Smokehouse, corner of SR 46 and I-35, Exit 189, New
Braunfels (% 830-625-2416; www.nbsmokehouse.com): Since 1946,
this friendly German restaurant and smokehouse has served sand-
wiches of smoked ham or turkey, beef barbecue, bratwurst, pas-
trami, and every imaginable combination, as well as chicken and
dumplings, a huge smoked sausage platter, ribs and brisket, and
breakfast tacos with smoked ham or sausage. Open daily from 
7:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.
 Po-Po Family Restaurant, 435 NE I-10 Access Rd., Boerne (% 830-
537-4194; www.poporestaurant.com): In the colorful little town of
Boerne (pronounced burn-ee), this rustic rock roadhouse with the
neon EATS sign out front has been around since 1929, as a dance hall,
skating rink, machine shop, and chicken hatchery. Today, it’s a
locally popular restaurant known for fried catfish, fried frog legs,
fried shrimp, and mesquite-smoked ribs — fried chicken is the
favorite, using Ma Burgon’s Original Recipe. Open daily from 11 a.m.
to 9 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Fri and Sat).
 Royer’s Round Top Café, on the square in Round Top (% 979-249-
3611; www.royersroundtopcafe.com): Deceptively down home
with a chic urban clientele, Royer’s specializes in grilled quail,
pasta, fresh fish, and homemade desserts. You can also buy a big
jar of vinegar-marinated peppers to take out that lasts forever; you
just keep adding new vinegar when the stock gets low. Use it as a
sauce on its own or to perk up salad dressings. Open Thursday
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday from 11 a.m.
to 7 p.m. Closed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
 Threadgill’s, 6416 N. Lamar, Austin (% 512-451-5440; www.
threadgills.com): Since 1933, Threadgill’s has fueled the folks in
Austin — first as a service station and then as a restaurant tucked
into the existing service-station facade. Two things put Threadgill’s
on the map: Janis Joplin sang here when she was starting her
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
232

career, and they make the best chicken-fried steak in the world.
Open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Wimberley Pie Company, SR 12, Wimberley (% 512-847-9462;
www.wimberleypie.com): Wimberley’s sells homemade pies whole
or by the slice, in such delicious flavors as buttermilk (try it, you’ll
love it!), coconut custard, pecan, lemon chess, Key lime, peanut
butter, and all the more familiar fruits and custards, as well as killer
cheesecakes. Open Wednesday and Thursday noon to 5:30 p.m.,
Friday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday
noon to 4 p.m. Closed Monday and Tuesday.

et down and get real — the Buckeye state is the heart of America.
“Why, oh why, oh why, oh why did I ever leave Ohio?” sang the
unhappy-in–New York heroine of the Broadway musical Wonderful Town,
written by Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden, and Adolph Green. The
roads of Ohio are lined with history (eight presidents lived here) and
strewn with calories (Skyline chili parlors in Cincinnati and homemade
pies from just about everywhere). And can you think of any place cooler
than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, designed
by world-class architect I. M. Pei?
A fascinating blend of the urban, industrial, and rural, Ohio gave birth to
the Wright brothers, Thomas Edison, astronauts Neil Armstrong and
John Glenn, and the rubber tire industry, but on the quiet back roads
around Millersburg, the world’s largest Amish community still tends
huge family farms without using electricity or the internal combustion
engine. Native Americans left their marks on the land in the form of
mounds; the most famous is shaped like a serpent, and some diligent
Swiss kitsch fans built the world’s largest cuckoo clock at Alpine Alpa in
Wilmot.
Getting There
Our circle drive around the heart of Ohio begins in Dayton, swings east
to Springfield along I-70, and then south to Yellow Springs and Xenia on
U.S. 68. (See “The Heart of Ohio” map in this chapter.) From Xenia, we
take U.S. 42 through Waynesville and Lebanon south to Cincinnati. We
follow the broad Ohio River along winding, scenic U.S. 52 to Aberdeen,

Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 235

and then detour north on scenic SR 41 and SR 73 to see the Serpent
Mound. Afterward, SR 73 takes us south again to Portsmouth on the river.
From Portsmouth, travel east on U.S. 52 to SR 93 and turn north to
Jackson, where we make a short detour east into the scenic Hocking Hills
via SR 93 to SR 56, and then return on 56 driving northwest to Circleville.
From there, we take U.S. 23 north to Columbus, the state capital.
From Columbus, we drive east on I-70 to Zanesville and Norwich along
parts of the old National Road, and then return to go north on SR 79 near
Hebron to Newark. Then we go east on SR 16 to SR 60 and south 3 miles
to Dresden, home of the world’s largest basket factory, and then return to
SR 16 turning east to Coshocton. From there, we drive north on SR 83 
to Millersburg and the beginning of the Amish country. Take U.S. 62
east, detouring south on SR 557 to Charm, and then return to U.S. 62 and
continue through Berlin to Winesburg and Wilmot; turn southeast on
U.S. 250 for 3 miles to SR 212 and follow it eastward to Zoar.
From Zoar, you can take I-77, the fast route north to Cleveland, pausing if
you’d like to at intervals of interest around Canton and Akron. The dis-
tance is approximately 725 miles.
Planning Ahead
Summer months are the prime season in Ohio, but that’s also when
Midwestern families take their camping and vacation trips, so you may
consider visiting in late spring or early fall. We last drove this route in
May, when rain threatens some days but temperatures are mild. Late
September and early October are practically perfect but can be
crowded in the Amish country because the harvest season is the most
popular time to visit; April through June is less crowded there. Freak
weather conditions called “the lake effect” can hit in winter, especially
snow and ice storms along Lake Erie. We once spent a week in January in
Cleveland during a blizzard and do not recommend it.
Be cautious about Midwestern weather. In spring’s tornado season,
local TV stations usually run a tornado alert information strip along the
bottom of the screen by county name, so always find out the name of the
county where you’re camping and the names of those nearby or where
you’re headed next. While you’re in the campground, if an alarm sounds,
leave your RV and make your way to the designated shelter, which is
often a recreation hall or even a storm cellar where you need to remain
until the alert is over. You may also run into heavy driving rain so power-
ful that you must pull over to the side of the road at the first opportunity
and wait for it to subside.
Campground reservations shouldn’t be necessary in most of the RV
parks recommended in this chapter, but you need to reserve ahead for
big holiday weekends, such as Memorial Day, Independence Day, and
Labor Day.
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
236

Pack a variety of clothing weights and options because weather can
change suddenly. Out in the country in hot weather, anything clean and
decent is acceptable, such as lightweight cotton shorts, shirts, and 
T-shirts, but always have a sweater or jacket handy if it cools off. Take an
umbrella and moderate rain gear. If you want to walk around a large town
or city, go into a nice restaurant, or attend a church service, pack long
pants for men and dressy cotton slacks, a skirt, or a dress for women.
Allow a week to ten days for this leisurely drive around the back roads
of Ohio, more if you’re a dedicated antiques shopper or museum-goer.
Stocking the Pantry
Ohio is chockablock with cafes, grocery stores, farm markets, and chain
supermarkets, such as Kroger, so you’ll have no problem stocking edi-
bles. The Amish country is a great place to pick up locally made cheeses,
especially Baby Swiss from Guggisberg Cheese Company in the hamlet
of Charm (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
In season, you see farmers’ markets in many towns, roadside produce
stands, even small-town growers selling tomatoes and corn in their front
yards with a help-yourself table, honor system cash box, and hand-
lettered sign.
Driving the Ohio Heartland
On back roads, drive slowly and exercise caution because you may
round a turn and run up behind a large, slow-moving tractor, a horse-
drawn Amish carriage, or even a herd of cattle crossing the road and
heading for the barn. Country roads in the Midwest also are famous for
making sudden right or left turns at a property boundary where a farmer
didn’t want his land bisected for the sake of a straight road.
The drive begins in Dayton, home to the Wright stuff — the Dayton
Aviation Heritage National Historic Park with four locations commemo-
rating the Wright brothers and their part in the history of flight: the
Wright Cycle Company Shop, the Dunbar House State Memorial, the
Carillon Historical Park (where the 1905 Wright Flyer III is on display),
and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field, home of the first permanent
flying school (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). The
Wright Brothers Memorial is on the edge of town on a hill overlooking
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which also is the location for the
United States Air Force Museum, the largest museum of its kind in the
world, displaying more than 300 airplanes in its gigantic hangars (see
“Must-see attractions”).
From the U.S. Air Force Museum, drive northeast on SR 4 to I-70, then
east a few miles to Exit 52, and turn south on U.S. 68 to Yellow Springs
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 237

and Xenia. The pretty town of Yellow Springs, home of Antioch College
and Young’s Jersey Dairy (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter), is at
the junction of U.S. 68 and SR 343. Hikers find good trails in the nearby
John Bryan State Park and the Glen Helen Nature Preserve.
From Xenia, U.S. 42 continues south to Waynesville and Lebanon,
10 miles apart but almost always spoken of in tandem as the antiques
capitals of Ohio, with some 250 shops between them (see “Shopping
along the Way,” later in this chapter); stop at the renowned Golden
Lamb Inn for a lunch break (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Waynesville, at the junction of U.S. 42 and SR 73, also is home to the
Ohio Sauerkraut Festival every October, where you can sample sauer-
kraut candy and sauerkraut pizza, among other offbeat offerings (see
“Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Cincinnati is 34 miles down U.S. 42. Mark Twain used to say he wanted
to be in Cincinnati when the world ended because it was always 20 years
behind the times, but today, the city that was called Porkopolis (because
it led the pork-packing industry in volume) has laid on the charm with a
refurbished riverfront. The splendid Museum Center at Union Terminal
would make Twain change his tune (see “Must-see attractions,” later in
this chapter). The city’s unique Cincinnati chili, sold at numerous
Skyline Chili franchises, is an acquired taste (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
From Cincinnati, head south on U.S. 52 for a scenic drive along the Ohio
River as far as Aberdeen (60 miles), then turn northeast on SR 41 to
Locust Grove, and then northwest on SR 73 to the Serpent Mound State
Memorial, one of America’s most distinctive archaeological features
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Return to the river road by following SR 73 southeast to where it joins 
SR 104, and then continue south 8 miles into Portsmouth. This colorful
town is where the late cowboy star Roy Rogers was born Leonard Slye 
in 1911. The walls along the town’s riverfront are covered with the
Portsmouth Floodwall Murals depicting each era of the city’s history
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
From Portsmouth, continue east on U.S. 52 along the Ohio River to SR 93
and follow that north to Jackson. Then turn north on SR 93 and west on
SR 56 into the Hocking Hills. Numerous campgrounds, caves, waterfalls,
and hiking areas color this rugged, scenic section of Ohio, particularly
around the area known as Old Man’s Cave off SR 56 (look for signs),
named for Richard Rowe, who lived in and is buried in the cave.
From Hocking Hills State Park, return to SR 56 and continue west to
Circleville, where a small museum is dedicated to jazz and pop singer
Ted Lewis (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
238

From Circleville, continue north on U.S. 23 to Columbus, Ohio’s capital
and a city that has several quirky attractions, including James Thurber
House, birthplace of the humorist; the Topiary Garden, which replicates
the figures from Georges Seurat’s classic painting A Sunday Afternoon on
the Island of La Grand Jatte in clipped boxwood topiary; and a German
village with an October beer festival and good German restaurants. (See
“More cool things to see and do” for the house and garden and “Good
eats” for the village.)
From Columbus, drive 56 miles east on I-70 to Zanesville, where the
delightful National Road Museum and Zane Grey Museum are 10 miles
east at Exit 164 at the same location. U.S. 40, which parallels I-70 at this
point, was the first attempt at building a national road when people still
traveled by horseback and oxcart. Detailed dioramas depicting the road
at different stages of travel history fill the museum (see “Must-see attrac-
tions,” later in this chapter).
Retrace your steps through Zanesville on U.S. 40 or I-70, Exit 129, and
turn north on SR 79 to a 25-mile strip of highway, SR 16, between Newark
and Dresden, home of the Longaberger Basket Factory, which offers a
fascinating tour but no factory outlet shopping (except for one style of
basket). The most interesting part of this empire is the Newark-based
company headquarters, a seven-story, basket-shaped building — the
world’s largest basket (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
From Dresden, continue north 3 miles on SR 60 to its junction with SR 16,
and then turn northeast on 16 to Coshocton and historic Roscoe Village,
a restored canal town where crafts shops turn out beautiful handmade
pottery, furniture, baskets, and weavings — and everything is for sale
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
SR 83 leads north from Coshocton to the Holmes County Amish country
around Millersburg. If you have time, set aside a day or two to explore
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). In nearby Mount Hope
and Kidron, the worthwhile stops include Lehman’s Hardware with a
full range of nonelectrical appliances from hand-cranked wringer wash-
ing machines to wood-burning stoves (see “More cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter).
From Millersburg, if time permits, take a detour down SR 557 to Charm,
a town as delightful as its name. Just past Millersburg on 557, you find
Guggisberg Cheese Company, selling 40 different types of cheese includ-
ing its own famous Baby Swiss (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
From the Millersburg area, drive east on U.S. 62 to Berlin (pronounced
burr-lin) and Walnut Creek. North of Walnut Creek on SR 515 at U.S. 62 is
the town of Winesburg, which gave its name to a book of short stories
by native son Sherwood Anderson. The real model for Winesburg, how-
ever, was probably Clyde, 20 miles southwest of Sandusky, where
Anderson grew up.
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 239

Wilmot, 5 miles northeast of Winesburg on U.S. 62, boasts that it’s home
to the world’s largest cuckoo clock at a restaurant/tourist attraction
called Alpine Alpa (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this
chapter).
From Wilmot, drive east on U.S. 250 to Strasberg, home of The Basket
Factory Outlet (see “Shopping along the Way,” later in this chapter),
then cut across SR 21 to SR 212, and drive to Zoar.
Zoar, a communal town founded in 1817 by a group of German sepa-
ratists, is now the Zoar State Memorial (see “Must-see attractions,” later
in this chapter), one of our favorite places in Ohio — perhaps because
we visited it early on a Monday morning when nobody was around. On
Mondays and Tuesdays, the historic buildings are closed to the public;
costumed interpreters occupy them the rest of the week. Frankly, we
enjoyed the peace and quiet and having the whole town to ourselves,
but you may want to stop by when the buildings are open.
Leave Zoar by driving west on SR 212, following the signs to I-77, which
you take north through Canton and Akron to Cleveland. In Canton, the
McKinley Museum, next door to the tomb of this third American presi-
dent to be assassinated, has animated figures of the president and his
wife, who “chat” with visitors about life in Canton and the White House
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
North Canton is the home of the Hoover Historical Center, not another
presidential home but rather the home of William Henry Hoover, founder
of the vacuum cleaner company of the same name (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
And the Harry London Chocolate Factory also is in North Canton, just
off I-77’s Exit 113, with free factory tours (by reservation) and great
prices on fresh-from-the-factory chocolates (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
From here, continue north on I-77 to its junction with I-90 on the
Cleveland lakefront, home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). The drive
ends in Cleveland.
Must-see attractions
Amish Country
Centered around Millersburg
Ohio’s Amish country offers enough attractions to fill a week of sightsee-
ing. Pick up one of the free Amish country maps (found in most shops and
restaurants) that carry ads for shops, restaurants, and sightseeing. For the
best part of the journey, however, strike out along the back roads to
glimpse farm families at work — men plowing the fields, women hanging
out washing, and children on the way to school.
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
240

SR 77 between Berlin and Mount Hope is a colorful back road lined with big farms
and horse-drawn Amish buggies going to and from town.
Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park
Dayton
This four-part museum complex spread around the city salutes the Wright
brothers and their contemporary and friend, African American poet Paul
Laurence Dunbar. From 1895 to 1897, the brothers operated the Wright
Cycle Company shop, which has been restored and furnished with period
bicycles and machinery. The Dunbar House State Memorial is the home
poet Dunbar bought for his mother when his work was published suc-
cessfully. Exhibits include a bicycle that the Wright brothers gave him.
Carillon Historical Park houses the Wright Flyer III, the first craft capable
of controlled flight. The Huffman Prairie Flying Field was where the Wright
brothers tested their planes and home to the first permanent flying school.
The Wright Brothers Memorial is in northeastern Dayton on SR 444 over-
looking Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Allow one hour for each of the museums, 15 minutes for the memorial.

Longaberger Basket Factory
Dresden
This factory tour of the world’s largest basket-making plant is extremely
well-organized but without the free sample or discount prices of a factory
store at the end. Only one basket, the $30 “tour model,” can be bought at
the plant. Otherwise, you must purchase these finely handcrafted baskets
through home party sales. The huge plant covers 61⁄2 acres but has no
assembly line. Instead, the 2,200 basket weavers turn out their own bas-
kets from start to finish and then sign each of them on the bottom. East of
the plant, also on SR 16, is the Longaberger Homestead, a collection of
replicas of period homes and workshops, with shops and restaurants
occupying various “rooms.” In Newark, also on SR 16, the company head-
quarters is a seven-story building shaped like a giant basket. Allow one
hour for plant tour plus a half-hour for video and museum.

Museum Center at Union Terminal
Cincinnati
In a magnificently restored 1933 Art Deco railway station, the city has built
three excellent museums, the Cincinnati History Museum, the Museum
of Natural History, and the hands-on Children’s Museum. You can walk
through the Ice Age, explore a limestone cavern inhabited by live bats, and
step onto a vintage steamboat from the Cincinnati landing. Because sight-
seeing can make you hungry, you also find a food court that includes a
Skyline Chili branch. Allow three to four hours.

National Road Museum/Zane Grey Museum
Zanesville
Three for the price of one, this museum contains the road museum, a
salute to native son Zane Grey, and a display of art glass made in the area.
Road warriors love the dioramas depicting the various stages of the
National Road from 1811 to the present day. You can follow the progress
of travelers from early inns to early campers with tents and tin lizzies, and
then a panorama with a trolley, a biplane, and Model Ts. Conestoga wagons
are displayed with toll-road signs and other vintage vehicles. Another
room houses a full-size replica of the studio used by Zanesville-born
Western writer Zane Grey. Allow two hours.

Portsmouth Floodwall Murals
Portsmouth
The pretty little river town of Portsmouth is where cowboy star Roy
Rogers was born and cruise boats sailing the Ohio River frequently call.
The waterfront is lined with huge murals depicting an awesome panorama
of town history from the prehistoric days to the present. Yes, Roy Rogers
and his horse Trigger are in one of the murals, but our favorite is an
evening depiction of the town during the days of World War II, with a movie
house, vintage cars, and soldiers in uniform. Some evocative shops in the
Boneyfiddle Historic District also are appealing. Allow one hour.
The murals line Front Street in downtown Portsmouth. % 740-353-1116. (Portsmouth

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum
Cleveland
Cleveland’s great rock museum, designed by I. M. Pei with a glass pyramid
reminiscent of the same architect’s entrance to the Louvre in Paris, is a
great place to spend a day. Some of the most important exhibits are under-
ground in the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, a large, darkish area hous-
ing all sorts of displays and interactive exhibits, such as “One Hit
Wonders” saluting now-forgotten artists who had one big hit and then van-
ished from view. On life-size mannequins are John Lennon’s collarless
Beatles jacket, Alice Cooper’s bondage outfit, David Bowie’s exaggerated
1970s fashions, Michael Jackson’s sequined glove, Leadbelly’s 12-string
guitar, Jim Morrison’s Cub Scout uniform — you get the idea.
Original rock ’n’ rollers are happy to discover that the museum has a dis-
counted senior rate because many of them are eligible for membership in
AARP.
Allow a half-day to a full day.
To get to the museum, follow the signage from I-90. % 888-764-ROCK (888-764-7625).
www.rockhall.com. RV parking: This is a big problem because the parking garage
at the museum has a height limit that prohibits most RVs; point your RV to the right
toward Burke Lakefront Municipal Airport, and when you reach the intersection
facing the museum, look for a spot in the airport parking lot, a block from the museum.
Admission: $20 adults, $14 seniors, $11 ages 9–11, free 8 and younger. Open: Daily 
10 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Wed 10 a.m.–9 p.m.
Roscoe Village
Coshocton
An 1850s restored living-history village along the Ohio and Erie Canal,
Roscoe Village is a sort of miniature Colonial Williamsburg. Craftsmen
demonstrate weaving, pottery making, and broom making in the shops
along the main street, while a horse-drawn canal boat takes visitors
through a restored section of the historic canal. Seasonal celebrations are
scheduled frequently from May’s Dulcimer Days to October’s Apple Butter
Stirrin’ Festival. Allow three to four hours.

Serpent Mound State Memorial
Peebles
Striking and unforgettable in photographs from magazines such as
National Geographic, in person the sinuous, grass-covered Serpent Mound
is a bit of a bust. Unless you’re in a low-flying aircraft, you don’t get the
gorgeous perspective depicted in most photographs. You can climb to the
top of the visitor viewing tower, but you still don’t get a full overview. The
Adena people constructed the 1,348-foot-long earthwork sometime
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 243

between 800 B.C. and A.D. 44. A pathway enables you to explore the perime-
ter of the mound, and an excellent museum discusses theories of how and
why the mound was built. Our favorite theory was put forth by the
Reverend Loudon West of Pleasant Hill, Ohio, who said that God built it to
identify Adams County as the Garden of Eden. Allow one hour.

United States Air Force Museum
Dayton
Wear comfortable shoes if you plan to see all of this museum — it’s the
world’s largest of its kind, filling 10 acres and displaying more than 300 air-
craft inside and outside. From balloons to the B-1 bomber, from the plane
that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945 to the plane that took
President Kennedy’s body from Dallas to Washington, D.C., in 1963, air his-
tory is here. The museum also has an IMAX theater that offers two films
alternating hourly. Allow three hours.

Zoar State Memorial
Zoar
In 1817, German separatists from the Kingdom of Wurttermburg founded
this communal town of Zoar. Named for Lot’s biblical town of refuge, Zoar
flourished as one of America’s most successful Christian communal soci-
eties until the society disbanded in 1898. Men and women had voting
power on the town board, and they produced their own food and operated
blast furnaces, a blacksmith shop, a tin shop, a garden and greenhouse,
and a wagon shop. They sold what they didn’t need and had a million dol-
lars in assets by 1852. Today, except on Mondays and Tuesdays and from
November through March, many of the town’s buildings are staffed with
costumed interpreters, and visitors are free to walk around the exteriors
of all the public buildings at any time.
Zoar is off I-77, Exit 93, accessible by SR 212. % 330-874-3211. http://ohsweb.

More cool things to see and do
Ohio’s roadside attractions run the gamut from the world’s largest cuckoo
clock to the birthplace of humorist James Thurber. You can have fun
and/or get informed at several spots along the way.
 Spot the real big bird. Put a quarter in the turnstile and climb the
wooden stairs to the rooftop of Grandma’s Alpine Homestead Swiss
Village, 1504 U.S. 62, Wilmot (% 330-359-5454; www.grandmas
homestead.com), to see the world’s largest cuckoo clock. How big 
is it? It’s 23 feet, 6 inches by 24 feet by 13 feet, 6 inches. When the
clock strikes, a wooden band plays and wooden dancers with braids
twirl around. Near the clock is a gnome garden with Snow White, 
her seven dwarfs, and many other small painted plaster people.
Downstairs are a restaurant, a cheese factory, a deli with German
food products, and a gift shop selling souvenirs, such as cuckoo
clocks and musical beer steins. Allow one hour.
RV parking is available in a large lot. Admission to the clock costs $1.
It’s open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. The clock is closed November
15 to April 15 and major holidays.
 Sprechen-sie Ohioan? The German village in Columbus is one of
Ohio’s best-loved destinations. Saved from demolition in the 1950s,
the 19th-century neighborhood is home to microbreweries, restau-
rants, antiques shops, and art galleries, and its brick streets are
inviting to stroll. Stay as long as you like.
The Visitors Information Center is at 588 S. Third St. (% 614-221-
8888; www.germanvillage.org). RV parking is available on the
street.
 Clean up your act. Contrary to what you may think, Hoover
Historical Center, 2225 Easton St. NW, North Canton (% 330-499-
0287; www.walsh.edu/tour/hoover_historical.html), is not
about a president but rather is about the founder of the famous
vacuum cleaner company. When invented, the vacuum was consid-
ered a miracle because “it beats as it sweeps as it cleans.” “To
Hoover” came to mean both the cleaner and the cleaning action in
many parts of the English-speaking world. This museum contains
seven decades of cleaning history (including an early “portable”
that weighed 100 pounds) plus a gift shop. Allow one hour.
RV parking is available in a small lot or on the street. Admission is
free. It’s open Wednesday through Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m. Tours
run at 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., and 4 p.m. Closed major holidays.
 Grind your own grist. Lehman’s Hardware (www.lehmans.com), a
tradition in Ohio’s Amish country, is a treasure trove of nonelectri-
cal appliances from hand-cranked wringer washing machines to
wood-burning cookstoves, all brand new. Butter churns, stone
crockery, hand-cranked gristmills (to make coarse meal out of
dried corn), carpenter’s adzes, solid oak furniture, handmade
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 245

quilts, washboards, and apple peelers are only a small part of the
collection. Allow one hour or more.
The store has two locations near each other: SR 77 in Mount Hope
(% 330-674-7474) and 1 Lehman Circle in Kidron (% 330-857-
5757). RV parking is available in lots large enough for Amish horse-
and-buggies. Admission is free. It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Kidron store is open until 8 p.m. on
Thursday, and the Mount Hope store is open until 8 p.m. Friday 
and until 5 p.m. Saturday.
 Chat with dead presidents. The McKinley Museum and National
Memorial, 800 McKinley Monument Dr. NW, Canton (% 330-455-
7043; www.mckinleymuseum.org), honors the 25th president, 
who was assassinated in 1901. The animated figures of McKinley
and his wife occupy the museum and talk about their life in the
White House. The memorial is reached by a flight of 108 terraced
stairs that fitness buffs often climb on the run. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $7 adults,
$6 seniors, $5 ages 3 to 18. It’s open Monday through Saturday from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
 Meet woolly mammoths. Ohio Village, 1982 Velma Ave. (at I-71 and
17th Avenue), Columbus (% 800-653-6446 or 614-297-2300; www.
ohiohistory.org/places/ohvillag), re-creates an Ohio town in
the 1860s with costumed interpreters and craftsmen, keeping kids
and adults interested in the past. In the Historical Center, you can
meet woolly mammoths and hear some hair-raising ghost stories.
Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot for a $4 fee. Admission is
$7 adults, $6 seniors, $3 ages 6 to 12. It’s open Tuesday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
 Is everybody happy? That was the signature phrase for Jazz Age
entertainer Ted Lewis from Circleville, who is remembered in his
hometown with a pleasant little museum showcasing his battered
top hat and clarinet, along with the sheet music for his hits “Me and
My Shadow” and “When My Baby Smiles at Me.” Allow one hour.
The museum is located at 133 W. Main St. (% 740-477-3630 or
740-474-3231). RV parking is available on the street. Admission is
free. It’s open Friday through Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m., other times
by appointment.
 Chuckle with a humorist. A unicorn stands in the garden across
from the James Thurber House, 77 Jefferson Ave., Columbus 
(% 614-464-1032; www.thurberhouse.org), birthplace of the
eccentric and beloved humorist whose short stories and drawings
graced the pages of The New Yorker for so many years. James
Thurber was famous for drawing unicorns, clocks, bossy wives, and
mournful dogs, and the house in Columbus is where “the ghost got
in” in one of his famous stories. A fine bookstore is on-site, and you
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
246

also find literary events, ranging from readings by distinguished
authors to literary picnics to a Birthday Gala for Thurber every
December. Allow a half-hour to an hour.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free; tours are
$2.50 per adult, $2 for students and seniors. It’s open daily from 
1 to 4 p.m., and for author appearances. Call ahead.
 Step into a painting. Sundays in the park with George come alive 
in Columbus’s Topiary Garden (% 614-645-0197; www.topiary
garden.org), a replica in pruned shrubbery of Georges Seurat’s
painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grand Jatte (which
inspired the Stephen Sondheim musical Sundays in the Park with
George), which has 50 topiary people, 8 boats, 3 dogs, a monkey,
and a real pond to represent the Seine.
The garden is in the Old Deaf School Park, at the corner of East
Town Street and Washington Avenue, in downtown Columbus.
Admission is free, and it’s always open.
Weekend wonders
You can’t cover Ohio in one weekend, so concentrate on the section that
interests you most. For crafts collectors and folks with hearty appetites,
the Amish country fills the bill nicely. Start and end your trip in Columbus,
driving north to Millersburg and Berlin and overnighting in that area.
Scenery, hiking, and camping fans need to drive along the Ohio River
from Cincinnati and then go up into the Hocking Hills, where camp-
grounds abound.
One of our favorite weekend combinations for Ohio sightseeing — that
pleases the whole family — is to start in Dayton, seeing all the airplane
history, then driving south through the antiques capitals of Waynesville
and Lebanon for a little shopping, pausing for a meal at the famous old
Golden Lamb Inn, and then driving into Cincinnati for the trio of great
museums at the Museum Center at Union Terminal.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Ohio has plenty of campgrounds, both private and public, but you need
to make reservations for long holiday weekends and during the peak
summer season. Having a reservation for a seasonal festival also is a
good idea because Buckeyes enjoy RV camping in conjunction with spe-
cial events.
On the food side, you find many cafes, including supper clubs, where
you can have a late meal. Restaurant meals are generous in the Midwest,
so if you stop to pick up a meal to go and don’t want leftovers, you often
can buy one to share with one another (in your motorhome, of course,
not in the restaurant).
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 247

All campgrounds listed in this section are open year-round and have
public flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless desig-
nated otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations
only. See Chapter 9 for more information on how we choose our favorite
campgrounds.

Good eats
Travelers in the Buckeye State can eat around the clock, choosing from
snacks, really solid meals with enormous servings, and sweets for
between meals or afterward.
Meals of chili, sauerkraut, and Amish cooking
Prices are modest, portions are large, and cooking is hearty in many of
our recommended typically Ohioan restaurants, unpretentious eateries
that win the balloting in Ohio magazine polls under headings such as
“best restaurant values” and “favorite neighborhood restaurants.”
 Camp Washington Chili, corner of Hopple and Colerain, Exit 3 off 
I-75, Cincinnati (% 513-541-0061; www.campwashingtonchili.
com): This restaurant is probably the most colorful purveyor of
Cincinnati’s famous chili, an acquired taste to any chili-head who
has come to love Southwestern chili. Greek Americans created the
Cincinnati version — a mild, soupy chili seasoned with cinnamon
and allspice, poured over a plate of spaghetti, and sprinkled with
cheese. That’s “three-way” chili. Add some chopped onions and it’s
“four-way” chili; if you ladle beans over the top, it’s “five-way.” Don’t
say we didn’t warn you! Open Monday through Saturday 24 hours;
closed Sunday.
 Der Dutchman, 4967 Walnut St., Walnut Creek (% 330-893-2981;
www.dhgroup.com) and five other Ohio locations: Der Dutchman 
is an Amish eatery with its own bakery and family-style dinners.
Broasted chicken, roast beef, country cured ham, Swiss steak,
plenty of mashed potatoes and noodles, a salad bar, and “pies
made from scratch” highlight the offerings. Open Monday through
Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Golden Lamb Inn, 27 S. Broadway, Lebanon (% 513-932-5065;
www.goldenlamb.com): This venerable inn usually wins the vote as
Ohio’s favorite restaurant in Ohio magazine. Since 1803, the Golden
Lamb has hosted Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, and ten American
presidents, plus assorted ghosts. While Dickens complained loudly
about the inn not serving spirits, you can order a bottle of wine
today to enjoy with the meltingly tender lamb shanks, fried
chicken, and fruit cobblers at lunch or dinner. Open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
and 5 to 9 p.m., and Sunday noon to 8 p.m.
 Mrs. Yoder’s Kitchen, SR 241, Mount Hope (% 330-674-0922): 
At this Amish restaurant, family-style dinners are priced by the
number of main dishes you order; up to three are permitted. “All
you can eat here” is emphasized on the menu; carry-out from the
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
250

family-style meal is not permitted. Instead, if you want takeout,
order from the regular menu, which is structured around one main
dish, two side dishes, and bread, all under $9. Look for special local
dishes, such as wedding steak (ground beef with mushroom sauce),
cracker pudding (a dessert based on crackers), and date-nut cake
with caramel sauce. Open Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to
8 p.m.
 Ohio Sauerkraut Festival, Old Main Street, Waynesville (% 513-
897-8855; www.sauerkrautfestival.com): Held the second week-
end in October, the festival draws more than 200,000 visitors with
its live music, crafts sales, and, most of all, traditional pork-and-
sauerkraut dinners, cabbage rolls, hot dogs with sauerkraut, sauer-
kraut candies, and sauerkraut pizza.
 Schmidt’s Restaurant and Sausage Haus, 240 Kossuth St.,
Columbus (% 614-444-6808; www.schmidthaus.com): At this
restaurant in the colorful German village section of town, look for
bratwurst, wiener schnitzel, pork and sauerkraut, red cabbage,
German potato salad, and the house special dessert, a jumbo
cream puff. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Skyline Chili (www.skylinechili.com): This big local chain has
some 149 locations around Cincinnati, including one in the food
court in the Museum Center at Union Terminal. Skyline often wins
the title for the best version of the local chili, seasoned with cinna-
mon and allspice. Oyster crackers are served on the side, and
Buckeyes enjoy it with a glass of buttermilk. (See Camp Washington
Chili, earlier in this section, for a complete description of the dish.)
Open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Snacks of chocolate, cheese, and ice cream
Ohio has its priorities straight: Along our drive are several havens for
lovers of chocolate and dairy treats.
 Coblentz Chocolate Company, 4917 SR 515 at SR 39 in Walnut Creek
(% 800-338-9341 or 330-893-2995; www.coblentzchocolates.com):
In a charming Victorian house in the heart of Amish country,
Coblentz displays its homemade candies in wood-and-glass cases.
Open in summer Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Guggisberg Cheese Company, SR 557, Charm (% 330-893-2500;
www.babyswiss.com): You can’t miss this place in the tiny town of
Charm. Just look for the big Swiss chalet with stainless-steel towers
and a cuckoo-clock tower. Sample the cheeses, and buy a whole
Baby Swiss to go, along with other picnic-makings from the deli.
Open Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday from
11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Harry London Chocolate Factory, 5353 Lauby Rd. (right off I-77
Exit 113), North Canton (% 800-321-0444 or 330-494-0833; www.
londoncandies.com): The factory offers tours, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Chapter 18: The Heart of Ohio: A Circle around Circleville 251

($3 adults, $2 ages 3–18) and chocolate shopping at a flat per-pound
rate, even if you wander around the huge store and buy “one of
those and two of these.” Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
 Young’s Jersey Dairy, SR 68, 2 miles north of Yellow Springs in
Hustead (% 937-325-0629; www.youngsdairy.com): Young’s does
quadruple duty as a bakery, soda fountain, sandwich shop, and ice-
cream store. Extra-thick shakes include the calf shake with two
scoops of ice cream, a cow shake with four, or a bull shake with five
scoops. Really hungry visitors order the King Kong sundae for
dessert. Open daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Shopping along the Way
Ohio, home of the world’s largest Amish community, has potters, basket
makers, weavers, quilt makers, and artists of all sorts. Outside the
Amish area, craftsmen staff historic villages and sell goods at every spe-
cial event. (Refer to “Good eats,” earlier in this chapter, for more on the
Ohio Sauerkraut Festival.) Antiques also are a main attraction at many
events.
The Basket Factory Outlet, 11052 SR 21 NW, Strasburg (% 800-327-7016;
www.basketware.com/basketfactory), considerably smaller than you
may expect from its name, is jam-packed with baskets from all around the
world, hanging from the ceiling, triple-stacked on the floor, and crowding
the open shelves. Prices are very modest, especially for the Asian
imports. Open Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m.; closed
Sunday and Monday.
Ohio boasts two antiques centers. Lebanon, on U.S. 42 at the junction of
SR 63, about 33 miles north of Cincinnati, has much history — Charles
Dickens slept here — and is home to 70 antiques shops and boutiques in
its downtown area, along with Ohio’s oldest inn, the Golden Lamb Inn
(see “Good eats,” earlier in this chapter). Waynesville, at the junction 
of U.S. 42 and SR 73, about halfway between Dayton and Cincinnati, has
trademarked the title of Antiques Capital of the Midwest for its 35-plus
antiques shops, along with art galleries, specialty shops, and boutiques.

Northern Minnesota: 
Paul Bunyan Country
In This Chapter

 Perching in Paul Bunyan’s palm
 Hanging out at the Mall of America
S
ome unique American icons came out of Minnesota — entertainer
Judy Garland, folk/rock musician Bob Dylan, the Greyhound bus, the
Mississippi River, and the giant logger Paul Bunyan who was so big when
he was born that it took five storks to deliver him. According to legend,
his footprints and those of his companion, Babe the Blue Ox, filled with
water and became the state’s 10,000 lakes. We like Minnesota for its
down-to-earth qualities; picture small towns in winter on frozen lakes
populated by the characters in the film Grumpy Old Men with Jack
Lemmon and Walter Matthau, or the laconic voice of Garrison Keillor,
creator of the fictional town of Lake Wobegon. For less hardy individu-
als, however, Minnesota is best seen in spring, summer, and fall, when
the weather is mild and the lakes have all thawed. Fishing, canoeing,
hiking, biking, and — lest we forget — shopping in the biggest mall in the
United States, Bloomington’s Mall of America, complete the experience.
Getting There
We begin in Duluth at the southern end of Lake Superior and drive north
via U.S. 53 to the town of Virginia, the beginning of the great Mesabi Iron
Range. (See the map of “Northern Minnesota” in this chapter for the
route.) We then turn west on U.S. 169 to Grand Rapids, continue west on
U.S. 2 to Bemidji, and drive south to Mississippi Headwaters at Itasca
State Park by following U.S. 2 west to Shevlin and then turning south 
on SR 2 to Lake Itasca. From there, the route turns east through Paul
Bunyan National Forest to the junction with SR 64, which we follow
south to Akeley. From Akeley, we turn west again, following SR 34 some

56 miles to the junction of U.S. 10, then follow U.S. 10 west to Moorhead,
Minnesota, and just across the Red River to Fargo, North Dakota. The
distance is approximately 357 miles.
One optional detour visits the gigantic Mall of America in Bloomington,
a suburb south of Minneapolis, adding 157 miles each way from Duluth.
A second detour follows North Shore Drive (SR 61) along Lake Superior
from Duluth to the Canadian border; the return, alas, is along the same
route, but when you’re halfway back to Duluth, you can cut off on SR 1
south of Little Marais and head northwest to Ely. Then follow SR 1/U.S.
169 southwest to Virginia and join the longer drive. The North Shore
Drive covers 264 miles.
Planning Ahead
Spring and fall temperatures are mild and comfortable, and summer
temperatures, although humid because of all the surface water in this
state of 12,000 lakes, rarely rise above the 80s (°F). Fall foliage in the
North Woods, a nickname for northern Minnesota, attracts sightseers,
who also take advantage of pick-your-own apples in orchards where the
harvest coincides with the autumn leaves color season.
Northern Minnesota is never really swamped with visitors, so camp-
ground reservations are only needed for the most popular parks on 
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
256
Meeting Paul Bunyan
We fell in love with Minnesota at first because of the hilarious tales of St. Olaf that
actress Betty White told on TV’s Golden Girls. Other fans probably found the state
through Garrison Keillor’s thoughtful and amusing Lake Wobegon stories on National
Public Radio. We suspect that not too many travelers these days are drawn to
Minnesota because of something as old as the Paul Bunyan yarns.
For those who don’t know about Paul Bunyan (or the version that wasn’t on The
Simpsons, which was rather freely adapted), he was a giant logger with a blue ox
named Babe, remembered in statues rising all around north-central Minnesota. The
unlikely stories of his strength and endurance originated in the logging camps of the
North Woods. A public relations man named William Laughead, who worked for the
Red River Lumber Company, gave the tales a spin when he issued a series of illus-
trated booklets from 1914 to 1934 that glorified the Paul Bunyan myth. The folk hero
first got on the map in a big way in 1937 when the town of Bemidji erected one of the
first known statues of the logger and his ox.
Some of the tales about Paul say that he was born in Maine, where the rocking of his
cradle toppled 4 acres of timber. When he and Babe set out for the North Country, they
left a trail of lake-size footprints behind them.

holiday weekends. Even in peak summer season, RVers can find camp-
ground sites somewhere in the area.
When packing, consider layered clothing to cover weather extremes
from a hot, sticky summer on the lake to a sudden chill or early snowfall.
Also bring along heavy-duty hiking boots, serious rain gear, and a strong
sunblock. Fishing gear, boats, and white-water rafting outfits can usually
be rented on-site.
Allow a leisurely week for the drive. Add a day for the Mall of America,
perhaps more time if you want to linger there, and two days for the
North Shore Drive along Lake Superior.
Stocking the Pantry
When you find a good supermarket, stock up on basic supplies because
the North Woods doesn’t have an endless supply of goodies. In summer,
towns and cities have farmers’ markets with local growers bringing in
fresh-picked produce for sale; pick-your-own fruits and vegetables are
available in season as well. Minneapolis has a daily farmers’ market
every morning from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. between late April and late December;
take Exit 230 from I-94 and follow the signs for 3 blocks to the market. You
find not only seasonal produce grown in Minnesota but also fish, meat,
flowers, and baked goods.
Chapter 19: Northern Minnesota: Paul Bunyan Country 257
The North Shore Drive
SR 61 strikes out north from Duluth along the shore of Lake Superior, traveling 168
miles to Grand Portage at the Canadian border, where you can catch ferries in season
(May–Oct) to Isle Royale National Park. The drive is especially attractive in the early
autumn when the leaves begin changing colors. Some half-dozen state parks with
campgrounds are well spaced along the route.
Highlights along the way include Split Rock Lighthouse, the highest waterfall in
Minnesota in Tettegouche State Park near Little Marais; and Grand Portage National
Monument, a re-created fur trading post 5 miles south of the Canadian border.
About 30 miles north of Duluth, in the town of Two Harbors right on the highway is
Betty’s Pies, open only in summer but worth a stop. If it’s too crowded to sit down, get
a pie (or at least a couple of slices) to go (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Rather than take the entire route north and then double back to Duluth, you can turn
around at Grand Portage and continue south as far as Little Marais, where you can
turn inland and drive northwest on SR 1 to Ely, home of the International Wolf Center
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter), and then continue south-
west to pick up the longer drive in Virginia.

In Bemidji, Lueken’s Village Foods, 1171 Paul Bunyan Dr. NW (% 218-
444-3663), carries a good supply of foods, and the North Country
Farmers’ Market sets up in the Pamida store’s parking lot on Paul
Bunyan Drive on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
in season. The Virginia Farmers’ Market is open Tuesday and Friday
afternoons from July through early September in the Armory parking 
lot on 81⁄2 Street South.
If you’re a skillful fisherman, you may be able to hook enough finny
friends for at least one meal a day until you tire of seafood.
Driving the Paul Bunyan Trail
Although this route through the land of Paul Bunyan sets out from
Duluth and ends in Fargo, we allow enough slack for dedicated shoppers
to start their journey in Bloomington, a suburb of Minneapolis/St. Paul
that is home to the country’s largest shopping mall, Mall of America
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
We also suggest that sightseers with a couple of extra days begin the trip
by following the North Shore Drive (SR 61) along Lake Superior from
Duluth to the Canadian border (see “The North Shore Drive” sidebar in
this chapter).
Our basic route starts in Duluth, or more properly in the town of
Cloquet, the location of a comfortable campground (see “Runner-up
campgrounds,” later in this chapter). On the northeast end of Cloquet at
the junction of SRs 45 and 33, you find an unexpected landmark — the
only gas station that architect Frank Lloyd Wright ever designed. Today,
an undistinguished yellow and green structure with a hint of Googie
Moderne style, it’s still pumping gas. From here, follow SR 33 to U.S. 53
all the way to the Mesabi Iron Range near Virginia, Minnesota.
Minnesota’s great Mesabi Iron Range, which stretches across a vast
area of the state north of Virginia and Chisholm, attracted miners from
all around the world around the turn of the 20th century. Most of the
miners were Finnish, but they came from 43 different regions in Europe
and the United Kingdom, including the Balkans, Belgium, Cornwall,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Scandinavia, Slovenia, and Wales.
The Cornish brought along their hot meat-filled pies called pasties (pro-
nounced pass-teas), which you still find today in small cafes and bak-
eries around the region. Polkas, Polish sausages, accordion music, and a
rich nut pastry called potica (pronounced po-teet-sah) were some of the
other souvenirs the miners left behind, changing the cultural face of
Minnesota’s North Country.
Just south of Virginia in the little town of Eveleth, is the United States
Hockey Hall of Fame, commemorating the first U.S. game, which was
played in Eveleth back in 1903 (see “More cool things to see and do,”
later in this chapter).
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
258

Virginia also is the best jumping-off point for animal fans to venture
north to observe and photograph wild black bears and wolves in their
natural habitats. You find wolves at the International Wolf Center in
Ely, 52 miles northeast of Virginia on SR 169, and black bears at the
Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary in Orr, 46 miles northwest of Virginia on
U.S. 53 (see “More cool things to see and do”). If you want to visit them
both, an 11-mile shortcut on SR 1, a paved road, cuts off some miles
between Angora on U.S. 53 and Tower on SR 169.
From Virginia, follow U.S. 169 west to Chisholm, where the wonderful
Ironworld Discovery Center (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this
chapter) tells you everything that you ever wanted to know (and then
some) about iron mining and details the cultures of those miners who
flocked here from so many different places. Children also find a park,
special playground, and Pellet Pete’s miniature golf course. Make sure 
to notice the huge statue saluting iron ore miners, just across from the
Ironworld entrance.
The town of Hibbing, 6 miles south of Chisholm on U.S. 169, gave
America two symbols that may have led many to escape the ordinary
and run away from home. The Greyhound Bus Company originated here
in 1914 with a single bus, a Hupmobile that carried miners from Hibbing
to Alice. The Greyhound Bus Origin Center displays one of the early
vehicles along with many other historic Greyhounds. In 1941, singer Bob
Dylan was born in Hibbing as Robert Allen Zimmerman; you can drive
past his boyhood home. (See “More cool things to see and do,” later in
this chapter, for info on both sights.)
About 30 miles farther down the road in Grand Rapids, another even
more famous singer born in 1922 was christened Frances Ethel Milne
Gumm. She would one day be known as Judy Garland. Several small
museums here today remember Baby Gumm and her family with photo-
graphs and personal memories (see “Must-see attractions”).
From Grand Rapids, it’s a straight 54-mile shot on U.S. 2 through scenic
lake country — past Leech Lake, Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake — to
Bemidji. Keep your eyes open for wild-rice sellers because this area pro-
duces Minnesota’s hand-harvested real wild rice (as opposed to com-
mercially harvested paddy-grown wild rice). Eighteen-foot Paul Bunyan
and Babe statues decorate the shore of pretty Bemidji Lake near the
town’s visitor center.
Nearby Itasca State Park (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chap-
ter) contains the area generally accepted as the headwaters of the
Mississippi. Every self-important geographer and explorer who managed
to find his way to the general area thought he was the only one who had
found the correct headwaters and should have the local lakes named
after himself.
From Lake Itasca, the Paul Bunyan route swings east on SR 200, and then
just before the town of LaPorte, it turns south on SR 64 to Akeley, where
Chapter 19: Northern Minnesota: Paul Bunyan Country 259

we turn west on SR 34. In Akeley, right by the side of SR 34, is a gigantic
statue of Paul Bunyan, one arm lowered with hand open to allow
anyone to sit comfortably in his palm. The local museum, open only
between Memorial Day and Labor Day, is adjacent to the statue, but for-
tunately for fans of photo ops, the statue always is open.
Continue on SR 34 about 28 miles west to Osage. Just 11⁄2 miles west of
town is the Smoky Hills Arts Center, a group of artisans that usually
includes painters, potters, blacksmiths, glassblowers, and woodcarvers
with studios and shops in the Smoky Hills National Forest beside the
road and reached by a boardwalk. Open only Memorial Day through
Labor Day, the center charges a modest entrance fee.
The drive follows SR 34 into Detroit Lakes and then turns west on U.S. 10
to Moorhead, the westernmost town in this part of Minnesota, directly
across the Red River from Fargo, North Dakota.
Must-see attractions
The Depot
Duluth
This renovated 1892 railway station is nicknamed “the Ellis Island of
Minnesota” because of the numbers of immigrants who arrived here by
train at the turn of the 20th century. Today, the bustling depot has been
turned into a museum and entertainment complex with steam locomotives
and their wooden coaches filling the Lake Superior Railway Museum
framed by a life-size reproduction of downtown Duluth in 1910. You also
find galleries operated by the Duluth Art Institute, the St. Louis County
Historical Society, and the Duluth Children’s Museum. One low-price
ticket accesses the lot, and two museum stores sell collectibles and books.
The Duluth Playhouse also is on the premises, and so are other perform-
ing arts companies. Allow three hours.

Headwaters of the Mississippi
Itasca State Park, Lake Itasca
In 1832, a scholarly geographer named Henry Schoolcraft, after trekking
through the area with local Indians, decided the headwaters of the great
Mississippi lay in this lake in northern Minnesota. Although both local
Ojibwas and French trappers called it Elk Lake, he renamed it Itasca from
syllables in the Latin veritas caput, meaning “true head.” What’s fun here
for the visitor is to leap or tiptoe across the small trickling stream forming
the Mississippi via a log footbridge or a footpath of slippery rocks placed
in the water. A museum at the site details the evidence. A quarter-mile walk
along a wooded trail takes you to the headwaters. Allow one to two hours.
36750 Main Park Dr., Park Rapids. (Take U.S. 2 west from Bemidji to its junction with
SR 2 at Shevlin, turn south and follow SR 2 to Lake Itasca, and then follow signage
to Itasca State Park’s East Entrance off U.S. 71.) Visitor center % 218-266-2100. www.
dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html. RV parking: Large
designated parking lot. Admission: Free. Open: Daily year-round.
Ironworld Discovery Center
Chisholm
We arrived at Ironworld on a September day dedicated to the International
Button Box Festival. It took only a moment to realize that a button box
actually is an accordion, and that this form of music is very much alive
and well in Minnesota. Music, storytelling, and polka dancing filled the day
along with plenty of snacks and dinners from The Ethnic Restaurant (see
“Good eats,” later in this chapter). You find a splendid museum on the his-
tory of the Iron Range and the various ethnic groups that arrived in the
New World to work the mines. A small amusement park with a steam cal-
liope carrousel and Pellet Pete’s miniature golf course entertains kids.
Other attractions include a gem and mineral display, the Polka Hall of
Fame, a vintage trolley ride to a reconstructed mining settlement called
Glen Mine, early Scandinavian buildings, and a tribute museum to the
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps of the 1930s, an organization
that built many state and national park facilities. Allow a half- to full day.
801 SW U.S. 169 W. (Take I-35 north from the Twin Cities or Duluth to Cloquet, follow
U.S. 33 to U.S. 53. Take U.S. 53 to Virginia, and then follow U.S. 169 west to Chisholm.)

nated lots adjacent to the center. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors, $6 ages 7–17; for
special event days add $1. Open: Tues–Sun June–Labor Day 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Judy Garland Museum
Grand Rapids
Judy Garland was almost born in a trunk. In 1922, she arrived as the third
daughter in a wannabe show-business family — her dad, Frank Gumm,
managed the local movie house and her mother, Ethel, played the piano to
accompany the silent films. Garland started her career as Baby Gumm, tap
dancing on the theater stage between features, and then graduated into
Chapter 19: Northern Minnesota: Paul Bunyan Country 261

name to Judy Garland when she signed her first Hollywood contract. The
downtown Central School, now called the Itasca Heritage Center, show-
cases A Family Scrapbook saluting Judy Garland, with replica costumes
and ruby slippers, posters, photos, programs from local amateur theatri-
cal productions directed by her mother, her father’s golf clubs, and an
abundance of family childhood photos. The center claims to have the
world’s largest collection of Garland memorabilia. The gift shop offers
Wizard of Oz items, books, and videos. Allow two hours.

Mall of America
Bloomington
Claiming to be the biggest shopping mall in the United States and the
Midwest’s largest entertainment complex, Mall of America offers the ulti-
mate hanging-out-at-the-mall experience. Hundreds of brand-name shops,
dozens of theme restaurants, such as Rainforest Cafe, a roller coaster,
aquarium, The Camp at MOA for kids, a LEGO center, Aquarium, sports
bars, dance clubs, and a simulated motor speedway do their part to sep-
arate you from your money — but offer plenty of bang for the buck. You
can walk around and ogle the attractions without spending a cent. Or you
can shop ’til you drop. There is no clothing tax at MOA.

More cool things to see and do
Minnesota is a great state for outdoor lovers with its countless lakes and
forests. Animal fans can commune with wolves and bears in their natural
habitats, fresh-food fanatics can pick their own fruits and vegetables in
season for pennies, and trivia collectors find a treasure trove of oddities.
 Like a rolling stone. Singer Bob Dylan’s boyhood home is in
Hibbing, where he was born Robert Zimmerman in 1941 and
attended the local high school, a fortress-like building erected by
the area mine owners to entice workers to move to the area, so
they could enlarge the mine in 1918. The home is at 2425 Seventh
Ave. S. and is privately owned, so you can only drive by for a look;
do not attempt to visit.
 Calling all loons. A giant loon 20 feet long and 20 feet high floats
on Silver Lake in the heart of Virginia; the big bird serves as the
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
262

centerpiece to the Land of the Loon Festival, an arts-and-crafts fes-
tival that takes place over a weekend each June.
 Leave the driving to them. The Greyhound Bus Origin Museum,
Hibbing Memorial Buildings, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue East,
Hibbing (% 218-263-5814; www.greyhoundbusmuseum.org), dis-
plays some beautiful examples of vintage buses, beginning with the
1914 Hupmobile, the company’s first vehicle that was used to trans-
port miners from Hibbing to nearby Alice. The 1956 Scenicruiser
with its big windows and the very first Bookmobile also are on 
display. Allow one hour.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is $5 adults, $4 sen-
iors and ages 12–17, $2 age 6–12, $10 families. It’s open mid-May
through mid-September Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m.
 Howl at the moon. The International Wolf Center, 96 SR 169, Ely
(% 800-359-9653 or 218-365-4695; www.wolf.org), not only tells
the story of timber wolves through exhibits and displays but also
has a pack of wolves in residence in a natural habitat area. A view-
ing theater enables visitors to watch wild wolves going about their
daily routines, including feeding on roadkill deer (not a sight for the
young or the squeamish). Scheduled night strolls near the center
let you howl with the wolves. Intensive weekend programs are
available. Allow a minimum of two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $7.50 adults,
$6.50 seniors, $4 ages 6–12; prices vary for special weekend pro-
grams. It’s open May through September daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
October through April weekends only. Wolf demonstrations are at 
11 a.m., 2 p.m., 4 p.m., and 6 p.m.
 Go for the goal. Eveleth is entitled to be hockey’s mecca because
the first ice hockey game in the United States was played in this
town in 1903. The United States Hockey Hall of Fame, U.S. 53 and
Hat Trick Avenue, Eveleth (% 800-443-7825 or 218-744-5167; www.
ushockeyhall.com), salutes the stars, tells the history of the
game, and even has a Zamboni display and a mock shooting rink
with an electronic goalie for you to try to score against. The world’s
largest hockey stick, 107 feet long and weighing more than 3 tons, 
is on display with its own giant rubber puck. Allow one to three
hours, depending on how big a fan you are.
RV parking is available in a designated lot or on the street. Admission
is $8 adults, $7 seniors and ages 13–17, $4 ages 6–12. It’s open May
through November Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.; December through April Thursday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed major holidays.
 Bear in mind. The Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary (% 218-757-
0172; www.americanbear.org) shelters some 60 black bears (in
addition to other native wildlife) in a 360-acre property. From a
Chapter 19: Northern Minnesota: Paul Bunyan Country 263

viewing platform, visitors can get close enough to photograph the
bears without disturbing their habitat. Allow one hour.
To get to the sanctuary, take Highway 53 north to 1 mile south of
Orr, turning left on County Road 23. Continue on CR 23 for 13 miles.
Watch for sign approximately 100 yards past CR 514 on the right.
RV parking is available in a nearby lot with a free shuttle to the
sanctuary. Admission is $7 adults and seniors, $3 ages 6–17. It’s
open May through early September Tuesday through Sunday from
5 p.m. to dusk. Call the Orr Chamber of Commerce at % 877-254-
4691 or go to www.orrmn.com for more information about the area.
Weekend wonder
Instead of traveling the entire Paul Bunyan route, you can opt for one 
of three short road trips in northern Minnesota. First, the North Shore
Drive from Duluth along Lake Superior offers some great sightseeing,
good camping, and easy driving except for sometimes bumper-to-
bumper conditions in peak season. Our second suggestion is a round-
trip from Duluth up SR 53 to Virginia and the Iron Range, with a
half-day spent at Ironworld, then heading west across U.S. 169 to Grand
Rapids, and returning to Duluth on U.S. 2. A third possibility is to take
U.S. 2 from Duluth west to Bemidji, visit Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue
Ox in both Bemidji and Akeley, cover the Mississippi headwaters, and
then return to Duluth on SR 200 and U.S. 2.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
You’ll have no trouble finding a place to camp because northern
Minnesota is chockablock with private campgrounds and state parks at a
ratio of one or more per lake in some areas. Still, if areas seem crowded
with campers as you travel through them, you can call ahead and make 
a reservation for your next overnight.
All campgrounds in this chapter have public flush toilets, showers, and
sanitary dump stations unless designated otherwise. Most campgrounds
are closed in winter. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations
only. See Chapter 9 for how we choose our favorite campgrounds.

Picking your own fresh berries
The whole family can have fun picking fresh berries in season or even ordering ahead
to get already-picked berries. In northern Minnesota, strawberries peak in June and
July; raspberries and blueberries, in July and August. We eat our fill of fresh berries
and then freeze them or make jams and jellies in our RV kitchen to take home. The fol-
lowing list names a few berry growers along the Paul Bunyan drive, although you may
spot others. The berry growers ask that you call ahead, whether you’re looking to pick
your own berries or buy fresh-picked ones. They can give you the hours and direc-
tions to their farms. There’s also a handy Web site that lists farms all over the country
where you can pick your own produce by season, here’s the link for Minnesota farms:
www.pickyourown.org/MN.htm.
 Berry Pine Farms, Duluth (% 218-721-3250), offers prepicked or pick-your-own
strawberries; containers are provided. Children are welcome. Homemade jams
and jellies also are for sale.

your-own blueberries. Open late July through Labor Day.
 The Blueberry Patch, Gilbert (% 218-865-4100), asks that visitors bring their own
containers for blueberries; strawberry containers provided. Supervised children
are welcome. Open daily Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Hand-
harvested wild rice also is for sale.

ally beginning the last week of July. Call after July 20 for opening date.

Good eats
Treats to look for in Minnesota include wild rice (especially the hand-
picked wild version as opposed to the paddy-grown wild rice), fresh
walleye pike, the European nut pastry called potica (pronounced po-teet-
sah), fresh-picked berries in season (see the “Picking your own fresh
berries” sidebar), Cornish pasties, Gouda and cheddar farm cheeses,
Harelson apples, and smoked fish from Lake Superior. For information
on grocery stores and farmers’ markets, see “Stocking the Pantry,” ear-
lier in this chapter.
 Betty’s Pies, 215 SR 61 E., Two Harbors (% 218-834-3367): Betty’s
sells just what the name implies, plenty of homemade pies, plus
sandwiches, salads, and soups, and the occasional slab of walleye
pike. Pies range from custard to fresh blueberry, a dozen different
flavors a day, plus homemade cookies and cakes. Open daily from 
7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Carol Widman’s Candy Shop, 4325 13th St. S., Fargo (% 800-688-
8351; www.carolwidmanscandyco.com), and 106 S. Third St.,
Grand Forks (% 701-775-3480): Widman’s heads our North Dakota
list because we’re addicted to the crunchy, salty-sweet, chocolate-
dipped potato chips they call Chippers. The ruffled potato chips
are made from local Red River Valley potatoes, and then dipped
into a thick dark chocolate. On the shelf, you also find cow pies,
chocolate-covered marshmallow and caramel, far more elegant
than the name implies, and “hot air,” a buttery honeycomb candy
covered with chocolate. Open Monday through Saturday from 
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Sunday.
 The Ethnic Restaurant, in the Ironworld Discovery Center, U.S. 169
W., Chisholm (% 800-372-6437 or 218-254-7959): On designated
days and special-events weekends, the restaurant serves a $10
ethnic buffet that may include roast lamb, sarmas (stuffed cab-
bage), porketta (thinly sliced, highly seasoned roast pork), Swedish
meatballs, and potica. If the buffet isn’t open during your visit, or if
you want something simpler, look for the open-air snack bar that
vends porketta in a potato roll, gyros, sarmas, pasties, bratwurst
with sauerkraut, Polish sausage, and “pickle on a stick.” Open on
special event days from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 Italian Bakery, 205 S. First St., Virginia (% 218-741-3464; www.
potica.com): This bakery is the home of the Slovenian dessert
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
268

potica, a dense, multilayered pastry filled with finely chopped wal-
nuts in butter and cream. Sold in loaves of 1 or 11⁄2 pounds, potica
keeps wonderfully well in the refrigerator and freezes well. If you
want a quick dessert, warm a slice in the microwave and top it with
a scoop of ice cream. The biscotti also are delicious. Open Monday
through Friday from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday from 6 a.m. to 
3 p.m. Closed Sunday.
Shopping along the Way
If shopping is your passion, plan to detour your RV to the Mall of
America in Bloomington (see “Must-see attractions”).
The Bemidji Woolen Mills Factory Store, 301 Irvine Ave., Bemidji 
(% 218-751-5166; www.bemidjiwoolenmills.com), sells woolen goods
produced on-site since 1920, along with other selected American brand

and outerwear. Shop hours are Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

or all their craggy remoteness, the Arkansas Ozarks, among
America’s oldest mountains, are only about 2,300 feet high. “Our
mountains ain’t high,” goes the saying, “but our valleys sure are deep.”
The Ozarks are the heart of American folk crafts and music, preserved
primarily because the area has been remote and poor for almost a cen-
tury. During the Depression of the 1930s, many of the hill people gravi-
tated to industrial cities of the North to make a living, leaving parts of the
Ozarks to revert to wilderness. In the 1950s, when so much of the South
was tearing down Victorian buildings to put up modern facades, lovely-
but-declining old towns, such as Hot Springs and Eureka Springs, made
do with what they had because they couldn’t afford modernization.
In the 1960s, a little-known lakeside Missouri town called Branson pio-
neered live country music shows. By the 1980s, major music stars
flocked to Branson to build their own theaters, and the town soon grew
into the second-most-visited tourist site in the United States, outnum-
bered only by Orlando, Florida.
Getting There
A rambling loop drive from Hot Springs, Arkansas, heads north on SR 7
to Harrison and then west via U.S. 412, north via SR 23, west again via
SR 12 to War Eagle, Rogers, and, via SR 112, north to Bentonville. From
there, follow U.S. 62 to the picturesque Victorian town of Eureka Springs
and east to Bear Creek Springs, and then drive north to Branson and
Springfield, Missouri, on U.S. 65.

The Ozarks and Branson
Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 271

Head back into Arkansas on U.S. 65, turning east at Leslie on SR 66 to
Mountain View, home of the Ozark Folk Center, and scenic Jacksonport
State Park with its spacious, appealing campground. A short jog south
on U.S. 67 takes you into Little Rock to conclude the journey. The total
distance driven is approximately 700 miles. (See the “Ozarks and
Branson” map in this chapter.)
Note that some of the most colorful roads through the Ozarks are also
narrow, steep, and winding. If you and your RV aren’t comfortable maneu-
vering the back roads, you can stick to main routes — taking the less
curvy SR 9 or I-30 to Little Rock, and I-40 west to Fort Smith and U.S. 71
north to Bentonville. U.S. 62 from Eureka Springs to U.S. 65 at Bear Creek
Springs also is easy to drive, and so is U.S. 65 north to Branson and
Springfield. We’ve safely driven motorhomes from 27 to 36 feet long
through the Ozarks on all the routes suggested in this driving tour.
The only real traffic jams in this area are on the streets of Branson,
where you can spend more than an hour inching your way along SR 76
through the middle of town in high season. Locals tell of visitors who
hop out of the RV (leaving behind a driver, of course!), go shopping, and
return to the vehicle a block or two farther along. The best way to avoid
this is to leave your RV at the campground and go into town via the local
shuttle.
Planning Ahead
Branson bustles with activities and shows between April and the end of
October (though some performers and theaters put on Christmas shows
around the holidays). During the off season, most of the theaters and
campgrounds are closed. The Ozarks are beautiful in spring — when the
dogwood trees, redbuds, lilacs, and May apples are blossoming and the
weather is mild — and in autumn when fall temperatures turn leaves red
and gold and good weather is likely through October. In summer, days can
be awfully hot, and the heaviest traffic and campground use is in effect.
If you know when you want to go and where you want to stay, making
campground reservations in Branson well ahead of time is a good idea.
Making show reservations doesn’t seem to be as important. Most RVers
wait until they arrive at their campground and then make reservations
and/or purchase tickets. Check the Branson Web site at www.branson
world.com to see who’s playing when.
Branson has some 35 live-music theaters, including the Roy Rogers/Dale
Evans Museum and Theater, that play daily matinee and evening shows;
some also even offer breakfast shows. Don’t expect a late night, how-
ever, because the last show usually starts at 8 p.m.
Dress is casual in this part of the world, so pack your jeans, shorts, 
T-shirts, and lightweight cottons if you’re coming in summer. For spring
and fall, add a sweater or jacket, some lightweight rain gear, and hiking
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
272

boots. You can easily arrange mountain biking, canoeing, white-water
rafting, hiking, fishing, and horseback riding when you’re in the Ozarks,
so bring along the gear for your favorite sport.
Allow one to two weeks for your Ozarks vacation, depending on how
many sports activities you plan to schedule and how many shows you
want to attend in Branson.
Stocking the Pantry
You need to stock up your pantry in Little Rock, Hot Springs, or
Springfield, because most rural stores in the Ozarks are long on country
ham, smoked bacon, homemade jams, and pepper relish, but short on
everything else. Cooked and ready to eat in or take out, chicken, barbe-
cue, and catfish are cheap and available almost everywhere.
If you want any alcoholic beverages in your pantry, stock up ahead of
time because parts of Arkansas and Missouri are dry, meaning they have
restricted sales or no sales of alcoholic beverages. Even in communities
where sales are legal, Sundays may be completely dry. Some communi-
ties that do permit limited alcohol sales operate on a private-club basis,
whereby you pay to become a member to access the bar.
Driving the Ozarks and Branson
Hot Springs, Arkansas, is home to the only urban national park in the
United States, a fact that mystifies many foreign visitors who arrive
expecting to see another Yellowstone or Yosemite. Known nowadays as
the town where former President Bill Clinton grew up, Hot Springs once
was the most fashionable watering hole in the Midwest. The notorious
gangster Al Capone loved to soak in the hot springs and booked the
entire fourth floor of the Arlington Hotel when he came to take in the
waters. Baseball great Babe Ruth was another frequent visitor.
Until the 1960s, gambling flourished in Hot Springs. Elegant old hotels
and bathhouses, such as the Fordyce Bathhouse, which has been reno-
vated to serve as a visitor center for the national park, line Central
Avenue (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). You can also
board amphibious ducks — World War II landing craft converted to
tourist transportation — and bop around Lake Hamilton over land and
water (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). When
it’s time to eat, make a beeline for McClard’s famous barbecue restau-
rant (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Parking space in downtown Hot Springs is limited for RVs, so you’re
better off leaving the motorhome or trailer at an RV campground and
heading into town in a smaller vehicle. Town parking lots are across
Central Avenue from Bathhouse Row along Bath and Exchange streets
Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 273

and opposite the Arlington Hotel on Central Avenue, which is also SR 7.
Note: Vehicles longer than 30 feet are not permitted to drive up Hot
Springs Mountain Drive.
Some 65 miles south of Hot Springs via U.S. 70 and SR 27 is Crater of
Diamonds State Park (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this
chapter), America’s only publicly accessible diamond mine, where you
not only can dig for the elusive gems for a modest fee, but you also get
to keep any diamonds that you unearth.
The most scenic mountain drive from Hot Springs north to Harrison is
the 160-mile stretch of SR 7, a winding two-lane highway that meanders
past Lake Ouchita State Park, the Ouchita Mountains (which can be daz-
zling in autumn), Nimrod Dam and Lake, and Lake Dardanelle State
Park (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter). Along the
way, you have plenty of opportunities to shop for country ham, hand-
made quilts, and tacky “hillbilly” souvenirs.
An even more rugged stretch of mountains lies ahead in the Ozark
National Forest. If you want a relaxing change of pace from the demand-
ing road, take I-40 west from Russellville to Fort Smith, then head north
on I-540 to Bentonville, and pick up the original tour.
North of Dardanelle, SR 7 winds its way up through the Ozark National
Forest past hillbilly trading posts and pretty mountain villages, such as
Pelsor, home of Hankins Country Store, dating from 1922, and Cowell.
The Buffalo River, the only major stream in Arkansas without a dam,
courses its way for 125 miles through the Ozarks between Buffalo City
and Boxley. Along this route you find the Buffalo National River Park
(see “More cool things to see and do”), a favorite destination for canoe-
ing. SR 7 crosses the river park at Pruitt. You can rent gear at several
outfitters along the river.
From Harrison, a major junction and gateway to Branson, Missouri, our
drive turns west to War Eagle, off SR 12 near Rogers. The War Eagle Mill,
a working gristmill, and the War Eagle Bean Palace sell and serve stone-
ground grits, cornbread, pancakes, and waffles (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter). A few miles west is Bentonville, where Sam and Mary
Walton opened their first 5-and-10-cent store in 1945. Enshrined on the
main square in town, the original store, now a museum and visitor center,
was the modest beginning of the Wal-Mart empire. (See “More cool things
to see and do,” later in this chapter, for the Wal-Mart Visitor Center.)
From Bentonville, SR 72 leads northeast to Pea Ridge, site of the Pea
Ridge National Military Park and one of the Civil War’s most unusual
battles (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Continuing east on U.S. 62 from Pea Ridge, SR 23 leads to Eureka
Springs, probably the most charming town in the Ozarks. Block after
block of Victorian houses are listed on the National Register of Historic

Hot Springs Highlights
Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 275
Places. Hillsides are so steep that some houses can be entered on the
first floor on one street and on the fifth floor on the next street uphill.
This jewel of a town delighted even as tough a character as Carry
Nation, fiery opponent of alcohol, who settled here in 1908, naming her
home Hatchet Hall after her favorite saloon-smashing tool. The town has
continued to attract fundamentalists and the religious right, and major
tourist attractions today include the long-running Great Passion Play
(see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter); the Anita
Bryant Theater, where the former orange-juice spokeswoman appears on
stage in her live musical autobiography; and a trio of attractions — a 70-
foot concrete statue of Christ that can be seen over the treetops, a Bible
museum, and a Christ Only Art Gallery with some 500 portraits of Jesus.
Our route continues east along U.S. 62 to its junction with U.S. 65 and
then turns north to Branson. This little town that nobody ever heard of
a few years ago now claims to be “the country music capital of the uni-
verse,” in case a few banjo-strumming Martians try to horn in on the act.

Today, it claims to attract more visitors every year than Yellowstone,
Grand Canyon, or Washington, D.C., and comes in second only to
Orlando, Florida, as America’s most-visited locale.
For the kids, Silver Dollar City is a classic 40-year-old theme park. For
the sentimental, an outdoor evening drama called The Shepherd of the
Hills is based on a book popular back in 1907. Strictly G-rated, the play,
written in mountain dialect, features a large cast, horse-drawn wagons,
and a burning cabin. (See “More cool things to see and do,” later in this
chapter, for details on the park and play.)
From Branson, Springfield is only 40 miles north via U.S. 65. Springfield
boasts not only the Bass Outdoor World (also called Bass Pro Shop),
one of Missouri’s major tourist attractions, but also offbeat Lambert’s,
a restaurant known as “the home of the throwed roll” (see “Must-see
attractions” and “Good eats,” respectively).
Fans of the Little House books and long-running TV series Little House on
the Prairie may want to drive the 35 miles east from Springfield on U.S.
60 to Mansfield, where the Laura Ingalls Wilder House has been turned
into a museum (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chap-
ter). Wilder wrote the popular series here.
The route returns to Arkansas and the Ozarks via U.S. 65 to Harrison and
southeast across Buffalo National River Park at Silver Hill. We like to
pause in the pleasant little town of Leslie for some delectable baked
goods from Serenity Farm Bread (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
From Leslie, cut across SR 66 to Mountain View and the Ozark Folk Arts
Center (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). Folk musician
Jimmy Driftwood probably best described the music at the center. When
asked the difference between the folk music at the Ozark Folk Arts
Center and the hillbilly and country music shows staged elsewhere in
Arkansas, Jimmy said, “We don’t allow counterfeit cornpone around
here,” referring to the cornbread made in the area. The cultural tradi-
tions of the mountain regions — the music, dancing, handicrafts, foods,
and folkways — are cherished and preserved at the center.
From Mountain View, follow scenic SR 14 east to Jacksonport State 
Park (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter). From
Jacksonport, you can easily swing south along U.S. 67 to Little Rock
and the end of the tour.
Must-see attractions
Bass Outdoor World
Springfield, Missouri
This vast sporting goods store and museum offers everything that you can
imagine, from hunting and fishing licenses to fly-tying demonstrations and
deer-processing books such as Field Dressing and Skinning. Four-story

waterfalls flow inside the store, surrounded by craggy rock cliffs and
mounted masterpieces of taxidermy (goats and bears, in particular). You
can test your new rifle, too, at the indoor shooting range. On the second
floor is a museum of the outdoors, a barbershop, and a macho all-day
eatery called Hemingway’s with a 30,000-gallon aquarium stocked with
sharks. Allow two to three hours.

8 p.m.; store Mon–Sat 7 a.m.–10 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Branson Family Entertainment
Branson, Missouri
With some 49 live music theaters, the rapidly growing entertainment
center of Branson claims more theater seats than Broadway, as much
musical excitement as Nashville, and a wholesome atmosphere for the
entire family. The stars, many with their own theaters, range from aging
pop singers, such as Andy Williams and Bobby (“Blue Velvet”) Vinton, to
Texas honky-tonk musician Mickey Gilley, violin virtuoso Shoji Tabuchi,
Russian comic Yakov Smirnoff, country singer and comedienne Barbara
Fairchild, Tony Orlando, stars of the Lawrence Welk TV show, the Roy
Rogers/Dale Evans Museum and Theater, and Les Brown’s Band of
Renown. Throw in a few spectacles — Dixie Stampede horse show with
racing ostriches, the Shanghai Puppet Troupe, pianist Frederick Antonio
with two grand pianos and 40,000 gallons of swirling water fountains, and
The Promise, a dramatization of the story of Jesus including live animals
and award-winning special effects — and you can see how they please the
crowds and the kids. The star appearances tend to be seasonal (May–Oct),
but the holidays bring Christmas shows, and there are still some live
shows performing from January to March.
Branson is in southwestern Missouri on U.S. 65, 12 miles north of the Arkansas
border. Branson Chamber of Commerce/Convention & Visitors Bureau % 800-214-
3661. www.explorebranson.com. Most attractions closed mid-Jan–Feb. Show
tickets: adults $25–$50, children $10–$25, some free for ages 12 and younger. Show
times: Some breakfast shows, afternoon matinees, most evening shows at 8 p.m.
Downtown Historic District
Eureka Springs, Arkansas
The entire downtown area of Eureka Springs is on the National Register of
Historic Places with colorful Victorian “painted ladies” lining the steep,
narrow streets. Limestone walls built from native stone mark boundaries,
and streets cross at peculiar angles, none making a perfect right angle.
Some houses that appear to be single story with an entrance from one
street turn out to have four more floors underneath when you get to the
next block downhill. The Catholic church is entered through its bell tower.
Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 277

The town was founded to exploit its 63 healing hot springs with board-
inghouses springing up to feed health seekers. The arrival of the railroad
in 1883 spurred the building of more than 50 plush hotels in the next three
decades. Today, crafts shops, art galleries, superb inns, and several out-
standing restaurants make Eureka Springs a romantic getaway for urban
honeymooners with the largest and most upscale collection of bed-and-
breakfasts in the state.
Don’t attempt to drive your RV in Eureka Springs. Instead, leave the rig at
the campground if you’re staying in the area or park it in one of the open-
air lots at the base of the town (before the main roads climb uphill) and
use the town’s open air trolleys for sightseeing. Allow two to three hours.
Eureka Springs is in the northwestern corner of Arkansas on U.S. 62. Eureka Springs
Tourist Center % 800-6-EUREKA (638-7352). www.eurekaspringschamber.com.
RV parking: Scarce; use the Eureka Springs Trolley System (% 479-253-9572) for a
1-hour guided tour or transport around town; $10 adults and children.
Fordyce Bathhouse
Hot Springs National Park, Arkansas
The Spanish Renaissance Fordyce Bathhouse, the most splendidly
restored structure along the town’s famous Bathhouse Row, doubles as
the visitor center for the national park and a museum of thermal bathing
history. Go in, get park information from the rangers on duty, and then look
around. An 8,000-piece stained-glass skylight illuminates the De Soto
Fountain with its Art Deco statue of an Indian maiden offering a bowl of
spring water to explorer Hernando De Soto. In the 1915 gymnasium, a spar-
tan fitness center displays punching bags, vaulting horses, and acrobatic
rings. Allow one hour.

Ozark Folk Arts Center
Mountain View, Arkansas
The first folk cultural center in the United States, this center was created
in 1973 to preserve the music, dancing, handicrafts, and folkways of the
Ozarks. Two dozen individual craftsmen work inside the center. Cloggers,
many of whom are elderly and who banter among themselves before,
during, and after performances, often dance to the tunes of musicians who
play frequent sets throughout the day. All musical selections must precede
1937; percussion and electronic amplification is not permitted. The center
offers special gospel music concerts on Sunday evenings. The folk center’s
restaurant serves honest Arkansas food (see “Good eats,” later in this
chapter) and a snack bar vends barbecue sandwiches and fried peach and
apple pies. Allow a half-day to a full day.

More cool things to see and do
The Ozarks is a haven of unique American innovations and creations
that reflect earlier eras. Sometimes you may think that you not only
entered another time zone but also another century.
 Paddle away the day. During winter and spring months, the Buffalo
River reaches its peak flow for canoeists and rafters. The Buffalo
National River Park, the first designated national river, is a natural
stream that’s unique in a state of multiple fishing streams and lakes
created by the U.S. Corps of Engineers.
At Wild Bill’s Outfitter, Buffalo Point, Junction of SR 14 and SR 268
No. 1, Yellville, Arkansas (% 800-554-8657 or 870-449-6235; www.
ozark-float.com), you can rent canoes, rafts, and kayaks. You
find additional outfitters in Jasper where SR 7 crosses the park, in
Ponca where SR 43 crosses the park, in Tyler Bend and Silver Hill
where U.S. 65 crosses the park, and in Buffalo Point where SR 14
crosses. RV parking is available on the road.
 Waddle with the ducks. Amphibious duck tours are popular land-
and-sea excursions undertaken in World War II landing craft that
have been converted for tourist transport. The ducks lumber along
the main roads in town and then head for Lake Hamilton to walk on
the water with plenty of laughing and splashing by kids and adults
alike. Allow three hours.
In Hot Springs, Arkansas, check out Ducks in the Park Tours, 316
Central Ave. (% 501-624-3825), and National Park Duck Tours, 418
Central Ave. (% 800-682-7044 or 501-321-2911; www.rideaduck.
com/ducks/index.php). RV parking is scarce in town; look for
parking lots across from Bathhouse Row on Bath and Exchange
streets. Admission is $14 adults, $13 seniors, $8 ages 3 to 12. Tours
run daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Catch the Ozarks’ own religious spectacle. More than six million
people have come to see the Great Passion Play, Statue Road off
U.S. 62 East, Eureka Springs, Arkansas (% 800-882-7529 or 479-
253-9200; www.greatpassionplay.com), the story of the last week
of the life of Jesus with a large cast and many special effects. The
popular Eureka Springs production has a cast of 250 actors, 40
sheep, 12 horses, 5 donkeys, and 3 camels.
RV parking is available in designated lots. Admission is $23 adults,
$10 ages 4–11. The play is on from late April through October
Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday through Saturday at 8:30 p.m.;
after Labor Day it’s at 7:30 p.m.
 Visit the little house in the Ozarks. The Laura Ingalls Wilder
Historic Home, 3068 Hwy. A, 1 mile east of the town square,
Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 279

Mansfield, Missouri (% 417-924-3626; www.lauraingallswilder
home.com), was the author’s home from 1894 until her death in
1957. She wrote all nine of her Little House books here. The house 
is preserved as she left it, and handwritten manuscripts of the
books are on display. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $8 adults, 
$6 seniors, $4 students ages 6 to 18. It’s open March 1 through
October 31 daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m.
 Flip for Missouri. Pea Ridge National Military Park, on U.S. 62, 
2 miles west of Garfield and 10 miles northeast of Rogers, Arkansas
(% 479-451-8122; www.nps.gov/peri), commemorates the 1862
battle that decided whether Missouri became a member of the
Union or the Confederacy. The battle also was the first in the Civil
War in which Native Americans — two regiments of Cherokees on
the Confederate side under the command of Brigadier General
Albert Pike — participated. Depending on which historian you read,
on the second day, the Cherokee troops either stood aside and were
not sent into the battle or, more likely, went home after the first day,
seeing little real reason to fight again. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a lot. Admission is $3 adults, free for ages
17 and younger, $5 families. It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Closed major holidays.
 Count sheep. The Shepherd of the Hills, SR 76, Branson, Missouri,
2 miles west of the strip (% 417-334-4191; www.theshepherdof
thehills.com), is a rustic, outdoor drama based on Harold Bell
Wright’s 1907 novel of the same name. (The book also was made
into a 1941 film starring John Wayne, which bears little resem-
blance to the original.) With a cast of 75, a whole herd of sheep,
and a roaring bonfire on stage, the play holds your attention, even
in a 2,000-seat arena.
In addition to the play, you can also eat a chuck wagon dinner
accompanied by the musical stylings of the Sons of the Pioneers as
they sing their classic hits, including “Tumbling Tumbleweeds” and
“Cool, Clear Water.” There are breakfast shows with Chuckwagon
stars at 11 a.m., and dinner shows with Sons of the Pioneers that
start at 5 p.m.; dinner is served at 4:15 p.m.
RV parking is available in designated lots. The 5 p.m. Sons of the
Pioneers show costs $39 adults, $19 ages 4 to 12; the breakfast
show at 11 a.m. costs $25 adults, $14 ages 4 to 12. The 8:30 p.m.
Shepard of the Hills show costs $37 adults, $35 seniors, $18 ages 4
to 12; dinner and show costs $61 adults, $57 seniors, $29 ages 4 to
16, $99 families. There are several combination tickets available
that include the show(s) and tours of Shepherd of the Hills
Homestead. Open: Daily.
 Skip the cave and hit the midway. The original theme park called
Silver Dollar City, Indian Point Road, Branson, Missouri (% 800-
475-9370 or 417-338-2611; www.silverdollarcity.com), grew up
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
280

around Marvel Cave back in the 1960s, but today’s visitors tend to
skip the cave (the 500 steep steps leading down into it may be one
reason) and visit the rides, shops, craftsmen venues, and country
music groups that perform daily throughout the park. Kids love the
waterslide, the roller coaster, and rides on the paddle-wheeler
Branson Belle. Allow a half-day to a full day.
The park is 9 miles west of Branson on SR 76. RV parking is avail-
able in a large designated lot. Admission is $47 adults, $45 seniors,
$37 ages 4 to 17. It’s open from mid-April to late December daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Witness the dawn of Wal-Mart. In Bentonville, Arkansas, Sam and
Mary Walton opened their first modest 5-and-10-cent store in 1945.
Today, the store is the Wal-Mart Visitor Center, 105 N. Main St., on
the Square, Bentonville, Arkansas (% 479-273-1329; www.walmart
stores.com), a museum filled with 1950s and 1960s merchandise,
35 electronic historical displays, and Sam’s original desk. Allow one
hour.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free. The visitor
center is open March through October Tuesday through Saturday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Weekend wonders
If you want to condense this scenic Ozarks drive and Branson entertain-
ment holiday into a weekend, you can begin your drive in Hot Springs,
Arkansas, follow SR 7 north through the Ozarks into Harrison, and on 
to Branson, Missouri. The drive itself is slightly less than 200 miles but
may take all day on the narrow, curvy road.
An alternative route is to drive from Little Rock north on I-40 to U.S. 65,
turn east at Clinton on SR 16 to Mountain View for a visit to the Ozark
Folk Center, and then follow scenic SR 14 northwest across the Buffalo
National River Park at Buffalo Point and on to Yellville, where you turn
west on U.S. 62/U.S. 412 to join U.S. 65 for the short trip north to
Branson. This shortened tour runs around 230 miles.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Arkansas state parks are RV friendly. Most have hookups and all are in
scenic areas. With 9,700 miles of streams and rivers and 6,000 acres of
surface water, the state promises plenty of fishing, boating, floating, and
canoeing in public and private campgrounds. For July and August and
spring weekends, we recommend that you make campground reserva-
tions, especially around Branson and Eureka Springs.
All campgrounds in this section are open year-round and have public
flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated

otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only. See
Chapter 9 for information on how we choose our favorite campgrounds.

Chapter 20: The Ozarks and Branson: Hot Springs to Springfield 285
Bringing home the bacon
Hickory-smoked, salt-cured country ham is an Ozarks specialty. This rich, salty ham
lasts for months in a cool dark place, so you can buy one to take home and store it in
the RV. What follows are some of our favorite spots to pick one up; all are open daily
except Sunday.
 Burgers Smokehouse, Highway 87 South, California, Missouri, 134 miles north of
Springfield near Jefferson City (% 800-624-5426 or 573-796-3134; www.smoke
house.com)
 Country Smoked Meats, Highway 7 South, Dogpatch, Arkansas (% 870-743-1638)
 Coursey’s Smokehouse, SR 65 between Leslie and St. Joe, Arkansas (% 870-439-
2503)
 Hillbilly Smokehouse, 1801 S. Eighth St., Rogers, Arkansas, on SR 17B (% 800-
759-9439 or 479-636-1927)

Good eats
Penny-pinchers are delighted with the Ozarks because prices, especially
for restaurant meals, are generally lower than in most other areas of the
country. Big, family-style, all-you-can-eat buffets dominate the scene in
places such as Branson. Because we prefer to avoid these, our list of
favorites doesn’t include any, but you can find reasonably priced big 
buffets by asking locally.
Here are some of our favorite places to pick up some down-home cook-
ing; most are open for lunch and early dinner, but don’t arrive fashion-
ably late because they’ll probably be closed.
 B&B Bar-B-Q, 230 S East St., Fayetteville, Arkansas (% 479-521-
3663): The barbecue pit is fired with hickory, and the bread is
homemade. You place your order using an orange telephone in
your booth, and when the phone lights up, it means your food is
ready. Beef and pork barbecue, batter-dipped fries, fried dill pick-
les, and fried peach or apple pies dusted with sugar make a gener-
ous if fat-laden meal. Don’t worry, you can have tofu and sprouts
tomorrow. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Catfish ’N’, 210 Dam Rd., on SR 7 near the Arkansas River Bridge in
Dardanelle, Arkansas (% 479-229-3321): Catfish ’N’ serves up award-
winning fried catfish and hush puppies, french fries, coleslaw, and
pickled peppers. On our to-go orders, one plate had four catfish
filets, the other five, plus at least half a dozen hush puppies apiece.
You can also get fried or boiled shrimp, fried chicken, and hot fruit
cobblers for dessert. Open Tuesday through Saturday from 4 to 
9 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Monday.
 Cliff House Inn, SR 7, 5 miles south of Jasper, Arkansas (% 870-
446-2292; www.mcrush.com/cliffhouse): This convenient spot
with a great view of Arkansas’s Grand Canyon from its balcony
serves burgers, sandwiches, homemade pies, and main dishes from
catfish and fried chicken to steak. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
 Feltner’s Whatta-Burger Drive Inn, 1410 N. Arkansas Rd.,
Russellville, Arkansas (% 479-968-1410): Feltner’s cooks up the
most famous hamburger in Arkansas, an award-winner for more
than a decade. If you’re hungry, order a double double — double
meat and double cheese. And don’t overlook the famous fries and
shakes. Open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 Lambert’s, 1800 W. Hwy. J, off U.S. 65, Springfield, Missouri (% 417-
581-ROLL [417-581-7655]; www.throwedrolls.com): Despite its
nickname, “The home of the throwed roll,” you’re not pelted with
your dinner here, only certain parts of it. All you can eat is prom-
ised, and some of the meal, the fluffy, slightly sweet dinner rolls, for
example, is tossed at you as the servers make their dining-room
rounds. Kids love the fun. Good main-dish selections include
Lambert’s crunchy fried chicken and the delicious ham and white
Part IV: Discovering Mid-America 
286

beans with a side order of collard greens. Open daily from 10:30 a.m.
to 9 p.m.
 McClard’s, 530 Albert Pike, Hot Springs, Arkansas (% 501-624-9586;
www.mcclards.com): Bill Clinton, who cites this as a favorite hang-
out when he was growing up in Hot Springs, recalls in particular the
“tamale spreads” — one or two tamales topped with corn chips,
beans, chopped beef, cheese, and onions. Open Tuesday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. No credit cards. Closed Sunday and
Monday.
 Serenity Farm Bread, 1 block east of U.S. 65, Leslie, Arkansas 
(% 870-447-2211): Dedicated baker David Lower bakes sourdough
bread in the European style without artificial yeast or sugar, using
only freshly milled flour from organically grown, stone-ground
wheat, unrefined sea salt, and filtered water. Tasty loaves to treas-
ure include French, whole wheat, rye, focaccia, and fruit-filled
breakfast loaves. Open Wednesday through Saturday from 9 a.m. 
to 5 p.m., and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Closed Monday and
Tuesday. A branch of the original store a half-mile south of town
also features pastries. Open Tuesday through Sunday from 7:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Closed Monday.
 Skillet Restaurant and Ozark Folk Center Smokehouse, Mountain
View, Arkansas (% 870-269-3139; www.ozarkfolkcenter.com):
The rustic restaurant at the folk arts center serves fresh trout and
catfish, country ham, and fried chicken. If you just want a small
bite, the snack bar serves sandwiches and fried apple and peach
pies throughout the day. Open May through October daily from 
7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Springfield Brewing Company, 305 S. Market, Springfield, Missouri
(% 417-832-TAPS; http://springfieldbrewingco.com): This
nostalgic brewpub with a rooftop beer garden, live music at night,
and a Sunday brunch buffet is only a few blocks from Bass Outdoor
World. Open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. and
Sunday from noon to midnight.
 Stubby’s Bar-B-Q, 310 Park Ave., Hot Springs, Arkansas (% 501-
624-1552): We found Stubby’s because an adjacent dirt parking lot
was the only place we could find to put our RV on a busy summer
Saturday afternoon. Out of guilt, we picked up our dinner to go —
smoky baked potatoes cooked in the barbecue pit; meaty ribs
coated with a rich, dark sauce; and piquant coleslaw — and real-
ized we’d made a find. Open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 War Eagle Bean Palace, SR 98 south of SR 12E between Eureka
Springs and Rogers, Arkansas (% 479-789-5343; www.wareagle
mill.com): To get there from Eureka Springs, take SR 23 south to

powered gristmill on the War Eagle River sells stone-ground grits,
cornmeal, flour, waffle and pancake mix, hush-puppy mix, and a
popular fish-fry coating, all in pretty patterned cloth bags. In the

estern scenery and RVs were made for each other.
You need big windshields to take in the endless
vistas, and you can sleep out in the wide-open spaces — not
just look down on them from 20,000 feet as you ﬂy over.
Many adventures await you in the West. On our drive through
Montana and Wyoming in Chapter 21, you can savor a buffalo
burger, follow Buffalo Bill across Yellowstone and through the
Bighorn Mountains, and see where Custer made his big mis-
take. While cruising New Mexico in Chapter 22, you can buy a
cool pair of cowboy boots, peruse some classiﬁed X-ﬁles info
at a UFO museum, and see where Billy the Kid made his last
escape. In Chapter 23, you can discover the best spots for
whale-watching, kite-ﬂying, and camping among the dunes
along the Oregon coast. In Chapter 24, we guide you to the
best of California’s central coast, pointing out where you can
camp among migrating monarch butterﬂies or take in glorious
coastal views.
And if you want a trip that’s both modern and historic, take
the Mother Road: We show you the best places to experience
historic Route 66 in Chapter 25.

Chapter 21
Montana and Wyoming:
Tracking Buffalo Bill
In This Chapter
 Conquering the Beartooth Highway
 Camping in Yellowstone
 Trailing Custer at Little Bighorn
A
collection of stories about Montana called The Last Best Place,
issued in 1988 to mark a century of statehood, pretty much sums
up the state for outsiders who want to be insiders. Everyone from movie
stars to tycoons is discovering Montana, but plenty of room still exists
for the rest of us. Wait until you see the Beartooth Highway between Red
Lodge and Yellowstone; no less an expert than TV’s RV maven, the late
Charles Kuralt, once called it the most beautiful roadway in America.
The same is true of Wyoming, which calls itself “high, wide, and hand-
some.” Marked off in a near-square by some civil servants and disdained
by pioneers in covered wagons heading for Oregon, the state began as
big ranches, many of them owned by Europeans. Even today, cattle out-
number people by about three to one.
What’s so fantastic about Montana and Wyoming — the Big Sky 
Country — is the emptiness, the openness, and the plenitude of land-
scape. Driving an RV, knowing that everything you need for comfort is
with you and that the road ahead waits with open campsites, roadside
trout fishing, and scenic surprises, is as good as it gets in the 21st 
century.
Getting There
Setting out from Billings, Montana, and driving south on U.S. 212 to Red
Lodge, our tour follows the curves of spectacular Beartooth Highway
(named for a rocky outcropping at the summit shaped like a bear’s
tooth) across a pass with a 10,940-foot summit that drops into Wyoming
and Yellowstone National Park. Next, make a circle tour of Yellowstone

highlights, and then drive east along little-traveled Chief Joseph Highway
into Cody. From Cody, go east on U.S. 14 to Greybull, then travel south on
U.S. 16 to Worland, and then east on U.S. 16 to Buffalo across the Powder
River Pass. From Buffalo, return to Billings by driving north on I-90 back
into Montana and pausing at Little Bighorn Battlefield National
Monument. The distance traveled is 772 miles. (For the route, see the
“Buffalo Bill Country” map in this chapter.) For a shorter loop that covers
many of the highlights, see “Weekend wonder,” later in this chapter.
Planning Ahead
The best time to take this drive is in late spring, summer, or early fall.
In winter, snow closes many of the scenic highways, most of the
entrances into Yellowstone, and most of the campgrounds. Early spring
brings snowmelt and mud, and wildflowers don’t start blooming until
June. July and August usually offer the warmest weather, and always the
biggest crowds, with sometimes-maddening traffic and no room to turn
off at photo opportunities. Early fall, from Labor Day until early October,
is probably the best time to visit because the weather usually is mild,
although days may be rainy.
You can figure any time during late spring, summer, or early fall to be
crowded in Yellowstone, so you need to make campground reservations
six months in advance for the immediate area of the park. Towns such as
Billings, Buffalo, and even Red Lodge are not as busy.
If you plan to drive the Yellowstone National Park loop (141 miles) on
one long day of sightseeing, you probably don’t need campground reser-
vations. But if you want to spend more time in the park, make camp-
ground reservations at one of the five campgrounds in the park that
accepts them (see the sidebar “Camping in Yellowstone National Park,”
in this chapter) or in a commercial campground just outside the park in
West Yellowstone or Gardiner (see “Our favorite campgrounds” and
“Runner-up campgrounds,” later in this chapter).
When you pack, keep in mind that Big Sky Country attire is casual, and
you need to include garb for all kinds of weather. Rain gear is essential,
and so are hiking boots, jeans, jackets, and sweatshirts or sweaters. The
days can get hot with temperatures around Little Bighorn Battlefield
sometimes topping 100°F in summer, but during that same week, you
can drive over Beartooth Pass in below-freezing weather.
Many of the roads in Yellowstone National Park are rough and bumpy
because of winter freezes that buckle the pavement. Although roadwork
goes on constantly every summer, you may encounter gusts of dust (or
mud, if it’s been raining), traffic jams, and closed sections of roadway.
You also run into frequent traffic jams around sightings of bear, buffalo,
and elk. Allow twice as much time as you’d expect to negotiate
Yellowstone’s roads. You also find that many of the park’s turnoffs that

work well for travelers in automobiles don’t allow enough space for
motorhomes or vehicles towing trailers. For maximum efficiency, con-
sider leaving your RV in a campground and taking your own or a rental
car around the park.
In July and August, you may also consider skipping Yellowstone entirely
and cutting 200 miles out of the total itinerary. Doing so enables you to
spend more time in the wide-open spaces and less on bumpy, traffic-
clogged roads and in RV campgrounds that sometimes resemble urban
parking lots, only more crowded.
For the entire drive, including Yellowstone, allow two weeks.
Stocking the Pantry
Plan ahead for grocery shopping because supermarkets, like restaurants,
are few and far between in the wild, wild West. Billings, the largest city
on the drive, is a good place to stock up. The reliable Safeway supermar-
ket chain can be found in many towns in Montana and Wyoming. Buttrey
Fresh Foods also can be found in Cody, at 1526 Rumsey St., and in other
communities.
Buffalo is a favorite Montana and Wyoming meat; it comes fresh or
smoked in just about every form that you find beef — as steaks, ground
meat, jerky, and sausages.
In Buffalo, Wyoming, DJ’s Thriftway at 895 W. Fort St., also known as
Highway 16, has an adequate selection of bakery items, deli items, gro-
ceries, and liquors, and accepts all major credit cards. Most commercial
campgrounds have a small store with a basic stock of supplies.
Driving Buffalo Bill’s Montana and Wyoming
Before setting out from Billings, take a look around town and then head
to a unique landmark, 28 miles east of town on I-94, called Pompey’s
Pillar (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). The
Lewis and Clark expedition passed this spot in 1806, and William Clark
paused to carve his name in this sandstone tower that later acquired
other 19th-century graffiti left by fur trappers, missionaries, soldiers,
and settlers on their way West.
From Billings, head west on I-90, which is also U.S. 212, driving 18 miles
to Exit 434 at Laurel, and continue to follow U.S. 212 southwest to Red
Lodge. The pretty town of Red Lodge is a good place to take a rest
break; from here to Yellowstone, the next 61 miles are difficult to drive
but spectacular to see.
The Beartooth Highway (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chap-
ter) is usually open from the end of May or beginning of June, when the
Part V: Seeing the West 
294

snowmelt is sufficient for crews to clear the road, until early to mid-
October, when the snowfall begins again in earnest. The switchback
twists and turns as it climbs out of Red Lodge at 5,555 feet to the summit
of Beartooth Pass at 10,940 feet and then winds downhill to Cooke City,
elevation 7,651 feet, near the entrance to Yellowstone.
In Cooke City, the white-knuckled RVer can stop for a break or forge on to
Yellowstone National Park (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chap-
ter). In Yellowstone, a figure-8 loop road enables you to see the major
highlights — from Tower-Roosevelt to Mammoth Hot Springs, south to
Old Faithful, around West Thumb to Fishing Bridge, and north again 
to Tower Junction — in a 141-mile circuit. If you’ve already visited
Yellowstone and don’t relish the idea of crawling along in a July or August
traffic jam, you can turn southeast on SR 296 to Cody, Wyoming, before
you get to Cooke City. Doing so cuts about 200 miles off the route, allow-
ing you more time for the uncrowded parts of Montana and Wyoming.
The Chief Joseph Highway (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this
chapter), SR 296, runs 46 miles between the Beartooth Highway and SR
Chapter 21: Montana and Wyoming: Tracking Buffalo Bill 295
Buffalo Bill: An American myth
William F. Cody was born in a log cabin in Iowa, signed on as a bullwhacker driving
teams of oxen for 50¢ a day when he was 11 and by age 14 was the youngest Pony
Express rider ever hired. During the Civil War, too young to be a soldier, he volunteered
as a scout, ranger, and messenger with the 7th Kansas Cavalry on the Union side. His
nickname Buffalo Bill came in the late 1860s when he was hired to kill buffalo to feed
workmen building the Kansas Pacific Railroad.
But Buffalo Bill turned out to be bigger than life, thanks to dime novelist Ned Buntline,
who told heroic stories about him in cheap paperbacks during the 1870s and 1880s.
Cody cashed in on the publicity and created a successful touring show about the Old
West with cowboys and Indians, roping and shooting, and stagecoach races around
the ring.
The Buffalo Bill Wild West Show toured America and Europe for 30 years at the end
of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th; Queen Victoria wrote in her diary
that she loved it. (She saw it twice.) The show starred at times such diverse Western
characters as crack shot Annie Oakley, Buck Taylor (“King of the Cowboys”), and
Chief Sitting Bull, who was paid $50 a week and all of his favorite dish (oyster stew)
that he could eat.
City fathers of a newly developing town near Yellowstone in western Wyoming per-
suaded Cody to head up their company because he was “the best-advertised man in
the world.” He agreed, but with the stipulation that they name the town after him. Cody
built a luxury hotel in his namesake town and called it Hotel Irma after his daughter.
He moved to Cody after the Wild West show folded in 1913. He died during a visit to his
sister in Denver, where he was buried in 1917.

120 into Cody. Although paving was completed several years ago, this
wonderfully scenic roadway still is uncrowded, and numerous forest
service campgrounds, some of them large enough for big RVs, are
spread out along the way.
Cody is the city most associated with Buffalo Bill because it’s where he
spent some of his last years. The immense museum of Western history
called the Buffalo Bill Center is the town’s most outstanding sight (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
From Cody, drive 47 miles east on U.S. 14 to Greybull, and then drop
south to Worland on U.S. 16, where a wood carving by Peter Toth called
Trail of the Whispering Giants adorns the courthouse lawn. The Hungarian
sculptor created 50 Native American–style carvings between 1972 and
1988, donating one to each state.
The route from Worland continues east, still on U.S. 16, to Ten Sleep, a
town named for the way local tribes measured the distance between
places by how many nights of sleep, along with days of riding, it took to
travel between them.
From Ten Sleep, the next 69 miles takes you over the Powder River Pass to
the town of Buffalo, named not for the bison that used to congregate in
this area but for the town of Buffalo, New York. As the story goes, five set-
tlers dropped names into a hat and the winner was a man from Buffalo.
The town is worth a visit of several days if you have the time.
The Buffalo KOA (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter)
has a superluxury site that you can rent by the night with its own private
hot tub, fenced patio, gazebo, and propane grill.
Take a walk along Main Street for a look at some charming antiques
shops, small cafes, and a drugstore with an old-fashioned soda fountain.
At the intersection of Main and Angus streets, notice the two wrought-
iron Western sculptures commemorating the 1892 Johnson County War,
a skirmish between big ranchers who wanted to keep the range open
and small ranchers and farmers who wanted to fence their lands. One is
called Ridin’ for the Brand; the other, Living on the Edge.
From Buffalo, drive north on I-25 to the junction with I-90 and continue
to Sheridan, where Buffalo Bill owned the Sheridan Inn. (See “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter, for more on the inn.)
From Sheridan, I-90 zips north back across the Montana border, where, in
about 50 miles, you find Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument
(see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter), commemorating a hot
June day in 1876, when Sitting Bull and other great chiefs, joined by a
force of some 1,500 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, wiped out the 210
troopers of General George Custer in less than an hour while two other
battalions of the U.S. Cavalry 7th Regiment were on a distant ridge. From
the battlefield, drive 50 miles back to Billings on I-90 to complete the tour.

Must-see attractions
Beartooth Highway
Red Lodge, Montana
To drive over the 10,947-foot Beartooth Pass is one of America’s great thrill
rides, especially for an RVer. Even the curves have names like “Mae West”
and “Frozen Man.” Have your cameras ready for once-in-a-lifetime views
and be prepared for some roadside snow play.
In marginal weather and at the fringes of the late May to early October
season, check the road conditions before setting out by calling the U.S.
Forest Service office in Red Lodge (% 406-446-2103). After you hit the
road, tackle the switchbacks with caution, especially when you’re towing
a vehicle. Most turnouts along the way are big enough for any RV, so if your
courage fails, you can always turn around and go back. The alternate route
to Yellowstone from Red Lodge is to return to I-90 and travel east to
Livingston and then south on U.S. 89 to Gardiner and the north entrance
to the park near Mammoth Hot Springs.
U.S. 212 between Red Lodge and the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National
Park, a distance of 68 miles. % 406-446-2103 for road conditions. www.beartooth
highway.com. Road open from late May or early June until early to mid-Oct,
depending on local snow conditions. Driving time is 3 hours.
Buffalo Bill Center
Cody, Wyoming
In the middle of Cody, five world-class museums are gathered in one
sprawling complex that many call “the Smithsonian of the West.” The
Buffalo Bill Museum is particularly lively with posters from his shows,
furniture, jewelry, and gifts that European royalty presented to him.
The Plains Indian Museum is magnificent with life-size figures in various
ceremonial dress. Filling the exhibit areas are cradleboards, painted buf-
falo robes, medicine blankets, pipe bags for carrying ceremonial pipes,
grizzly-bear-claw necklaces, and ceremonial dresses used in the religious
Ghost Dances of the 1890s.
The Whitney Gallery of Western Art, named for New York sculptor
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, displays a replica studio of artist Frederic
Remington and the original studio of Western illustrator W. H. D. Koerner,
along with major Western works. The H. Peter and Jeannette Kriendler
Gallery of Contemporary Western Art celebrates today’s artists.
The Cody Firearms Museum, one of the world’s largest, and certainly the
most detailed of its kind, includes an engraved gun that belonged to Annie
Oakley, one of the stars of the Wild West show.
The brand-new Draper Museum of Natural History is an interactive walk-
through of Yellowstone National Park’s geology, including a path display-
ing slabs from different geologic ages and exhibits about current issues,
such as the reintroduction of wolves into the environment.

Chief Joseph Highway
Cody, Wyoming
The Chief Joseph Highway, SR 296, was a favorite of intrepid travelers who
didn’t mind the gravel roadway. But now, this scenic route is completely
paved, lightly traveled, and breathtakingly beautiful. Running 46 miles
between the turnoff from Beartooth Highway (U.S. 212) to SR 120, 17 miles
northwest of Cody, the Chief Joseph is named for the Nez Perce chief who
led his tribe through this area in 1877 while fleeing the U.S. Army. The route
follows William Clark’s Fork of the Yellowstone River for the first part of the
journey and then turns into a corkscrew of switchbacks as it climbs to
Wyoming’s highest bridge, 8,060 feet, at Dead Indian Summit. This con-
struction, finished in 1995, completed Wyoming’s goal to pave all its state
highways. Allow two hours.

Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum
Buffalo, Wyoming
With 15,000 artifacts arranged in two adjacent buildings, this museum
offers the real story of the Wyoming range wars and the Indian wars set out
in miniature dioramas. Gatchell was a druggist who collected historical
artifacts from the day he opened his drugstore in 1900. Among the collec-
tions are dolls, firearms, Crow and Cheyenne beaded deerskin garments,
buffalo and horsehide winter coats, and homemade knives confiscated
from prisoners in the Johnson County Jail. Allow two hours.

Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument
Crow Agency, Montana
The famous battle lasted less than an hour on June 25, 1876, when a force
of some 5,000 Sioux and Cheyenne warriors under the leadership of Sitting
Bull and other great chiefs wiped out Custer’s troops while two other 
Part V: Seeing the West 
298

battalions of the 7th Cavalry waited on a distant ridge for word to join
Custer. The handsome, cocky Custer, underestimating the Plains Indian
forces, had rashly decided to divide his 600 troops into thirds to create a
pincers action and then attacked without waiting for the others.
From a visitor center, you walk uphill to a fenced cemetery with tomb-
stones that document the soldiers’ names, insofar as they were known,
and where the men were believed to have fallen. Although accounts vary,
estimates put the number of Indian casualties at 150.
Signs on the site caution visitors wandering around the battlefield to watch
out for rattlesnakes.
Allow two hours.

Yellowstone National Park
Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming
Glorious, awe-inspiring, sometimes infuriating, Yellowstone National Park
has more attractions to offer a visitor than almost any other park in the
country, but sometimes, finding them is difficult. During the past decade,
we visited almost every year in differing seasons, trying to determine the
one that’s best, and we have thrown up our hands in defeat. In July and
August, the roads are so bad and so full of traffic — yes, RVs are among the
worst culprits — that we want to turn around and head out, back to less-
crowded highways and friendlier campgrounds. The big burns — entire hill-
sides of dead trees for miles and miles — are depressing to look at and slow
to return to life. Early autumn may bring drizzly days without diminishing
the crowds; springtime often is muddy, making the already-bad roads
worse. And more than three million visitors a year keep passing through.
Since an earthquake threw off its rhythm a few years ago, Old Faithful has
turned into Old Faithless, and you may have to wait anywhere from 50 to
100 minutes to catch the famous geyser act. You can do better, if time is
limited, by driving through the geothermal areas keeping your eyes open
for eruptions. Steamboat, in the Norris Geyser Basin at Norris, is the
tallest geyser but rarely shows off for visitors. Nearby Echinus is more reli-
able, spouting off about once an hour. (For the locations of these attrac-
tions, see the “Yellowstone National Park” map in this chapter.)
Mammoth Hot Springs is the place to see Technicolor terraces of colored
limestone boiling up from the earth and numerous animals on cold days;
large elk congregate around Mammoth where it’s warm. Grand Canyon of
the Yellowstone has plenty of RV parking at a large lot at the trail head
and a short walk to a dramatic viewpoint. Lamar Valley offers good, if dis-
tant, animal spotting for herds of buffalo; we’ve shot good close-ups during

Chapter 21: Montana and Wyoming: Tracking Buffalo Bill 301

the fringe seasons at Sylvan Lake on the east entrance road and along the
Firehole River at Lower Geyser Basin. Bears are a long shot; you may
glimpse one along the highway, but sightings are much rarer than they
used to be because rangers now discourage the furry freeloaders and
those who feed them.
Never approach a wild animal on foot. Do not leave your vehicle when you
see one. You can be maimed or killed. Be cautious in thermal areas. Never
step off designated walkways or boardwalks onto the fragile crust.
Northwestern corner of Wyoming with a few acres in the eastern edges of Idaho
and Montana. % 307-344-2117 for road information and general information; % 307-
344-7311 for lodging, dining, and camping reservations. www.travelyellowstone.
com. RV parking: Some designated RV parking in populated and commercial areas;
12 campgrounds with RV camping; some but not all turnouts along the roadways
large enough for RVs. Admission: $20 a car, $10 for hikers and bicyclists, $15 for
motorcyclists. Seniors with the new National Parks and Federal Recreation
Lands–Senior Pass are free. Open: Year-round. Road access all year from the north
entrance, U.S. 89 at Gardiner, Montana; other park entrances open on seasonal basis,
usually closed Nov–May.
More cool things to see and do
Montana and Wyoming are full of fascinating sights, activities, and out-
door pursuits. See the following list for some of our favorites; you’ll find
many more on your driving tour.
 Ride the trail. Buffalo Bill’s Trail Rides, 5561 Greybull Hwy., 
Cody, Wyoming (% 307-587-2369), set out from the Cody KOA
Campground (see “Runner-up campgrounds,” later in this chapter)
daily from June through September. Reservations are advised.
Allow half a day.
 Shoot the gunslingers. Bring a camera, because the photogenic
Cody Gunslingers congregate and shoot it out in and around the
Irma Hotel, Sheridan and 12th streets, Cody, Wyoming (% 307-587-
4221). Allow one hour.
Admission is free. The shootouts are held from Memorial Day
through Labor Day Monday through Saturday at 6 p.m.
 Greet a grizzly. The closest you can safely get to a grizzly bear is 
at the Grizzly Discovery Center, Grizzly Park near the west entrance
to Yellowstone National Park in West Yellowstone, Montana (% 800-
257-2570 or 406-646-7001; www.grizzlydiscoverycenter.org).
Here, in a natural habitat, a nonprofit center takes care of bad-boy
bears from Canada and Alaska, like Toby and Fred and Max and
Lewie, and a resident wolf pack. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $9.75 adults,
$9 seniors, $5 ages 5 to 12. It’s open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Shoot it out at high noon. The first classic Western confrontation
or “walk down” is in the pages of Owen Wister’s novel The Virginian
Part V: Seeing the West 
302

and is said to have been in front of the Occidental Hotel, 10 Main
St., Buffalo, Wyoming (% 307-684-0451; www.occidentalwyoming.
com). The hotel was constructed of logs in 1878 and finished in
1880, and still welcomes day visitors and overnight guests. In 2007,
they were named “Best Hotel in the West” for the second time by
True West magazine. Allow ten minutes for a visit to the hotel,
longer for food and drink.
RV parking is available on the street parking or in a free city lot at
the corner of Main and Fort streets. Admission is free, and drinks
are sold. The Virginian Restaurant (% 307-684-5976) is open for
dinner Monday through Saturday from noon to 9 p.m.; it’s open for
breakfast Monday through Saturday from 7–11 a.m. and on Sunday
from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.; the Saloon (% 307-684-8989) is open from
11 a.m. to closing in the summer, and 5 p.m. to closing in winter.
 Do the touristy thing. The big, loopy handwriting still is clear
behind the framed section of the sandstone pillar: “W Clark, July
25, 1806.” William Clark of Lewis and Clark fame couldn’t resist
leaving his name and the date of his visit carved on Pompey’s
Pillar (% 406-875-2400; www.pompeyspillar.org), a 700-foot
sandstone plug sticking up from the flats along the Yellowstone
River east of Billings, Montana. A wooden staircase with handrails
leads up 500 steps to the top of the pillar. Allow one hour.
Pompey’s Pillar National Historic Landmark is 28 miles east of
Billings, Montana, on I-90 at Exit 23; follow the signs. RV parking is
available in a large lot by the visitor center. Admission is free, but
there is a $7 parking fee. It’s open daily from Memorial Day through
Labor Day 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Labor Day through September 30 from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Set ’em up, Bill. . . . Established in 1893 and a National Historic
Landmark, Sheridan Inn, 858 Broadway, Sheridan, Wyoming 
(% 307-674-5440; Sheridan Convention & Visitors Bureau % 800-
453-3650; www.sheridaninn.com), once was owned and run by
Buffalo Bill, and still boasts the Buffalo Bill Cody Saloon with its
original bar. Today, the many-dormered hotel takes no overnight
guests but is open as a museum, restaurant (% 307-673-4700; open
11 a.m.–9 p.m.), and gift shop.
RV parking is available on the street or in a designated lot.
 Brave Butch Cassidy. Historic buildings from all across Wyoming
are set up in Old Trail Town, 1831 Demaris Dr., at the edge of Cody,
Wyoming (% 307-587-5302; www.nezperce.com/trltown.html),
in a photogenic Western setting. Mountain man Jeremiah Johnson’s
grave is in the cemetery, and outlaw hideout cabins, such as the
Sundance Kid’s Mud Spring Cabin and Butch Cassidy’s Hole in the
Wall Gang Cabin, are fun to look into.
RV parking is available in a large lot. Admission is $7 adults, $6 sen-
iors, $3 ages 6 to 12, free ages 5 and younger. It’s open daily mid-
May through mid-September from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Chapter 21: Montana and Wyoming: Tracking Buffalo Bill 303

Weekend wonder
Buffalo Bill country is a little distant for a weekend stopover for most
people, but if you’re in the vicinity in summer and have a yen to see 
the best part in a couple of days, plan a driving tour from Billings to 
Red Lodge, Montana, over the Beartooth Highway to the Chief Joseph
Highway and into Cody, Wyoming. In Cody, spend all your spare time at
the Buffalo Bill Center quintet of museums. Stay at the Cody KOA and
you can take a trail ride right from the campground.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
Montana and Wyoming are RV-friendly states with plenty of public and
privately owned campgrounds; good, lightly traveled roads (except
those in Yellowstone National Park); and wide-open spaces. Although
state parks and national forest campgrounds don’t usually offer RV
hookups, the scenery is so great and the vistas so wide that staying a
day or two is worth the hassle of not having a hookup.
All campgrounds listed in this chapter are open year-round and have
public flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless desig-
nated otherwise. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations
only. For Yellowstone National Park campgrounds (except Fishing Bridge
RV Park), see this chapter’s sidebar “Camping in Yellowstone National
Park.” See Chapter 9 for detailed information on how we choose our
favorite campgrounds.
Our favorite campgrounds
Billings KOA
$$$–$$$$$
Billings, Montana
The Billings KOA is the world’s first KOA campground, and Montana and
Wyoming still claim 37 KOAs between them. This granddaddy of them all
offers shady sites, some with gravel but most with grass. You can choose
a spot on the Yellowstone River with freshwater fishing, trees, grass, and
long pull-throughs with patios. When you don’t feel like cooking, you can
buy breakfast and evening BBQ dinners at the campground in summer.
547 Garden Ave. (From I-90 at 27th Street, Exit 450, go east 200 yds. to Garden Avenue,
turn right and follow signs to second campground on the left.) % 800-562-8546 or 406-
252-3104. www.koa.com/where/mt/26104/. Total of 95 sites with water and 30-
and 50-amp electric, 40 full hookups, 80 pull-throughs. CATV, dataport, handicap access,
laundry, pool/spa, Wi-Fi. Rates: $22–$65 per site. AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Apr 15–Oct 15.
Buffalo Bill State Park
$
Cody, Wyoming
Two campgrounds belong to Buffalo Bill State Park — the North Shore
Bay, 9 miles west of Cody on U.S. 14/16/20, and North Fork, 14 miles west
on the same highway. You find no hookups and narrow sites, but the areas
Part V: Seeing the West 
304

Camping in Yellowstone National Park
Pay special attention if you want to book a campsite in Yellowstone National Park.
Here’s how it goes: Yellowstone has 12 campgrounds suitable for RVs (depending on
size). Five of them have sites that you can reserve in advance by contacting Xanterra
Parks and Resorts (% 307-344-7311; www.xanterra.com). Of those five, only one
has hookups — the Fishing Bridge RV Park, with 346 parking-lot-type spaces for $36
a night, is open mid-May to early October. If you’ve come to experience the great out-
doors with plenty of peace and quiet and birdsong, this campground may not be the
place for you. And if your RV is soft-sided, like a folding camping trailer, or has any
canvas on its body instead of metal, you won’t be permitted to camp because this is
bear country. But if you want a convenient and easy location in the park with a hookup,
don’t mind crowds, and know the date that you want to stay, then you need to make
a reservation here well ahead of time (see “Runner-up campgrounds”).
The other four campgrounds that can be reserved in advance, like Fishing Bridge, also
are in heavily used areas. If you have a reservation date near the campgrounds’ open-
ing or closing dates, check again before your arrival to make sure that the facilities are
open; bad weather can cause late openings or early closings. These campgrounds
are usually just as crowded as Fishing Bridge but without the convenience of hookups.
Generator use is limited. All sites are back-ins (meaning you have to back your rig into
the site).
The campgrounds listed below charge $18 a night per site, have a 14-day limit, and
accept credit cards (DISC, MC, V). For reservations, call % 307-344-7311.
 Bridge Bay: On Yellowstone Lake not far from Fishing Bridge. 432 narrow, paved
campsites, marina. Open late May to mid-September.
 Canyon Village: In Canyon Village near the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. 272
narrow, grassy sites (no slideouts permitted). Open early June to mid-September.

 Madison: On the Madison River 14 miles from the west entrance. 277 paved,
narrow (12 feet wide) campsites and no showers. Open early May to late October.
The park service operates seven other campgrounds in Yellowstone National Park
that accept no reservations (www.nps.gov/yell/pphtml/camping.html).
Camping is on a first-come, first-served basis and limited to 14 days. Generator use is
limited. Except for Mammoth Hot Springs, these campgrounds are in less-traveled
areas of the park. Note the vehicle size restrictions for each.
 Indian Creek: On the Grand Loop Road about halfway between Mammoth Hot
Springs and Norris Geyser Basin. 75 narrow paved sites, 12 feet wide, maximum
length of 28 feet. $12 a night per site, cash only. Open mid-June to mid-September.

entrance on U.S. 89. 85 narrow paved sites, 12 feet wide, maximum length of 35
feet, no flush toilets, no showers. $12 a night per site, cash only. Open mid-June
to early November.

L
and of Enchantment is the longtime license plate slogan for New
Mexico, and the magic is everywhere. Red rock canyons and mesas
abut hazy blue hills, which, in turn, stand out against snowcapped peaks
topping 10,000 feet. Ristras, strings of dried red chile peppers, hang from
the eaves of adobe houses, and silver-and-turquoise jewelry twinkles
from the windows of battered trading posts. Ancient cliff dwellings rest
within sheltered rocky overhangs, Native Americans invoke the spirits of
the past with traditional dances, and golden aspen leaves quiver in the
first cold puffs of winter wind.
The first inhabitants arrived around 25,000 years ago. The Southwest is
where, in the late 19th century, a slight, cocky Brooklyn-born boy nick-
named “the Kid,” and later, Billy the Kid, entered legend, and here too,
some believe that aliens crashed their ship in the middle of the 20th
century. A real bear cub that survived a Lincoln County forest fire in
1950 entered America’s annals as Smokey Bear, the animated animal on
everybody’s black-and-white TV sets who growled, “Only you can pre-
vent forest fires.” Five years earlier, the world’s first nuclear test at
Trinity Site broke windows 120 miles away in Silver City, the town where
Billy the Kid grew up.
Getting There
El Paso, Texas, makes an ideal jumping-off point for southern New
Mexico. Our route follows the Rio Grande north, paralleling I-25 on rural
roads that bisect pecan groves and chile fields to Hatch, some 65 miles
away, and then turns west, following SR 26 and then U.S. 180 to Silver
City another 100 miles. Return south on U.S. 180 to I-10, east to Las

Cruces, and then along I-70 past White Sands National Monument to
Alamogordo, another 168 miles. Continue east to Roswell and then north
to Fort Sumner, a total of 200 miles. Drive east on U.S. 60 to Clovis, and
then south via I-70 back to Roswell, 168 miles total. Some 77 miles south
are Carlsbad Caverns, and another 165 miles along U.S. 62 returns you to
El Paso. The total drive is 943 miles. (See the “New Mexico” map in this
chapter for the route.) For a shorter loop that covers many of the high-
lights, see “Weekend wonder” later in this chapter.
Planning Ahead
Spring and fall are the best seasons to visit New Mexico. Winter brings
snow to higher elevations like Silver City in the Southwest, although the
deserts around Carlsbad in the southeast usually are mild. Summer heat
sizzles the terrain surrounding Carlsbad Caverns, but the temperature
below ground stays at 56°F — a real treat. Even in winter, most days are
sunny. The southern part of the state claims to get 300 days of sunshine
a year. The mountains around Cloudcroft get 25 inches of rain a year,
while the city of Las Cruces, less than 100 miles away, gets only 8 inches.
Expect to see a torrential late afternoon thunderstorm or two in July and
August, and never camp in a dry riverbed because of the potential danger
from flash floods.
Although campground reservations are a good idea, they’re not essen-
tial in many parts of southern New Mexico, especially after summer has
gone. If you want to make reservations, you can do so at a commercial
RV park near one of the major attractions. State parks, such as City of
Rocks, don’t accept reservations.
When packing, take along sweaters and jackets no matter when you visit
because summer nights are cool — even in the desert — and Carlsbad
Caverns is a constant 56°F. Winter days, even in ski resorts, are cold but
usually dry and clear. Bring plenty of sunscreen because the rays can
reach your skin instantly through the clear air.
Allow 7 to 14 days to drive this itinerary with time for hiking and explor-
ing Carlsbad Caverns.
Stocking the Pantry
The first day of the drive from El Paso takes you past several notable
tortilla factories and through the town of Hatch, famous for its chile
products. We like the Little Diner and Tortilla Factory in Canutillo,
Texas, north of El Paso, where you can take away both thick and thin
homemade corn tortillas. Local and national supermarket chains in 
El Paso and throughout New Mexico usually stock both red and green
versions of Hatch-brand enchilada sauces, which come in various
strengths from mild to very hot.
Chapter 22: New Mexico: Billy the Kid Meets E.T. 313

Driving Southern New Mexico
Leave El Paso on I-10 and take Exit 6 to SR 28, which wends past pecan
orchards and chile fields. The same Rio Grande River that separates El
Paso, Texas, from Juarez, Mexico, also irrigates the valley that carries its
name. A dozen varieties of chilies are grown in and around Hatch, and
harvested in early September, when the air is heavy with the smell of
roasting peppers. Local farmers roast the chilies and freeze them, so
they always have plenty for cooking.
The most famous chile restaurant in this part of the valley is Chope’s in
La Mesa (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter), favored by the local
chile growers for chiles rellenos, fresh green chilies filled with cheese,
dipped in egg batter, and fried. The blue-corn version of tortillas, which
used to be unique to New Mexico, also is served. Look for produce
stands selling local chilies, tomatoes, pecans, and melons in season.
Mesilla, the next town north from La Mesa on SR 28, is a must-stop desti-
nation, especially for first-time visitors to New Mexico who can see in
one small town all the details — a plaza, a mission-style church, and an
abundance of adobe shops and restaurants — that go into creating such
superstar tourist meccas as Santa Fe and Taos.
From Mesilla, continue north to Hatch; between here and Canutillo to the
south, farmers grow most of New Mexico’s chilies. This state, where the
chile is the official state vegetable, leads all the rest in production of the
spicy pods. From Hatch, turn southwest on SR 26, and then north on U.S.
180, to Silver City. (An alternative, if you’re driving a small RV and/or the
season is summer, when there’s little chance of snow on the roadway, is to
continue north on I-25 to Caballo and turn west on SR 152 at Exit 63 for a
hilly, scenic, 86-mile drive into Silver City. This route doesn’t repeat the
drive along U.S. 180 between Silver City and Deming on the way out.)
Silver City commemorates the youthful Billy the Kid, born as Henry
McCarty but later known as Henry Antrim (he took the surname of his
mother’s second husband after she died of tuberculosis). Her grave can
be found at 21 Cypress Lane by the ninth tree from the entrance of the
local cemetery on Memory Lane. A year later, the 15-year-old Kid had his
first arrest for stealing clothes from a Chinese laundry. He was locked
up, but he broke out of jail during the night by climbing up a chimney.
He ran away to Arizona, severing his ties with Silver City forever.
One of our favorite state parks is City of Rocks, an eerie collection of
gigantic boulders with campsites hidden in, around, between, and under
the rocks. The nearby town of Deming, reached by following U.S. 180 
to I-10, is home of the Luna Membres Museum, with a fine collection of
distinctive local black-and-white Indian pottery (see “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter).
From Deming, make the fast trip across I-10 to Las Cruces, where you
join I-25 north and then turn off on U.S. 70 at Exit 6. About 50 miles up

the road is the entrance to White Sands National Monument, the
world’s largest gypsum dunes field, an improbable 275 square miles of
sugar-white sand as fine and soft as powder (see “Must-see attractions,”
later in this chapter).
Alamogordo, with its International Space Hall of Fame, is 10 miles or
so up the road from White Sands National Monument (see the New
Mexico Museum of Space History under “Must-see attractions,” later in
this chapter). It’s hard to imagine that more than a century ago, this
infant town set out as a planned city to attract eastern socialites with
plenty of money and culture. When that plan fizzled, Alamogordo —
described by one local writer as “miles and miles of nothing but miles
and miles” — slept until the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor plunged
America into war. Then all that emptiness was turned into a bombing
and gunnery range, training British and American heavy-bomber crews.
Today, you find a missile range, space museum, and Air Force base.
Ski areas, lavish resorts, golf courses, racetracks, petroglyphs, and
museums clustered within a triangle-shaped area north of Alamogordo
could fill a month-long holiday almost any season of the year — if you’re
willing to zigzag back and forth to get there. Cloudcroft, as cool and
romantic a four-seasons town as it sounds, is 19 miles northeast of
Alamogordo on U.S. 82 (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in
this chapter).
Follow U.S. 54 north from Alamogordo for 30 miles to find Three Rivers
Petroglyph Site (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chap-
ter). On U.S. 70, east from Tularosa, you pass Inn of the Mountain Gods,
a lavish resort and casino that Mescalero Apaches own and operate on
their reservation. The parking lot is big enough for RVs, so you can stop
and look around, and perhaps have lunch and a whirl in the casino.
Continue east on U.S. 70 to Ruidoso and Ruidoso Downs, home of the

The Trinity Site: Testing 
the first atomic bomb
Due north of the White Sands National Monument, on the White Sands Missile Range,
about 50 miles as the crow flies, is the Trinity Site. This closely guarded area is where
the world’s first nuclear bomb was tested on July 16, 1945. A stone memorial stands
at Ground Zero, where the force of the blast melted the dirt in the area into a strange
green glassy substance called Trinitite.
The site is open to the public only two days a year: the first Saturdays of April and
October, when tours are conducted from Alamogordo. Cars line up in single file with
headlights on and proceed behind a military escort to Ground Zero. You also can visit
the ranch house where the bomb was assembled. Some radiation remains at the site.

The Lincoln County War
In 1878, the paths of five tough-minded men crossed, and their differences erupted
into bloodshed. When the Lincoln County War, as locals called it, was over, many men
were dead, and the reputation of one minor-league gunslinger grew into the icon of
Billy the Kid. In 1877, the courthouse was the Murphy-Dolan Store, sole recipient of
lucrative government supply contracts to provide beef and other supplies for nearby
Fort Stanton and the Mescalero Apache Reservation to the south. Murphy was smart-
ing under a charge of cattle rustling from a local land baron named Chisum when two
newcomers, a Kansas lawyer named Alexander McSween and a young English adven-
turer named John Tunstall, opened a rival store down the street. Murphy figured
Chisum had helped fund the new store.
Matters came to a head early in 1878 when Sheriff Brady dispatched a posse to take
over Tunstall’s ranch, claiming that the Englishman’s partner McSween owed Murphy
money. In the ensuing argument, Tunstall was shot and killed, and that might have
ended the trouble then and there if Tunstall hadn’t previously befriended and hired an
18-year-old cowboy calling himself William H. Bonney. Bonney — the new name taken
by Henry Antrim, also known as Billy the Kid — swore to avenge his friend’s death.
The Murphy-Dolan team had Sheriff Brady and his deputies on its side. Billy the Kid and
his “Regulators” had Dick Brewer, the newly appointed Lincoln County constable and
former foreman for the Tunstall Ranch on their side. Brewer “deputized” Billy the Kid
and some of his friends, and within days they had captured and shot two of Sheriff
Brady’s posse. On April 1, Billy and his Regulators crouched in ambush by the Tunstall
Store as Brady and his deputies walked toward the Wortley Hotel. Shots rang out,
Brady fell into the street, and the deputies ran for cover.
In mid-July, after a shootout at the Chisum Ranch, Billy and his men took refuge in the
McSween home, next door to the Tunstall Store. The Murphy-Dolan faction sur-
rounded the house and fired into it from a vantage point atop a small hill. At dusk on
July 19, they set fire to the house. Billy the Kid and several others made a successful
dash for freedom and escaped into the underbrush.
After three years on the loose, Billy the Kid was accused of the murder of Sheriff Brady
(the Kid was the only member of either Lincoln County War faction ever to go to trial),
captured by Sheriff Pat Garrett and brought to Mesilla for trial, found guilty, and sen-
tenced to be hanged. He was removed to Lincoln County Jail but soon managed to
escape by overpowering and shooting the two deputies guarding him. A friend of Billy’s
helped him to sever the chain holding his leg shackles and brought him a horse that
belonged to the deputy clerk of the probate court. The Kid escaped and hid out in the
Fort Sumner area at ranches belonging to several different Hispanic families. In July
1881, Sheriff Garrett caught and shot the Kid in a darkened bedroom of one of the
houses.

and poised as if frozen in midair against a New Mexico meadow (see
“More cool things to see and do”). Ruidoso also is a good starting point
to drive the Billy the Kid National Scenic Byway (see “Must-see attrac-
tions,” later in this chapter).
Continue north to U.S. 380 — you can reach it via U.S. 54 north of
Alamogordo and then east at Carrizozo — to find more Billy the Kid
country, and Smokey Bear habitat. Smokey Bear Historical State Park in
Capitan houses the grave of Smokey, a longtime favorite resident at the
National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and every camper’s reminder to be
sure to put that campfire out before you leave a campsite (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter). From Capitan, continue driv-
ing east for 12 miles on U.S. 380 to Lincoln, where you need to plan to
spend some time exploring the area. Pick up a town map and guide at
the Lincoln County Heritage Trust Historical Museum. (For details on
Lincoln, see the listing for Billy the Kid National Scenic Byway under
“Must-see attractions” and the sidebar “The Lincoln County War.”)
Some 50 miles east of Lincoln is the city of Roswell, forever on the map
for an alleged UFO incident on or around July 4, 1947. Everything you
ever wanted to know about flying saucers and extraterrestrials is on dis-
play in the International UFO Museum & Research Center in downtown
Roswell (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Fifty-four miles up the road from Roswell is Fort Sumner, the last resting
place of Billy the Kid. The gravesite is on SR 212 some 3 miles east of the
present town of Fort Sumner. The tombstone was stolen twice, taken
once to Texas for 26 years and once to California for 2 years, but it’s now
securely shackled at the site. Adjacent to the grave is the Old Fort
Sumner Museum. The Billy the Kid Museum is near the junction of U.S.
60 and U.S. 84 in town. (See “More cool things to see and do” for info on
all these Kid sights.)
Take U.S. 60/84 for 57 miles east to Clovis, where Buddy Holly recorded
“That’ll Be the Day,” “Peggy Sue,” and “Maybe Baby” at the Norman Petty
Studio, and then continue south 19 miles on U.S. 70 to Portales, the
Valencia peanut capital of the United States. Another 92 miles driving
southwest on U.S. 70 returns you to Roswell.
From Roswell, drive south on U.S. 285 to Carlsbad, the site of Carlsbad
Caverns National Park, one of the world’s largest cave systems, and the
Living Desert State Park, a wonderful collection of Chihuahua Desert
animals, plants, and reptiles. (See “Must-see attractions,” later in this
chapter, for details on both parks.)
From Carlsbad, the quickest route back to El Paso is a 165-mile straight
shot down U.S. 60/120 past Guadalupe Mountains National Park, domi-
nated by 8,749-foot Guadalupe Peak, the tallest mountain in Texas.

Billy the Kid National Scenic Byway
Lincoln County, New Mexico
An official highway route proceeds along the Billy the Kid trail, starting
from the new Billy the Kid Interpretive Center and adjacent museum with
its scaled-down walk-through version of the byway on U.S. 70 in Ruidoso
Downs. The route seems guilty of lassoing and roping in items that have
even the faintest of connections with the Western icon, so use your
common sense to disconnect the tourist come-on from historic reality.
(For example, Ruidoso Downs also boasts the Billy the Kid Casino with 300
electronic slot machines. Are you Kidding us?) Allow one hour.
The 69-mile trail (90 minutes driving time if you don’t stop anywhere) goes
west on U.S. 70 and north on SR 48 to Ruidoso, where the Old Mill Gift &
Book Shop on Suddarth Drive claims to be a Billy the Kid Hideout.
Actually, the Kid reputedly hid in a flour barrel here to escape armed pur-
suers, so naturally today, the shop sells souvenir bags of flour. From
Ruidoso, SR 48 continues north to U.S. 380 and Capitan (Smokey Bear
headquarters), dips south to Fort Stanton on SR 220, and then continues
east along U.S. 380 to Lincoln, which is the key to the most historic part
of the Kid’s life, the Lincoln County War. (See this chapter’s sidebar “The
Lincoln County War.”)
The whole town of Lincoln is a National Historic Landmark and a State
Monument. Kids of all ages enjoy the Old West atmosphere. A self-guided
walking tour map of the town is available at the Lincoln County Heritage
Trust Historical Museum. Follow the trail from the museum to the Wortley
Hotel, the old courthouse across the street, the Tunstall Store, the site of
the Murphy-Dolan Store, and the site of the McSween House.

Carlsbad Caverns National Park
Carlsbad, New Mexico
Even card-carrying claustrophobics won’t mind going underground to tour
the spacious caverns of Carlsbad, unless the elevator ride from the visi-
tor center down 75 floors is too unnerving. The quick, self-guided tour
takes an hour (including the elevator ride down and back) and covers a lit
circular trail around a gigantic cavern, big enough to contain 14 football
fields. Highlights include Hall of Giants, Giant Dome, Lower Cave, and
Top of the Cross with its 255-foot ceiling. The Bottomless Pit gave us shiv-
ers, and so did a close encounter with a cluster of sleeping Mexican free-
tail bats. Most of the bats are far from the main tour routes with one
exception: Visitors can gather every summer evening at Bat Flight time in

International UFO Museum & Research Center
Roswell, New Mexico
The city of Roswell has a tongue-in-cheek attitude about its flying 
saucer fame. One city brochure is headlined, “Some of our most famous
visitors . . . came from out of state.”
The International UFO Museum & Research Center gets some 200,000 vis-
itors a year from around the world to see displays about the Roswell inci-
dent in 1947 (see the sidebar “UFOs: The Roswell incident”) and other
purported UFO sightings in New Mexico and elsewhere. A large gift shop
does a brisk sale in UFO souvenirs and T-shirts. A new museum is sched-
uled to open, located 8 blocks north of the present museum. Allow

The stars of the show at Living Desert are its birds and animals, all of them
native to the Chihuahua Desert, most of them brought here because of
injuries or illness and scheduled to be released back into the wild. Those
too ill or too old to return, such as a Mexican gray wolf, stay on. The wolf
spends most of his time napping atop a rocky ledge in the sun. The setting
is a hilltop covered with native cacti and other plants. A well-manicured
trail wends its way through the terrain — the design of the path brings sur-
prises at every turn. Kids have a chance to see the animals in a natural
environment. In the gift shop, you can buy small, native cactus plants in
pots.

UFOs: The Roswell incident
The International UFO Museum & Research Center (see “Must-see attractions,” in
this chapter), founded by key figures who were in Roswell and close to the events of
July 1947, has been open since 1991. Lt. Walter G. Haut, public relations director for
Roswell Army Air Field in 1947, wrote the first narrative of the events, which appeared
in the Roswell Daily Record of July 8, 1947. Glenn Dennis, an ambulance driver for the
Ballard Funeral Home in Roswell, was at the army base hospital on the night of the
alleged crash and was told by medical staff that at least five bodies of aliens had been
recovered from the crash site and brought into the hospital. But within a week, all sto-
ries of the crash were denied, all informants and witnesses hushed, and nothing else
was heard about it until 1978, when some writers started looking into the story again
and published one of the early books about Roswell in 1980. Haut and Dennis felt a
museum needed to be established in Roswell to give what information is available
about the alleged crash, and although Haut is convinced that aliens have visited Earth,
the museum simply presents the amassed information. (But we figure that if the
museum or the city of Roswell ever took the position that space aliens couldn’t possi-
bly have dropped in back in 1947, their tourist revenue would drop off considerably.)
Although the details of the event often are confusing or conflicting, it seems irrefutable
that something happened in Roswell in the summer of 1947. The truth is out there. . . .

ing at the moon” evenings.
The Dunes Drive goes 8 miles into the heart of the dunes, turns at a circle,
and then comes back out the same way. A picnic area, boardwalk, and two
hiking trails are reached from turnouts along the drive.
No one is allowed to drive across the dunes, but hiking is permitted. Be
aware that you can get lost easily, especially if a windstorm produces
whiteout. The powdery white sand blows easily and can penetrate your
RV even when doors and windows are closed.
Photographers need to visit at times other than midday when the high sun
flattens the terrain. Use a polarizer for best results.

More cool things to see and do
New Mexico is full of fascinating sights. What follows are more of our
favorites. In addition to these, you may also want to try your luck at the
Inn of the Mountain Gods Casino (% 800-545-9011 or 575-464-7777;
www.innofthemountaingods.com), east of Tularosa on U.S. 70.
 See the Kid’s grave. If you have the time and inclination to make the
long, arid drive up to Billy the Kid’s grave in Fort Sumner (Chamber
of Commerce % 575-355-7705; www.ftsumnerchamber.com), you
may appreciate how long it took the outlaw to reach this destination
on horseback. Take the time to poke around, although none of the
local museums are world-class. The Old Fort Sumner Museum
(% 575-355-2942) is adjacent to the gravesite and Fort Sumner
State Monument (% 575-355-2573), while the Billy the Kid Museum
(% 575-355-2380) is in town in Fort Sumner near the junction of U.S.
60 and U.S. 84. His tombstone is now securely set inside a fenced site
after being stolen twice. Allow one hour for the grave site and the
museum and one or more hours for the museum in town.
To get there, drive east on U.S. 60/84 3 miles from the town of Fort
Sumner, New Mexico, to SR 212, and then turn south and drive 4
miles to Fort Sumner State Monument. RV parking is available in a
large lot at the gravesite, adjacent to the Old Sumner Museum, and
in a smaller lot at the Billy the Kid Museum; street parking is also
available. Old Fort Sumner Museum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 
Part V: Seeing the West 
322

5 p.m.; admission is $3. The Billy the Kid Museum is open Monday
through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 
5 p.m.; admission is $5 adults, $4 seniors, $3 children 7 to 14.
 Take a walk in the clouds. The town of Cloudcroft (Chamber of
Commerce % 575-682-2733; www.cloudcroft.net), at an eleva-
tion of 9,200 feet and surrounded by 500,000 acres of Lincoln
National Forest, makes a cool, pretty spot for a morning or after-
noon pause if you tire of the hot valley climate. The Lodge, built in
1899, still welcomes visitors to its restaurant, and a ski slope, golf
course, and quaint Western-style boutiques provide distraction.
Be aware that snow in winter may require tire chains in this area;
check conditions before leaving the Alamogordo area.
From I-70, 2 miles north of Alamogordo, take U.S. 82 east 16 miles to
Cloudcroft, New Mexico. RV parking is available on the street.
 Appraise collectibles. On the way to or from Silver City, pause at
Deming’s Luna Mimbres Museum, 301 S. Silver St. (% 575-546-2382;
www.deminglunamimbresmuseum.com), housed in a 1917 brick
armory, to see some good examples of local black-and-white
Mimbreno pottery, one of the most elegant tribal collectibles. The
museum also is a starting point for a self-guided, historic walking
tour of the town; pick up a map at the museum. Allow one hour; add
an additional hour for the walking tour.
RV parking is plentiful on the street. Admission is by donation. The
museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Sunday from 1:30 to 4 p.m.
 Horse around. The nucleus of the Hubbard Museum of the
American West, off U.S. 70 East in Ruidoso Downs, 1 mile east of
the Ruidoso Downs Race Track (% 575-378-4142; www.hubbard
museum.org), is a much-loved 10,000-piece collection of horse 
artifacts collected by the late Anne C. Sterling, a New Jersey heiress
and aficionado. But the best reason to go, even if you don’t venture
inside, is to see the magnificent sculptures of eight running horses
in the outdoor monument. Allow one hour.
RV parking is available nearby in a small lot or on the street.
Admission is $6 adults; $5 seniors, military, and ages 5 to 17. It’s
open daily in the summer from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Drop the “the.” Repeat after me: There is no “the” in Smokey Bear. If
you didn’t know that, you’ll discover it right away at Smokey Bear
Historical State Park, 118 Smokey Bear Blvd., Capitan (% 575-354-
2748; www.emnrd.state.nm.us/fd/SmokeyBear/SmokeyBear
Park.htm). In May 1950, when firefighters found a badly singed 
bear cub clinging to a burnt pine tree near the town of Capitan, a car-
toon Smokey Bear in a ranger costume had already been informing
campers about the dangers of forest fires for five years. The young
black bear was named Smokey, and when his burns healed, he was
sent to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., where he was a favorite
Chapter 22: New Mexico: Billy the Kid Meets E.T. 323

of visitors. After Smokey died in 1976, he was returned to Capitan for
burial. Allow two hours.
RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $2 adults,
$1 ages 7 to 12. The park is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed
major holidays.
 Spy a petroglyph. At Three Rivers Petroglyph Site (Bureau of
Land Management offices % 575-525-4300; www.nm.blm.gov), 
you can see some 500 petroglyphs (images that have been scratched,
carved, or chiseled into a rock face). The pictures of people, animals,
fish, and reptiles were carved by the Mogollon people between 
A.D. 900 and A.D. 1400. A path wends for a mile through the hilltop
site. Allow two hours, more if you want to do additional hiking.
From U.S. 54 about 30 miles north of Alamogordo, New Mexico, take
SR 579 to the site, following the signs. RV parking is available in a
large lot at the site. Admission is $2 per vehicle. It’s open daily from
sunrise to sunset.
Weekend wonder
If time is short, you can eliminate parts of this journey to make an accel-
erated dash to the main attractions. Get an early start from El Paso,
drive north on I-25 to Las Cruces, where U.S. 70 (Exit 8) turns east to
Alamogordo. Pause to take the Dunes Drive through White Sands
National Monument, and then continue along U.S. 70 to Ruidoso Downs.
The 69-mile Billy the Kid National Scenic Byway takes only an hour to
cover; allow a second hour for a walking tour around Lincoln. If you have
kids (or kids at heart) onboard, pause at Smokey Bear Historical State
Park in Capitan. And Roswell’s International UFO Museum & Research
Center is a must-stop. Then head south to Carlsbad Caverns National
Park, allowing a minimum of an hour for a self-guided tour through the
Big Room. Return to El Paso via U.S. 62/180. Without advance reserva-
tions, your best bets for campground overnight lodging are around
Alamogordo and again around Roswell or Carlsbad.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
More than 16 of the communities along our driving route have at least
one RV campground, most of them have several. You can eyeball the
action early in the drive to figure out whether you need to make reserva-
tions for the remainder of the trip. If most campgrounds look full as you
drive by in the afternoon, you may consider calling ahead for a spot. But
usually, you’ll have no problem finding lodging except, perhaps, in the
Carlsbad Caverns area in tourist season, which is summer, the
Christmas holidays, and Presidents’ weekend.
If you’re traveling the route in summer, when temperatures can reach
90°F or more at lower elevations, plan ahead for an electrical hookup
capable of running your RV’s air-conditioning unit full blast.

Good eats
Restaurants and snack bars may be many miles apart in the wilds of
southern New Mexico, so you’ll be glad that you’re carrying your own
kitchen — with a well-stocked refrigerator. At the same time, be aware
that some of the small, scruffy-looking country kitchens that you
encounter are treasured word-of-mouth secrets whispered from one
chile-head to another.
The Hatch Chile
“You spell it chili, and I spell it chile . . .” but before we call the whole
thing off, let’s explain. In New Mexico, the spicy capiscum pod always is
spelled chile and often the dishes made from it as well. Texans like the
spelling chili, just as Anglo Indians often use chilli. Hatch is the center of
New Mexico chile-growing, and New Mexico leads the nation in total pro-
duction. The official state vegetables are chilies and frijoles (beans, usu-
ally the pinto variety).
Chilies come in two colors: red and green. The red chile is simply a riper
version of the green chile. Most New Mexican restaurants give you the
choice of red or green chile stews, soups, and sauces. Always ask which
is hotter, because it varies from pepper to pepper. The most commonly
grown variety is the New Mexico long green, moderate on a chile heat

scale that ranks jalapeños as moderately hot. Tiny serrano and
habanero chilies rate much higher on the Scoville heat scale.
New Mexico chili is made primarily of fresh, frozen, roasted, or canned
chile peppers, while Texas chili con carne is meat (without beans) sea-
soned with dried chilies.
Following are some good eating establishments in southern New Mexico
and the adjacent area around El Paso, Texas:
 Cattleman’s Steakhouse, 3045 S. Carlsbad Rd., Fabens, Texas 
(% 915-764-2283; www.cattlemanssteakhouse.com): The restau-
rant isn’t hard to find after you get to Fabens, about 25 miles south
of El Paso on I-10. Just take Exit 10 from I-10 and head north, follow-
ing the signs. This dude ranch and steak restaurant serves great
steaks; a display case shows the raw steaks in each size, so you can
gauge your appetite. Reservations suggested. A huge parking lot by
the restaurant can handle RVs. Open Monday through Friday 4:30
to 10 p.m., Saturday noon to 10 p.m., and Sunday noon to 9 p.m.
 Chope’s, SR 28, La Mesa, New Mexico (% 575-233-3420): Chope’s 
is where the chile growers eat chile rellenos, blue corn enchiladas,
and green chile enchiladas. Park on the street. Open Tuesday
through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. Closed
Sunday and Monday.
 K-Bob’s Steakhouse, 316 E. Cedar St., Deming, New Mexico (% 575-
546-8883): This popular eatery is locally famous for its chicken-fried
steak with baked potato for a low, low price. If you’ve eaten chicken-
fried steak before, you know it’s a pounded cube steak dipped in
industrial-strength batter and deep-fried, and you know whether
you like it. If you’ve never tried the dish before, this is a good, cheap
place to order one for the first time. A parking lot and easy street
parking are available. Open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 La Posta Restaurant and Chile Shop, 2410 Calle de San Albino,
Mesilla, New Mexico (% 575-524-3524; www.laposta-de-mesilla.
com): At the chile shop, look for hot sauces, salsas, recipe books,
canned chilies, and other accessories for chile cooking. In the
restaurant, an American classic since 1939, large portions of tacos,
enchiladas, chile con queso, and tostados are served at lunch and
dinner. RV parking is on the street. Both the restaurant and the
chile shop are open daily from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 Little Diner and Tortilla Factory, 7209 Seventh St., Canutillo, Texas
(% 915-877-2176; www.gorditas.com): Crowds always are stand-
ing in line at this popular place that sells tortillas to go, and a full
gamut of other New Mexico treats to eat in or take out. (This part of
Texas unofficially is in New Mexico.) We like the deep-fried masa
patties called gorditas filled with spicy red chile sauce and chunks
of pork, but the local children were gobbling them down stuffed
with ground beef, chopped lettuce, and tomatoes, sort of a
Chapter 22: New Mexico: Billy the Kid Meets E.T. 329

“McGordita.” The large, adjacent parking lot has plenty of space for
RVs. Open Thursday through Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Closed
Wednesday.
 Nellie’s Café: 1226 W. Hadley, Las Cruces, New Mexico (% 575-524-
9982): Servings are enormous, and the atmosphere is relaxed at
breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Order anything with chilies, even the
chile cheeseburger, and don’t skip the refried beans, even at break-
fast. RV parking is available in large open lots nearby or on the
street. Open Tuesday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Closed
Sunday and Monday.
 Stahman’s Farm, SR 28, 6 miles south of Mesilla, New Mexico 
(% 575-526-8974): The farm sells plenty of pecans shelled or
unshelled, plus candies and other goodies made from the local
nuts. A large parking lot offers space for RVs. Open Monday
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sundays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Shopping along the Way
El Paso, Texas, is a great place to buy cowboy boots because so many
brands are available in the factory outlet stores lining I-10 east of town.
When buying ready-made boots, be sure the heel slips a little when you
walk; when the sole gets more flexible, the slippage stops. If the heel
doesn’t slip when you first try it on, the boot is too tight and will give
you blisters. The instep should be snug, the boot shank long enough to
cover your arch fully, and the ball of your foot should fit into the widest
part of the boot and not sit forward or back of it. Some stores worth a
peek are
 Justin Outlet, 7100 Gateway E., I-10 at Hawkins (% 915-779-5465)
 Lucchese Factory Outlet, 6601 Montana (% 915-778-8060)

O
regon is not like any other state. Oregonians are overwhelmingly,
genuinely — there’s no other word for it — nice. Even today, you
can find traces of those gentle eccentrics, who 150 years ago packed up
pianos and plows, cousins and cows, and set out along the Oregon Trail.
And for anyone who remembers or read about the 1960s, the latter-day
hippies still live along the beaches or up in the hills above the Pacific.
If you look at a road map of Oregon — and you need to if you’re making
this drive — you can see that its major cities are lined up in a vertical
row along I-5 an hour or two inland, but each of them — Portland,
Salem, and Eugene — has a corridor road leading to its own closest
beach. The heaviest tourist developments — restaurants, shops, motels,
dune-buggy rentals, and jet-boat excursion companies — are clustered
for a mile or two on either side of the place where the corridor reaches
the sea. Get away from those access roads and you find untrampled
dunes, lonely beaches, and the wild surf of your dreams.
The coast is dotted lavishly with state parks that have RV hookups,
overnight camping spots, and picnic tables. Although the water often is
too cold for swimming for all but the hardiest, walking and beachcomb-
ing are world-class. Alert strollers may find Japanese fishing floats, bits
of agate, and driftwood twisted into fantastic shapes. Kite flyers love the
sea breezes, sand-castle builders compete for the most grandiose con-
structions, and chowderheads can dig for Oregon razor clams and giant
geoducks.

The Oregon Coast
Chapter 23: The Oregon Coast: California to Washington 333

Getting There
U.S. 101 follows the Oregon coastline for almost all of its 365 miles, dip-
ping inland occasionally but always returning to the sea. Even when the
main route leaves the water, minor side roads cling to the coast. This
drive begins in the south, at the Oregon/California border, and contin-
ues north to Astoria, the spot where Lewis and Clark spent the winter of
1805 to 1806. If you prefer, you can make the drive in the opposite direc-
tion by simply reversing the route directions. The entire route covers
approximately 400 miles, more if you take some of the side detours (see
“The Oregon Coast” map in this chapter).
We added the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington State, just across the
Columbia River from Astoria, because many Oregon coast visitors con-
sider the beach an extension of the coast drive. Official mileposts along
the way on U.S. 101 begin with 0 at the Oregon/Washington border, in the
middle of the Columbia River, and continue through mile 363 at the
Oregon/California border. The Long Beach Peninsula extension adds
another 40 or so miles.
Planning Ahead
Although you can drive along the Oregon coast year-round, summer is
the best time. Temperatures are warmer, and less rain falls. The winter
weather in Oregon is a mixed bag. Here we quote the Oregon Tourism
Commission itself: “You’ve heard the old joke that people in Oregon
don’t tan. They rust. Or if you wait outside for a bus, you’ll grow moss
on your north side. But lest you assume that it rains every day here in
winter, let’s set the record straight. Some days it snows.”
Between December and February, the gray whales migrate south along
the Oregon Coast from Alaska to their calving grounds in Baja, Mexico.
Then they head north again, in the months of March, April, and May,
passing even closer to the coast with their baby whales nearby. So
winter and springtime are good for whale-watching. And fall offers many
dry, sunny days interspersed with days of drizzle.
Whenever you go to the Oregon Coast, be prepared for some rainy days.
We use those days to settle in comfortably in our RV, reading, working
puzzles, baking cookies or muffins to munch on down the road, or put-
tering around the campsite. Then, when the sun comes out, we drop
everything and head for the beach.
Expect crowds on summer weekends at the beaches, but the rest of the
week, even in summer, long stretches of coastline can be empty. State
parks are popular with Oregonians in the summer, so make campground
reservations whenever possible during that season. The rest of the year,
you may well have a campground entirely to yourself, the way we have
on many occasions.
Part V: Seeing the West 
334

Obviously, you want to pack rain gear. Even those two-piece yellow
slicker suits can come in handy if you — like us — enjoy walking along
the beach in the rain. Although coastal temperatures are comfortable to
cool, even in summer, a short drive inland takes you into warmer
weather, so take along some lightweight cotton clothing. Sweaters with
silk turtlenecks underneath or sweatshirts and sweatpants make good
Oregon RV travel clothes. Even in the best restaurants in Oregon, folks
don’t dress up much; we can’t imagine a place where you’d need to wear
a tie unless you’re combining your RV vacation with a business trip.
Take sturdy walking shoes, preferably hiking boots, with a spare pair in
case one pair gets wet, and a pair of waterproof boots if you want to
explore tidal pools.
Allow a week for a leisurely tour along the Oregon Coast, although you
can drive the route straight through in a couple of days (something we
don’t recommend, because you’d miss some wonderful experiences).
Stocking the Pantry
Oregon manufactures some excellent cheeses, especially mild to sharp
cheddars, which you can buy from the factory at Tillamook. French-
style soft cheeses also can be found in Tillamook at Blue Heron French
Cheese Company (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Seafood is superlative everywhere along the coast. Watch for roadside
fish markets. Local salmon smoked in the northwestern style over alder
wood or in Nova Scotia–lox style can be purchased at several producers,
including Josephson’s Smokehouse in Astoria, Chuck’s Seafoods in
Charleston, and Bandon Fisheries in Bandon (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
If you enjoy wine-tastings, you’ll enjoy sampling Oregon’s wines. Some
of the best wineries are in Yamhill County around McMinnville, just
inland from Lincoln City via SR 18. Pinot noirs are especially outstand-
ing; interestingly, the pinot noir grapes grow happily in the same region
with hazelnuts, also called filberts. Follow Scenic Route 99W and SR 47
north of McMinnville, and within 15 to 20 miles, you come across some
two dozen wineries.
Driving the Oregon Coast
The drive begins at mile 363 on the Oregon/California border on U.S.
101 in the Banana Belt. Yes, that’s right: the Banana Belt. It’s called that
because the weather is unusually mild due to a consistent weather pat-
tern that produces the warmest average temperatures on the Oregon
Coast. The Brookings area is where most of America’s Easter lilies are
grown, where an annual azalea festival takes place Memorial Day week-
end at the end of May, and where retirees increasingly are flocking. Look
for the lily fields along U.S. 101 south of Brookings.
Chapter 23: The Oregon Coast: California to Washington 335

At milepost 355.6 in Harris Beach State Park is an Oregon Welcome
Center, where you can pick up maps and materials about the Oregon
Coast. Look particularly for the free Oregon Coast Mile-by-Mile Guide
to Highway 101. The center is closed in the winter months.
North of Brookings, Samuel H. Boardman State Park is spread along 12
miles of roadway with hiking trails striking off from a dozen waysides
where you can park the RV (see “More cool things to see and do,” later
in this chapter). Only 3⁄4 mile north of North Island Viewpoint, China
Beach is a favorite.
At Gold Beach, Oregon’s famous Rogue River surges into the Pacific.
Miners discovered gold on the beach in the mid-1800s, giving the town
its name. Jet-boat tours up the river leave daily between May 1 and
October 30 and travel variously 64, 80, and 104 miles up the river. (See
“More cool things to see and do” for details on boat tours.)
Humbug Mountain State Park, just south of Port Orford at milepost
305.5, stands 1,730 feet above the beach, waiting for hikers to challenge
its 3-mile loop trail (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this
chapter). Port Orford, the oldest town site along the Oregon Coast, is
free of so-called tourist attractions, but you can stroll around to see the
boats dry-docked at the marina, an unusual arrangement. At low tide,
you can walk over to the Battle Rock landmark at milepost 301, a good
place for whale-watching. The Cape Blanco Lighthouse at milepost 296.6
north of Port Orford is open for tours in summer (see “More cool things
to see and do”), and the Cape Blanco State Park has a campground with
electrical hookups.
Bandon Old Town, or as they’ve begun calling it, Bandon-by-the-Sea, is
one of our favorite coastal towns because if you come in the off season
or early in the day, you can drive in, park in one of the designated RV
parking lots or along the street, and just walk around and groove on the
place (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). You’ll find art
galleries, a fishing plant with a retail outlet, a candy company with free
samples, and a fish-and-chips takeout. You can also rent a sea kayak
from Adventure Kayak to travel the Coquille River (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Just north of Bandon lie Oregon’s cranberry bogs, a surprise to anyone
from New England, who thought Massachusetts had an exclusive on the
Thanksgiving berry. From Bandon, U.S. 101 turns inland for the 17 miles
into the Coos Bay area. Take some time to drive the back road that
passes a string of state parks on its way into Charleston; to get to the
back road, take a left turn on West Beaver Hill Road about 8 miles north
of Bandon. Shore Acres State Park has some of the most spectacular
wave action along the coast; you can watch winter storms from a shelter
in the park. You can also stop at several vantage points to look at sea
lions. Sunset Bay State Park is a sheltered camping area with hookups
(see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter).
Part V: Seeing the West 
336

Charleston is an off-the-beaten-path fishing community with a good fish
market and oyster company, Chuck’s Seafoods, on the west end of the
bridge (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Coos Bay is the heart of Oregon’s myrtle wood country. This hardwood
grows only at this site and is used for making bowls and utensils, gob-
lets, even jewelry. Local factories, such as House of Myrtlewood, offer
free tours (see “Shopping along the Way,” later in this chapter).
North of North Bend, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area
begins and continues through Reedsport, where the headquarters are
located, 45 miles north to Florence (see “Must-see attractions,” later in
this chapter). You find some trail heads with parking areas large enough
for RVs, so you can stop and play in the sand.
From Reedsport, SR 38 turns inland 31⁄2 miles to the Dean Creek Elk
Viewing Area, where you stand a good chance of getting a look at one of
the 120 or so resident Roosevelt elk almost any time (see “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter). On one autumn day, near
sunset, we saw a dozen or more grazing quietly close to the roadway
and viewing platform.
Florence and Lincoln City, Kite Capital of the World, have branches of
the Catch the Wind Kites Shop, great places to pick up a kite if you have
the urge to fly one on the beach (see “More cool things to see and do,”
later in this chapter). Lincoln City claims that its winds are the world’s
best for kite-flying because of its location halfway between the equator
and the North Pole.
Florence also is home to the Sea Lion Caves, 12 miles north, one of the
most interesting and certainly the smelliest of the Oregon Coast attrac-
tions (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). Instead of scram-
bling down the rocks to see the wild Stellar sea lions, you get into an
elevator and ride 208 feet down to sea (or sea lion) level. The creatures
spend most of the fall and winter months inside the caves and then
move outside in spring and summer to breed and bear young.
At Cape Perpetua Scenic Area (see “More cool things to see and do,”
later in this chapter), visit the Interpretive Center, with a Discovery Cove
for kids; allow time to hike at least one of the three trails. The Giant
Spruce Trail is 2 miles round-trip along a creek through tall trees; the
Captain Cook Trail is a 1-mile trail down to the sea; and the Cape
Perpetua Trail climbs the south face of the 803-foot cape itself.
The next coastal town along the route is Yachats (pronounced ya-hots),
known as “the gem of the Oregon Coast,” and most popular, we suspect,
with people who know how to pronounce it.
Newport is a favored destination for its Oregon Coast Aquarium (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter) and the Sylvia Beach Hotel,
named for the Paris bookshop owner who befriended numerous authors
Chapter 23: The Oregon Coast: California to Washington 337

in the 1920s. Each of its 20 rooms is decorated in the spirit of and named
for a noted author from Edgar Allen Poe to Agatha Christie, Dr. Seuss to
Ernest Hemingway. The rooms don’t have TVs, radios, or phones, but
books and games are everywhere. Smoking is prohibited.
While you’re in the aquarium vicinity, if it’s lunchtime, head south to the
Lighthouse Deli & Fish Company for some of the best fish and chips on
the Oregon Coast. Native Yaquina Bay oysters farmed in the beds of the
bay were the oysters so popular with miners who struck it rich during
the California gold rush in 1849. Do a little digging on your own. The
clam chowder champion in these parts is Mo’s. (See “Good eats,” later in
this chapter, for both restaurants. For info on doing a little clam digging
on your own, see “More cool things to see and do.”)
Depoe Bay is another good area for whale-watching and for spotting
seals and sea lions, both members of the order Pinnipedia, meaning they
have finlike feet or flippers. The harbor, one of the smallest in the world,
is fascinating to watch as vessels maneuver the narrow channels
between rocks. Spouting horns, rock formations that turn waves into
plumes of water, line the town’s sea wall. Gray whales come in so close,
locals say, because they like to scratch their backs on the rocks. Boiler
Bay State Wayside north of town is one of the best bird- and whale-
watching spots in the area.
Lincoln City is one of the more commercial beach towns along the
Oregon Coast, with the area’s first factory outlet center at milepost
115.6. RVs are welcome. To complete the un-Oregon atmosphere, the
Chinook Winds Casino, belonging to the Siletz tribe, is in Lincoln and
promises coupons for cheap gas to winners (see “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter).
Detour off 101 and head east to Pacific City, have some fish and chips at
the Pelican Pub & Brewery, and drive the curvy but beautiful Three
Cape Scenic Route into Tillamook.
Tillamook always is one of our favorite stops along the Oregon Coast
because of its delicious cheeses, but the Tillamook Cheese Factory,
right on U.S. 101, also makes rich ice cream and sells other made-in-
Oregon items (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). The
Blue Heron French Cheese Company is right off 101 on a marked drive-
way and offers wine-tasting along with cheese-tasting (see “Good eats”).
Both spots have plenty of RV parking.
Cannon Beach is a popular resort community with a sand-castle compe-
tition and a kite-flying festival. Between April and October, you may see
tufted puffins around Haystack Rock at milepost 30.5.
Seaside, only 10 miles up the coast from Cannon Beach, was the Oregon
Coast’s first resort; its amusement park dates from 1873. A Ferris wheel
remains, but formerly, the complex included a zoo, racetrack, and posh
hotel. Members of the Lewis and Clark party ventured to Seaside from
Part V: Seeing the West 
338

their quarters at Fort Clatsop during the winter of 1805 to 1806 to boil
seawater for salt to preserve meats for the long journey home. (See the
listing for Fort Clatsop National Memorial under “Must-see attractions,”
later in this chapter.)
Astoria can claim to be the oldest American city west of the Missouri
River, because John Jacob Astor founded it in 1811 as a fur-trading port.
The Columbia River Maritime Museum, one of the best of its kind, has
an interesting gift shop (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chap-
ter). Today, the town retains much of its charm, although feisty locals
like to display bumper stickers saying, “We Ain’t Quaint.”
From Astoria, we recommend driving north across the Columbia into
Washington to explore the Long Beach Peninsula, which has a long
sandy beach on the ocean side and some of the best oysters on the West
Coast on the Willapa Bay side. Take U.S. 101 across the bridge, follow it
west to Ilwaco and Seaview, and then take SR 103 to the northern tip of
the peninsula at Oysterville. Along the peninsula, you find the World
Kite Museum and Hall of Fame, and the Lewis & Clark Interpretive
Center near Cape Disappointment. (See “More cool things to see and
do,” later in this chapter.) You also pass Oysterville Sea Farms, which
sells homemade condiments (see “Good eats”). This extension to visit
the peninsula adds 40 miles to the basic journey.
Must-see attractions
Bandon Old Town
Bandon-by-the-Sea, Oregon
The Old Town of Bandon isn’t that old. In 1936, a fire destroyed the origi-
nal town, which then was rebuilt along the mouth of the Coquille River.
Known as the “Storm Watching Capital of the World” and the “Cranberry
Capital of Oregon,” this town is a great place to look for agates on the
beach, dig clams at Coquille Point, browse in the local art galleries, order
fish and chips to go, and munch on a super-large cone of local Umpqua
Dairy Co. ice cream. The fun here is making your own special discovery
while you stroll around. We suggest that you explore the area between
First and Second streets along Alabama, Baltimore, Chicago, Delaware,
Elmira, and Fillmore streets. Allow a half-day.
Milepost 270 on U.S. 101. Chamber of Commerce % 541-347-9616. www.bandon.com.
RV parking: Designated lots, plenty of street parking on weekdays. Admission: Free.
Shops open daily 8:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Columbia River Maritime Museum
Astoria, Oregon
The museum recently was renovated and expanded with a large indoor
and outdoor collection that includes the conning tower of a submarine,
the bridge of a U.S. Navy destroyer, displays of fishing boats, lighthouses,
fishing, navigation, and naval history. You can tour a floating lighthouse,
Chapter 23: The Oregon Coast: California to Washington 339

the lightship Columbia, ponder the personal effects of passengers who
went down in ships snagged on the reefs at the mouth of the Columbia
River, and browse the well-stocked museum store. Allow three hours.
1792 Marine Dr. % 503-325-2323. www.crmm.org. RV parking: Two large parking
lots adjacent to museum and street parking. Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors, $4 ages
6–17. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Fort Clatsop National Memorial
Astoria, Oregon
This replica of the fort where the members of the Lewis and Clark expedi-
tion spent the winter of 1805 to 1806 turned out to be more accurate than
even the historians suspected: In 1999, an anthropologist turned up a 148-
year-old map showing that the site of the original was very close to where
the copy was built. During the summer, buckskin-clad, fur-hatted expedi-
tioners show visitors what day-to-day life was like for the Corps of
Discovery. A fine gift shop carries books and videos about the Lewis and
Clark expedition Allow three hours.
92343 Fort Clatsop Rd. % 503-861-2471. www.nps.gov/lewi. RV parking: Large
parking lot capable of handling tour buses. Admission: $5 ages 16 and older, $2 ages
15 and younger. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m., mid-June through Labor Day until 6 p.m.
Closed Christmas.
Oregon Coast Aquarium
Newport, Oregon
If children like this aquarium half as much as a couple of jaded adults that
we know, they’ll have a great day! You can see a tufted puffin in a walk-
through aviary with windows that let you see them “fly” underwater as
they dive for fish. A glass tunnel through the water puts you in the ocean
with sharks, sea lions, seals, sea otters, and a giant Pacific octopus. Oregon
Coast Aquarium is where Keiko, star of the film Free Willy, was rehabili-
tated before returning to the wild. Allow three to four hours.
2820 SE Ferry Slip Rd. % 541-867-3474. www.aquarium.org. RV parking:
Designated lots. Admission: $13 ages 12 and older, $11 seniors, $7.75 ages 3–11. Open:
Memorial Day through Labor Day daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Labor Day through Memorial
Day daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Christmas. Rental wheelchairs available.
Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area
Reedsport (headquarters), Oregon
Stretching 45 miles along the coast between North Bend and Florence, the
Oregon dunes have access areas with off-road parking, some of it large
enough for RVs and some of it not quite. If you can, eyeball entrances

Sea Lion Caves
Florence, Oregon
Wild Stellar sea lions, the largest of the sea lions, inhabit these caves or the
rocks outside them year-round, spending fall and winter inside and spring
and summer outside. Open since 1932, this attraction is fascinating for
anyone who hasn’t been to a sea lion or seal rookery. An elevator descends
208 feet down into the caves; you have to negotiate some stairs and ramps
to get to the elevator. Take a sweater or jacket, camera, and binoculars,
and be prepared, especially in fall and winter, for plenty of noise and some
rank smells. If you prefer your sea lions cute and cuddly, don’t venture far-
ther than the gift shop where you can buy the stuffed kind. Most kids get
a kick out of the elevator ride and the novelty of being in a cave, although
they may complain about the smell. Allow one hour.

Tillamook Cheese Factory
Tillamook, Oregon
This factory tour with its free samples is Oregon’s third-most-popular
tourist attraction. The attraction draws many people who have no idea
how milk from black-and-white cows turns into mild or sharp cheddar
cheese. The Tillamook County Creamery Association was founded in 1918,
and today’s modern factory turns out 40 million pounds of cheese a year,
plus ice cream and other dairy products. Allow two hours.

More cool things to see and do
Oregon seems as big as all outdoors with so much to do along its
beaches that you can never get bored. In addition to the suggestions in
the following list, you may want to check out Cannon Beach (Chamber of
Commerce % 503-436-2623; www.cannonbeach.org); Chinook Winds
Casino, on the beach in Lincoln City (% 888-CHINOOK [244-6665];

in to the technique. Get information booklets and locations from the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (www.dfw.state.or.us).
(See “Fast Facts” at the end of this chapter.)

Recreation Area, Cape Perpetua Scenic Area, Samuel H.
Boardman State Park, Humbug Mountain State Park, and Shore

Weekend wonder
Although driving the 360 or so miles of 101 along the Oregon Coast in
one day is possible, no one in his or her right mind would do it. For a
nice weekend along the northern coast, starting from Portland’s main
access route of U.S. 26, drive over to Seaside and Cannon Beach, then
drive south through Tillamook to Lincoln City, and return to the
Portland area by SR 18 through McMinnville and the Oregon wine
Chapter 23: The Oregon Coast: California to Washington 343

country. To highlight the central coast for the weekend, start from
Eugene and drive across SR 126 to Florence, then drive north as far as
Newport, and return to I-5 via U.S. 20 to Corvallis. Then a short 45-mile
drive down I-5 returns you to Eugene. For a weekend on the southern
Oregon Coast, start from Brookings at the California border and drive
north as far as Florence and then cross SR 126 to Eugene.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
The Oregon Coast is dotted with campgrounds, both state parks (19 of
them with RV camping and hookups) and commercial parks (26 towns
and communities along the coast have one or more RV parks). Although
making reservations is a good idea at beachfront state parks in summer,
especially on weekends, you should be able to find an empty spot almost
anywhere during the rest of the year. An RV-friendly state, Oregon has 
37 designated waste disposal or sanitary dump stations and a correspon-
ding map/guide with access hours and locations. Many of the state parks
outshine their commercial counterparts in site size and separation. Call
Oregon State Parks (% 800-551-6949; www.oregonstateparks.org) for
a brochure or pick one up at any state welcome center. Reservations for
state park campgrounds can be made at % 800-452-5687.
Oregon State Park Discovery Season, from October through April,
offers RV campers a savings from $4 a night for renting a full hookup site
at any state park.
All campgrounds in this chapter are open year-round and have public
flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated
otherwise. Toll-free numbers are for reservations only unless noted. See
Chapter 9 for our criteria on choosing our favorite campgrounds.

(% 503-325-2190; www.josephsons.com), an elegant old-fashioned
store with fine smoked salmon. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 Weird wines: Head to Shallon Winery, 1598 Duane St., Astoria,
Oregon (% 503-325-5978; www.shallon.com). A little old wine-
maker named Paul van der Veldt makes chocolate-orange wine,
lemon meringue pie wine, and cran au lait, among other flavors.
Fortunately, he turns out only about 500 gallons a year. Open daily
from 1 to 6 p.m.
 Willapa Bay oysters: Stop at Oysterville Sea Farms, Oysterville,
Washington (% 800-CRANBERRY [272-6237] or 360-665-6585;
www.oysterville.net). Fresh oysters in the shell or shelled and in
a jar, as well as smoked oysters, are for sale in this shingled cottage
by the bay. To accompany them, try some Oysterville Victorian cake
mixes, cranberry condiments, and fancy preserves, all available on
the spot or by mail order. You can also pick up gifts with a local
accent from Wholly Cow cereals to hand-printed T-shirts with
Oysterville themes. Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Shopping along the Way
If you’re an outlet fan, you may want to run your rig to Lincoln City,
where you find factory outlets at milepost 115.6 on U.S. 101.
For something unique to Oregon, look for products made from myrtle, a
hardwood that grows only on the coast in the Coos Bay area. House of
Myrtlewood, U.S. 101, South Coos Bay (% 800-255-5318), offers a free
factory tour, where you can watch myrtle logs being turned into salad
bowls, and see local craftsmen create everything from golf putters to
trays and bowls. If you’re bored with woodworking, the place also 
makes and serves fudge. Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m., and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed major holidays.

T
he dramatic California coastline winds for 1,200 miles between
Crescent City in the north and San Diego in the south, but the most
scenic part is the central coast, the most beautiful place on Earth. This
drive takes you along a stretch of highway that we’ve been driving,
singly and together, for more years than either of us is willing to admit.
The real California isn’t found among the boutiques of Beverly Hills, the
false-front glamour of studio back lots, San Francisco’s hilly cable car
routes, or Sausalito’s chic waterfront. The real California turns green
after winter rains, when wildflowers embellish the hillsides, and then
turns golden under the summer sun. You’re seeing the real California
when you spot trail riders stirring up a cloud of dust on horseback;
strawberries, lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers growing in long neat rows,
moistened by the coastal fog; a solitary figure and two dogs walking a
lonely, windswept beach; weathered adobe walls sheltering the relics of
18th-century Spanish friars; and vineyards covering the hillsides of what
was a spreading Californio rancho.
Getting There
Set out from the famous beachside community of Malibu, only a few min-
utes north of Santa Monica. The drive follows SR 1 (California 1, CA 1),
also called the Pacific Coast Highway (“the PCH,” as locals call it), for
340 miles north to the Monterey Peninsula, which juts out into the
Pacific about 100 miles south of San Francisco. The PCH sometimes joins
up with wider, faster U.S. 101, from the Oxnard/Ventura area to Gaviota,
north of Santa Barbara, and then again from Pismo Beach to San Luis

California Central Coast
Chapter 24: California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey 353

Obispo, but for much of the time, you and your RV are alone along the
coastline. Along the way, you encounter surf pounding at the foot of the
cliffs along of the curving roadway. You drive from Malibu along the cen-
tral coast, past world-famous Big Sur, to the Monterey Peninsula, a dis-
tance of some 340 miles. (See the “California Central Coast” map in this
chapter for the route.)
Planning Ahead
The central coast makes a splendid destination any season of the year,
although summer coastal fogs and winter rains can make driving diffi-
cult, and rock and mudslides triggered by the winter rain may even close
the Pacific Coast Highway at intervals. Be prepared with sweaters and
jackets if you visit in summer; cool dense fogs roll in during the night
and hang on through the morning hours but usually burn off before
midday. (Mark Twain remarked that the coldest winter he ever spent
was a summer in San Francisco.) Warm, sunny days often occur along
the route in February or March. September and October also are often
warm and clear — most summer visitors are gone by then.
You need campground reservations on weekends throughout the year;
state parks often divide their sites into first-come, first-served sites and
those reserved months ahead. The best commercial RV parks often are
fully booked in summer and on holidays. In “Sleeping and Eating on the
Road,” later this chapter, we suggest which of our favorite campgrounds
need to be reserved ahead and which may have a spot at the last
minute.
When packing, take along warm clothes, even in summer, sturdy hiking
boots if you want to strike out along some of the coastal trails and
beaches, binoculars, and plenty of film for your camera.
You can make the drive in two or three days, but you’ll want more time
to visit the area’s must-see attractions. To really enjoy the coast and its
beaches, plan to spend several days camping in at least one serendipi-
tous area that sings to you. We spend as much as a month at our hide-
away in Morro Bay and still hate to leave when our time is up. Allow
seven to ten days for a perfect RV vacation.
Stocking the Pantry
This part of California’s coast has plenty of supermarkets, wineries, and
other food suppliers. If you want to do some wine-tasting and stocking
up on vintages from the area, see Wine-tasting 101 under “More cool
things to see and do,” later in this chapter.
One of our favorite food suppliers, the Trader Joe’s chain, notable for
budget-price wines and specialty food products, has a big market in
Arroyo Grande on a hilltop beside U.S. 101. We also suggest shopping
Part V: Seeing the West 
354

spots for tri-tip roast, the backbone of Santa Maria barbecue, in Morro
Bay and Santa Maria (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Driving California’s Central Coast
We set out from scenic Malibu Beach RV Park, in the middle of expen-
sive, exclusive Malibu on a hilltop above the Pacific Coast Highway (see
“Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chapter). If you have access to
a car (a car that you’re towing or a rental vehicle), visit both the Getty
Center near Brentwood and the Santa Monica Pier before heading
north. You can also take public transportation to these sights. (For the
Getty, see “Must-see attractions,” and for the pier, see “More cool things
to see and do,” later in this chapter.)
For fans who grew up watching Raymond Burr as TV’s Perry Mason, the
coastal town of Ventura can claim to be the home of the famous lawyer/
detective because this is where creator Erle Stanley Gardner lived and
practiced law. Ventura’s city hall, formerly the courthouse, was used to
film parts of the classic TV series. The city offers an Erle Stanley Gardner
walking tour (see “More cool things to see and do”).
The drive from Malibu to Santa Barbara is 83 miles, so if you can time
your arrival around midday, stop for lunch at the world’s most written-
about taco stand, the late Julia Child’s favorite, La Super-Rica (see
“Good eats,” later in this chapter). Driving around the city of Santa
Barbara in a large motorhome or towing a trailer is not recommended
because you have to depend on street parking, and these streets aren’t
made for RVing. But sometimes you can find space in the residential
Chapter 24: California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey 355
Solvang: A little bit of Denmark
Depending on your sugar capacity, not only for Danish pastries but also cuddly sweet-
ness, you either love or hate Solvang, America’s own Danish community. Back in the
1960s, this was a Scandinavian settlement selling a few Danish souvenirs and celebrat-
ing a mid-September festival with aebelskiver (round apple pancakes cooked in a spe-
cial pan) and sausage served to the few visitors. Today, Solvang is a burgeoning tourist
attraction that fills the town with so many vehicles that only the most intrepid RVer would
attempt to join them, although Solvang offers some edge-of-town RV parking.
Bakeries selling buttery pastries and cookies include Danish Mill Bakery, 1682
Copenhagen Dr. (% 805-688-5805); Mortensen’s Danish Bakery, 1588 Mission Dr. 
(% 805-688-8373); Olsen’s Danish Village Bakery, 1529 Mission Dr. (% 805-688-6314;
www.olsensdanishbakery.com); and Solvang Bakery, 460 Alisal Rd. (% 805-
688-4939; www.solvangbakery.com). Other local shops sell Danish china, choco-
late candies, Danish costumes, leather-and-wood clogs, and European antiques.

neighborhood around the taco stand. The city of Santa Barbara offers a
public transit service that visits many of the city’s highlights.
North of Santa Barbara is a mostly undiscovered area of the central
coast, ranging from the cute Danish town of Solvang (from SR 1 or U.S.
101, go east on SR 246) to ranches owned by celebrities. (For more on
Solvang, see this chapter’s sidebar “Solvang: A little bit of Denmark.”)
North of Las Cruces, we suggest following SR 1 rather than U.S. 101. Two
hundred years of history have barely left an imprint on this land. Rolling
sandy hills covered with scrubby vegetation along the coast give way to
rich valleys where market vegetables grow year-round, and lush ranchos
where Arabian horses breed. The dazzling flower fields in Lompoc
bloom in rainbow colors much of the year and produce 85 percent of all
the flower seeds for America’s home gardeners.
The peninsula west of U.S. 101, except for Vandenberg Air Force Base
where the space shuttles land when the weather is bad in Florida, is a
throwback to old California when the state still belonged to Mexico. In
1849, eager to claim the riches discovered in the Sierra foothills, a group
of gold miners drew a flag with a bear on it and proclaimed the Bear Flag
Rebellion, claiming California for the United States.
In the 18th century, Spanish friars created a string of 21 missions located
a day’s horseback ride apart. Today, most of them sit in the middle of
urban areas where parking is difficult for RVs, and the ambience doesn’t
evoke the former mission days. An exception is our favorite mission, 
La Purísima Concepción, 5 miles out of Lompoc, which remains in a
rural setting. This mission is worth a special visit, particularly in summer,
when the nearby flower fields of Lompoc are in full bloom. (For more
information, see “La Purísima Mission State Historic Park” under “Must-
see attractions,” later in this chapter.)
Great barbecued steaks (the world’s best, say the proprietors) are
cooked in tiny Casmalia, a few miles south of Vandenberg’s main gate, at
The Hitching Post. If you opt for the fast road instead of taking SR 1,
you’ll be glad to know that an offshoot of this eatery is now in Buellton
just off U.S. 101. (For more information, see “Good eats,” later in this
chapter.)
Good food abounds in Guadalupe, a farming community along the coast
with a string of good Mexican restaurants (choose any of them) and the
Far Western Tavern (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter), an old
California ranch-style steakhouse serving steaks barbecued over red oak
with Santa Maria pinquito (little pink) beans and salsa.
Nipomo and Oceano are distinctive for 1920s connections. Nipomo,
home of towering sand dunes that have doubled for the Sahara in many
films, is now also an archaeological dig that is unearthing (are you
ready?) the remains of a movie set created by Cecil B. DeMille for his
1923 epic The Ten Commandments. Although the dig is closed, you can
Part V: Seeing the West 
356

see some of the artifacts at the Dunes Discovery Center at the north
end of town (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Pismo Beach, known since the 1930s as a one-liner joke delineating a
rural California settlement and a retiree getaway, is, thankfully, much the
same today. A top-notch RV snowbird winter retreat, Pismo Beach
remains popular for its mild weather and the ease of getting around
town. Although the famous Pismo clams are more a memory than a fact
today (none can be sold commercially), you can get tasty chowders
made from eastern and northwestern clams or strike out to dig your
own with a local clamming license available from the state fish and game
authorities (see “Fast Facts” at the end of this chapter). The problem
with the big clams (the minimum legal size to keep is 41⁄2 inches wide,
and there’s a catch limit of ten) is that most have been eaten by
California sea otters, those little tool-smart critters who swim around in
the Pacific carrying rocks for breaking shellfish against their chests.
At Pismo Beach, SR 1 rejoins U.S. 101 to take you as far as San Luis
Obispo, home of California Polytechnic State University (“Cal Poly” for
short); the Mission of San Luis Obispo de Tolosa; a pair of vintage gro-
cery stores, the 1884 Ah Louis Store and the 1874 Sinsheimer Brothers
Store; and Bubble Gum Alley, a bizarre ongoing work of art on Higuera
Street between Garden and Broad streets. This easygoing town, nick-
named SLO, also is the scene of a famous Thursday night farmers’
market, when vendors of Santa Maria barbecue and farmers selling fresh
produce line closed-off blocks of Higuera Street (see “Good eats,” later in
this chapter).
Chapter 24: California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey 357
The mating game on the butterfly coast
The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is one of the most exotic winter visitors to
the central coast, arriving in late October by the hundreds of thousands to more than
300 nesting sites within 2 miles of the ocean. Although the migration territory ranges
from a golf course in San Leandro in the San Francisco Bay area southward to the
campus of the University of California at San Diego, the main sites are along the cen-
tral coast.
Look for monarchs between mid-October and late February or early March at the fol-
lowing state parks and sanctuaries: Monarch Grove Sanctuary, Ridge Road near
Lighthouse Avenue, Pacific Grove (% 831-648-5716); San Simeon State Beach, SR 1,
5 miles south of Hearst Castle (% 805-927-2035); Morro Bay State Park, State Park
Road, off SR 1 south of Morro Bay (% 805-772-7434); Pismo State Beach, North Beach
Campground, SR 1, 1⁄4 mile south of Pismo Beach (% 805-489-1869); El Capitan State
Beach, U.S. 101, 17 miles west of Santa Barbara (% 805-968-1033); Camino Real Park,
Dean Drive near Varsity Street, Ventura (% 805-652-4594); Point Mugu State Park,
9000 W. SR 1, Malibu (% 805-488-5223). Call ahead for directions and information.

SLO is where SR 1 returns to the coast and the fishing town of Morro
Bay, dominated by landmark Morro Rock, a 576-foot-high volcanic plug
dome that may be 50 million years old. Peregrine falcons nest on the
rock; great blue herons nest between January and June in a grove of
eucalyptus trees by the estuary’s wetlands; brown pelicans and white
gulls check out the fishing boats on the waterfront; and sandpipers leave
their footprints on the wet sand of the beach as the tide washes in.
RVers have two splendid hookup campground choices: Morro Bay State
Park on the estuary and Morro Dunes by the sea, sheltered by grass-
topped sand dunes (see “Our favorite campgrounds,” later in this chap-
ter). Morro Bay marks the jumping-off point for the Big Sur section of the
drive. As you continue north on SR 1, you pass the beach town of
Cayucos with a handful of antiques shops and seafood restaurants on
the pier. Next comes Harmony, population 18, as its roadside signage
announces (be alert or you may miss the whole town), and then pre-
cious Cambria with many antiques shops and scores of collectibles, chic
restaurants, and a thin veneer of ever-so-quaint-ye-olde cuteness.
Just up SR 1 a piece from Cambria is San Simeon, headquarters for “the
ranch,” as publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst referred to his
opulent 165-room hilltop castle built on the same spot where the family
used to go camping. Allow most of a day if you want to visit the famous
castle, because you must take one of several daily guided tours, the only
option for getting through the gates. Film buffs immediately recognize
the Hearst Castle’s connection with Orson Welles’s masterpiece film
Citizen Kane; “Rosebud” is all that’s missing. (For more information on
the castle, see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter.)
From San Simeon, SR 1 winds nearly 100 miles to the Monterey Peninsula,
passing through legendary Big Sur on a white-knuckle highway. Don’t miss
stopping at a viewpoint to admire the delicate arches of Bixby Creek
Bridge, spanning a 260-foot gorge against a backdrop of gently rounded
treeless hills. After you cross over the bridge, the best views of this much-
photographed 1932 concrete span are from the turnouts to the north.
Take your time driving along the Big Sur stretch of the coast, turning off
into the pullouts (those that are big enough to handle your rig, that is)
and getting out to stretch and to photograph the spectacular scenery.
However tempting some of the signs and driveways may be, before you
enter, consider carefully whether you can turn around your RV and get
back out. And be wary of traffic on this two-lane highway. The restaurant
Nepenthe, the most famous eatery along the way, is noted for its
ambrosia burgers; expect a crowd on a sunny midday. Sometimes there
isn’t even space enough for a car to park in the restaurant’s lot, let alone
an RV. Opt for a space along the roadway instead.
Carmel, an artists’ mecca in the early years of the 20th century, has
turned into a traffic-clogged bed-and-breakfast town of tearooms and
upscale shops. Once admired as the home of photographer Ansel Adams,
the town is best known these days for resident and former mayor Clint
Eastwood, whose Hog’s Breath Inn was the focus of innumerable tourist
Part V: Seeing the West

cameras until he closed it a few years ago. Today, he runs the Mission

town near the mission on Dolores Street. The hotel was converted from
an 1850s ranch house that doubled as a New England estate in the 1959
tear-jerker A Summer Place.
The Monterey Peninsula is John Steinbeck country. The author grew up
in the area and wrote about it in such diverse books as East of Eden and
Cannery Row. The National Steinbeck Center in Salinas joins such must-
see peninsula attractions as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Point Lobos
State Reserve, Cannery Row, and Fisherman’s Wharf (see “Must-see
attractions” and the “Monterey’s Cannery Row and Fisherman’s Wharf”
sidebar, later in this chapter).
The 17-Mile Drive, an expensive and much-touted toll road that swings
past Pebble Beach, is restricted to cars and vans, so don’t expect to
drive your RV along the famous route. Locals park outside the entrance
and walk or bicycle in to avoid the fee. Because the entrance is in a posh
residential district, however, you won’t be permitted to park an RV on-
site. Leave the RV in the campground and use your tow car or rental car
to navigate the narrow streets of the peninsula.
From Monterey, you can continue north on SR 1 to San Francisco or
return to Los Angeles.
Must-see attractions
Getty Center
Los Angeles
Allow most or all of a day to see this complex of galleries, gardens, gift
stores, and restaurants. The gorgeously lit galleries display everything
from Old Masters to Impressionists (van Gogh’s Irises is one acquisition),
sculpture and decorative arts to photography (including a major collec-
tion of Walker Evans’s work), while the landscaped gardens invite strolling
and contemplating a drop-dead view in all directions (smog permitting!).
Travelers are told, “You can’t miss it,” but if you head north on I-405 from
I-10 toward U.S. 101, you really can’t miss the Getty Center. First, you see
a huge stone complex crowning the top of a hill to the west of I-405 as the
highway climbs toward the crest at Mulholland Drive. Next you see sig-
nage labeled Getty Center and Getty Center Drive with arrows directing
you to the garage. In a twist from the usual, the Getty charges for parking,
but the museum is free. Allow a half-day to a full day.
1200 Getty Center Dr., off I-405 near Brentwood. % 310-440-7300. www.getty.edu.

Chapter 24: California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey 359

Hearst Castle
San Simeon
Arranging these must-see sights in alphabetical order underscores the
impact that captains of industry — J. Paul Getty in oil and international
business and William Randolph Hearst in publishing — have had on
California culture. Getty’s museum was a long-planned gift to the people of
California, while Hearst’s castle was his own opulent hideaway until his
death in 1951; the Hearst estate endowed the castle to the state of
California, and it became a state park in 1958.
Although building went on from 1919 to 1947, Hearst Castle never was fin-
ished. Hearst intended eventually to add a bowling alley, a clock tower, an
aviary, a croquet lawn, and a polo field. The rich and famous of the 1930s
dined at the long refectory table set with priceless china and silver, along
with paper napkins and condiments like catsup still in their original bot-
tles. They were, after all, camping out at the ranch.
Allow time to visit the artifacts rescued from storage and on view in the
reception exhibit hall and to see the 40-minute film, Building the Dream ($8
adults, $6 ages 17 and younger), and the tapestries in the lobby of the the-
ater. Allow at least a half-day, more if you’re at the back of the line.

tours start at 8:20 a.m. with the last tour beginning at 3:20 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Visitors have a choice of four different day tours, all of which require a 1⁄2 mile walk
and negotiating 200 to 500 stairs. Evening tours with docents in period costume are
scheduled on Fri and Sat beginning at 6:10 p.m. on selected spring and fall dates.

La Purísima Mission State Historic Park
Lompoc
Locals pronounce the town lom-poke, not lom-pock, as comedian W. C.
Fields pronounced it in his film The Bank Dick, shot here in 1940. The
restored 1787 mission, now a state park, remains in a rural setting.
Costumed guides, who carry on the original daily routines and demon-
strate the crafts of the early 19th century, staff the site. The long, low,
adobe-and-wood buildings house chapels, a kitchen where candles are
made by hand, a museum of artifacts and photographs, Indian workshops,
soldiers’ barracks, and the simple cells where the friars slept. Allow two
hours for the visit, more if you want to hike or go horseback riding (avail-
able on-site) on one of the trails around the mission.
Part V: Seeing the West 
360

The flower fields surrounding the mission start to bloom in June but are
brightest in July and August. Take Ocean Avenue west from downtown
and drive until you spot the first fields, and then zigzag back and forth
between Ocean Avenue and Central Avenue on the connecting streets to
enjoy a display of sweet peas, delphiniums, bachelor’s buttons, marigolds,
petunias, and zinnias. Also make sure to see Lompoc’s 50 historical
murals on public and private buildings in the middle of town, especially
the temperance-minded lady smashing a whiskey keg with an ax.

Monterey Bay Aquarium
Monterey
Design magic and some $50 million turned the last remaining sardine fac-
tory on Monterey’s Cannery Row into one of the world’s top aquariums.
Inside is pure enchantment from the three-story kelp tank to a two-level
sea otter habitat. Hands-on exhibits let you touch anemones and bat rays,
and you even find a corner that runs period films from the sardine can-
nery days. Some 360,000 creatures are on-site, from jellyfish to sharks, and
giant whale models hang overhead. The world’s biggest window gives a
look into the Outer Bay exhibit, a million-gallon, man-made ocean popu-
lated by tuna, sunfish, sea turtles, and other denizens of the deep. Allow
a half-day (explore Monterey the rest of the day).

National Steinbeck Center
Salinas
Although the inland city of Salinas is a few miles off the coastal route, the
National Steinbeck Center, along with the surrounding pedestrian-friendly
city center, makes this 16-mile detour more than worth the trip. The family
will love exploring this hands-on museum.
Author John Steinbeck is familiar to RVers as a pioneer of the movement
as detailed in his popular Travels with Charley, the story of his ramblings
around America with his French poodle Charley in 1961 in a truck camper
named Rocinante after Don Quixote’s horse. From the thousands of read-
ers who bought his book came many of today’s RV aficionados. In the
museum, you find the original Rocinante truck camper, along with walk-in
galleries for each of his major books filled with touch, see, and smell
exhibits. Film clips from movies made from Steinbeck books, including
Cannery Row, East of Eden, The Grapes of Wrath, Tortilla Flat, The Red Pony,
and Of Mice and Men, play in each area.
Chapter 24: California Central Coast: Malibu to Monterey 361

The newest part of the center takes a look at California agriculture from the
human point of view, documenting personal history of farm workers in the
Salinas Valley. Allow two to three hours.
1 Main St. (directly off U.S. 101, 16 miles east of SR 1 via SR 68 from Monterey). % 831-
796-3833. www.steinbeck.org. RV parking: Use the railway station lot across the
street or street parking. Admission: $11 adults, $8.95 seniors, $7.95 ages 13–17, $5.95
ages 6–12, 5 and younger free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Point Lobos State Reserve
Carmel
You see the same Monterey cypress trees and fog-misted headlands in
Point Lobos as you do on the 17-Mile Drive, except that instead of driving
through posh suburbs, you’re traveling through natural coastal scenery.
Go as early in the morning as possible so that you won’t be tied up in a
long row of cars that brake upon sightings of sea otters, sea lions, harbor
seals, and seabirds. Explore 9 miles of hiking trails and 456 acres of
reserve; carry binoculars to look for California gray whales during migra-
tion seasons, which occur in mid-January (southbound) and in April and
early May (northbound). No dogs are allowed, and no vehicles longer than
20 feet are allowed during the summer season. However, you can park
along the highway and walk in. Allow anywhere from an hour to a half-day
depending on your hiking plans.
SR 1 south of Carmel. % 831-624-4909. www.pointlobos.org. Admission: $9 per
vehicle, $4 vehicle with senior, $3 vehicle with person with disability, $1 for a map.
Open: Daily summer 9 a.m.–7 p.m., winter 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Limit of 150 vehicles at any

More cool things to see and do
Although the scenery is spectacular along every mile of this drive, you
may want to check out these other cool activities. Don’t overlook
Monterey with its colorful attractions (see the “Monterey’s Cannery Row
and Fisherman’s Wharf” sidebar, later in this chapter).
 Uncovering Egypt: Movie fans who also are archaeology buffs love
the Nature Conservancy’s Dunes Discovery Center, 1055 Guadalupe
St. (CA 1), Guadalupe (% 805-343-2455, ext. 101; www.dunes
center.org), which combines hands-on educational exhibits about
the landscape and the creatures that inhabit the dunes, with an
ongoing excavation of a long-buried movie set depicting Egypt in the
biblical era.
In 1923, on the Nipomo Dunes south of Guadalupe, Cecil B. DeMille
constructed a movie set only slightly less ambitious than the Great
Pyramids at Giza for The Ten Commandments. The production
involved 1,600 laborers, 2,500 movie stars and extras (who slept in
tents on adjacent dunes), and 110-foot walls flanked by 4 statues of
Ramses II and 21 sphinxes. At the end of shooting, DeMille brought
in a horse-drawn bulldozer and knocked down the set to keep a
Part V: Seeing the West 
362

rival producer from coming in, shooting a cheap picture, and
releasing it first. The moving sands soon buried the set. Some 60
years later, a storm uncovered some of it, and a pair of documen-
tarians rushed in to preserve and catalog what they could. Now 16
years in the making, the dig is not yet complete. The center also
offers docent-led hikes through the dunes that focus on the film,
along with bird-watching, photography, and botanical and animal
life. To visit on your own, drive west on the road by the cemetery
to the parking lot right on the beach at Guadalupe Dunes Preserve,
or go 3 miles north of town and west 3 miles on Oso Flaco Lake
Road to a parking lot ($4) and hike along a trail and a boardwalk
over the lake to the dunes; it’s 2 miles round-trip. Allow two to
three hours if you visit the dunes.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free. The center
is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Wine-tasting 101: Off U.S. 101 in and around the town of Los Olivos
lies a sampling of Santa Barbara County wineries, including
Firestone, Fess Parker (yes, that Fess Parker in the Davy Crockett
coonskin cap), Zaca Mesa, Foxen Vineyard, and Gainey Vineyard.
Call Santa Barbara County Vintner’s Association at % 805-688-0881
or go to www.sbcountywines.com for a detailed map of all the
county’s wineries with tastings, tour times, and types of wines 
produced.
 Piering into the past: Santa Monica Pier, Ocean and Colorado
avenues, was earmarked to be the port of Los Angeles, but through
political machinations the area lost out to San Pedro at the turn of
the 20th century. Undeterred, the city fathers instead created a
broad, sandy beach park and a playland pier, which was built
between 1904 and 1921 and restored in the last decade. A 1916 car-
rousel, which starred in the film The Sting, a penny arcade, a Ferris
wheel, bumper cars, games of chance, fortunetellers — all lend a
Coney Island or Jersey Shore accent to this sunny pocket of
Southern California. Allow from two hours to a half-day, depending
on how many carrousel rides you take.
For more information on visiting the pier, contact the Santa Monica
Visitor Center, 1920 Main St., Ste. B (% 800-544-5319 or 310-393-
7593; www.santamonica.com). RV parking is available in desig-
nated lots.
 Shadowing Perry Mason: The city of Ventura was home of Erle
Stanley Gardner, a lawyer and writer whose Perry Mason series
began in 1933. Today, you can take a walking tour past Gardner’s
several homes and law offices in town. Allow a couple of hours.
For more information, contact the Ventura Visitors & Convention
Bureau, 89 S. California St., Ste. C (% 800-483-6214 or 805-648-
2075; www.ventura-usa.com). RV parking is available on the
street; some off-street lots are available.

Weekend wonder
You can make a quick weekend run from Los Angeles to Monterey com-
fortably in one direction if you’re bound for other areas, but don’t try to
make a round-trip. If you only have a weekend, try driving from Los
Angeles as far as Morro Bay, overnighting on the bay, and heading
south again; or drive from San Francisco along the Big Sur coast as far
as Morro Bay and return. You can catch the best of scenery, enjoy a

Monterey’s Cannery Row 
and Fisherman’s Wharf
Cannery Row was, in the words of John Steinbeck, “a poem, a stink, a grating noise,
a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream.” Today, the canneries are silent,
the smell of the sardines long gone, and only the dream and nostalgia remain, along
with a bustling commercial center aimed squarely at tourists.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium, 886 Cannery Row (%831-648-4800; www.mbayaq.org),
is a must-see, but as long as you’re in the neighborhood and have some time, check out
the rest of the attractions. If you know Steinbeck’s novels set here — Cannery Row and
Tortilla Flat — you can recognize the remaining landmarks — Wing Chong Market,
called Lee Chong’s Grocery in the books; Ed Ricketts’s Pacific Biological Laboratories,
named Western Biological in the books; and Flora Wood’s Lone Star Café, the Bear Flag
Restaurant in the books. A historic marker in Cannery Row Memorial Park memorializes
the books’ Chicken Walk and Palace Flophouse.
A 1905 Herschell Spillman carrousel whirls at 640 Wave St.; a playground named for
Dennis the Menace, the comic strip character created by resident Hank Ketchum,
calls out to eager kids from Pearl Street. If you’re in the mood, you can take advantage
of Cannery Row’s factory outlet shops, wine-tasting, fish restaurants, and souvenir
shops.
Monterey State Historical Park and Fisherman’s Wharf jut out into the bay a few
blocks east of Cannery Row but with much less spacious parking, so plan to park in
the Cannery Row area. The wharf is lined with seafood takeout places similar to
Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco; one local specialty is clam chowder served in
hollowed-out loaves of sourdough bread. Forget the overpriced abalone — a former
staple of coastal California, the delectable shellfish has been overfished and most of
it sold on the wharf today is frozen and imported. Instead, order the local calamari
(squid), delicious when fried to a crunch and served with lemon wedges and tartar
sauce.
Cannery Row, on the street named Cannery Row, is adjacent to Foam Street and
Lighthouse Street in Monterey. A parking lot in the area (look for the signage) is large
enough for RVs; leave your vehicle in the lot and walk the 6 or so blocks over to
Fisherman’s Wharf. For more information, go to www.canneryrow.com.

seafood or Santa Maria barbecue meal, even take in a couple hours of
antiques shopping, but you won’t have time for the major museums and
the aquarium.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
The Pacific Coast Highway (California 1 — SR 1) is chockablock with
state park campgrounds where an RV can overnight (usually without
hookups), if you’ve made advance reservations or you arrive early on a
weekday when other campers are checking out. Private campgrounds
are more lenient; you can make a phone call and leave a credit card
number to reserve an open site for as long as you want to stay.
Altogether, some three dozen RV parks, including state and national
forest campgrounds, are located along the coastal route. Note that the
toll-free reservations numbers for the state parks listed in this section
are for a central reservations system that may involve a long wait on
hold and much punching in of numbers from your touch-tone phone.
Food is plentiful, especially familiar fast food for nonfussy travelers.
Road-food fans, however, may find the unique central coast eateries that
serve Santa Maria barbecue far more interesting.
Because the coast drive is rewarding year-round, we urge you to make
reservations when you’re traveling on weekends. On winter weekdays,
you may find plenty of empty spots in some campgrounds, so you can
rely on serendipity.
All campgrounds listed in this chapter are open year-round and have
flush toilets, showers, and sanitary dump stations unless otherwise
noted. Toll-free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only. See
Chapter 9 for the criteria we use to select our favorite campgrounds.

Good eats
Although chic and expensive restaurants line this route, some of them
get uptight when they see an RV drive up. We prefer friendly, down-
home, takeout spots and concentrate on local and regional cooking.
Santa Maria barbecue
After decades as a cherished secret central coast cuisine, the Santa
Maria barbecue has reached national prominence because former L.A.
residents and knowledgeable barbecue fans now edit major foodie jour-
nals, such as Gourmet and Saveur. Some of the bolder critics call this
barbecue the best in the world, but we quibble there, because a fine
piece of Texas brisket or Owensboro, Kentucky, mutton also is
supremely satisfying. However, nobody else but Santa Maria serves up
unique side dishes of tiny, tasty pinquito beans, grown only in Santa
Barbara County, and piquant salsa inherited from the Californios.
The Santa Maria style began more than a century ago with the hos-
pitable Californios, Mexican ranch families who welcomed strangers with
a giant outdoor barbecue. Later, communal cattle roundups meant local
ranchers celebrated the end of the work by throwing hunks of beef on
live oak (also called red oak) logs in a hand-dug pit and having a party.
Then, in the 1950s, butchers in Santa Maria isolated the tri-tip, a bottom
sirloin usually designated for stew; seasoned it with salt, pepper, olive
oil, garlic, and red wine vinegar; and tossed it on the grill.
Today, you find Santa Maria barbecue in a few places — in sit-down
restaurants along the central coast (a list follows) or along Broadway in
Santa Maria on Saturdays and Sundays between noon and 6 p.m. in any
parking lot where you see the smoke rising from a portable barbecue.
You can also hit the Thursday night street market in San Luis Obispo,
where vendors with portable cookers clog Higuera Street and vend sand-
wiches or cooked barbecue by the pound. Or you can make them your-
self by buying a tri-tip roast or other suitable cut of beef, sometimes
already marinated, from a local market, such as Spencer’s Fresh Market
in Morro Bay or El Rancho in Santa Maria.
Besides pinquito beans and an often-bland salsa, other acceptable side
dishes in a restaurant meal of Santa Maria barbecue include a relish dish
of pickles, olives, carrot and celery sticks, shrimp cocktail, garlic bread,
and baked potato. When you buy from the roadside stand, take whatever
they’re offering on the side.
The best central coast purveyors of Santa Maria–style barbecued beef
are as follows:
 Far Western Tavern, 899 Guadalupe St. (SR 1), Guadalupe (% 805-
343-2211; www.farwesterntavern.com): The owners prefer to use
“bull’s-eye” (rib-eye) steaks up to 20 ounces cut from their own cattle
but also offer “cowboy cut” top sirloin cooked in the Santa Maria
style with pinquito beans and salsa on the side, along with an
optional appetizer of crisp mountain oysters (called calf fries, these

11 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Friday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
 The Hitching Post, 3325 Point Sal Rd., Casmalia (% 805-937-6151;
www.hitchingpost1.com): The Hitching Post, north of Vandenburg
Air Force Base, has been around since 1952. The meat is cooked in
an open pit in the middle of the room, and dinner (without beans)
is served on red tablecloths. Open Monday through Saturday from
4:30 to 9:30 p.m. and Sunday from 4 to 9 p.m. To get there from SR 1,
take Black Road to Point Sal Road.
A second location is at 406 E. SR 246, Buellton (% 805-688-0676).
This Hitching Post is a slightly fancier version of its Casmalia
parent, offering steaks of ostrich, turkey, and quail, also cooked over
live oak logs, along with the house appetizer, grilled artichokes with
smoky, spicy chipotle mayonnaise flavored with smoked chilies.
Open daily from 4 to 9:30 p.m.
 Jocko’s, 125 N. Thompson St., Nipomo (% 805-929-3686): Standing
on the corner in Nipomo like a pool hall or burger joint, Jocko’s is
notable for Santa Maria barbecue. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Markets and meals
In addition to checking out Trader Joe’s (see “Stocking the Pantry” ear-
lier in this chapter), you may want to fill your fridge with fresh fish and
produce from some of our other favorite spots. We also include options
for when you want someone else to do the cooking. For information on
picking up Danish treats, see the “Solvang: A little bit of Denmark” side-
bar, earlier in this chapter.
 Giovanni’s Fish Market, 1001 Front St., Morro Bay (% 805-772-
2123; www.giovannisfishmarket.com): This market has a live
crab tank and cooker outside, a takeout window for fish and chips
and other seafood goodies, and a full-fledged fish market inside,
selling everything from cooked crab and shrimp to calamari salad
and fresh-from-the-Pacific rock cod, halibut, and petrale sole. The
cooked and cleaned cracked crab comes in its own Styrofoam box
lined with a red-and-white checked plastic mini-tablecloth and is
ready to devour, if you want, on the nearby picnic tables that over-
look the fishing fleet. The store is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
the kitchen, daily from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 La Super-Rica Taqueria, 622 N. Milpas St. (take the Milpas turnoff
from U.S. 101), Santa Barbara (% 805-963-4940): This taco stand is
America’s most famous, thanks to a long-ago rave by food icon Julia
Child. Instead of grabbing the plug and running with it to found a
fast-food franchise, owner and chef Isodoro Gonzalez retained the
same pleasant little restaurant that he built in 1980, kept cooking
what Julia liked, and continued adding new daily specials. Today,
diners still queue up to place an order, pay in advance, take a
number, and sit in the casual eating area awaiting the delivery of
their cooked-to-order food. Beer and soft drinks are available, the

Route 66: OK to L.A.
In This Chapter
 Getting your kicks on Route 66
 Saluting the cowboys
 Romping through roadside attractions
John Steinbeck called Route 66 “the mother road” in his classic
novel The Grapes of Wrath. But whether being traversed by the
book’s dirt-poor Joad family in the 1930s, who headed for California
with all their possessions tied to a broken-down truck, or the hand-
some hero-adventurers Tod and Buz in their shiny yellow Corvette in
the 1960s TV series Route 66, this highway has sung its invitation to
anyone with a dream to hit the road.
Route 66 is the highway that authenticated the age of the automobile,
painting the image of footloose Americans as car travelers, proving that
the going can be as rewarding as the getting there, that life can be lived
on the road as fully as at home. To match the road, Americans invented
diners, tourist cabins, campgrounds, motels, and motor courts that
enabled travelers to park their vehicles beside their doors, and see bill-
board teasers in comic-book colors screaming out roadside attractions
from rattlesnakes to jackalopes (the imaginary fast-moving offspring of
jackrabbits and antelopes). Car lovers even came up with drive-in
restaurants, drive-in movies, and drive-in churches.
The original Route 66 ran “from Chicago to L.A.,” as anyone who’s heard
the Bobby Troup song of the same name knows, but our drive travels
only between Claremore, Oklahoma, and Los Angeles. More recently, the
animated film Cars, which takes place in the fictional town of Radiator
Springs on Route 66, has focused more attention on the Mother Road.
Not all the old roadway remains, so much of the time our route follows 
I-40, which parallels and sometimes covers the original tracks of Route 66.
Getting There
Because Route 66 was also dedicated as the Will Rogers Highway in
1952 to honor the famous humorist, we begin in his hometown of
Claremore, Oklahoma, right on Route 66, and follow it all the way to
Santa Monica, California, where a plaque in Pacific Palisades, at the end

of I-10 commemorates Rogers and the highway. Not far away is Will
Rogers’s beloved California ranch, now a state park and polo field.
Traveling from Claremore to Tulsa is only 20 miles on Route 66 and then
105 more to Oklahoma City. From the city, follow a widened Route 66
out of town and through El Reno and then switch over to I-40, parts of
which can be quite bumpy in this area. Business Route 40, which also is
old 66, detours in the towns of Weatherford, Clinton, Elk City, and
Sayre to enable us to drive segments of the original Route 66 (Oklahoma
has more original miles than any other state) interspersed with I-40 all
the way to Texas. In Texas, the route crosses the panhandle through
Amarillo with more original Route 66 detours at Shamrock, McLean,
Alanreed, Groom, Vega, and Adrian.
In New Mexico, the first major town is Tucumcari, followed by
Moriarity. A few remnants of Route 66 remain in Albuquerque, so
detour through the Nob Hill section near the University of New Mexico,
and then pick up a former stretch of Route 66 from Laguna to Cubero

and between McCartys and Thoreau. The town of Gallup is filled with
the spirit of Route 66 and makes a good place to camp overnight.
In Arizona, the Petrified Forest also retains Route 66 connections, and
so do Holbrook, Joseph City, and Winslow. Rejoin I-40 to go on to
Flagstaff, without forgetting Winona, as the silky voice of Nat King Cole
reminds us in the song, but then get off the interstate to explore more
old Route 66 roadway. One of the longest and smoothest stretches of
Route 66 that’s still around runs from Ash Fork to Kingman with another
rewarding if narrower section from Kingman to Oatman.
In California, a turnoff at Needles travels north to Goffs and then south
to Essex and Amboy before returning north to rejoin I-40 at Ludlow.
Follow I-40 to Barstow and then rejoin old 66 from Barstow through
Hodge, Helendale, and Oro Grande to Victorville. At Victorville, pick
up another interstate, I-15, down the long grade to San Bernardino and
then, if in a hurry, take I-10 to the end of the road at Santa Monica. If you

have time, poke along the 50 miles of Foothill Boulevard still numbered
Route 66 between San Bernardino and Pasadena.
The basic distance is 1,453 miles; some of the detours onto old Route 66
add more miles. (See the “Route 66” map in this chapter.)
Planning Ahead
In general, this stretch of Route 66 can be traveled year-round, but in
winter, snow sometimes falls in the upper elevations of New Mexico and
around Flagstaff. Conversely, summer can be quite hot along parts of the
road in California, Arizona, and the Texas panhandle. Spring can bring
gusty winds in the Texas panhandle and the California and Arizona
deserts. Overall, spring and fall are the best times to travel.
Campground reservations aren’t usually necessary unless you have
your heart set on a particular park. We often decide in early to midafter-
noon how much farther we want to travel, figure how far we’ll get, and
call ahead to a campground in that area to reserve a spot .
When packing, take along hiking boots, rain gear, lightweight clothing
for hot weather (even in winter), and warm clothing for cool days. Sun
block and sunglasses are essential in the bright desert sunlight of the
Southwest. Take binoculars, camera, and film.
Allow at least 7 days but preferably 10 to 14 to make a leisurely tour
along Route 66.
Driving Route 66
Route 66, the Mother Road, the Main Street of America, is also known as
the Will Rogers Highway, so our driving tour begins and ends with the
famous cowboy humorist. A must-see in Claremore, Oklahoma, is the
Will Rogers Memorial Museum, a large and well-displayed collection of
personal possessions, mementos, costumes, and many of Rogers’s 70
films (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Continue along Route 66, which parallels I-44, the Will Rogers Turnpike,
through this part of Oklahoma.
In Tulsa, take I-44 or I-244 to the west side of town to rejoin Route 66 at
Exit 220. This section of the old route is well maintained. Because the
turnpike charges a toll and has limited on and off access, you need to
stay on Route 66 all the way to Oklahoma City, if you don’t want to miss
any of the old landmarks along the way.
In Sapulpa, the Frankoma Pottery Company still makes the classic
Western-style dishes that it originally designed in 1933 (see “Shopping
along the Way,” later in this chapter).
Part V: Seeing the West 
374

Arcadia’s famous Round Barn has been restored and makes a good stop
to admire the details of the roof from the inside and to pick up Route 66
souvenirs. Across the road, Hillbillees Café serves breakfast, lunch, and
dinner in a casual atmosphere with chicken fried steak and fried chicken
(see “Good eats,” later in this chapter). Behind the cafe is a log-cabin
motor court turned offbeat bed-and-breakfast.
Oklahoma City is home to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and
Western Heritage Center, worth a good half-day minimum for cowboy
fans who like art or art aficionados who appreciate cowboys and
Western movies (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). From
the museum, follow I-44 West to Route 66 at Exit 123-B and continue
west. You pass through Yukon, displaying on a water tower its pride in
hometown hero Garth Brooks.
El Reno, the next town you pass, is the home of the onion-fried burger,
where we spent the better part of two different visits sampling them at
four different cafes (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).
Clinton is a major stop, not only for its well-preserved strip of old 66,
which goes right through town past some of the most famous landmarks
of the mother road, but also for its fine Oklahoma Route 66 Museum
(see the “Route 66 museums” sidebar, later in this chapter). On the east
end of town is Pop Hicks’ Restaurant, a Route 66 institution; if you want
to hear some yarns and see some souvenirs, stop there. If you want to
pick up some barbecue to go, pause at Jiggs’ Smoke House just west of
town for some barbecue sandwiches or home-smoked meats. (See
“Good eats,” later in this chapter, for both restaurants.)
Elk City also boasts a National Route 66 Museum (see the “Route 66
museums” sidebar, later in this chapter) as part of its new Old Town
Museum Complex. The lawns are decorated with painted metal kachina
dolls and a textured metal buffalo, an opera house has cutout figures
looking out of the upstairs windows, and a false-front Western town
encourages even Nintendo kids to play cowboys again.
In Texas, Route 66 zips you across the panhandle as slowly or as quickly
as you want. You want to pause in tiny McLean, some 35 miles after you
cross the border, for a look at the beautifully restored 1930s Phillips 66
service station on the west end of town. The Devil’s Rope Museum on
Route 66 at the corner of Kingsley shows examples of barbed wire and
offers a small Route 66 Museum (see the “Route 66 museums” sidebar,
later in this chapter).
The city of Amarillo is the Texas metropolis of Route 66, but the best-
known landmark has been greeting the I-40 traveler for many miles with
billboards advertising a free 72-ounce steak at the Big Texan Steak
Ranch. (Catch onto the catch in “Good eats,” later in this chapter.)
Just west of Amarillo, in plain sight from I-40 and accessible by a desig-
nated turnoff road, is the renowned Cadillac Ranch, erected in 1974. The
Chapter 25: Route 66: OK to L.A. 375

ranch displays ten vintage Cadillacs dating from 1948 to 1964 buried
grill-end first in the dirt with tail fins erect, all planted at the same angle
as the Great Pyramid of Egypt (see “More cool things to see and do,”
later in this chapter).
The town of Santa Rosa also contains a number of Route 66 landmarks,
including the notable Club Café, founded in 1935, closed in 1992, and still
closed the last time we passed through, although the building was still
standing. But Joseph’s, dating back to 1956, still flourishes, selling some
signature dishes from the Club Café, including sourdough biscuits (see
“Good eats,” later in this chapter).
At Clines Corners, off Exit 218, is a Flying C truck stop dating back to
1934 that displays fake rattlesnakes, rubber tomahawks, and paintings
on velvet collected since the 1920s. Neighboring Moriarity is the pinto
bean capital of the world, offering a favorite local recipe of cookies made
with mashed pinto beans and chocolate chips.
In Albuquerque, I-40 zips right through the middle of town, but if you
want to take the time, Central Avenue crosses I-40 on historic Route 66,
passing through scenic Old Town, filled with historic colonial buildings
erected around a plaza, with restaurants and shops featuring New
Mexican foods, arts, and crafts. After Albuquerque, the road skirts sev-
eral Native American communities, including the Isleta lands, Laguna
Pueblo and Mission at Laguna, and the wonderful Acoma Pueblo (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Grants is where a Navajo rancher named Paddy Martinez found uranium
ore in 1950, triggering a latter-day, mini gold rush. Today, Grants is home
Part V: Seeing the West

What rhymes with Albuquerque?
In Albuquerque, you can leave I-40 and drive along Central Avenue to retrace old Route
66, but the eastern end has little to attract you unless used-car dealerships and fast-food
franchises make you nostalgic. The architectural scenery changes as you get to the Nob
Hill area by the University of New Mexico. There you get a strong reminder of the 1930s
and 1940s, especially the roadside service stations that were the lifeline of Route 66.
Look for the 1931 pueblo revival Aztec Motel,3821 Central Ave. NE (%505-254-1742). See
the two former service stations, too — a 1946 modern-style station is now a live music
venue, Club Rhythm & Blues, 3523 Central Ave. NE (% 505-256-0849), and a vintage
Conoco houses the Golden Eagle Trading Company, 3601 Central Ave. NE (% 505-255-
6523). Although the Flying Star, 3416 Central Ave. NE (% 505-255-6633; www.flying
starcafe.com), still known by locals as its former name, the Double Rainbow, isn’t
from the 1930s, it does sell great coffees and desserts. Closer into town, appearing to be
the real thing but reconstructed after a fire in 1995, is the Route 66 Malt Shop & Grill,1720
Central Ave. SW (%505-242-7866; www.route66maltshop.com), in a 1950s Phillips
66 gas station (see “Good eats,” later in this chapter).

to the New Mexico Museum of Mining with a re-created uranium mine
in the basement.
Some 60 miles to the west, Gallup treasures its status as a Route 66 land-
mark city, showcasing the 1937 El Rancho Hotel at 1000 E. Route 66 — a
hangout for Hollywood stars in the 1930s and 1940s.
Arizona, however, is where Route 66 reached the epitome of its 1930s
image, lining its right of way with attractions. At Exit 311 from I-40,
you’re near the Petrified Forest National Park and Painted Desert (see
“Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter).
Holbrook is home to the Wigwam Village, one of only two remaining
motels from a former national chain with cement teepees offered as
sleeping units; the other is in Rialto, California, on Foothill Boulevard,
which also is known as old Route 66. Nearby Joseph City still treasures
the Jack Rabbit Trading Post, the subject of innumerable yellow bill-
boards along Route 66.
Williams, 28 miles farther down I-40 from Flagstaff, is the gateway to the
Grand Canyon. If you want to see the canyon without taking your RV—
you won’t be permitted to drive it along the scenic Rim Road — consider
hopping the Grand Canyon Railway in Williams for a one-day round-
trip by train (see “Must-see attractions,” later in this chapter). You also
find the Williams and Forest Service Visitors Center with a replica of an
old roadside diner that’s a memory bank for travelers along Route 66
(see the “Route 66 museums” sidebar, later in this chapter).
From Ash Fork to Kingman, you want to drive the old route, which par-
allels I-40, making a point to pause at Seligman (pronounced slig-man),
where the Delgadillo brothers have been the driving force behind the
Historic Route 66 Association of Arizona; Angel is the barber, Juan the
proprietor of the Snow Cap Drive-In (see “Good eats,” later in this chap-
ter). The towns of Truxton and Hackberry still house landmark diners
and gas stations. Peach Springs has resurrected some of the old Burma-
Shave signs that lined roadways across the United States.
Kingman remembers native son Andy Devine, a comic sidekick for
cowboy stars, in the Mohave Museum of History and Arts (see “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). Near the museum is the
turnoff on Historic Route 66 National Back Country Byway to Oatman,
where wild burros walk the streets expecting handouts and a few color-
ful gift shops and cafes survive on mostly weekend tourist business (see
the “Kickin’ back in Oatman” sidebar in this chapter).
Needles may be familiar to comic-strip fans as the hometown of

parks (see “Must-see attractions” and “Our favorite campgrounds,”
respectively, later in this chapter).
A few miles farther, movie buffs will want to pull off at Newberry
Springs to see the location of the 1987 film, Bagdad Café (see “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter).
Barstow is endearing for its Mother Road Museum newly installed in the
Casa del Desierto, the original Harvey House Hotel, now the bus and
train depot (see the “Route 66 museums” sidebar, later in this chapter).
The Barstow Station (see “Shopping along the Way,” later in this chap-
ter) is so relentlessly touristy with its tacky souvenirs and fast-food
restaurant housed in old railway cars that you mustn’t miss it.
From Barstow, you can drive the original Route 66 roadway south to
Victorville through Helendale.
The final stretch of Route 66 into Los Angeles, also called Foothill
Boulevard, flies through San Bernardino; Rialto, where the Wigwam
Motel sports teepee-shaped motel units; Arcadia, home of the Art Deco
Santa Anita racetrack; and Pasadena’s Colorado Boulevard where Old
Pasadena has been turned into a row of shops and restaurants. After you
pass Pasadena, don’t attempt to follow the twists and turns of old Route
66 in downtown Los Angeles; little, if any, remains of the color and ambi-
ence. From Pasadena, take the Pasadena Freeway (the 110) to I-10 and
follow that west to Santa Monica and the end of the trail.

Kickin’ back in Oatman
Oatman, founded in 1906, produced $36 million in gold before the federal government
decided in 1942 that gold was not essential to the war effort. Before the 1930s
Depression years, Oatman had a population of 12,000; then it all but disappeared.
Today, the resident numbers are growing again, but the town still is so small that wild
burros roam the streets foraging for handouts from visitors.
Popular on the weekend RV circuit because of its nearness to Laughlin, Nevada, and
Lake Havasu City, Arizona, Oatman hosts swap meets, antiques shops, old saloons,
and such silly annual events as the Labor Day weekend International Burro Biscuit
Throwing Contest. (A clue: These biscuits aren’t made from flour.)
The best time to go is on weekdays because weekend parking can get tight in town, espe-
cially for RVs. To get there: An evocative but narrow and winding part of the original Route
66 runs between Kingman and Oatman over the 3,652-foot Sitgreaves Pass. But the best
route to and from Oatman, if you’re driving or towing a large RV or if narrow, curvy roads
make you nervous, is to stay on I-40 from Kingman to Topock on the Arizona/California
border and drive north on SR 95 to the turnoff on Route 66 to Oatman.

Must-see attractions
Acoma Pueblo
Acoma, New Mexico
Called Sky City, this hilltop pueblo is said to be the oldest continuously
inhabited community in the United States, dating back to A.D. 1250.
Constructed atop a 367-foot sandstone mesa near Grants, the village is
open to visitors daily year-round by guided tour only. A dozen families still
are in residence, although most tribal members have settled in the valley
below. Visitors can purchase Acoma pottery and bread baked in the out-
door adobe ovens. Visitors are not permitted to enter the kiva (sacred
chamber) and need to expect certain camera restrictions, including paying
a fee for using cameras or sketch pads. Allow one or two hours.
66 miles west of Albuquerque. (From I-40, take Exit 102 or Exit 96 and follow the sig-
nage to the visitor center.) % 800-747-0181 or 505-552-7860. www.skycity.com.
RV parking: In the designated lot in the village below Sky City. Admission: $12 adult,
$11.50 seniors, $9 ages 6–17. Open: Daily summer 8 a.m–6 p.m., with the last tour
starting at 5 p.m.; winter 8 a.m.–4 p.m., with the last tour starting at 3 p.m. Closed
Easter weekend, July 10–13, and the first or second weekend in Oct. No one can go
beyond the parking lot in the village below the mesa without joining a tour.
Calico Ghost Town
Calico, California
Extremely popular with European and Japanese Old West aficionados,
Calico isn’t a built-for-tourists ghost town that some people expect but is
rather a real silver-mining town that thrived from 1881 to 1907 with a pop-
ulation of 3,500. Walter Knott of Knott’s Berry Farm fame, who worked in
the mines as a youth, restored and preserved the town, which is operated
today by the San Bernadino County Park System. A modestly priced
county RV park is adjacent to the town entrance; RVers camping on-site
get free admission to the town. Original and reconstructed buildings,
including a house made of glass bottles, sometimes serve as a backdrop
for staged gunfights and other Western shenanigans on weekends and in
summer. Allow a half-day or more.

Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Grand Canyon Railway
Williams, Arizona
A steam train to the Grand Canyon leaves daily at 10 a.m. year-round from
the restored 1908 train station in the town of Williams. Passengers ride the
refurbished 1928 rail cars the 65 miles north to the canyon, have a few
hours for sightseeing, and then return in late afternoon. The town has sev-
eral nice campgrounds if you want to check in for the night. At the canyon,
the train stops near El Tovar Hotel, where frequent shuttle departures set
out to tour the South Rim.
Chapter 25: Route 66: OK to L.A. 379

Taking the train is a good idea because Grand Canyon National Park now
prohibits private vehicles from the entire South Rim — a policy started in
2004. In summer, adequate parking space isn’t always available in the lots
at the entrance, especially for RVs. Allow a full day.
233 N. Grand Canyon Blvd. (just off I-40; you can see the station from the highway).
% 800-843-8724. www.thetrain.com. RV parking: Lot by the station is big enough
for any size RV. Tickets: Choose from five different classes of rail car, with coach to
first class $70–$130 adults, $45–$104 ages 11–16, $35–$95 ages 2–10; top prices are
for the luxurious Parlor Car at $175 adults, $145 children. Prices include tax and
national park entrance fee. Departure: Train leaves Williams at 10 a.m., reaches
Grand Canyon shortly after noon, boards to return at 4 p.m., and arrives back in
Williams at 6:15 p.m. The train doesn’t run when heavy snow covers the tracks.
Reservations recommended.
National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
Framed against the windows at the end of the massive entry hall that
begins your tour, James Earle Fraser’s marble sculpture, End of the Trail,
depicts an Indian warrior, his body slumped in exhaustion and defeat
astride his horse, his lance drooping at the same angle as his horse’s head.
For Fraser, his subject represents the end of an era, the passing of the Old
West. This excellent museum displays outstanding art and artifacts from
the old and new West. Recently added or expanded galleries include the
American Rodeo Gallery, Western Entertainment Gallery with movie
posters and film and video clips, and Prosperity Junction, a life-size replica
of an Old West town. Allow two hours or more.

area in front of the museum. Admission: $8.50 adults, $7 seniors, $4 children 6–12, 5
and under free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Petrified Forest National Park and Painted Desert
I-40 in northeastern Arizona
These two famous Route 66 landmarks lie across the highway from each
other about 25 miles east of Holbrook. A loop road goes through both
areas. Stop first at the visitor center near the entrance to the Petrified
Forest to get a map and some idea of how this landscape was formed. In
the time of the dinosaurs, 225 million years ago, a forest of trees fell into
the water and gradually began to petrify, a process in which quartz
replaces the organic cells of the trees. Allow a half-day.
Tempting as it may be, picking up any pieces of the petrified wood is
against the law and bad luck, as letters on display in the Rainbow Forest
Museum attest; people who picked up rocks returned them after having
unsettling experiences. For those who want to acquire the wood legiti-
mately, samples are for sale at the Crystal Forest Museum in the south-
ern end of the area.

Route 66 museums
All the following museums display artifacts, signs, and photographs of old Route 66 with
varying degrees of sophistication. Our favorite is the Oklahoma Route 66 Museum in
Clinton, Oklahoma, for its multi-gallery re-creation of the highway decade by decade, from
a battered 1920s truck loaded down with family possessions to a painted hippie van of
the 1960s. The new Mother Road Museum, housed in part of the old train station in
Barstow, California, displays license plates, road signs, and a 1926 Dodge Touring Sedan
that drove the highway when the trip was a real adventure. Barbed wire is the main focus
of the Devil’s Rope Museum in McLean, Texas, with the adjoining Route 66 Museum, all
housed in a former bra factory. The Williams and Forest Service Visitors Center in
Williams, Arizona, has a replica of an old diner with a diary for road pilgrims to enter their
experiences on Route 66, and a video showing the highway’s past.

More cool things to see and do
Some of our favorite zany attractions line Route 66, the classic road to
America’s imagination. Where else can you see vintage Cadillacs buried
front-end down to replicate Britain’s Stonehenge or the ghost town of
Calico with its own campground so you can return to the comfort of
your RV after looking for the ghosts.
 Burying the gas guzzlers: At Cadillac Ranch, ten vintage tail-fin
Cadillacs are buried front-end down in an open field on a ranch just
west of Amarillo, Texas, causing the I-40 traffic to slow down and
gape. To pull over, take the Hope Road exit that lets you pull off on
a parking-permitted shoulder from where you can walk across
some 500 yards of often-muddy field to get a closer look. Always
open, always free. Allow 30 minutes if you stop.
 Waking Andy Devine: At the Mohave Museum of History and
Arts, 400 W. Beale St., Kingman, Arizona (% 928-753-3195; www.
ctaz.com/~mocohist/museum), a casual, almost homemade
museum, the city’s favorite son is the main exhibit. He’s the late
film actor Andy Devine, who played comic sidekicks to various
cowboy stars in countless B movies and various TV series, such as
Wild Bill Hickok. Movie posters, a replica of his dressing room, and
costumes he wore fill his part of the museum. Elsewhere, you find
everything from World War II airplane nose art to displays of local
turquoise jewelry. Route 66 souvenirs are for sale in the gift shop.

 Refueling at Bagdad Café: The buses filled with French or German
tourists pull up beside this undistinguished cafe on old Route 66
and pile out with cameras and remarks about how “It’s just like the
movie.” They’re talking about a 1987 film called Bagdad Café star-
ring Jack Palance and Whoopi Goldberg. The movie didn’t fare well
in the United States, but it became a big hit in Europe with a cult
following (hence, the tourists yearning to have a Jack Palance
burger or the Bagdad omelet).
The Bagdad Café is located at 48548 Route 66, Newberry Springs,
California (% 760-257-3101), about 18 miles east of Barstow. It’s
open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Sleeping and Eating on the Road
The original Route 66 pioneered roadside sleeping and eating, but many
of the original establishments that sheltered early tin-can campers, as
they were called, are boarded up, for sale, or long gone. Much of this
journey parallels I-40, which is lined with RV parks and fast-food options
all the way to the coast.
All campgrounds listed are open year-round and have public flush toilets,
showers, and sanitary dump stations unless designated otherwise. Toll-
free numbers, where listed, are for reservations only.

Guests at this campground get free access to the colorful old ghost town

If it didn’t actually invent the hamburger, Route 66 can take credit for
making it popular. You find some historical claims on the Mother Road —
Harold and Rick Bilby, the owners of Weber’s Superior Root Beer
Restaurant, 3817 S. Peoria Ave., Tulsa, Oklahoma (% 918-742-1082; www.
webersoftulsa.com), said their great-grandfather was serving hamburg-
ers in Indian Territory as early as 1891. They failed to say to whom.
The first time we drove Route 66 cross-country in the 1950s, big, juicy
hamburgers could be found everywhere, including in chains like A&W
Root Beer where each franchise made burgers individually. The follow-
ing list includes a few of the best spots along old Route 66 that still make
old-fashioned burgers by hand. 
 Buffalo Inn, 1814 W. Foothill Blvd., Upland, California (% 909-981-
5515): Buffalo burgers are accompanied by buffalo chips (home-
made potato chips) in this college hangout for students at
Claremont Colleges. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Classen Grill, 5124 N. Classen Blvd., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
(% 405-842-0428): A choice of a dozen different toppings crown
the charcoal-grilled burgers, and the breakfasts are notable, too.
Open daily from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 El Reno’s onion-fried burgers: In El Reno, Oklahoma, four local
eateries cook burgers on a grill with thinly sliced onions, pressing
them together as they cook so that the onion caramelizes, turning
the burger and sizzling some more, then popping the whole busi-
ness on a bun, and garnishing it with trimmings that may include
tomatoes, lettuce, mustard, mayonnaise, and/or sliced dill pickles.
We confess being partial to Robert’s because the diner is so tiny
and colorful, and it was the first place that we sampled the onion-
grilled burger. Here’s the skinny on the four restaurants:
• Jobe’s Drive-In, 1220 Sunset Dr. (% 405-262-0194): Open
Monday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.
• Johnnie’s Grill, 301 S. Rock Island Ave. (% 405-262-4721):
Open Monday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Chapter 25: Route 66: OK to L.A. 387

• Robert’s Grill, 300 S. Bickford Ave. (% 405-262-1262): Open
Monday through Saturday from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., Sunday from
11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
• Sid’s Diner, 300 S. Choctaw Ave. (% 405-262-7757): Open
Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
 Emma Jean’s Hollandburger Café, 17143 D St., Victorville, California
(% 760-243-9938; www.hollandburger.com): This old-time diner,
right on old Route 66 in Victorville, serves up classic burgers from
the short-order grill. Open Monday through Friday from 5 a.m. to 
3 p.m. and Saturdays from 6 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Closed Sunday.
 Route 66 Malt Shop & Grill, 1720 Central Ave. SW, Albuquerque,
New Mexico (% 505-242-7866; www.route66maltshop.com):
Burgers are sharp and tasty with blue cheese and green chilies;
order a malt to cool them down. They have two sets of opening
hours, “dead of winter” (about November through March) when
they are open Monday and Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Wednesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and closed
Sunday. The hours expand later in the day as the weather grows
warmer, and you’ll find the shop open as late as 10 p.m. during 
midsummer.
 Snow Cap Drive-In, Route 66, Seligman, Arizona (no phone):
Although Juan Degadillo’s hamburgers are nothing to write home
about, his sense of humor is great; don’t miss a chance to chat with
one of the founding fathers of the revitalized Route 66. Hours are
erratic, but take a chance because even the exterior is worth a
look.
Looking for something other than a hamburger? You’re in luck — several
options await. In addition to those in the list that follows, you may want
to check out Pop Hicks’ Restaurant, 223 W. Gary Blvd., Clinton,
Oklahoma (% 405-323-9718 [payphone]).
 Big Texan Steak Ranch, 7701 I-40 East, Exit 75, Amarillo, Texas 
(% 806-372-6000; www.bigtexan.com): The billboards promise a
free 72-ounce steak, but you have to eat it all, including the side
dishes — shrimp cocktail, baked potato, roll, and green salad — in
less than an hour or you pay $72 for it. Many are called but few can
finish. Open daily from 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
 Hillbillee’s Café, 206 E. Hwy. 66, Arcadia, Oklahoma (% 405-396-
9600): Across the road from the Round Barn, Hillbillee’s fries up
some good chicken and popular chicken-fried steak and serves 
substantial breakfasts that rarely top $5. Open Monday through
Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m.
to 10 p.m., and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Part V: Seeing the West 
388

 Jiggs’ Smoke House, at the Parkersburg Road exit from I-40
between Clinton and Elk City, Oklahoma (no phone): This rustic
little shack by the side of the road sells its own barbecued beef
brisket chopped into sandwiches, along with homemade beef jerky,
sausages, ham, and bacon from the butcher case. Open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed Sunday.
 Joseph’s, 865 Will Rogers Dr., Santa Rosa, New Mexico (% 575-
472-3361): One of the old-time Route 66 stopovers, Joseph’s still
boasts an adjoining gift shop of tacky souvenirs, and a great break-
fast menu that includes breakfast burritos and a spicy carne
adovado (pork and red chilies) with eggs, refried beans, and flour
tortillas. Open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Shopping along the Way
Although you’ll come across numerous shops along Route 66, we want
to point out these two:
 Barstow Amtrak Station, California Welcome Center, East Main
Street off I-15, east of Barstow, California (% 760-253-4782):
Although we normally don’t care for the architecture of McDonald’s,
we make an exception for this one created from vintage railroad
cars and serving as the centerpiece of a tour bus stop and souvenir
stand. Well, it’s more like the mother of all souvenir stands with
items piled on the floors, hanging from the ceiling, and stacked all
around on precarious shelves. Wonderfully tacky, the station’s offer-
ings range from life-size plaster of Paris howling coyotes to plastic
cacti 4 feet tall, Marilyn Monroe cookie jars, and personalized mugs
for every Tom, Dick, and Lupe who happens by. RV parking is in
back of the station where buses and trucks park. Open daily from 
9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
 Frankoma Pottery Company, 2400 Frankoma Rd., Sapulpa,
Oklahoma (% 918-224-5511): From the ridiculous to the sublime.
We coveted the prairie green, wagon-wheel–pattern pitchers from
the first time we ever saw them, and finally, thanks to a factory
visit, we acquired an affordable version. Frankoma has manufac-
tured Western-style pottery since 1933, and the factory in this
suburb of Tulsa has an adjoining museum and outlet store. The
family-owned company offers free plant tours and fantastic budget
buys of factory seconds in another store behind the museum gift
shop. RV parking is available in a lot adjacent to the factory. Open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

In this part . . . 
I
f you get as excited about RVing as we did when we
started — and still are — you may want to add detours or
other drives to the excursions in this book. In this part, we
give additional sightseeing recommendations, from the
enlightened to the hilarious, plus suggestions for ten great
winter getaways for snowbirds seeking warm weather.

Chapter 26
Ten Great Snowbird
Getaways
In This Chapter
 Crossing London Bridge to camp
 Setting up camp near the Walt Disney World Resort
 Sleeping by the beach
O
ne out of every ten RV owners — adding up to about three 
million — is a snowbird who sets out every winter for warmer cli-
mates. Florida and Texas top the list of destinations, followed closely by
California and Arizona.
Most snowbirds already are well traveled and prefer to pick one camp-
ground and stay there for much of the season, venturing out in a tow
automobile or truck for local sightseeing and shopping. The conven-
ience of nearby shopping and restaurant facilities may outweigh scenery
and recreation as considerations.
When you move into a campground for the season, you want to negoti-
ate a lower price than the per-night price that you’d pay for staying a
couple of days. Monthly rates vary from $250 to $500 or more, depend-
ing on the season, the site, the geographic location, the size of your vehi-
cle, and the services that you require. Many campgrounds offer an
additional discount if you stay longer than a month, and all rates are
negotiable in privately owned campgrounds. Public campgrounds, such
as state and national parks, impose a maximum-stay limit, usually
around 14 days, which requires the camper to move out for several
days, a week, or even longer before returning.
Snowbirds on a tight budget can apply to work as volunteer hosts in the
campground in exchange for free camping and perhaps a little salary on
the side for additional chores. (See Chapter 1 for details.)
The following locations are recommended only for winter stays; in most
of them, summer temperatures reach three digits (Fahrenheit).

Lake Havasu City, Arizona
Just across the London Bridge (transported to this site brick by brick
from England) from town, Islander RV Resort, 751 Beachcomber Blvd.
(% 928-680-2000; www.islanderrvresort.com), is set on a man-made
island with 180 full hookup sites (up to 50-amp electric), some with
waterfront locations on the Colorado River. The resort offers plenty to
please RVing snowbirds — an adjacent 18-hole golf course, boat ramps,
fish-cleaning stations, potluck suppers, bingo, dances, exercise classes,
modem connections at your campsite as well as Wi-Fi, and an “English
village” with pubs and half-timbered inns a mile away. Call ahead for pet
restrictions. Weekly full hookup costs $378.
Borrego Springs, California
Not as fancy as the other snowbird hideaways, Borrego Palm Canyon
Campground, 200 Palm Canyon Dr. (% 800-444-7275 or 760-767-4238;
www.anzaborrego.statepark.org), in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park,
is in the quiet country of central San Diego County, 2 miles west of town.
Amenities include 52 full hookups (30-amp electric), handicap access
sites, and a visitor center with a book and map shop. The location at the
edge of the colorful little town of Borrego Springs boasts hiking trails
through the desert and fresh local grapefruit available for pennies. Be
prepared to move in and out because of restrictions on length of stay.
Weekly full hookup costs $150.
Indio, California
Not really a campground, the Outdoor Resorts Motorcoach Country
Club, 80-501 Avenue 48 (% 800-892-2992; www.motorcoachcountry
club.com), has all the amenities of a luxury resort. Although most of the
419 lots are privately owned, many of them are available for overnight or
longer stays. Sites have a concrete pad, many with outdoor bar and bar-
becue and they face the golf course, the lake, or a private view of the
mountains and desert. Three pools are located around the park with the
main pool adjacent to the 10,000-square-foot clubhouse that has a
restaurant, bar, fitness center, and pro shop. The latter serves the 9/18-
hole short golf course that runs through the property. Three lighted
tennis courts are also near the club. Nearby Palm Desert and Palm
Springs offer top restaurants, entertainment, casinos, and premier golf
courses. Full hookup rates vary depending on the site location from $63
to $75 a night, monthly rates run $1,300 to $1,600. RVs are limited to
Class A motorhomes, 30 to 45 feet. To get there from I-10, exit at
Jefferson and travel south across U.S. 11 to Avenue 48; and then go left
one block to the entrance.

Long Beach, California
Golden Shore RV Resort, 101 Golden Shore (% 800-668-3581 or 562-
435-4646; www.goldenshorerv.com), is within walking distance of
public transportation to downtown shopping and restaurants, the
beach, the Queen Mary, the Aquarium of the Pacific, and a lively Friday
morning farmers’ market with fresh fruits and vegetables all winter long.
With only 80 sites, all back-ins, the well-landscaped park is quiet and
makes a good choice for independent people who don’t want to be over-
whelmed by a megaresort. You can take whale-watching tours during
winter, all-day Catalina Island excursions, or meander the bike and
beach path. A golf course is five minutes away; Disneyland and Knotts
Berry Farm are a half-hour away. Weekly full hookup costs $325.
Long Key, Florida
Well-planned but compact, Fiesta Key KOA Resort, Milepost 70, U.S. 1
(% 800-562-7730; www.koa.com), offers some waterfront sites, a tent 
village, and 20 motel units. Swimming pool, hot tubs, bicycle and boat
rentals, and a waterfront pub and seafood grill make this an appealing
location halfway between Miami and Key West. As with other RV resorts
in the Florida Keys, expect higher-than-average fees and some pet
restrictions. It costs $72 to $120 per night; no weekly rate.
Kissimmee, Florida
You can expect plenty of friends and family to visit during winter at
Tropical Palms Fun Resort, 2650 Holiday Trail (% 800-647-2567 or 407-
396-4595; www.tropicalpalmsrv.com), a highly rated RV park border-
ing the Walt Disney World Resort. Bonuses include transportation to all
the local theme parks and discount attraction tickets. Some 400 paved
sites with full hookups have grass and shade, and the resort offers a cen-
tral modem hookup, poolside cafe, heated pool for adults open 24 hours,
kiddie pool, basketball and volleyball, and mobile sewer service. Weekly
full hookup costs $321 to $365.
Pismo Beach, California
California beaches in winter can range from damp and mist-shrouded
with an angry crashing surf to bright golden sunshine on the broad
sandy shores. Whatever it is, it lures RVers year-round. A great snowbird
getaway is Pismo Coast Village RV Resort, 165 S. Doliver St. (% 888-
782-3224; www.pismocoastvillage.com), with 400 dirt sites, some
shaded, all full hookups with 30- and 50-amp electric hookups. It’s
located so that a trek across the dune puts you on the beach with an
expanse that is never crowded. Beside the large recreation hall (with
Chapter 26: Ten Great Snowbird Getaways 395

restaurant) are a large heated pool, general store, large laundry, and a
shop with rental bicycles — tandems and quads. The town is within
walking distance and the campground has instituted wireless Internet
connection. Rates are nightly only, $34 to $51 depending on the season
and day of week; stays are limited to 29 days.
Donna, Texas
South Texas along the Rio Grande River between Brownsville and McAllen
is lined with upscale RV parks, such as Victoria Palms Resort, 602 N.
Victoria Rd. (% 800-551-5303 or 956-464-7801; www.victoriapalms.
com), near Gulf coast beaches and Mexico. Victoria Palms offers more
than 1,000 40-foot-wide pull-through and back-in sites with 628 full
hookups, its own restaurant and motel (handy if you have relatives or
friends who want to visit), instant phone hookups at your site, free cable
TV, a barbershop, a salon, a card room, a billiards room, arts-and-crafts
programs, scenic area tours, an exercise room, live dance bands, a ball-
room, a heated pool, and two heated therapy pools. Weekly full hookup
costs $474.
Mission, Texas
AmeriCana: The Birding Center RV Resort, 721 N. Bentsen Palm Dr. 
(% 956-581-1705; www.americanarvresort.com), is across the street
from a new state park that affords quiet and scenic pleasure. This over-
55 resort has 154 hookups with water, 30- and 50-amp electric, and 50 full
hookups with sewer connections. There are no pull-throughs, but the
wide sites have patios and can handle big rigs. The park features two
sections, with large trees and gravel sites in the older section and small
trees and grass sites in the newer one. A spa and pool area augments the
Spanish-style clubhouse, resplendent in tile, with a large recreation
room that includes a kitchen serving Saturday morning breakfast for the
guests. There’s also an on-site laundry, and you can check your e-mail
via the resort’s Wi-Fi. Weekly full hookup costs $140 plus electric.
South Padre Island, Texas
With 211 full hookup sites, each with its own modem connections and
cable TV, Destination South Padre Island KOA, 1 Padre Blvd., off Queen
Isabella Causeway (% 800-562-9724 or 956-761-5665; www.destination

spa. South Padre Island is a fully developed resort town adjacent to the
commercially developed southern part of the national park. Monthly full
hookups cost $735; nightly fees are $42 to $59.

Ten Cool Factory Tours
In This Chapter
 Sampling Ben & Jerry’s new flavors
 Tasting a Belly Flop
 Watching how they make Winnebagos and more
W
e always take notice of many other RVs in the big parking lots of
manufacturers that offer tours. We do love to see how things are
made. Another plus — most of the tours we describe are free. This chap-
ter includes the nine best factory tours in the United States, and one
Web site that enables you to visit six more.
Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream, Waterbury, Vermont
Tours of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Factory (% 802-882-1240; www.ben
jerry.com) start every 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the season, and
sign-up is on a first-come, first-served basis. Try to avoid visiting on
Sundays and holidays when no ice cream is produced. The tour consists
of a seven-minute “Moovie,” a guided overview of the manufacturing
process, free samples of the day, and finally a shopping op in the scoop
and gift shop. In summer, try to arrive before noon. Allow at least one
hour for the tour.
To get to the factory, located in Waterbury, Vermont, take Exit 10 off I-89
and drive north on SR 100 for 1 mile to the entrance on the left. RV park-
ing is in a designated lot. Admission is $3 adults, $2.50 seniors, and free
for children 12 and younger. Tours run daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., with
longer hours in summer. The factory is closed New Year’s Day,
Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
Cape Cod Potato Chips, Hyannis, Massachusetts
The Cape Cod Potato Chip Company, 100 Breeds Hill Rd. (% 888-881-
2447 or 508-775-3206; www.capecodchips.com), bagged only 200 pack-
ages a day in 1980. Today, the factory still uses the same kettle-cooking
method to turn out 200,000 bags in the same amount of time. Watch the
crispy, salty, kettle-cooked chips go through their production lines into

six kettles filled with sizzling oil, after which you see chips drained,
cooled, and packaged. You get a free package of your choice of chips at
the end of the tour. Allow one hour.
The factory is located off SR 132 South near the airport. RV parking is in
a large open lot behind the factory. Admission is free. Self-guided tours
run Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Closed holidays.
Crayola Crayons, Easton, Pennsylvania
We’d like to say that you’re watching the real Binney & Smith assembly
line at the Crayola Factory, 30 Centre Square (% 610-515-8000; www.
crayola.com/factory), but this handsome, visitor-friendly facility is
just a demonstration of how Crayola manufactures your favorite
crayons. Built several years ago when the factory itself got swamped
with visitors, this facility is designed for families, and so are the hands-
on coloring and crafts areas for kids. The presentations usually hold
adults as spellbound as their offspring. Souvenirs can be purchased at
the General Store gift shop and the big Crayola Store next door.
This attraction also is the home of the National Canal Museum, which
offers a 40-minute canal boat ride from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission to both the museum and
the Crayola factory is $9.50 adults and children 3 and up, $9 seniors, and
free for children 2 and under. It’s open Tuesday through Saturday from
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Allow two hours, more if you
do the Canal Museum and boat ride.
Hallmark Greeting Cards, Kansas City, Missouri
More a museum than a factory tour, the Hallmark Visitors Center,
Crown Center Complex, 1 mile south of downtown off Grand Avenue and
25th Street (% 816-274-3613; hallmarkvisitorscenter.com), show-
cases its famous cards with 14 exhibits, a keyhole walk-through leading
to a gigantic artist’s drawing board, and displays of company products.
Allow two hours.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free. Self-guided tours
are Tuesday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday 9:30 a.m. to
4:30 p.m.; closed holidays.
Jelly Belly Jellybeans, Fairfield, California
The Jelly Belly Candy Company, 2400 N. Watney Way (% 707-428-2800;
www.jellybelly.com), offers our hands-down favorite of all the factory
tours in the United States. Here you can watch the candies being made
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
398

on the assembly line and taste them at different stages, get free samples
at the end of the tour, and buy low-price factory rejects called Belly
Flops, which usually are two jellybeans that fused together during the
process. Jelly Belly jellybeans are the favorites of knowledgeable candy
lovers like former President Ronald Reagan, because the fillings are fla-
vored in addition to the candy coatings on the outside. The tour also
includes a collection of portraits of famous people, including Reagan,
made from jellybeans. Guided tours set out frequently from the main
desk. Allow one hour.
To get to the factory, take the SR 12 exit from I-80 and follow the signs.
RV parking is available in a huge lot. Admission is free. Half-hour walking
tours run daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. No production line runs on week-
ends, holidays, the last week of June, or first week of July; a video shows
the production line at these times.
Louisville Sluggers, Louisville, Kentucky
Fans of America’s favorite pastime enjoy the Louisville Slugger Museum,
800 W. Main St. (% 877-775-8443; www.sluggermuseum.org). First, walk
through the museum that salutes famous sluggers, and then see the bat-
making itself. Some 95 percent of the bats are machine made, but a few
special orders still are hand turned. A hot brand sizzles the mark, model
number, and player’s autograph into the wood. Allow two hours.
To get to there, take the Third Street exit from I-64 West, turn right on
River Road, turn left on Eighth Street, and look for the world’s tallest
baseball bat. RV parking is available in a designated lot. Admission is $9
adults, $8 seniors, $4 ages 6 to 12, free for children 5 and under. Ninety-
minute tours run Monday through Saturday starting at 9 a.m., with the
last factory tour leaving at 4 p.m.
Sechler’s Pickles, St. Joe, Indiana
You discover that there’s more to making pickles than you thought as
you’re guided around the huge vats that stand in the yard outside the
family-owned Sechler’s Pickle Factory, 5686 SR 1 (% 800-332-5461 or
260-337-5461; www.gourmetpickles.com), where pickles may spend as
long as a year marinating. Then you can watch the cooking and process-
ing, and finally the bottling. Different types of pickles are made on differ-
ent days. Taste free samples and select pickles to purchase in the
showroom. Allow one hour.
RV parking is in a large lot outside the factory. Admission is free. Tours
run April through October Monday through Friday from 9 to 11 a.m. and
12:30 to 2 p.m. Open year-round except holidays.

Tabasco Sauce, Avery Island, Louisiana
The world’s most-famous hot sauce was invented on this plantation just
after the Civil War and has been made here ever since. Although the pep-
pers come from around the world, the sauce is made only here at the
McIlhenny Company (% 337-365-8173; www.tabasco.com) on Avery
Island. You can watch the sauce being bottled and the bottles labeled
and packed into shipping boxes. You get a miniature bottle of Tabasco
and some recipes at the end of the tour. The gift shop is full of cool sou-
venirs with the Tabasco logo. Allow one hour.
To get there, take I-10 West from New Orleans to Exit 103A and then U.S.

Virtual Factory Tours with Mr. Rogers
Here’s a group of factory tours that you can take without leaving your
campsite — if you have a computer. You can see how people make
sneakers, wagons, plates, construction paper, crayons, and even fortune
cookies. Granted, this site is designed for kids, but even grown-ups can
learn a thing or two. Visit www.pbskids.org to join the late Fred Rogers
from Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood as he narrates information about each
of the featured factories. You can explore the factories via video, slides,
or just narration depending on what kind of software you have. Open
year-round 24/7.
Winnebago Motorhomes, Forest City, Iowa
The Winnebego Industries, Inc., Visitors Center, 1316 S. Fourth St. 
(% 641-585-3535; www.winnebagoind.com), offers tours of the world’s
largest production plant. You follow a catwalk around the plant for a
bird’s-eye view of the manufacturing process, watching motorhomes
move down assembly lines at 21 inches a minute. The dramatic finish
is when each unit is tested in a simulated rainstorm along a pothole-
studded roadway while standing still. You can buy logo caps and jack-
ets in the gift shop. Allow two hours.
To get there, take the SR 9 exit off I-35 and then turn south on SR 69 to

Chapter 28
Ten Zany Museums
In This Chapter
 Flushing out the history of plumbing
 Cutting the mustard in Wisconsin
 Discovering the truth about Spam and more
W
e’ve been visiting zany museums for years. These off-the-wall
attractions always get plenty of attention when we’re traveling
around the country talking about our RV travel books; now and then, we
surprise local radio or TV interviewers by mentioning one in their own
backyards that they’ve never heard of.
Fans of these zany spots may also want to take note of the Moxie Museum
at the Moxie Bottling Company (Chapter 12), the Lucy-Desi Museum and
the Jell-O Gallery (both in Chapter 13), the Key Underwood Coon Dog
Memorial Graveyard (Chapter 16), the Judy Garland Museum and the
Greyhound Bus Origin Museum (both in Chapter 19), and the
International UFO Museum & Research Center (Chapter 22)
American Sanitary Plumbing Museum,
Worcester, Massachusetts
The American Sanitary Plumbing Museum, 39 Piedmont St., Worcester,
Massachusetts (% 508-754-9453), is a collection of pipes, toilets, and
lavatories attracts wannabe plumbers and appreciators of toilet humor.
One item, perhaps an early dishwasher, is an electric sink with an agita-
tor that washed dishes. Allow 30 minutes unless you’re a plumber.
The museum is off I-290 in the town center, and RV parking is available
on the street. Admission is free. It’s open January through June and
September through December Tuesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 
2 p.m.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
402
Colonel Harland Sanders Cafe/Museum,
Corbin, Kentucky
The original Colonel Sanders Kentucky Fried Chicken Cafe, at the junc-
tion of U.S. 25E and U.S. 25W in Corbin, Kentucky (% 606-528-2163), has
been turned into a museum but retains a branch of KFC on the premises.
Colonel Sanders came up with his pressure-cooker-fried chicken in 1940,
and the world beat a path to his door until the highway system rerouted
the main road. Then he took to the road himself to sell his cooking
method to franchisees. (The museum is interesting, but the fried chicken
that we sampled wasn’t as good as at some other franchises.) Allow one
hour.
To get there, take Exit 29 from I-75 and drive south on U.S. 25E for 1 mile
and then west on U.S. 25W for a half-mile. RV parking is available in a
large lot. Admission is free. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Circus City Festival Museum, Peru, Indiana
Peru, Indiana, is usually associated with composer Cole Porter, but it was
also the former winter quarters for Hagenback-Wallace, Clyde Beatty,
Emmett Kelly, and other members of the American circus troupe. In the
Circus City Festival Museum, Circus City Center, 154 N. Broadway, Peru,
Indiana (% 765-472-3918; www.perucircus.com), you’ll find mementos
of those days with posters, costumes, trapezes, and show wagons. Every
July, a youth circus performs in the town, which is filled with clowns.
Allow an hour unless you have a secret desire to be a clown.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is by donation. It’s open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Miss Laura’s Bordello, Fort Smith, Arkansas
Claiming to be the only bordello listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, Miss Laura’s, 2 N. B St., Fort Smith, Arkansas (% 800-
637-1477 or 479-783-8888; www.fortsmith.org), doubles as a museum
and the visitor center for Fort Smith and was recently refurbished to
look the way it did at the turn of the 20th century. Allow one hour, unless
you’re a fast worker.
RV parking is available in an adjacent lot and on the street. Admission is
free. The visitor center is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to
4 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 4:30 p.m.

Metropolis, Illinois
The only town in the United States named Metropolis decided to claim
Superman as well and turn itself into a kind of living museum. The town
put a 9-foot statue of the Man of Steel in its square, hired an actor to
wear the costume, erected giant billboards, painted the hero on the
water tower, and set up a phone booth where you can lift the receiver
and get a message from Superman. You can also pick up a copy of the
local newspaper: The Daily Planet, of course. A gift shop/museum on the
square is named Super Museum. In the spring of 2001, the actor who
plays Superman donned the costume and married his sweetheart by the
statue in the square. (Her name wasn’t Lois Lane, however.)
Metropolis, Illinois, is in the southern tip of Illinois on U.S. 45 about 12
miles northwest of Paducah, Kentucky, on the Ohio River. For more
information on the town, contact the Metropolis Chamber of Commerce
(% 800-949-5740; www.metropolischamber.com).
Mount Horeb Mustard Museum, Wisconsin
Mount Horeb Mustard Museum, 100 W. Main St., Mount Horeb, Wisconsin
(% 608-437-3986; www.mustardweb.com), a combination museum/shop,
stocks more than 2,500 kinds of mustard, which makes browsing the
shelves an education in condiments. The owner, enthusiastic Barry
Levenson, also publishes a newsletter, expounds on the history of mus-
tard, quotes Shakespeare on mustard (“Good Master Mustardseed, I know
your patience well”), and sells T-shirts and banners from his trademarked
Mustard College, Poupon U. Allow one hour, more if Barry is in residence.
RV parking is available on the street. Admission is free. It’s open daily
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame,
Hayward, Wisconsin
Talk about Jonah! At the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, Hall
of Fame Drive, Hayward, Wisconsin (% 715-634-4440; www.freshwater-
fishing.org), you walk through a four-story giant muskie and stand in
his open jaw, which is a balcony overlooking several other giant Fiberglas
fish. Equally bizarre is a collection of several thousand fishhooks that
doctors have retrieved from the flesh of fishermen; each case is carefully
documented.
The museum is located near the junction of SR 63 and SR B, and RV park-
ing is available in a large designated lot. Admission is $6.50 adults, $3.75
ages 10 to 17, $2.75 ages 9 and younger. It’s open April 15 through October
30 daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 28: Ten Zany Museums 403

Pest House Medical Museum, 
Lynchburg, Virginia
The morbid and medical-minded can visit this complex of three museums
and a cemetery. In the 19th century, patients were quarantined in the
Pest House. Then, when they almost inevitably died, their bodies were
buried in the Old City Cemetery, which dates from the Confederate era.
Now a museum, the Pest House contains an 1860s hypodermic needle
and an early chloroform mask, among other weird stuff; visitors look in
the windows and listen to recordings. Also on-site are the Victorian
Mourning Museum with wreaths and decorations made from the hair of
the deceased, and the 1898 C & O Station House. Allow one hour.
The Pest House Medical Museum is at 401 Taylor St., Lynchburg, Virginia
(% 434-847-1465; www.gravegarden.org). RV parking is available on
the street along the 1-mile loop road through the cemetery. Admission is
free. It’s open from dawn to dusk. Interior guided tours are available by
appointment.
Shady Dell RV Park and Campground, 
Bisbee, Arizona
The Shady Dell RV Park and Campground, 1 Douglas Rd., Bisbee,
Arizona (% 520-432-3567; www.theshadydell.com), just off the U.S. 80
traffic circle 11⁄2 miles east of town, is an outdoor museum of vintage
Airstream trailers that rent by the night and are furnished with period
furniture and cassettes from the Big Band era. You’re welcome to drive
up in your own RV and take a look. The campground also displays a ter-
rific diner done up in 1930s style.
Spam Museum, Austin, Minnesota
Spam stands for “spiced ham,” a 64-year-old American icon and lunch-
eon meat that made history in Army mess kitchens during World War II
and is a daily staple on the menus of Hawaii. At the Spam Museum, 1101
N. Main St., Austin, Minnesota (% 800-588-7726; www.hormel.com),
interactive exhibits include a simulated production line that visitors can
join, wearing rubber gloves and a hard hat; a game show about meat
trivia; and a survey of Spam around the world. Allow one hour or longer.
The museum is off I-90 via the Fourth Street exit. RV parking is available in
a designated lot. Admission is free. It’s open Monday through Saturday
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. Closed holidays.

RV and Campground Lingo
In the same way that a potential home buyer must figure out the
abbreviated language for real estate classified listings — 6 rms riv vu
(six rooms with river view), for instance — an RVer wants to know
certain terms that are peculiar to owning and operating recreation
vehicles. Some of the more common ones are as follows:
 Auxiliary battery: Extra battery to run 12-volt equipment.
 Basement model: An RV with large storage areas underneath a
raised chassis.
 Black water: Wastewater from the toilet.
RV Vacations For Dummies, 4th Edition

 Cabover: The part of a mini-motorhome (see Chapter 6 for RV
types) that overlaps the top of the vehicle’s cab, usually contain-
ing a sleeping area, storage unit, or entertainment center.
 Camper shell: Removable unit to fit in the bed of a pickup truck.
 Curbside: The side of the RV that’s at the curb when parked.
 Diesel pusher: A motorhome with a rear diesel engine.
 Dual electrical system: An RV system in which lights and other
electrical systems can run on 12-volt battery power, 110 AC elec-
trical hookup, or gas generator.
 Dump station: Also called sanitary dump or disposal station;
where an RV empties the gray water (wastewater from sinks and
shower) and black water (wastewater from toilet) from its hold-
ing tanks.
 Full hookup: A campsite that provides connections for electric-
ity, water, and sewage.
 Generator: Small engine fueled by gasoline or propane that pro-
duces 110-volt electricity that’s built into many RVs but also
available as a portable option.
 Gray water: Wastewater from the sinks and shower.
 Hard-sided: RV walls made of aluminum or other hard surface.
 Hitch: The fastening unit that joins a movable vehicle, such as a
towable RV, to the vehicle that pulls it.
 Holding tanks: Tanks that retain black water (wastewater from
toilet) and gray water (wastewater from sinks and shower) when
the RV unit isn’t connected to a sewer.
 Hookups: The land connections at a campsite for electricity,
water, and sewage; sites that offer all three connections are
called full hookups, sites that offer only one or two of three con-
nections are called partial hookups.
 Inverter: A unit that changes 12-volt direct current to 110-volt
alternating current to enable operation of computers, TV sets,
and other electrical devices when an RV isn’t hooked up to 
electricity.
 Leveling: Positioning the RV in camp so the rig is level, using
ramps (also called levelers) placed under the wheels, built-in
scissors jacks, or power-leveling jacks.
 Overflow area: That part of a campground that can handle late
arrivals when all the regular sites are filled; the area usually is
little more than a parking lot or open field.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 409

 Partial hookups: Sites that offer one or two of the three land
connections for electricity, water, and sewage.
 Pop-up: Foldout or raised additions to an RV that add height for
standing room.
 Propane: Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used for heating, cook-
ing, and refrigeration in RVs.
 Pull-through: A campground site that enables the driver to 
pull the RV forward into the site for camping and then drive 
out of the site on the other end to leave, without ever having to
back up.
 Self-contained: An RV that needs no external connections to
provide short-term cooking, bathing, and heating functions.
 Shore cord: The external electrical cord that connects the vehi-
cle to a campground electrical hookup.
 Slide out: A portion of the vehicle that slides open when the RV
is parked to expand the living and/or bedroom area. If the RV is
parked in a narrow area or there is a tree in the way, you can
keep the slide out closed or perhaps only open it partway.
 Snowbird: Resident of a cold climate who takes an RV and
moves south to a warm climate for the winter.
 Spirit level: A device used for determining an even horizontal or
vertical plane by centering a bubble in a slightly curved glass
tube or tubes filled with alcohol or ether. Some RVs come with
built-in levels.

when the RV is parked in a campground.
