Preface to the Second Edition
Our aim in writing the original edition of Numerical Recipes was to provide a
book that combined general discussion, analytical mathematics, algorithmics, and
actual working programs. The success of the ï¬rst edition puts us now in a difï¬cult,
though hardly unenviable, position. We wanted, then and now, to write a book
that is informal, fearlessly editorial, unesoteric, and above all useful. There is a
danger that, if we are not careful, we might produce a second edition that is weighty,
balanced, scholarly, and boring.
It is a mixed blessing that we know more now than we did six years ago. Then,
we were making educated guesses, based on existing literature and our own research,
about whichnumerical techniqueswere the most important and robust. Now, we have
the beneï¬t of direct feedback from a large reader community. Letters to our alter-ego
enterprise, Numerical Recipes Software, are in the thousands per year. (Please, donât
telephone us.) Our post ofï¬ce box has become a magnet for letters pointing out
that we have omitted some particular technique, well known to be important in a
particular ï¬eld of science or engineering. We value such letters, and digest them
carefully, especially when they point us to speciï¬c references in the literature.
The inevitable result of this input is that this Second Edition of Numerical
Recipes is substantially larger than its predecessor, in fact about 50% larger both in
words and number of included programs (the latter now numbering well over 300).
âDonât let the book grow in size,â is the advice that we received from several wise
colleagues. We have tried to follow the intended spirit of that advice, even as we
violate the letter of it. We have not lengthened, or increased in difï¬culty, the bookâs
principal discussions of mainstream topics. Many new topics are presented at this
same accessible level. Some topics, both from the earlier edition and new to this
one, are now set in smaller type that labels them as being âadvanced.â The reader
who ignores such advanced sections completely will not, we think, ï¬nd any lack of
continuity in the shorter volume that results.
Here are some highlights of the new material in this Second Edition:
â¢ a new chapter on integral equations and inverse methods
â¢ a detailed treatment of multigrid methods for solving elliptic partial
differential equations
â¢ routines for band diagonal linear systems
â¢ improved routines for linear algebra on sparse matrices
â¢ Cholesky and QR decomposition
â¢ orthogonal polynomials and Gaussian quadratures for arbitrary weight
functions
â¢ methods for calculating numerical derivatives
â¢ PadÂ´e approximants, and rational Chebyshev approximation
â¢ Bessel functions, and modiï¬ed Bessel functions, of fractional order; and
several other new special functions
â¢ improved random number routines
â¢ quasi-random sequences
â¢ routines for adaptive and recursive Monte Carlo integration in high-
dimensional spaces
â¢ globally convergent methods for sets of nonlinear equations

Acknowledgments
It is not possible for us to list by name here all the readers who have made
useful suggestions; we are grateful for these. In the text, we attempt to give speciï¬c
attribution for ideas that appear to be original, and not known in the literature. We
apologize in advance for any omissions.
Some readers and colleagues have been particularly generous in providing
us with ideas, comments, suggestions, and programs for this Second Edition.
We especially want to thank George Rybicki, Philip Pinto, Peter Lepage, Robert
Lupton, Douglas Eardley, Ramesh Narayan, David Spergel, Alan Oppenheim, Sallie
Baliunas, Scott Tremaine, Glennys Farrar, Steven Block, John Peacock, Thomas
Loredo, Matthew Choptuik, Gregory Cook, L. Samuel Finn, P. Deuï¬hard, Harold
Lewis, Peter Weinberger, David Syer, Richard Ferch, Steven Ebstein, Bradley
Keister, and William Gould. We have been helped by Nancy Lee Snyderâs mastery
of a complicated TEX manuscript. We express appreciation to our editors Lauren
Cowles and Alan Harvey at Cambridge University Press, and to our production
editor Russell Hahn. We remain, of course, grateful to the individuals acknowledged
in the Preface to the First Edition.
Special acknowledgment is due to programming consultant Seth Finkelstein,
who wrote, rewrote, or inï¬uenced many of the routines in this book, as well as in
its FORTRAN-language twin and the companion Example books. Our project has
beneï¬ted enormously from Sethâs talent for detecting, and followingthe trail of, even
very slight anomalies (often compiler bugs, but occasionally our errors), and from
his good programming sense. To the extent that this edition of Numerical Recipes
in C has a more graceful and âC-likeâ programming style than its predecessor, most
of the credit goes to Seth. (Of course, we accept the blame for the FORTRANish
lapses that still remain.)
We prepared this book for publication on DEC and Sun workstations run-
ning the UNIX operating system, and on a 486/33 PC compatible running
MS-DOS 5.0/Windows 3.0.

Emacs, TEX, Perl, Adobe Illustrator, and PostScript. Also used were a variety of C
compilers â too numerous (and sometimes too buggy) for individual acknowledg-
ment. It is a sobering fact that our standard test suite (exercising all the routines
in this book) has uncovered compiler bugs in many of the compilers tried. When
possible, we work with developers to see that such bugs get ï¬xed; we encourage
interested compiler developers to contact us about such arrangements.

Preface to the First Edition
We call this book Numerical Recipes for several reasons. In one sense, this book
is indeed a âcookbookâ on numerical computation. However there is an important
distinction between a cookbook and a restaurant menu. The latter presents choices
among complete dishes in each of which the individual ï¬avors are blended and
disguised. The former â and this book â reveals the individual ingredients and
explains how they are prepared and combined.
Another purpose of the title is to connote an eclectic mixture of presentational
techniques. This book is unique, we think, in offering, for each topic considered,
a certain amount of general discussion, a certain amount of analytical mathematics,
a certain amount of discussion of algorithmics, and (most important) actual imple-
mentations of these ideas in the form of working computer routines. Our task has
been to ï¬nd the right balance among these ingredients for each topic. You will
ï¬nd that for some topics we have tilted quite far to the analytic side; this where we
have felt there to be gaps in the âstandardâ mathematical training. For other topics,
where the mathematical prerequisites are universally held, we have tilted towards
more in-depth discussion of the nature of the computational algorithms, or towards
practical questions of implementation.
We admit, therefore, to some unevenness in the âlevelâ of this book. About half
of it is suitable for an advanced undergraduate course on numerical computation for
science or engineering majors. The other half ranges from the level of a graduate
course to that of a professional reference. Most cookbooks have, after all, recipes at
varying levels of complexity. An attractive feature of this approach, we think, is that
the reader can use the book at increasing levels of sophisticationas his/her experience
grows. Even inexperienced readers should be able to use our most advanced routines
as black boxes. Having done so, we hope that these readers will subsequently go
back and learn what secrets are inside.
If there is a single dominant theme in this book, it is that practical methods
of numerical computation can be simultaneously efï¬cient, clever, and â important
â clear.
The alternative viewpoint, that efï¬cient computational methods must
necessarily be so arcane and complex as to be useful only in âblack boxâ form,
we ï¬rmly reject.
Our purpose in this book is thus to open up a large number of computational
black boxes to your scrutiny. We want to teach you to take apart these black boxes
and to put them back together again, modifying them to suit your speciï¬c needs.
We assume that you are mathematically literate, i.e., that you have the normal
mathematical preparation associated with an undergraduate degree in a physical
science, or engineering, or economics, or a quantitative social science. We assume
that you know how to program a computer. We do not assume that you have any
prior formal knowledge of numerical analysis or numerical methods.
The scope of Numerical Recipes is supposed to be âeverything up to, but
not including, partial differential equations.â We honor this in the breach: First,
we do have one introductory chapter on methods for partial differential equations
(Chapter 19). Second, we obviouslycannot include everything else. All the so-called
âstandardâ topics of a numerical analysis course have been included in this book:

linear equations (Chapter 2), interpolation and extrapolation (Chaper 3), integration
(Chaper 4), nonlinear root-ï¬nding (Chapter 9), eigensystems (Chapter 11), and
ordinary differential equations (Chapter 16). Most of these topics have been taken
beyond their standard treatments into some advanced material which we have felt
to be particularly important or useful.
Some other subjects that we cover in detail are not usually found in the standard
numerical analysis texts. These include the evaluation of functions and of particular
special functions of higher mathematics (Chapters 5 and 6); random numbers and
Monte Carlo methods (Chapter 7); sorting (Chapter 8); optimization, including
multidimensional methods (Chapter 10); Fourier transform methods, including FFT
methods and other spectral methods (Chapters 12 and 13); two chapters on the
statistical description and modeling of data (Chapters 14 and 15); and two-point
boundary value problems, both shooting and relaxation methods (Chapter 17).
The programs in this book are included in ANSI-standard C. Versions of the
book in FORTRAN, Pascal, and BASIC are available separately.
We have more
to say about the C language, and the computational environment assumed by our
routines, in Â§1.1 (Introduction).
Acknowledgments
Many colleagues have been generous in giving us the beneï¬t of their numerical
and computational experience, in providing us with programs, in commenting on
the manuscript, or in general encouragement. We particularly wish to thank George
Rybicki, Douglas Eardley, Philip Marcus, Stuart Shapiro, Paul Horowitz, Bruce
Musicus, Irwin Shapiro, Stephen Wolfram, Henry Abarbanel, Larry Smarr, Richard
Muller, John Bahcall, and A.G.W. Cameron.
We also wish to acknowledge two individuals whom we have never met:
Forman Acton, whose 1970 textbook Numerical Methods that Work (New York:
Harper and Row) has surely left its stylistic mark on us; and Donald Knuth, both for
his series of books on The Art of Computer Programming (Reading, MA: Addison-
Wesley), and for TEX, the computer typesetting language which immensely aided
production of this book.
Research by the authors on computational methods was supported in part by
the U.S. National Science Foundation.

password immediately, on-line, from the On-Line Store, with fees ranging from
$50 (PC, Macintosh, educational institutionsâ UNIX) to $140 (general UNIX).
Downloading the packaged software from the On-Line Store is also the way to
start if you want to acquire a more general (multiscreen, site, or corporate) license.
â¢ You can purchase media containing the programs from Cambridge University
Press. Diskette versions are available in IBM-compatible format for machines
running Windows 3.1, 95, or NT. CDROM versions in ISO-9660 format for PC,
Macintosh, and UNIX systems are also available; these include both C and Fortran
versions on a single CDROM (as well as versions in Pascal and BASIC from the
ï¬rst edition). Diskettes purchased from Cambridge University Press include a
single-screen license for PC or Macintosh only. The CDROM is available with
a single-screen license for PC or Macintosh (order ISBN 0 521 576083), or (at a
slightly higher price) with a single-screen license for UNIX workstations (order
ISBN 0 521 576075). Orders for media from Cambridge University Press can
be placed at 800 872-7423 (North America only) or by email to orders@cup.org
(North America) or trade@cup.cam.ac.uk (rest of world). Or, visit the Web sites

Types of License Offered
Here are the types of licenses that we offer.
Note that some types are
automatically acquired with the purchase of media from Cambridge University
Press, or of an unlocking password from the Numerical Recipes On-Line Software
Store, while other types of licenses require that you communicate speciï¬cally with
Numerical Recipes Software (email: orders@nr.com or fax: 781 863-1739). Our
Web site http://www.nr.com has additional information.
â¢ [âImmediate Licenseâ] If you are the individual owner of a copy of this book and
you type one or more of its routines into your computer, we authorize you to use
them on that computer for your own personal and noncommercial purposes. You
are not authorized to transfer or distribute machine-readable copies to any other
person, or to use the routines on more than one machine, or to distribute executable
programs containing our routines. This is the only free license.
â¢ [âSingle-Screen Licenseâ] This is the most common type of low-cost license, with
terms governed by our Single Screen (Shrinkwrap) License document (complete
terms available through ourWeb site). Basically, this license lets you use Numerical
Recipes routines on any one screen (PC, workstation, X-terminal, etc.). You may
also, under this license, transfer pre-compiled, executable programs incorporating
our routines to other, unlicensed, screens or computers, providing that (i) your
application is noncommercial (i.e., does not involve the selling of your program
for a fee), (ii) the programs were ï¬rst developed, compiled, and successfully run
on a licensed screen, and (iii) our routines are bound into the programs in such a
manner that they cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably
be unbound and used in other programs. That is, under this license, your program
user must not be able to use our programs as part of a program library or âmix-and-
matchâ workbench. Conditions for other types of commercial or noncommercial
distribution may be found on our Web site (http://www.nr.com).
â¢ [âMulti-Screen, Server, Site, and Corporate Licensesâ] The terms of the Single
Screen License can be extended to designated groups of machines, deï¬ned by
number of screens, number of machines, locations, or ownership.
Signiï¬cant
discounts from the corresponding single-screen prices are available when the
estimated number of screens exceeds 40. Contact Numerical Recipes Software
(email: orders@nr.com or fax: 781 863-1739) for details.
â¢ [âCourse Right-to-Copy Licenseâ]Instructors at accredited educationalinstitutions
who have adopted this book for a course, and who have already purchased a Single
Screen License (either acquired with the purchase of media, or from the Numerical
Recipes On-Line Software Store), may license the programs for use in that course
as follows: Mail your name, title, and address; the course name, number, dates,
and estimated enrollment; and advance payment of $5 per (estimated) student
to Numerical Recipes Software, at this address: P.O. Box 243, Cambridge, MA
02238 (USA). You will receive by return mail a license authorizing you to make
copies of the programs for use by your students, and/or to transfer the programs to
a machine accessible to your students (but only for the duration of the course).
About Copyrights on Computer Programs
Like artistic or literary compositions, computer programs are protected by
copyright. Generally it is an infringement for you to copy into your computer a
program from a copyrighted source. (It is also not a friendly thing to do, since it
deprives the programâs author of compensation for his or her creative effort.) Under

copyright law, all âderivative worksâ (modiï¬ed versions, or translations into another
computer language) also come under the same copyright as the original work.
Copyright does not protect ideas, but only the expression of those ideas in
a particular form.
In the case of a computer program, the ideas consist of the
programâs methodology and algorithm, including the necessary sequence of steps
adopted by the programmer. The expression of those ideas is the program source
code (particularly any arbitrary or stylistic choices embodied in it), its derived object
code, and any other derivative works.
If you analyze the ideas contained in a program, and then express those
ideas in your own completely different implementation, then that new program
implementation belongs to you. That is what we have done for those programs in
this book that are not entirely of our own devising. When programs in this book are
said to be âbasedâ on programs published in copyright sources, we mean that the
ideas are the same. The expression of these ideas as source code is our own. We
believe that no material in this book infringes on an existing copyright.

The fact that ideas are legally âfree as airâ in no way supersedes the ethical
requirement that ideas be credited to their known originators. When programs in
this book are based on known sources, whether copyrighted or in the public domain,
published or âhanded-down,â we have attempted to give proper attribution. Unfor-
tunately, the lineage of many programs in common circulation is often unclear. We
would be grateful to readers for new or corrected information regarding attributions,
which we will attempt to incorporate in subsequent printings.

Chapter 1.
Preliminaries
1.0 Introduction
This book, like its predecessor edition, is supposed to teach you methods of
numerical computing that are practical, efï¬cient, and (insofar as possible) elegant.
We presume throughout this book that you, the reader, have particular tasks that you
want to get done. We view our job as educating you on how to proceed. Occasionally
we may try to reroute you brieï¬y onto a particularly beautiful side road; but by and
large, we will guide you along main highways that lead to practical destinations.
Throughout this book, you will ï¬nd us fearlessly editorializing, telling you
what you should and shouldnât do. This prescriptive tone results from a conscious
decision on our part, and we hope that you will not ï¬nd it irritating. We do not
claim that our advice is infallible! Rather, we are reacting against a tendency, in
the textbook literature of computation, to discuss every possible method that has
ever been invented, without ever offering a practical judgment on relative merit. We
do, therefore, offer you our practical judgments whenever we can. As you gain
experience, you will form your own opinion of how reliable our advice is.
We presume that you are able to read computer programs in C, that being
the language of this version of Numerical Recipes (Second Edition).
The book
Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN (Second Edition) is separately available, if you
prefer to program in that language. Earlier editions of Numerical Recipes in Pascal
and Numerical Recipes Routines and Examples in BASIC are also available; while
not containing the additional material of the Second Edition versions in C and
FORTRAN, these versions are perfectly serviceable if Pascal or BASIC is your
language of choice.
When we include programs in the text, they look like this:
#include <math.h>
#define RAD (3.14159265/180.0)
void flmoon(int n, int nph, long *jd, float *frac)
Our programs begin with an introductory comment summarizing their purpose and explaining
their calling sequence. This routine calculates the phases of the moon. Given an integer n and
a code nph for the phase desired (nph = 0 for new moon, 1 for ï¬rst quarter, 2 for full, 3 for last
quarter), the routine returns the Julian Day Number jd, and the fractional part of a day frac
to be added to it, of the nth such phase since January, 1900. Greenwich Mean Time is assumed.
{
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int i;
float am,as,c,t,t2,xtra;
c=n+nph/4.0;
This is how we comment an individual
line.

xtra += (0.1721-4.0e-4*t)*sin(RAD*as)-0.6280*sin(RAD*am);
else nrerror("nph is unknown in flmoon");
This is how we will indicate error
conditions.
i=(int)(xtra >= 0.0 ? floor(xtra) : ceil(xtra-1.0));
*jd += i;
*frac=xtra-i;
}
If the syntax of the function deï¬nition above looks strange to you, then you are
probably used to the older Kernighan and Ritchie (âK&Râ) syntax, rather than that of
the newer ANSI C. In this edition, we adopt ANSI C as our standard. You might want
to look ahead to Â§1.2 where ANSI C function prototypes are discussed in more detail.
Note our convention of handling all errors and exceptional cases with a statement
like nrerror("some error message");. The function nrerror() is part of a
small ï¬le of utility programs, nrutil.c, listed in Appendix B at the back of the
book. This Appendix includes a number of other utilitiesthat we will describe later in
this chapter. Function nrerror() prints the indicated error message to your stderr
device (usually your terminal screen), and then invokes the function exit(), which
terminates execution. The function exit() is in every C library we know of; but if
you ï¬nd it missing, you can modify nrerror() so that it does anything else that will
halt execution. For example, you can have it pause for input from the keyboard, and
then manually interrupt execution. In some applications, you will want to modify
nrerror() to do more sophisticated error handling, for example to transfer control
somewhere else, with an error ï¬ag or error code set.
We will have more to say about the C programming language, its conventions
and style, in Â§1.1 and Â§1.2.
Computational Environment and Program Validation
Our goal is that the programs in this book be as portable as possible, across
different platforms (models of computer), across different operating systems, and
across different C compilers.
C was designed with this type of portability in
mind. Nevertheless, we have found that there is no substitute for actually checking
all programs on a variety of compilers, in the process uncovering differences in
library structure or contents, and even occasional differences in allowed syntax. As
surrogates for the large number of possible combinations, we have tested all the
programs in this book on the combinations of machines, operating systems, and
compilers shown on the accompanying table. More generally, the programs should
run without modiï¬cation on any compiler that implements the ANSI C standard,
as described for example in Harbison and Steeleâs excellent book [1]. With small
modiï¬cations, our programs should run on any compiler that implements the older,
de facto K&R standard [2]. An example of the kind of trivial incompatibility to
watch out for is that ANSI C requires the memory allocation functions malloc()

them to be declared with the header ï¬le malloc.h, while others regard them as
inherent in the language and require no header ï¬le at all.
In validating the programs, we have taken the program source code directly
from the machine-readable form of the bookâs manuscript, to decrease the chance
of propagating typographical errors. âDriverâ or demonstration programs that we
used as part of our validations are available separately as the Numerical Recipes
Example Book (C), as well as in machine-readable form. If you plan to use more
than a few of the programs in this book, or if you plan to use programs in this book
on more than one different computer, then you may ï¬nd it useful to obtain a copy
of these demonstration programs.
Of course we would be foolish to claim that there are no bugs in our programs,
and we do not make such a claim. We have been very careful, and have beneï¬tted
from the experience of the many readers who have written to us. If you ï¬nd a new
bug, please document it and tell us!
Compatibility with the First Edition
If you are accustomed to the Numerical Recipes routines of the First Edition, rest
assured: almost all of them are still here, with the same names and functionalities,
often with major improvements in the code itself. In addition, we hope that you
will soon become equally familiar with the added capabilities of the more than 100
routines that are new to this edition.
We have retired a small number of First Edition routines, those that we believe
to be clearly dominated by better methods implemented in this edition. A table,
following, lists the retired routines and suggests replacements.
First Edition users should also be aware that some routines common to
both editions have alterations in their calling interfaces, so are not directly âplug
compatible.â A fairly complete list is: chsone, chstwo, covsrt, dfpmin, laguer,
lfit, memcof, mrqcof, mrqmin, pzextr, ran4, realft, rzextr, shoot, shootf.
There may be others (depending in part on which printingof the First Edition is taken
for the comparison). If you have written software of any appreciable complexity

About References
You will ï¬nd references, and suggestions for further reading, listed at the
end of most sections of this book. References are cited in the text by bracketed
numbers like this [3].
Because computer algorithms often circulate informally for quite some time
before appearing in a published form, the task of uncovering âprimary literatureâ
is sometimes quite difï¬cult. We have not attempted this, and we do not pretend
to any degree of bibliographical completeness in this book.
For topics where a
substantial secondary literature exists (discussion in textbooks, reviews, etc.) we
have consciously limited our references to a few of the more useful secondary
sources, especially those with good references to the primary literature. Where the
existing secondary literature is insufï¬cient, we give references to a few primary
sources that are intended to serve as starting points for further reading, not as
complete bibliographies for the ï¬eld.
The order in whichreferences are listed is not necessarily signiï¬cant. It reï¬ects a
compromise between listingcited references in theorder cited, and listingsuggestions
for further reading in a roughly prioritized order, with the most useful ones ï¬rst.
The remaining three sections of this chapter review some basic concepts of
programming (control structures, etc.), discuss a set of conventions speciï¬c to C
that we have adopted in this book, and introduce some fundamental concepts in
numerical analysis (roundoff error, etc.). Thereafter, we plunge into the substantive
material of the book.

1.1 Program Organization and Control
Structures
We sometimes like to point out the close analogies between computer programs,
on the one hand, and written poetry or written musical scores, on the other. All
three present themselves as visual media, symbols on a two-dimensional page or
computer screen. Yet, in all three cases, the visual, two-dimensional, frozen-in-time
representation communicates (or is supposed to communicate) something rather
different, namely a process that unfolds in time. A poem is meant to be read; music,
played; a program, executed as a sequential series of computer instructions.
In all three cases, the target of the communication, in its visual form, is a human
being. The goal is to transfer to him/her, as efï¬ciently as can be accomplished,
the greatest degree of understanding, in advance, of how the process will unfold in
time. In poetry, this human target is the reader. In music, it is the performer. In
programming, it is the program user.
Now, you may object that the target of communication of a program is not
a human but a computer, that the program user is only an irrelevant intermediary,
a lackey who feeds the machine. This is perhaps the case in the situation where
the business executive pops a diskette into a desktop computer and feeds that
computer a black-box program in binary executable form. The computer, in this
case, doesnât much care whether that program was written with âgood programming
practiceâ or not.
We envision, however, that you, the readers of this book, are in quite a different
situation. You need, or want, to know not just what a program does, but also how
it does it, so that you can tinker with it and modify it to your particular application.
You need others to be able to see what you have done, so that they can criticize or
admire. In such cases, where the desired goal is maintainable or reusable code, the
targets of a programâs communication are surely human, not machine.
One key to achieving good programming practice is to recognize that pro-
gramming, music, and poetry â all three being symbolic constructs of the human
brain â are naturally structured into hierarchies that have many different nested
levels. Sounds (phonemes) form small meaningful units (morphemes) which in turn
form words; words group into phrases, which group into sentences; sentences make
paragraphs, and these are organized into higher levels of meaning.
Notes form
musical phrases, which form themes, counterpoints, harmonies, etc.; which form
movements, which form concertos, symphonies, and so on.
The structure in programs is equally hierarchical. Appropriately, good pro-
gramming practice brings different techniques to bear on the different levels [1-3].
At a low level is the ascii character set. Then, constants, identiï¬ers, operands,

1.1 Program Organization and Control
Structures
We sometimes like to point out the close analogies between computer programs,
on the one hand, and written poetry or written musical scores, on the other. All
three present themselves as visual media, symbols on a two-dimensional page or
computer screen. Yet, in all three cases, the visual, two-dimensional, frozen-in-time
representation communicates (or is supposed to communicate) something rather
different, namely a process that unfolds in time. A poem is meant to be read; music,
played; a program, executed as a sequential series of computer instructions.
In all three cases, the target of the communication, in its visual form, is a human
being. The goal is to transfer to him/her, as efï¬ciently as can be accomplished,
the greatest degree of understanding, in advance, of how the process will unfold in
time. In poetry, this human target is the reader. In music, it is the performer. In
programming, it is the program user.
Now, you may object that the target of communication of a program is not
a human but a computer, that the program user is only an irrelevant intermediary,
a lackey who feeds the machine. This is perhaps the case in the situation where
the business executive pops a diskette into a desktop computer and feeds that
computer a black-box program in binary executable form. The computer, in this
case, doesnât much care whether that program was written with âgood programming
practiceâ or not.
We envision, however, that you, the readers of this book, are in quite a different
situation. You need, or want, to know not just what a program does, but also how
it does it, so that you can tinker with it and modify it to your particular application.
You need others to be able to see what you have done, so that they can criticize or
admire. In such cases, where the desired goal is maintainable or reusable code, the
targets of a programâs communication are surely human, not machine.
One key to achieving good programming practice is to recognize that pro-
gramming, music, and poetry â all three being symbolic constructs of the human
brain â are naturally structured into hierarchies that have many different nested
levels. Sounds (phonemes) form small meaningful units (morphemes) which in turn
form words; words group into phrases, which group into sentences; sentences make
paragraphs, and these are organized into higher levels of meaning.
Notes form
musical phrases, which form themes, counterpoints, harmonies, etc.; which form
movements, which form concertos, symphonies, and so on.
The structure in programs is equally hierarchical. Appropriately, good pro-
gramming practice brings different techniques to bear on the different levels [1-3].
At a low level is the ascii character set. Then, constants, identiï¬ers, operands,

operators. Then program statements, like a[j+1]=b+c/3.0;. Here, the best pro-
gramming advice is simply be clear, or (correspondingly) donât be too tricky. You
might momentarily be proud of yourself at writing the single line
k=(2-j)*(1+3*j)/2;
if you want to permute cyclically one of the values j = (0, 1, 2) into respectively
k = (1, 2, 0). You will regret it later, however, when you try to understand that
line.
Better, and likely also faster, is
k=j+1;
if (k == 3) k=0;
Many programming stylists would even argue for the ploddingly literal
switch (j) {
case 0: k=1; break;
case 1: k=2; break;
case 2: k=0; break;
default: {
fprintf(stderr,"unexpected value for j");
exit(1);
}
}
on the grounds that it is both clear and additionallysafeguarded from wrong assump-
tions about the possible values of j. Our preference among the implementations
is for the middle one.
In this simple example, we have in fact traversed several levels of hierarchy:
Statements frequently come in âgroupsâ or âblocksâ which make sense only taken
as a whole. The middle fragment above is one example. Another is
swap=a[j];
a[j]=b[j];
b[j]=swap;
which makes immediate sense to any programmer as the exchange of two variables,
while
ans=sum=0.0;
n=1;
is very likely to be an initialization of variables prior to some iterative process. This
level of hierarchy in a program is usually evident to the eye. It is good programming
practice to put in comments at this level, e.g., âinitializeâ or âexchange variables.â
The next level is that of control structures. These are things like the switch
construction in the example above, for loops, and so on. This level is sufï¬ciently
important, and relevant to the hierarchical level of the routines in this book, that
we will come back to it just below.
At still higher levels in the hierarchy, we have functions and modules, and the
whole âglobalâ organization of the computational task to be done. In the musical
analogy, we are now at the level of movements and complete works. At these levels,

modularization and encapsulation become important programming concepts, the
general idea being that program units should interact with one another only through
clearly deï¬ned and narrowly circumscribed interfaces. Good modularizationpractice
is an essential prerequisite to the success of large, complicated software projects,
especially those employing the efforts of more than one programmer. It is also good
practice (if not quite as essential) in the less massive programming tasks that an
individual scientist, or reader of this book, encounters.
Some computer languages, such as Modula-2 and C++, promote good modular-
ization with higher-level language constructs absent in C. In Modula-2, for example,
functions, type deï¬nitions, and data structures can be encapsulated into âmodulesâ
that communicate through declared public interfaces and whose internal workings
are hidden from the rest of the program [4]. In the C++ language, the key concept
is âclass,â a user-deï¬nable generalization of data type that provides for data hiding,
automatic initializationof data, memory management, dynamic typing, and operator
overloading (i.e., the user-deï¬nable extension of operators like + and * so as to be
appropriate to operands in any particular class) [5]. Properly used in deï¬ning the data
structures that are passed between program units, classes can clarify and circumscribe
these unitsâ public interfaces, reducing the chances of programming error and also
allowing a considerable degree of compile-time and run-time error checking.
Beyond modularization, though depending on it, lie the concepts of object-
oriented programming. Here a programming language, such as C++ or Turbo Pascal
5.5 [6], allows a moduleâs public interface to accept redeï¬nitions of types or actions,
and these redeï¬nitions become shared all the way down through the moduleâs
hierarchy (so-called polymorphism).
For example, a routine written to invert a
matrix of real numbers could â dynamically, at run time â be made able to handle
complex numbers by overloading complex data types and corresponding deï¬nitions
of the arithmetic operations. Additional concepts of inheritance (the ability to deï¬ne
a data type that âinheritsâ all the structure of another type, plus additional structure
of its own), and object extensibility (the ability to add functionality to a module
without access to its source code, e.g., at run time), also come into play.
We have not attempted to modularize, or make objects out of, the routines in
this book, for at least two reasons. First, the chosen language, C, does not really make
this possible. Second, we envision that you, the reader, might want to incorporate
the algorithms in this book, a few at a time, into modules or objects with a structure
of your own choosing. There does not exist, at present, a standard or accepted set
of âclassesâ for scientiï¬c object-oriented computing. While we might have tried to
invent such a set, doing so would have inevitably tied the algorithmic content of the
book (which is its raison dâËetre) to some rather speciï¬c, and perhaps haphazard, set
of choices regarding class deï¬nitions.
On the other hand, we are not unfriendly to the goals of modular and object-
oriented programming. Within the limits of C, we have therefore tried to structure
our programs to be âobject friendly.â That is one reason we have adopted ANSI
C with its function prototyping as our default C dialect (see Â§1.2). Also, within
our implementation sections, we have paid particular attention to the practices of
structured programming, as we now discuss.

Control Structures
An executing program unfolds in time, but not strictly in the linear order in
which the statements are written. Program statements that affect the order in which
statements are executed, or that affect whether statements are executed, are called
control statements. Control statements never make useful sense by themselves. They
make sense only in the context of the groups or blocks of statements that they in turn
control. If you think of those blocks as paragraphs containing sentences, then the
control statements are perhaps best thought of as the indentation of the paragraph
and the punctuation between the sentences, not the words within the sentences.
We can now say what the goal of structured programming is. It is to make
program control manifestly apparent in the visual presentation of the program. You
see that this goal has nothing at all to do with how the computer sees the program.
As already remarked, computers donât care whether you use structured programming
or not. Human readers, however, do care. You yourself will also care, once you
discover how much easier it is to perfect and debug a well-structured program than
one whose control structure is obscure.
You accomplish the goals of structured programming in two complementary
ways.
First, you acquaint yourself with the small number of essential control
structures that occur over and over again in programming, and that are therefore
given convenient representations in most programming languages. You should learn
to think about your programming tasks, insofar as possible, exclusively in terms of
these standard control structures. In writing programs, you should get into the habit
of representing these standard control structures in consistent, conventional ways.
âDoesnât this inhibit creativity?â
our students sometimes ask.
Yes, just
as Mozartâs creativity was inhibited by the sonata form, or Shakespeareâs by the
metrical requirements of the sonnet. The point is that creativity, when it is meant to
communicate, does well under the inhibitions of appropriate restrictions on format.
Second, you avoid, insofar as possible, control statements whose controlled
blocks or objects are difï¬cult to discern at a glance. This means, in practice, that you
must try to avoid named labels on statements and gotoâs. It is not the gotoâs that
are dangerous (although they do interrupt oneâs reading of a program); the named
statement labels are the hazard. In fact, whenever you encounter a named statement
label while reading a program, you will soon become conditioned to get a sinking
feeling in the pit of your stomach. Why? Because the following questions will, by
habit, immediately spring to mind: Where did control come from in a branch to this
label? It could be anywhere in the routine! What circumstances resulted in a branch
to this label? They could be anything! Certainty becomes uncertainty, understanding
dissolves into a morass of possibilities.
Some examples are now in order to make these considerations more concrete
(see Figure 1.1.1).

Notice how we always indent the block of code that is acted upon by the control
structure, leaving the structure itself unindented. Notice also our habit of putting the
initial curly brace on the same line as the for statement, instead of on the next line.
This saves a full line of white space, and our publisher loves us for it.
IF structure.
This structure in C is similar to that found in Pascal, Algol,
FORTRAN and other languages, and typically looks like
if (...) {
...
}
else if (...) {
...
}
else {
...
}
Since compound-statement curly braces are required only when there is more
than one statement in a block, however, Câs if construction can be somewhat less
explicit than the corresponding structure in FORTRAN or Pascal. Some care must be
exercised in constructing nested if clauses. For example, consider the following:
if (b > 3)
if (a > 3) b += 1;
else b -= 1;
/* questionable! */
As judged by the indentation used on successive lines, the intent of the writer of
this code is the following: âIf b is greater than 3 and a is greater than 3, then
increment b. If b is not greater than 3, then decrement b.â According to the rules
of C, however, the actual meaning is âIf b is greater than 3, then evaluate a. If a is
greater than 3, then increment b, and if a is less than or equal to 3, decrement b.â The
point is that an else clause is associated with the most recent open if statement,
no matter how you lay it out on the page. Such confusions in meaning are easily
resolved by the inclusion of braces. They may in some instances be technically
superï¬uous; nevertheless, they clarify your intent and improve the program. The
above fragment should be written as
if (b > 3) {
if (a > 3) b += 1;
} else {
b -= 1;
}
Here is a working program that consists dominantly of if control statements:
#include <math.h>
#define IGREG (15+31L*(10+12L*1582))
Gregorian Calendar adopted Oct. 15, 1582.
long julday(int mm, int id, int iyyy)
In this routine julday returns the Julian Day Number that begins at noon of the calendar date
speciï¬ed by month mm, day id, and year iyyy, all integer variables. Positive year signiï¬es A.D.;
negative, B.C. Remember that the year after 1 B.C. was 1 A.D.

a unique integer, the Julian Day Number [7].
Julian Day Zero was a very long
time ago; a convenient reference point is that Julian Day 2440000 began at noon
of May 23, 1968. If you know the Julian Day Number that begins at noon of a
given calendar date, then the day of the week of that date is obtained by adding
1 and taking the result modulo base 7; a zero answer corresponds to Sunday, 1 to
Monday, . . . , 6 to Saturday.)
While iteration.
Most languages (thoughnotFORTRAN, incidentally)provide
for structures like the following C example:
while (n < 1000) {
n *= 2;
j += 1;
}
It is the particular feature of this structure that the control-clause (in this case
n < 1000) is evaluated before each iteration. If the clause is not true, the enclosed
statements will not be executed. In particular, if this code is encountered at a time
when n is greater than or equal to 1000, the statements will not even be executed once.
Do-While iteration.
Companion to the while iteration is a related control-
structure that tests its control-clause at the end of each iteration.
In C, it looks
like this:
do {
n *= 2;
j += 1;
} while (n < 1000);
In this case, the enclosed statements will be executed at least once, independent
of the initial value of n.
Break.
In this case, you have a loop that is repeated indeï¬nitely until some
condition tested somewhere in the middle of the loop (and possibly tested in more

than one place) becomes true. At that point you wish to exit the loop and proceed
with what comes after it. In C the structure is implemented with the simple break
statement, which terminates execution of the innermost for, while, do, or switch
construction and proceeds to the next sequential instruction. (In Pascaland standard
FORTRAN, this structure requires the use of statement labels, to the detriment of clear
programming.) A typical usage of the break statement is:
for(;;) {
[statements before the test]
if (...) break;
[statements after the test]
}
[next sequential instruction]
Here is a program that uses several different iteration structures. One of us was
once asked, for a scavenger hunt, to ï¬nd the date of a Friday the 13th on which the
moon was full. This is a program which accomplishes that task, giving incidentally
all other Fridays the 13th as a by-product.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#define ZON -5.0
Time zone â5 is Eastern Standard Time.
#define IYBEG 1900
The range of dates to be searched.
#define IYEND 2000
int main(void) /* Program badluk */
{
void flmoon(int n, int nph, long *jd, float *frac);
long julday(int mm, int id, int iyyy);
int ic,icon,idwk,im,iyyy,n;
float timzon = ZON/24.0,frac;
long jd,jday;
printf("\nFull moons on Friday the 13th from %5d to %5d\n",IYBEG,IYEND);
for (iyyy=IYBEG;iyyy<=IYEND;iyyy++) {
Loop over each year,
for (im=1;im<=12;im++) {
and each month.
jday=julday(im,13,iyyy);
Is the 13th a Friday?
idwk=(int) ((jday+1) % 7);
if (idwk == 5) {
n=(int)(12.37*(iyyy-1900+(im-0.5)/12.0));
This value n is a ï¬rst approximation to how many full moons have occurred
since 1900. We will feed it into the phase routine and adjust it up or down
until we determine that our desired 13th was or was not a full moon. The
variable icon signals the direction of adjustment.
icon=0;

Get date of full moon n.

If you are merely curious, there were (or will be) occurrences of a full moon
on Friday the 13th (time zone GMTâ5) on: 3/13/1903, 10/13/1905, 6/13/1919,
1/13/1922, 11/13/1970, 2/13/1987, 10/13/2000, 9/13/2019, and 8/13/2049.
Other âstandardâ structures.
Our advice is to avoid them.
Every
programming language has some number of âgoodiesâ that the designer just couldnât
resist throwing in. They seemed like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately they
donât stand the test of time! Your program becomes difï¬cult to translate into other
languages, and difï¬cult to read (because rarely used structures are unfamiliar to the
reader). You can almost always accomplish the supposed conveniences of these
structures in other ways.
In C, the most problematic control structure is the switch...case...default
construction (see Figure 1.1.1), which has historically been burdened by uncertainty,
from compiler to compiler,about what data types are allowed initscontrol expression.
Data types char and int are universally supported. For other data types, e.g., float
or double, the structure should be replaced by a more recognizable and translatable
if. . .else construction. ANSI C allows the control expression to be of type long,
but many older compilers do not.
The continue; construction, while benign, can generally be replaced by an
if construction with no loss of clarity.
About âAdvanced Topicsâ
Material set in smaller type, like this, signals an âadvanced topic,â either one outside of
the main argument of the chapter, or else one requiring of you more than the usual assumed
mathematical background, or else (in a few cases) a discussion that is more speculative or an

topics on a ï¬rst reading of the book.
You may havenoticed that, by its looping overthe months andyears, the programbadluk
avoids using any algorithm for converting a Julian Day Number back into a calendar date. A
routine for doing just this is not very interesting structurally, but it is occasionally useful:
#include <math.h>
#define IGREG 2299161
void caldat(long julian, int *mm, int *id, int *iyyy)
Inverse of the function julday given above. Here julian is input as a Julian Day Number,
and the routine outputs mm,id, and iyyy as the month, day, and year on which the speciï¬ed
Julian Day started at noon.

The C language was devised originally for systems programming work, not for

the programmer âvery close to the machineâ in several respects. It is operator-rich,
giving direct access to most capabilities of a machine-language instruction set. It
has a large variety of intrinsic data types (short and long, signed and unsigned
integers; ï¬oating and double-precision reals; pointer types; etc.), and a concise
syntax for effecting conversions and indirections. It deï¬nes an arithmetic on pointers
(addresses) that relates gracefully to array addressing and is highly compatible with
the index register structure of many computers.

Portability has always been another strong point of the C language. C is the
underlying language of the UNIX operating system; both the language and the
operating system have by now been implemented on literally hundreds of different
computers. The languageâs universality, portability, and ï¬exibility have attracted
increasing numbers of scientists and engineers to it. It is commonly used for the
real-time control of experimental hardware, often in spite of the fact that the standard
UNIX kernel is less than ideal as an operating system for this purpose.
The use of C for higher level scientiï¬c calculations such as data analysis,
modeling,andï¬oating-point numerical workhasgenerallybeenslowerindeveloping.
In part this is due to the entrenched position of FORTRAN as the mother-tongue of
virtually all scientists and engineers born before 1960, and most born after.
In
part, also, the slowness of Câs penetration into scientiï¬c computing has been due to
deï¬ciencies in the language that computer scientists have been (we think, stubbornly)
slow to recognize. Examples are the lack of a good way to raise numbers to small
integer powers, and the âimplicit conversion of float to doubleâ issue, discussed
below. Many, though not all, of these deï¬ciencies are overcome in the ANSI C
Standard. Some remaining deï¬ciencies will undoubtedly disappear over time.
Yet another inhibitionto the mass conversion of scientists to the C cult has been,
up to the time of writing, the decided lack of high-quality scientiï¬c or numerical
libraries. That is the lacuna into which we thrust this edition of Numerical Recipes.
We certainly do not claim to be a complete solution to the problem. We do hope
to inspire further efforts, and to lay out by example a set of sensible, practical
conventions for scientiï¬c C programming.
The need for programming conventions in C is very great. Far from the problem
of overcoming constraints imposed by the language (our repeated experience with
Pascal), the problem in C is to choose the best and most natural techniques from
multiple opportunities â and then to use those techniques completely consistently
from program to program. In the rest of this section, we set out some of the issues,
and describe the adopted conventions that are used in all of the routines in this book.
Function Prototypes and Header Files
ANSI C allows functions to be deï¬ned with function prototypes, which specify
the type of each function parameter.
If a function declaration or deï¬nition with
a prototype is visible, the compiler can check that a given function call invokes
the function with the correct argument types. All the routines printed in this book
are in ANSI C prototype form. For the beneï¬t of readers with older âtraditional
K&Râ C compilers, the Numerical Recipes C Diskette includes two complete sets of
programs, one in ANSI, the other in K&R.
The easiest way to understand prototypes is by example. A function deï¬nition
that would be written in traditional C as
int g(x,y,z)
int x,y;
float z;
becomes in ANSI C

int g(int x, int y, float z)
A function that has no parameters has the parameter type list void.
A function declaration (as contrasted to a function deï¬nition) is used to
âintroduceâ a function to a routine that is going to call it. The calling routine needs
to know the number and type of arguments and the type of the returned value. In
a function declaration, you are allowed to omit the parameter names.
Thus the
declaration for the above function is allowed to be written
int g(int, int, float);
If a C program consists of multiple source ï¬les, the compiler cannot check the
consistency of each function call without some additional assistance.
The safest
way to proceed is as follows:
â¢ Every external function should have a single prototype declaration in a
header (.h) ï¬le.
â¢ The source ï¬le with the deï¬nition (body) of the function should also
include the header ï¬le so that the compiler can check that the prototypes
in the declaration and the deï¬nition match.
â¢ Every source ï¬le that calls the function should include the appropriate
header (.h) ï¬le.
â¢ Optionally, a routine that calls a function can also include that functionâs
prototype declaration internally.
This is often useful when you are
developing a program, since it gives you a visible reminder (checked by
the compiler through the common .h ï¬le) of a functionâs argument types.
Later, after your program is debugged, you can go back and delete the
supernumary internal declarations.
For the routines in this book, the header ï¬le containing all the prototypes is nr.h,
listed in Appendix A. You should put the statement #include nr.h at the top of
every source ï¬le that contains Numerical Recipes routines. Since, more frequently
than not, you will want to include more than one Numerical Recipes routine in a
single source ï¬le, we have not printed this #include statement in front of this
bookâs individual program listings, but you should make sure that it is present in
your programs.
As backup, and in accordance with the last item on the indented list above, we
declare the function prototype of all Numerical Recipes routines that are called by
other Numerical Recipes routines internally to the calling routine. (That also makes
our routines much more readable.) The only exception to this rule is that the small
number of utility routines that we use repeatedly (described below) are declared in
the additional header ï¬le nrutil.h, and the line #include nrutil.h is explicitly
printed whenever it is needed.
A ï¬nal important point about the header ï¬le nr.h is that, as furnished on
the diskette, it contains both ANSI C and traditional K&R-style declarations. The
ANSI forms are invoked if any of the following macros are deï¬ned: __STDC__,
ANSI, or NRANSI. (The purpose of the last name is to give you an invocation that
does not conï¬ict with other possible uses of the ï¬rst two names.) If you have an
ANSI compiler, it is essential that you invoke it with one or more of these macros

deï¬ned. The typical means for doing so is to include a switch like â-DANSIâ on
the compiler command line.
Some further details about the ï¬le nr.h are given in Appendix A.
Vectors and One-Dimensional Arrays
There is a close, and elegant, correspondence in C between pointers and arrays.
The value referenced by an expression like a[j] is deï¬ned to be *((a)+(j)),
that is, âthe contents of the address obtained by incrementing the pointer a by
j.â
A consequence of this deï¬nition is that if a points to a legal data location,
the array element a[0] is always deï¬ned. Arrays in C are natively âzero-originâ
or âzero-offset.â An array declared by the statement float b[4]; has the valid
references b[0], b[1], b[2], and b[3], but not b[4].
Right away we need a notation to indicate what is the valid range of an array
index. (The issue comes up about a thousand times in this book!) For the above
example, the index range of b will be henceforth denoted b[0..3], a notation
borrowed from Pascal.
In general, the range of an array declared by float
a[M]; is a[0..M â1], and the same if float is replaced by any other data type.
One problem is that many algorithms naturally like to go from 1 to M, not
from 0 to M â1. Sure, you can always convert them, but they then often acquire
a baggage of additional arithmetic in array indices that is, at best, distracting. It is
better to use the power of the C language, in a consistent way, to make the problem
disappear.
Consider
float b[4],*bb;
bb=b-1;
The pointer bb now points one location before b. An immediate consequence is that
the array elements bb[1], bb[2], bb[3], and bb[4] all exist. In other words the
range of bb is bb[1..4]. We will refer to bb as a unit-offset vector. (See Appendix
B for some additional discussion of technical details.)
It is sometimes convenient to use zero-offset vectors, and sometimes convenient
to use unit-offset vectors in algorithms. The choice should be whichever is most
natural to the problem at hand.
For example, the coefï¬cients of a polynomial
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . . + anxn clearly cry out for the zero-offset a[0..n], while
a vector of N data points xi, i = 1 . . .N calls for a unit-offset x[1..N]. When a
routine in this book has an array as an argument, its header comment always gives
the expected index range.
For example,
void someroutine(float bb[], int nn)
This routine does something with the vector bb[1..nn].
...
Now, suppose you want someroutine() to do its thing on your own vector,
of length 7, say. If your vector, call it aa, is already unit-offset (has the valid range
aa[1..7]), then you can invoke someroutine(aa,7);in the obvious way. That is
the recommended procedure, since someroutine() presumably has some logical,
or at least aesthetic, reason for wanting a unit-offset vector.

But suppose that your vector of length 7, now call it a, is perversely a native C,
zero-offset array (has range a[0..6]). Perhaps this is the case because you disagree
with our aesthetic prejudices, Heaven help you! To use our recipe, do you have to
copy aâs contents element by element into another, unit-offset vector? No! Do you
have to declare a new pointer aaa and set it equal to a-1? No! You simply invoke
someroutine(a-1,7);. Then a[1], as seen from within our recipe, is actually
a[0] as seen from your program. In other words, you can change conventions âon
the ï¬yâ with just a couple of keystrokes.
Forgive us for belaboring these points. We want to free you from the zero-offset
thinking that C encourages but (as we see) does not require. A ï¬nal liberating point
is that the utility ï¬le nrutil.c, listed in full in Appendix B, includes functions
for allocating (using malloc()) arbitrary-offset vectors of arbitrary lengths. The
synopses of these functions are as follows:
float *vector(long nl, long nh)
Allocates a float vector with range [nl..nh].
int *ivector(long nl, long nh)
Allocates an int vector with range [nl..nh].
unsigned char *cvector(long nl, long nh)
Allocates an unsigned char vector with range [nl..nh].
unsigned long *lvector(long nl, long nh)
Allocates an unsigned long vector with range [nl..nh].
double *dvector(long nl, long nh)
Allocates a double vector with range [nl..nh].
A typical use of the above utilities is the declaration float *b; followed by
b=vector(1,7);, which makes the range b[1..7] come into existence and allows
b to be passed to any function calling for a unit-offset vector.
The ï¬le nrutil.c also contains the corresponding deallocation routines,
void free_vector(float *v, long nl, long nh)
void free_ivector(int *v, long nl, long nh)
void free_cvector(unsigned char *v, long nl, long nh)
void free_lvector(unsigned long *v, long nl, long nh)
void free_dvector(double *v, long nl, long nh)
with the typical use being free_vector(b,1,7);.
Our recipes use the above utilitiesextensively for the allocationand deallocation
of vector workspace. We also commend them to you for use inyourmain programs or
other procedures. Note that if you want to allocate vectors of length longer than 64k
on an IBM PC-compatible computer, you should replace all occurrences of malloc
in nrutil.c by your compilerâs special-purpose memory allocation function. This
applies also to matrix allocation, to be discussed next.

Matrices and Two-Dimensional Arrays
The zero- versus unit-offset issue arises here, too. Let us, however, defer it for
a moment in favor of an even more fundamental matter, that of variable dimension
arrays (FORTRAN terminology) or conformant arrays (Pascal terminology). These
are arrays that need to be passed to a function along with real-time information
about their two-dimensional size. The systems programmer rarely deals with two-
dimensional arrays, and almost never deals with two-dimensional arrays whose size
is variable and known only at run time. Such arrays are, however, the bread and
butter of scientiï¬c computing. Imagine trying to live with a matrix inversion routine
that could work with only one size of matrix!
There is no technical reason that a C compiler could not allow a syntax like
void someroutine(a,m,n)
float a[m][n];
/* ILLEGAL DECLARATION */
and emit code to evaluate the variable dimensions m and n (or any variable-dimension
expression) each time someroutine() is entered. Alas! the above fragment is
forbidden by the C language deï¬nition. The implementation of variable dimensions
in C instead requires some additional ï¬nesse; however, we will see that one is
rewarded for the effort.
There is a subtle near-ambiguity in the C syntax for two-dimensional array
references.
Let us elucidate it, and then turn it to our advantage.
Consider the
array reference to a (say) float value a[i][j], where i and j are expressions
that evaluate to type int. A C compiler will emit quite different machine code for
this reference, depending on how the identiï¬er a has been declared. If a has been
declared as a ï¬xed-size array, e.g., float a[5][9];, then the machine code is: âto
the address a add 9 times i, then add j, return the value thus addressed.â Notice that
the constant 9 needs to be known in order to effect the calculation, and an integer
multiplication is required (see Figure 1.2.1).
Suppose, on the other hand, that a has been declared by float **a;. Then
the machine code for a[i][j] is: âto the address of a add i, take the value thus
addressed as a new address, add j to it, return the value addressed by this new
address.â Notice that the underlying size of a[][] does not enter this calculation
at all, and that there is no multiplication; an additional indirection replaces it. We
thus have, in general, a faster and more versatile scheme than the previous one.
The price that we pay is the storage requirement for one array of pointers (to the
rows of a[][]), and the slight inconvenience of remembering to initialize those
pointers when we declare an array.
Here is our bottom line: We avoid the ï¬xed-size two-dimensional arrays of C as
being unsuitabledata structures for representing matrices in scientiï¬c computing. We
adopt instead the convention âpointer to array of pointers,â with the array elements
pointing to the ï¬rst element in the rows of each matrix. Figure 1.2.1 contrasts the
rejected and adopted schemes.
The following fragment shows how a ï¬xed-size array a of size 13 by 9 is
converted to a âpointer to array of pointersâ reference aa:

to an array of pointers to rows; this is the scheme adopted in this book.
float a[13][9],**aa;
int i;
aa=(float **) malloc((unsigned) 13*sizeof(float*));
for(i=0;i<=12;i++) aa[i]=a[i];
a[i] is a pointer to a[i][0]
The identiï¬er aa is now a matrix with index range aa[0..12][0..8]. You can use
or modify its elements ad lib, and more importantly you can pass it as an argument
to any function by its name aa. That function, which declares the corresponding
dummy argument as float **aa;, can address its elements as aa[i][j] without
knowing its physical size.
You may rightly not wish to clutter your programs with code like the above
fragment. Also, there is still the outstanding problem of how to treat unit-offset
indices, so that (for example) the above matrix aa could be addressed with the range
a[1..13][1..9]. Both of these problems are solved by additional utility routines
in nrutil.c (Appendix B) which allocate and deallocate matrices of arbitrary
range.
The synopses are
float **matrix(long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Allocates a float matrix with range [nrl..nrh][ncl..nch].
double **dmatrix(long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Allocates a double matrix with range [nrl..nrh][ncl..nch].
int **imatrix(long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Allocates an int matrix with range [nrl..nrh][ncl..nch].
void free_matrix(float **m, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Frees a matrix allocated with matrix.

void free_dmatrix(double **m, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Frees a matrix allocated with dmatrix.
void free_imatrix(int **m, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)

All matrices in Numerical Recipes are handled with the above paradigm, and we
commend it to you.
Some further utilities for handling matrices are also included in nrutil.c.
The ï¬rst is a function submatrix() that sets up a new pointer reference to an
already-existing matrix (or sub-block thereof), along with new offsets if desired.
Its synopsis is
float **submatrix(float **a, long oldrl, long oldrh, long oldcl,
long oldch, long newrl, long newcl)
Point a submatrix [newrl..newrl+(oldrh-oldrl)][newcl..newcl+(oldch-oldcl)] to
the existing matrix range a[oldrl..oldrh][oldcl..oldch].
Here oldrl and oldrh are respectively the lower and upper row indices of the
original matrix that are to be represented by the new matrix, oldcl and oldch are
the corresponding column indices, and newrl and newcl are the lower row and
column indices for the new matrix. (We donât need upper row and column indices,
since they are implied by the quantities already given.)
Two sample uses might be, ï¬rst, to select as a 2 Ã 2 submatrix b[1..2]
[1..2] some interior range of an existing matrix, say a[4..5][2..3],
float **a,**b;
a=matrix(1,13,1,9);
...
b=submatrix(a,4,5,2,3,1,1);
and second, to map an existing matrix a[1..13][1..9] into a new matrix
b[0..12][0..8],
float **a,**b;
a=matrix(1,13,1,9);
...
b=submatrix(a,1,13,1,9,0,0);

Incidentally, you can use submatrix() for matrices of any type whose sizeof()
is the same as sizeof(float) (often true for int, e.g.); just cast the ï¬rst argument
to type float ** and cast the result to the desired type, e.g., int **.
The function
void free_submatrix(float **b, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
frees the array of row-pointers allocated by submatrix(). Note that it does not free
the memory allocated to the data in the submatrix, since that space still lies within
the memory allocation of some original matrix.
Finally, if you have a standard C matrix declared as a[nrow][ncol], and you
want to convert it into a matrix declared in our pointer-to-row-of-pointers manner,
the following function does the trick:
float **convert_matrix(float *a, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Allocate a float matrix m[nrl..nrh][ncl..nch] that points to the matrix declared in the
standard C manner as a[nrow][ncol], where nrow=nrh-nrl+1 and ncol=nch-ncl+1. The
routine should be called with the address &a[0][0] as the ï¬rst argument.
(You can use this function when you want to make use of Câs initializer syntax
to set values for a matrix, but then be able to pass the matrix to programs in this
book.)
The function
void free_convert_matrix(float **b, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch)
Free a matrix allocated by convert_matrix().
frees the allocation, without affecting the original matrix a.
The only examples of allocating a three-dimensional array as a pointer-to-
pointer-to-pointer structure in this book are found in the routines rlft3 in Â§12.5 and
sfroid in Â§17.4. The necessary allocation and deallocation functions are
float ***f3tensor(long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch, long ndl, long ndh)
Allocate a float 3-dimensional array with subscript range [nrl..nrh][ncl..nch][ndl..ndh].
void free_f3tensor(float ***t, long nrl, long nrh, long ncl, long nch,
long ndl, long ndh)
Free a float 3-dimensional array allocated by f3tensor().
Complex Arithmetic
C does not have complex data types, or predeï¬ned arithmetic operations on
complex numbers. That omission is easily remedied with the set of functions in
the ï¬le complex.c which is printed in full in Appendix C at the back of the book.
A synopsis is as follows:

typedef struct FCOMPLEX {float r,i;} fcomplex;
fcomplex Cadd(fcomplex a, fcomplex b)
Returns the complex sum of two complex numbers.
fcomplex Csub(fcomplex a, fcomplex b)
Returns the complex diï¬erence of two complex numbers.
fcomplex Cmul(fcomplex a, fcomplex b)
Returns the complex product of two complex numbers.
fcomplex Cdiv(fcomplex a, fcomplex b)
Returns the complex quotient of two complex numbers.
fcomplex Csqrt(fcomplex z)
Returns the complex square root of a complex number.
fcomplex Conjg(fcomplex z)
Returns the complex conjugate of a complex number.
float Cabs(fcomplex z)
Returns the absolute value (modulus) of a complex number.
fcomplex Complex(float re, float im)
Returns a complex number with speciï¬ed real and imaginary parts.
fcomplex RCmul(float x, fcomplex a)
Returns the complex product of a real number and a complex number.
The implementation of several of these complex operations in ï¬oating-point
arithmetic is not entirely trivial; see Â§5.4.
Only about half a dozen routinesin this book make explicit use of these complex
arithmetic functions. The resultingcode is not as readable as one would like, because
the familiar operations +-*/ are replaced by function calls. The C++ extension to
the C language allows operators to be redeï¬ned. That would allow more readable
code. However, in this book we are committed to standard C.
We should mention that the above functions assume the ability to pass, return,
and assign structures like FCOMPLEX (or types such as fcomplex that are deï¬ned
to be structures) by value. All recent C compilers have this ability, but it is not in
the original K&R C deï¬nition. If you are missing it, you will have to rewrite the
functions in complex.c, making them pass and return pointers to variables of type
fcomplex instead of the variables themselves. Likewise, you will need to modify
the recipes that use the functions.
Several other routines (e.g., the Fourier transforms four1 and fourn) do
complex arithmetic âby hand,â that is, they carry around real and imaginary parts as
float variables. This results in more efï¬cient code than would be obtained by using
the functions in complex.c. But the code is even less readable. There is simply no
ideal solution to the complex arithmetic problem in C.
Implicit Conversion of Float to Double
In traditional (K&R) C, float variables are automatically converted to double
before any operation is attempted, including both arithmetic operations and passing
as arguments to functions. All arithmetic is then done in double precision. If a
float variable receives the result of such an arithmetic operation, the high precision

is immediately thrown away. A corollary of these rules is that all the real-number
standard C library functions are of type double and compute to double precision.
The justiï¬cationfor these conversion rules is, âwell, thereâs nothing wrong with
a little extra precision,â and âthis way the libraries need only one version of each
function.â One does not need much experience in scientiï¬c computing to recognize
that the implicit conversion rules are, in fact, sheer madness! In effect, they make it
impossible to write efï¬cient numerical programs. One of the cultural barriers that
separates computer scientists from âregularâ scientists and engineers is a differing
point of view on whether a 30% or 50% loss of speed is worth worrying about. In
many real-time or state-of-the-art scientiï¬c applications, such a loss is catastrophic.
The practical scientist is trying to solve tomorrowâs problem with yesterdayâs
computer; the computer scientist, we think, often has it the other way around.
The ANSI C standard happily does not allow implicit conversion for arithmetic
operations, but it does require it for function arguments, unless the function is fully
prototyped by an ANSI declaration as described earlier in this section.
That is
another reason for our being rigorous about using the ANSI prototype mechanism,
and a good reason for you to use an ANSI-compatible compiler.
Some older C compilers do provide an optional compilation mode in which
the implicit conversion of float to double is suppressed. Use this if you can.
In this book, when we write float, we mean float; when we write double,
we mean double, i.e., there is a good algorithmic reason for having higher
precision.
Our routines all can tolerate the traditional implicit conversion rules,
but they are more efï¬cient without them. Of course, if your application actually
requires double precision, you can change our declarations from float to double
without difï¬culty. (The brute force approach is to add a preprocessor statement
#define float double !)
A Few Wrinkles
We like to keep code compact, avoiding unnecessary spaces unless they add
immediate clarity. We usually donât put space around the assignment operator â=â.
Through a quirk of history, however, some C compilers recognize the (nonexistent)
operator â=-â as being equivalent to the subtractive assignment operator â-=â, and
â=*â as being the same as the multiplicative assignment operator â*=â. That is why
you will see us write y= -10.0; or y=(-10.0);, and y= *a; or y=(*a);.
We have thesame viewpointregardingunnecessary parentheses. Youcanât write
(or read) C effectively unless you memorize its operator precedence and associativity
rules. Please study the accompanying table while you brush your teeth every night.
We never use the register storage class speciï¬er. Good optimizing compilers
are quite sophisticated in making their own decisions about what to keep in registers,
and the best choices are sometimes rather counter-intuitive.
Different compilers use different methods of distinguishing between deï¬ning
and referencing declarations of the same external name in several ï¬les. We follow
the most common scheme, which is also the ANSI standard.
The storage class
extern is explicitly included on all referencing top-level declarations. The storage
class is omitted from the single deï¬ning declaration for each external variable. We
have commented these declarations, so that if your compiler uses a different scheme
you can change the code. The various schemes are discussed in Â§4.8 of [1].

We have already alluded to the problem of computing small integer powers of
numbers, most notably the square and cube. The omission of this operation from C
is perhaps the languageâs most galling insult to the scientiï¬c programmer. All good
FORTRAN compilers recognize expressions like (A+B)**4 and produce in-line code,
in this case with only one add and two multiplies. It is typical for constant integer
powers up to 12 to be thus recognized.

In C, the mere problem of squaring is hard enough! Some people âmacro-izeâ
the operation as
#define SQR(a) ((a)*(a))
However, this is likely to produce code where SQR(sin(x)) results in two calls to
the sine routine! You might be tempted to avoid this by storing the argument of the
squaring function in a temporary variable:
static float sqrarg;
#define SQR(a) (sqrarg=(a),sqrarg*sqrarg)
The global variable sqrarg now has (and needs to keep) scope over the whole
module, which is a little dangerous. Also, one needs a completely different macro to
square expressions of type int. More seriously, this macro can fail if there are two
SQR operations in a single expression. Since in C the order of evaluation of pieces of
the expression is at the compilerâs discretion, the value of sqrarg in one evaluation
of SQR can be that from the other evaluation in the same expression, producing
nonsensical results. When we need a guaranteed-correct SQR macro, we use the
following, which exploits the guaranteed complete evaluation of subexpressions in
a conditional expression:
static float sqrarg;
#define SQR(a) ((sqrarg=(a)) == 0.0 ? 0.0 : sqrarg*sqrarg)
A collection of macros for other simple operations is included in the ï¬le nrutil.h
(see Appendix B) and used by many of our programs. Here are the synopses:
SQR(a)
Square a float value.
DSQR(a)
Square a double value.
FMAX(a,b)
Maximum of two float values.
FMIN(a,b)
Minimum of two float values.
DMAX(a,b)
Maximum of two double values.
DMIN(a,b)
Minimum of two double values.
IMAX(a,b)
Maximum of two int values.
IMIN(a,b)
Minimum of two int values.
LMAX(a,b)
Maximum of two long values.
LMIN(a,b)
Minimum of two long values.
SIGN(a,b)
Magnitude of a times sign of b.
Scientiï¬c programming in C may someday become a bed of roses; for now,
watch out for the thorns!

1.3 Error, Accuracy, and Stability
Althoughwe assume no prior trainingof the reader in formal numerical analysis,
we will need to presume a common understanding of a few key concepts. We will
deï¬ne these brieï¬y in this section.
Computers store numbers not with inï¬nite precision but rather in some approxi-
mation that can be packed into a ï¬xed number of bits (binary digits) or bytes (groups
of 8 bits). Almost all computers allow the programmer a choice among several
different such representations or data types. Data types can differ in the number of
bits utilized (the wordlength), but also in the more fundamental respect of whether
the stored number is represented in ï¬xed-point (int or long) or ï¬oating-point
(float or double) format.
A number in integer representation is exact. Arithmetic between numbers in
integer representation is also exact, with the provisos that (i) the answer is not outside
the range of (usually, signed) integers that can be represented, and (ii) that division
is interpreted as producing an integer result, throwing away any integer remainder.
In ï¬oating-point representation, a number is represented internally by a sign bit
s (interpreted as plus or minus), an exact integer exponent e, and an exact positive
integer mantissa M. Taken together these represent the number
s Ã M Ã BeâE
(1.3.1)
where B is the base of the representation (usually B = 2, but sometimes B = 16),
and E is the bias of the exponent, a ï¬xed integer constant for any given machine
and representation. An example is shown in Figure 1.3.1.
Several ï¬oating-point bit patterns can represent the same number. If B = 2,
for example, a mantissa with leading (high-order) zero bits can be left-shifted, i.e.,
multiplied by a power of 2, if the exponent is decreased by a compensating amount.
Bit patterns that are âas left-shifted as they can beâ are termed normalized. Most
computers always produce normalized results, since these donât waste any bits of
the mantissa and thus allow a greater accuracy of the representation.
Since the
high-order bit of a properly normalized mantissa (when B = 2) is always one, some
computers donât store this bit at all, giving one extra bit of signiï¬cance.
Arithmetic among numbers in ï¬oating-point representation is not exact, even if
the operands happen to be exactly represented (i.e., have exact values in the form of
equation 1.3.1). For example, two ï¬oating numbers are added by ï¬rst right-shifting
(dividing by two) the mantissa of the smaller (in magnitude) one, simultaneously
increasing its exponent, until the two operands have the same exponent. Low-order
(least signiï¬cant) bits of the smaller operand are lost by this shifting. If the two
operands differ too greatly in magnitude, then the smaller operand is effectively
replaced by zero, since it is right-shifted to oblivion.
The smallest (in magnitude) ï¬oating-point number which, when added to the
ï¬oating-point number 1.0, produces a ï¬oating-point result different from 1.0 is
termed the machine accuracy Ïµm. A typical computer with B = 2 and a 32-bit
wordlength has Ïµm around 3 Ã 10â8.
(A more detailed discussion of machine
characteristics, and a program to determine them, is given in Â§20.1.)

deï¬ne these brieï¬y in this section.
Computers store numbers not with inï¬nite precision but rather in some approxi-
mation that can be packed into a ï¬xed number of bits (binary digits) or bytes (groups
of 8 bits). Almost all computers allow the programmer a choice among several
different such representations or data types. Data types can differ in the number of

the stored number is represented in ï¬xed-point (int or long) or ï¬oating-point
(float or double) format.
A number in integer representation is exact. Arithmetic between numbers in
integer representation is also exact, with the provisos that (i) the answer is not outside
the range of (usually, signed) integers that can be represented, and (ii) that division
is interpreted as producing an integer result, throwing away any integer remainder.
In ï¬oating-point representation, a number is represented internally by a sign bit
s (interpreted as plus or minus), an exact integer exponent e, and an exact positive
integer mantissa M. Taken together these represent the number
s Ã M Ã BeâE
(1.3.1)
where B is the base of the representation (usually B = 2, but sometimes B = 16),
and E is the bias of the exponent, a ï¬xed integer constant for any given machine
and representation. An example is shown in Figure 1.3.1.
Several ï¬oating-point bit patterns can represent the same number. If B = 2,
for example, a mantissa with leading (high-order) zero bits can be left-shifted, i.e.,
multiplied by a power of 2, if the exponent is decreased by a compensating amount.
Bit patterns that are âas left-shifted as they can beâ are termed normalized. Most
computers always produce normalized results, since these donât waste any bits of
the mantissa and thus allow a greater accuracy of the representation.
Since the
high-order bit of a properly normalized mantissa (when B = 2) is always one, some
computers donât store this bit at all, giving one extra bit of signiï¬cance.
Arithmetic among numbers in ï¬oating-point representation is not exact, even if
the operands happen to be exactly represented (i.e., have exact values in the form of
equation 1.3.1). For example, two ï¬oating numbers are added by ï¬rst right-shifting
(dividing by two) the mantissa of the smaller (in magnitude) one, simultaneously
increasing its exponent, until the two operands have the same exponent. Low-order
(least signiï¬cant) bits of the smaller operand are lost by this shifting. If the two
operands differ too greatly in magnitude, then the smaller operand is effectively
replaced by zero, since it is right-shifted to oblivion.
The smallest (in magnitude) ï¬oating-point number which, when added to the
ï¬oating-point number 1.0, produces a ï¬oating-point result different from 1.0 is
termed the machine accuracy Ïµm. A typical computer with B = 2 and a 32-bit
wordlength has Ïµm around 3 Ã 10â8.

speaking, the machine accuracy Ïµm is the fractional accuracy to which ï¬oating-point
numbers are represented, corresponding to a change of one in the least signiï¬cant
bit of the mantissa. Pretty much any arithmetic operation among ï¬oating numbers
should be thought of as introducing an additional fractional error of at least Ïµm. This
type of error is called roundoff error.
It is important to understand that Ïµm is not the smallest ï¬oating-point number
that can be represented on a machine. That number depends on how many bits there
are in the exponent, while Ïµm depends on how many bits there are in the mantissa.
Roundoff errors accumulate with increasing amounts of calculation. If, in the
course of obtaining a calculated value, you perform N such arithmetic operations,
you might be so lucky as to have a total roundoff error on the order of
â
NÏµm, if
the roundoff errors come in randomly up or down. (The square root comes from a
random-walk.) However, this estimate can be very badly off the mark for two reasons:
(i) It very frequently happens that the regularities of your calculation, or the
peculiarities of your computer, cause the roundoff errors to accumulate preferentially
in one direction. In this case the total will be of order NÏµm.
(ii) Some especially unfavorable occurrences can vastly increase the roundoff
error of single operations. Generally these can be traced to the subtraction of two
very nearly equal numbers, giving a result whose only signiï¬cant bits are those
(few) low-order ones in which the operands differed. You might think that such a
âcoincidentalâ subtraction is unlikely to occur. Not always so. Some mathematical
expressions magnify its probability of occurrence tremendously. For example, in the
familiar formula for the solution of a quadratic equation,
x = âb +
â
b2 â4ac
2a
(1.3.2)
the addition becomes delicate and roundoff-prone whenever ac âªb2. (In Â§5.6 we
will learn how to avoid the problem in this particular case.)

Roundoff error is a characteristic of computer hardware.
There is another,
different, kind of error that is a characteristic of the program or algorithm used,
independent of the hardware on which the program is executed. Many numerical
algorithms compute âdiscreteâ approximations to some desired âcontinuousâ quan-
tity. For example, an integral is evaluated numerically by computing a function
at a discrete set of points, rather than at âeveryâ point.
Or, a function may be
evaluated by summing a ï¬nite number of leading terms in its inï¬nite series, rather
than all inï¬nity terms. In cases like this, there is an adjustable parameter, e.g., the
number of points or of terms, such that the âtrueâ answer is obtained only when
that parameter goes to inï¬nity. Any practical calculation is done with a ï¬nite, but
sufï¬ciently large, choice of that parameter.
The discrepancy between the true answer and the answer obtained in a practical
calculation is called the truncation error. Truncation error would persist even on a
hypothetical, âperfectâ computer that had an inï¬nitelyaccurate representation and no
roundoff error. As a general rule there is not much that a programmer can do about
roundoff error, other than to choose algorithms that do not magnify it unnecessarily
(see discussion of âstabilityâ below). Truncation error, on the other hand, is entirely
under the programmerâs control.
In fact, it is only a slight exaggeration to say
that clever minimization of truncation error is practically the entire content of the
ï¬eld of numerical analysis!
Most of the time, truncation error and roundoff error do not strongly interact
with one another. A calculation can be imagined as having, ï¬rst, the truncation error
that it would have if run on an inï¬nite-precision computer, âplusâ the roundoff error
associated with the number of operations performed.
Sometimes, however, an otherwise attractive method can be unstable. This
means that any roundoff error that becomes âmixed intoâ the calculation at an early
stage is successively magniï¬ed until it comes to swamp the true answer. An unstable
method would be useful on a hypothetical, perfect computer; but in this imperfect
world it is necessary for us to require that algorithms be stable â or if unstable
that we use them with great caution.
Here is a simple, if somewhat artiï¬cial, example of an unstable algorithm:
Suppose that it is desired to calculate all integer powers of the so-called âGolden
Mean,â the number given by
Ï â¡
â
5 â1
2
â0.61803398
(1.3.3)
It turns out (you can easily verify) that the powers Ïn satisfy a simple recursion
relation,
Ïn+1 = Ïnâ1 âÏn
(1.3.4)
Thus, knowing the ï¬rst two values Ï0 = 1 and Ï1 = 0.61803398, we can
successively apply (1.3.4) performing only a single subtraction, rather than a slower
multiplication by Ï, at each stage.
Unfortunately, the recurrence (1.3.4) also has another solution,namely the value
â1
2(
â
5 + 1). Since the recurrence is linear, and since this undesired solution has
magnitude greater than unity, any small admixture of it introduced by roundoff errors
will grow exponentially. On a typical machine with 32-bit wordlength, (1.3.4) starts

Solution of Linear
Algebraic Equations
2.0 Introduction
A set of linear algebraic equations looks like this:
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 + Â· Â· Â· + a1NxN = b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 + Â· Â· Â· + a2NxN = b2
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 + Â· Â· Â· + a3NxN = b3
Â· Â· Â·
Â· Â· Â·
aM1x1 + aM2x2 + aM3x3 + Â· Â· Â· + aMNxN = bM
(2.0.1)
Here the N unknowns xj, j = 1, 2, . . ., N are related by M equations.
The
coefï¬cients aij with i = 1, 2, . . ., M and j = 1, 2, . . ., N are known numbers, as
are the right-hand side quantities bi, i = 1, 2, . . ., M.
Nonsingular versus Singular Sets of Equations
If N = M then there are as many equations as unknowns, and there is a good
chance of solving for a unique solution set of xjâs. Analytically, there can fail to
be a unique solution if one or more of the M equations is a linear combination of
the others, a condition called row degeneracy, or if all equations contain certain
variables only in exactly the same linear combination, called column degeneracy.
(For square matrices, a row degeneracy implies a column degeneracy, and vice
versa.) A set of equations that is degenerate is called singular. We will consider
singular matrices in some detail in Â§2.6.
Numerically, at least two additional things can go wrong:
â¢ While not exact linear combinations of each other, some of the equations
may be so close to linearly dependent that roundoff errors in the machine
render them linearly dependent at some stage in the solution process. In
this case your numerical procedure will fail, and it can tell you that it
has failed.

â¢ Accumulated roundoff errors in the solution process can swamp the true
solution.
This problem particularly emerges if N is too large.
The
numerical procedure does not fail algorithmically. However, it returns a
set of xâs that are wrong, as can be discovered by direct substitution back
into the original equations. The closer a set of equations is to being singular,
the more likely this is to happen, since increasingly close cancellations
will occur during the solution. In fact, the preceding item can be viewed
as the special case where the loss of signiï¬cance is unfortunately total.
Much of the sophistication of complicated âlinear equation-solving packagesâ
is devoted to the detection and/or correction of these two pathologies.
As you
work with large linear sets of equations, you will develop a feeling for when such
sophistication is needed. It is difï¬cult to give any ï¬rm guidelines, since there is no
such thing as a âtypicalâ linear problem. But here is a rough idea: Linear sets with
N as large as 20 or 50 can be routinely solved in single precision (32 bit ï¬oating
representations) without resorting to sophisticated methods, if the equations are not
close to singular. With double precision (60 or 64 bits), this number can readily
be extended to N as large as several hundred, after which point the limiting factor
is generally machine time, not accuracy.
Even larger linear sets, N in the thousands or greater, can be solved when the
coefï¬cients are sparse (that is, mostly zero), by methods that take advantage of the
sparseness.
We discuss this further in Â§2.7.
At the other end of the spectrum, one seems just as often to encounter linear
problems which, by their underlying nature, are close to singular. In this case, you
might need to resort to sophisticated methods even for the case of N = 10 (though
rarely for N = 5).
Singular value decomposition (Â§2.6) is a technique that can
sometimes turn singular problems into nonsingular ones, in which case additional
sophistication becomes unnecessary.
Matrices
Equation (2.0.1) can be written in matrix form as
A Â· x = b
(2.0.2)
Here the raised dot denotes matrix multiplication,A is the matrix of coefï¬cients, and
b is the right-hand side written as a column vector,
A =
ï£®
ï£¯ï£°
a11
a12

a1N

b =

(2.0.3)
By convention, the ï¬rst index on an element aij denotes its row, the second
index its column. For most purposes you donât need to know how a matrix is stored
in a computerâs physical memory; you simply reference matrix elements by their
two-dimensional addresses, e.g., a34 = a[3][4]. We have already seen, in Â§1.2,
that this C notation can in fact hide a rather subtle and versatile physical storage
scheme, âpointer to array of pointers to rows.â You might wish to review that section

at this point. Occasionally it is useful to be able to peer through the veil, for example
to pass a whole row a[i][j], j=1, . . ., N by the reference a[i].
Tasks of Computational Linear Algebra
We will consider the following tasks as falling in the general purview of this
chapter:
â¢ Solutionof the matrix equationAÂ·x = b for an unknownvector x, where A
is a square matrix of coefï¬cients, raised dot denotes matrix multiplication,
and b is a known right-hand side vector (Â§2.1âÂ§2.10).
â¢ Solution of more than one matrix equation A Â· xj = bj, for a set of vectors
xj, j = 1, 2, . . ., each corresponding to a different, known right-hand side
vector bj. In this task the key simpliï¬cation is that the matrix A is held
constant, while the right-hand sides, the bâs, are changed (Â§2.1âÂ§2.10).
â¢ Calculation of the matrix Aâ1 which is the matrix inverse of a square
matrix A, i.e., A Â· Aâ1 = Aâ1 Â· A = 1, where 1 is the identity matrix
(all zeros except for ones on the diagonal).
This task is equivalent,
for an N Ã N matrix A, to the previous task with N different bjâs
(j = 1, 2, . . ., N), namely the unit vectors (bj = all zero elements except
for 1 in the jth component). The corresponding xâs are then the columns
of the matrix inverse of A (Â§2.1 and Â§2.3).
â¢ Calculation of the determinant of a square matrix A (Â§2.3).
If M < N, or if M = N but the equations are degenerate, then there are
effectively fewer equations than unknowns.
In this case there can be either no
solution, or else more than one solution vector x. In the latter event, the solution
space consists of a particular solution xp added to any linear combination of
(typically) N âM vectors (which are said to be in the nullspace of the matrix A).
The task of ï¬nding the solution space of A involves
â¢ Singular value decomposition of a matrix A.
This subject is treated in Â§2.6.
In the opposite case there are more equations than unknowns, M > N. When
this occurs there is, in general, no solution vector x to equation (2.0.1), and the set
of equations is said to be overdetermined. It happens frequently, however, that the
best âcompromiseâ solution is sought, the one that comes closest to satisfying all
equations simultaneously. If closeness is deï¬ned in the least-squares sense, i.e., that
the sum of the squares of the differences between the left- and right-hand sides of
equation (2.0.1) be minimized, then the overdetermined linear problem reduces to
a (usually) solvable linear problem, called the
â¢ Linear least-squares problem.
The reduced set of equations to be solved can be written as the N ÃN set of equations
(AT Â· A) Â· x = (AT Â· b)
(2.0.4)
where AT denotes the transpose of the matrix A. Equations (2.0.4) are called the
normal equations of the linear least-squares problem. There is a close connection

between singular value decomposition and the linear least-squares problem, and the
latter is also discussed in Â§2.6. You should be warned that direct solution of the
normal equations (2.0.4) is not generally the best way to ï¬nd least-squares solutions.
Some other topics in this chapter include
â¢ Iterative improvement of a solution (Â§2.5)
â¢ Various special forms:
symmetric positive-deï¬nite (Â§2.9), tridiagonal
(Â§2.4), band diagonal (Â§2.4), Toeplitz (Â§2.8), Vandermonde (Â§2.8), sparse
(Â§2.7)
â¢ Strassenâs âfast matrix inversionâ (Â§2.11).
Standard Subroutine Packages
We cannot hope, in this chapter or in this book, to tell you everything there is to
know about the tasks that have been deï¬ned above. In many cases you will have no
alternative but to use sophisticated black-box program packages. Several good ones
are available, though not always in C. LINPACK was developed at Argonne National
Laboratories and deserves particular mention because it is published, documented,
and available for free use. A successor to LINPACK, LAPACK, is now becoming
available. Packages available commercially (though not necessarily in C) include
those in the IMSL and NAG libraries.
You should keep in mind that the sophisticated packages are designed with very
large linear systems in mind. They therefore go to great effort to minimize not only
the number of operations, but also the required storage. Routines for the various
tasks are usually provided in several versions, corresponding to several possible
simpliï¬cations in the form of the input coefï¬cient matrix: symmetric, triangular,
banded, positive deï¬nite, etc. If you have a large matrix in one of these forms,
you should certainly take advantage of the increased efï¬ciency provided by these
different routines, and not just use the form provided for general matrices.
There is also a great watershed dividing routines that are direct (i.e., execute
in a predictable number of operations) from routines that are iterative (i.e., attempt
to converge to the desired answer in however many steps are necessary). Iterative
methods become preferable when the battle against loss of signiï¬cance is in danger
of being lost, either due to large N or because the problem is close to singular. We
will treat iterative methods only incompletely in this book, in Â§2.7 and in Chapters
18 and 19. These methods are important, but mostly beyond our scope. We will,
however, discuss in detail a technique which is on the borderline between direct
and iterative methods, namely the iterative improvement of a solution that has been
obtained by direct methods (Â§2.5).

2.1 Gauss-Jordan Elimination
For inverting a matrix, Gauss-Jordan elimination is about as efï¬cient as any
other method.
For solving sets of linear equations, Gauss-Jordan elimination
produces both the solution of the equations for one or more right-hand side vectors
b, and also the matrix inverse Aâ1. However, its principal weaknesses are (i) that
it requires all the right-hand sides to be stored and manipulated at the same time,
and (ii) that when the inverse matrix is not desired, Gauss-Jordan is three times
slower than the best alternative technique for solving a single linear set (Â§2.3). The
methodâs principal strength is that it is as stable as any other direct method, perhaps
even a bit more stable when full pivoting is used (see below).
If you come along later with an additional right-hand side vector, you can
multiply it by the inverse matrix, of course. This does give an answer, but one that is
quite susceptible to roundoff error, not nearly as good as if the new vector had been
included with the set of right-hand side vectors in the ï¬rst instance.
For these reasons, Gauss-Jordan elimination should usually not be your method
of ï¬rst choice, either for solving linear equations or for matrix inversion.
The
decomposition methods in Â§2.3 are better. Why do we give you Gauss-Jordan at all?
Because it is straightforward, understandable, solid as a rock, and an exceptionally
good âpsychologicalâ backup for those times that something is going wrong and you
think it might be your linear-equation solver.
Some people believe that the backup is more than psychological, that Gauss-
Jordan elimination is an âindependentâ numerical method.
This turns out to be
mostly myth.
Except for the relatively minor differences in pivoting, described
below, the actual sequence of operations performed in Gauss-Jordan elimination is
very closely related to that performed by the routines in the next two sections.
For clarity, and to avoid writingendless ellipses (Â· Â· Â·) we will write out equations
only for the case of four equations and four unknowns, and with three different right-
hand side vectors that are known in advance. You can write bigger matrices and
extend the equations to the case of N Ã N matrices, with M sets of right-hand
side vectors, in completely analogous fashion.
The routine implemented below
is, of course, general.

2.1 Gauss-Jordan Elimination
For inverting a matrix, Gauss-Jordan elimination is about as efï¬cient as any
other method.
For solving sets of linear equations, Gauss-Jordan elimination
produces both the solution of the equations for one or more right-hand side vectors
b, and also the matrix inverse Aâ1. However, its principal weaknesses are (i) that
it requires all the right-hand sides to be stored and manipulated at the same time,
and (ii) that when the inverse matrix is not desired, Gauss-Jordan is three times
slower than the best alternative technique for solving a single linear set (Â§2.3). The
methodâs principal strength is that it is as stable as any other direct method, perhaps
even a bit more stable when full pivoting is used (see below).
If you come along later with an additional right-hand side vector, you can
multiply it by the inverse matrix, of course. This does give an answer, but one that is
quite susceptible to roundoff error, not nearly as good as if the new vector had been
included with the set of right-hand side vectors in the ï¬rst instance.
For these reasons, Gauss-Jordan elimination should usually not be your method
of ï¬rst choice, either for solving linear equations or for matrix inversion.
The

(2.1.1)
Here the raised dot (Â·) signiï¬es matrix multiplication, while the operator âjust
signiï¬es column augmentation, that is, removing the abutting parentheses and
making a wider matrix out of the operands of the âoperator.
It should not take you long to write out equation (2.1.1) and to see that it simply
states that xij is the ith component (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the vector solution of the jth
right-hand side (j = 1, 2, 3), the one whose coefï¬cients are bij, i = 1, 2, 3, 4; and
that the matrix of unknown coefï¬cients yij is the inverse matrix of aij. In other
words, the matrix solution of
[A] Â· [x1 âx2 âx3 âY] = [b1 âb2 âb3 â1]
(2.1.2)
where A and Y are square matrices, the biâs and xiâs are column vectors, and 1 is
the identity matrix, simultaneously solves the linear sets
A Â· x1 = b1
A Â· x2 = b2
A Â· x3 = b3
(2.1.3)
and
A Â· Y = 1
(2.1.4)
Now it is also elementary to verify the following facts about (2.1.1):
â¢ Interchanging any two rows of A and the corresponding rows of the bâs
and of 1, does not change (or scramble in any way) the solution xâs and
Y. Rather, it just corresponds to writing the same set of linear equations
in a different order.
â¢ Likewise, the solution set is unchanged and in no way scrambled if we
replace any row in A by a linear combination of itself and any other row,
as long as we do the same linear combination of the rows of the bâs and 1
(which then is no longer the identity matrix, of course).
â¢ Interchanging any two columns of A gives the same solution set only
if we simultaneously interchange corresponding rows of the xâs and of
Y. In other words, this interchange scrambles the order of the rows in
the solution. If we do this, we will need to unscramble the solution by
restoring the rows to their original order.
Gauss-Jordan elimination uses one or more of the above operations to reduce
the matrix A to the identity matrix. When this is accomplished, the right-hand side
becomes the solution set, as one sees instantly from (2.1.2).

Pivoting
In âGauss-Jordan elimination with no pivoting,â only the second operation in
the above list is used. The ï¬rst row is divided by the element a11 (this being a
trivial linear combination of the ï¬rst row with any other row â zero coefï¬cient for
the other row). Then the right amount of the ï¬rst row is subtracted from each other
row to make all the remaining ai1âs zero. The ï¬rst column of A now agrees with
the identity matrix. We move to the second column and divide the second row by
a22, then subtract the right amount of the second row from rows 1, 3, and 4, so as to
make their entries in the second column zero. The second column is now reduced
to the identity form. And so on for the third and fourth columns. As we do these
operations to A, we of course also do the corresponding operations to the bâs and to
1 (which by now no longer resembles the identity matrix in any way!).
Obviously we will run into trouble if we ever encounter a zero element on the
(then current) diagonal when we are going to divide by the diagonal element. (The
element that we divide by, incidentally, is called the pivot element or pivot.) Not so
obvious, but true, is the fact that Gauss-Jordan eliminationwithno pivoting(no use of
the ï¬rst or third procedures in the above list) is numerically unstable in the presence
of any roundoff error, even when a zero pivot is not encountered. You must never do
Gauss-Jordan elimination (or Gaussian elimination, see below) without pivoting!
So what is this magic pivoting? Nothing more than interchanging rows (partial
pivoting) or rows and columns (full pivoting), so as to put a particularly desirable
element in the diagonal position from which the pivot is about to be selected. Since
we donât want to mess up the part of the identitymatrix that we have already built up,
we can choose among elements that are both (i) on rows below (or on) the one that
is about to be normalized, and also (ii) on columns to the right (or on) the column
we are about to eliminate. Partial pivoting is easier than full pivoting, because we
donât have to keep track of the permutation of the solution vector. Partial pivoting
makes available as pivots only the elements already in the correct column. It turns
out that partial pivoting is âalmostâ as good as full pivoting, in a sense that can be
made mathematically precise, but which need not concern us here (for discussion
and references, see [1]). To show you both variants, we do full pivoting in the routine
in this section, partial pivoting in Â§2.3.
We have to state how to recognize a particularly desirable pivot when we see
one. The answer to this is not completely known theoretically. It is known, both
theoretically and in practice, that simply picking the largest (in magnitude) available
element as the pivot is a very good choice. A curiosity of this procedure, however, is
that the choice of pivot will depend on the originalscaling of the equations. If we take
the third linear equation in our original set and multiply it by a factor of a million, it
is almost guaranteed that it will contribute the ï¬rst pivot; yet the underlying solution
of the equations is not changed by this multiplication! One therefore sometimes sees
routines which choose as pivot that element which would have been largest if the
original equations had all been scaled to have their largest coefï¬cient normalized to
unity. This is called implicit pivoting. There is some extra bookkeeping to keep track
of the scale factors by which the rows would have been multiplied. (The routines in
Â§2.3 include implicit pivoting, but the routine in this section does not.)
Finally, let us consider the storage requirements of the method. With a little
reï¬ection you will see that at every stage of the algorithm, either an element of A is

predictably a one or zero (if it is already in a part of the matrix that has been reduced
to identity form) or else the exactly corresponding element of the matrix that started
as 1 is predictably a one or zero (if its mate in A has not been reduced to the identity
form). Therefore the matrix 1 does not have to exist as separate storage: The matrix
inverse of A is gradually built up in A as the original A is destroyed. Likewise,
the solution vectors x can gradually replace the right-hand side vectors b and share
the same storage, since after each column in A is reduced, the corresponding row
entry in the bâs is never again used.
Here is the routine for Gauss-Jordan elimination with full pivoting:
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
#define SWAP(a,b) {temp=(a);(a)=(b);(b)=temp;}
void gaussj(float **a, int n, float **b, int m)
Linear equation solution by Gauss-Jordan elimination, equation (2.1.1) above. a[1..n][1..n]
is the input matrix. b[1..n][1..m] is input containing the m right-hand side vectors. On
output, a is replaced by its matrix inverse, and b is replaced by the corresponding set of solution
vectors.
{
int *indxc,*indxr,*ipiv;
int i,icol,irow,j,k,l,ll;
float big,dum,pivinv,temp;
indxc=ivector(1,n);
The integer arrays ipiv, indxr, and indxc are
used for bookkeeping on the pivoting.
indxr=ivector(1,n);
ipiv=ivector(1,n);
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) ipiv[j]=0;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
This is the main loop over the columns to be
reduced.
big=0.0;
for (j=1;j<=n;j++)
This is the outer loop of the search for a pivot
element.
if (ipiv[j] != 1)
for (k=1;k<=n;k++) {
if (ipiv[k] == 0) {
if (fabs(a[j][k]) >= big) {
big=fabs(a[j][k]);
irow=j;
icol=k;
}
} else if (ipiv[k] > 1) nrerror("gaussj: Singular Matrix-1");
}
++(ipiv[icol]);
We now have the pivot element, so we interchange rows, if needed, to put the pivot
element on the diagonal. The columns are not physically interchanged, only relabeled:
indxc[i], the column of the ith pivot element, is the ith column that is reduced, while
indxr[i] is the row in which that pivot element was originally located. If indxr[i] Ì¸=
indxc[i] there is an implied column interchange. With this form of bookkeeping, the
solution bâs will end up in the correct order, and the inverse matrix will be scrambled
by columns.
if (irow != icol) {
for (l=1;l<=n;l++) SWAP(a[irow][l],a[icol][l])
for (l=1;l<=m;l++) SWAP(b[irow][l],b[icol][l])
}
indxr[i]=irow;
We are now ready to divide the pivot row by the
pivot element, located at irow and icol.
indxc[i]=icol;
if (a[icol][icol] == 0.0) nrerror("gaussj: Singular Matrix-2");
pivinv=1.0/a[icol][icol];
a[icol][icol]=1.0;
for (l=1;l<=n;l++) a[icol][l] *= pivinv;
for (l=1;l<=m;l++) b[icol][l] *= pivinv;

Row versus Column Elimination Strategies
The above discussion can be ampliï¬ed by a modest amount of formalism.
Row
operations on a matrix A correspond to pre- (that is, left-) multiplication by some simple
matrix R. For example, the matrix R with components
Rij =
ï£±
ï£´
ï£²
ï£´
ï£³
1
if i = j and i Ì¸= 2, 4
1
if i = 2, j = 4
1
if i = 4, j = 2
0
otherwise
(2.1.5)
effects the interchange of rows 2 and 4. Gauss-Jordan elimination by row operations alone
(including the possibility of partial pivoting) consists of a series of such left-multiplications,
yielding successively
A Â· x = b
(Â· Â· Â· R3 Â· R2 Â· R1 Â· A) Â· x = Â· Â· Â· R3 Â· R2 Â· R1 Â· b
(1) Â· x = Â· Â· Â· R3 Â· R2 Â· R1 Â· b
x = Â· Â· Â· R3 Â· R2 Â· R1 Â· b
(2.1.6)
The key point is that since the Râs build from right to left, the right-hand side is simply
transformed at each stage from one vector to another.
Column operations, on the other hand, correspond to post-, or right-, multiplications
by simple matrices, call them C. The matrix in equation (2.1.5), if right-multiplied onto a
matrix A, will interchange Aâs second and fourth columns. Elimination by column operations
involves (conceptually) inserting a column operator, and also its inverse, between the matrix
A and the unknown vector x:
A Â· x = b
A Â· C1 Â· Câ1

Â· x = b

Notice the essential difference between equation (2.1.8) and equation (2.1.6). In the
latter case, the Câs must be applied to b in the reverse order from that in which they become
known. That is, they must all be stored along the way. This requirement greatly reduces
the usefulness of column operations, generally restricting them to simple permutations, for
example in support of full pivoting.

2.2 Gaussian Elimination with Backsubstitution
The usefulness of Gaussian elimination with backsubstitution is primarily
pedagogical. It stands between full elimination schemes such as Gauss-Jordan, and
triangular decomposition schemes such as will be discussed in the next section.
Gaussian elimination reduces a matrix not all the way to the identity matrix, but
only halfway, to a matrix whose components on the diagonal and above (say) remain
nontrivial. Let us now see what advantages accrue.
Suppose that in doing Gauss-Jordan elimination, as described in Â§2.1, we at
each stage subtract away rows only below the then-current pivot element. When a22
is the pivot element, for example, we divide the second row by its value (as before),
but now use the pivot row to zero only a32 and a42, not a12 (see equation 2.1.1).
Suppose, also, that we do only partial pivoting, never interchanging columns, so that
the order of the unknowns never needs to be modiï¬ed.
Then, when we have done this for all the pivots, we will be left with a reduced
equation that looks like this (in the case of a single right-hand side vector):

Here the primes signify that the aâs and bâs do not have their original numerical

point. The procedure up to this point is termed Gaussian elimination.

2.2 Gaussian Elimination with Backsubstitution
The usefulness of Gaussian elimination with backsubstitution is primarily
pedagogical. It stands between full elimination schemes such as Gauss-Jordan, and
triangular decomposition schemes such as will be discussed in the next section.
Gaussian elimination reduces a matrix not all the way to the identity matrix, but
only halfway, to a matrix whose components on the diagonal and above (say) remain
nontrivial. Let us now see what advantages accrue.
Suppose that in doing Gauss-Jordan elimination, as described in Â§2.1, we at
each stage subtract away rows only below the then-current pivot element. When a22
is the pivot element, for example, we divide the second row by its value (as before),
but now use the pivot row to zero only a32 and a42, not a12 (see equation 2.1.1).
Suppose, also, that we do only partial pivoting, never interchanging columns, so that
the order of the unknowns never needs to be modiï¬ed.
Then, when we have done this for all the pivots, we will be left with a reduced
equation that looks like this (in the case of a single right-hand side vector):

Here the primes signify that the aâs and bâs do not have their original numerical
values, but have been modiï¬ed by all the row operations in the elimination to this
point. The procedure up to this point is termed Gaussian elimination.

(2.2.4)
The procedure deï¬ned by equation (2.2.4) is called backsubstitution. The com-
bination of Gaussian elimination and backsubstitution yields a solution to the set
of equations.
The advantage of Gaussian elimination and backsubstitutionover Gauss-Jordan
elimination is simply that the former is faster in raw operations count:
The
innermost loops of Gauss-Jordan elimination, each containing one subtraction and
one multiplication, are executed N 3 and N 2M times (where there are N equations
and M unknowns). The corresponding loops in Gaussian elimination are executed
only 1
3N 3 times (only half the matrix is reduced, and the increasing numbers of
predictable zeros reduce the count to one-third), and 1
2N 2M times, respectively.
Each backsubstitution of a right-hand side is 1
2N 2 executions of a similar loop (one
multiplication plus one subtraction). For M âªN (only a few right-hand sides)
Gaussian elimination thus has about a factor three advantage over Gauss-Jordan.
(We could reduce this advantage to a factor 1.5 by not computing the inverse matrix
as part of the Gauss-Jordan scheme.)
For computing the inverse matrix (which we can view as the case of M = N
right-hand sides, namely the N unit vectors which are the columns of the identity
matrix), Gaussianeliminationandbacksubstitutionat ï¬rst glancerequire 1
3N 3 (matrix
reduction) + 1
2N 3 (right-hand side manipulations) + 1
2N 3 (N backsubstitutions)
= 4
3N 3 loop executions, which is more than the N 3 for Gauss-Jordan. However, the
unit vectors are quite special in containing all zeros except for one element. If this
is taken into account, the right-side manipulations can be reduced to only 1
6N 3 loop
executions, and, for matrix inversion, the two methods have identical efï¬ciencies.
Both Gaussian eliminationand Gauss-Jordan eliminationshare the disadvantage
that all right-hand sides must be known in advance. The LU decomposition method
in the next section does not share that deï¬ciency, and also has an equally small
operations count, both for solution with any number of right-hand sides, and for
matrix inversion. For this reason we will not implement the method of Gaussian
elimination as a routine.

Equations (2.3.6) and (2.3.7) total (for each right-hand side b) N 2 executions
of an inner loop containing one multiply and one add. If we have N right-hand
sides which are the unit column vectors (which is the case when we are inverting a
matrix), then taking into account the leading zeros reduces the total execution count
of (2.3.6) from 1
2N 3 to 1
6N 3, while (2.3.7) is unchanged at 1
2N 3.
Notice that, once we have the LU decomposition of A, we can solve with as
many right-hand sides as we then care to, one at a time. This is a distinct advantage
over the methods of Â§2.1 and Â§2.2.
Performing the LU Decomposition
How then can we solve for L and U, given A?
First, we write out the
i, jth component of equation (2.3.1) or (2.3.2). That component always is a sum
beginning with
Î±i1Î²1j + Â· Â· Â· = aij
The number of terms in the sum depends, however, on whether i or j is the smaller
number. We have, in fact, the three cases,
i < j :
Î±i1Î²1j + Î±i2Î²2j + Â· Â· Â· + Î±iiÎ²ij = aij
(2.3.8)
i = j :
Î±i1Î²1j + Î±i2Î²2j + Â· Â· Â· + Î±iiÎ²jj = aij
(2.3.9)
i > j :
Î±i1Î²1j + Î±i2Î²2j + Â· Â· Â· + Î±ijÎ²jj = aij
(2.3.10)
Equations (2.3.8)â(2.3.10) total N 2 equations for the N 2 +N unknown Î±âs and
Î²âs (the diagonal being represented twice). Since the number of unknowns is greater
than the number of equations, we are invited to specify N of the unknowns arbitrarily
and then try to solve for the others. In fact, as we shall see, it is always possible to take
Î±ii â¡1
i = 1, . . ., N
(2.3.11)
A surprising procedure, now, is Croutâs algorithm, which quite trivially solves
the set of N 2 + N equations (2.3.8)â(2.3.11) for all the Î±âs and Î²âs by just arranging
the equations in a certain order! That order is as follows:
â¢ Set Î±ii = 1, i = 1, . . ., N (equation 2.3.11).
â¢ For each j = 1, 2, 3, . . ., N do these two procedures:
First, for i =
1, 2, . . ., j, use (2.3.8), (2.3.9), and (2.3.11) to solve for Î²ij, namely
Î²ij = aij â
iâ1
X
k=1
Î±ikÎ²kj.
(2.3.12)
(When i = 1 in 2.3.12 the summation term is taken to mean zero.) Second,
for i = j + 1, j + 2, . . ., N use (2.3.10) to solve for Î±ij, namely
Î±ij =
1
Î²jj
 
aij â
jâ1
X
k=1
Î±ikÎ²kj
!
.
(2.3.13)
Be sure to do both procedures before going on to the next j.

If you work through a few iterations of the above procedure, you will see that
the Î±âs and Î²âs that occur on the right-hand side of equations (2.3.12) and (2.3.13)
are already determined by the time they are needed. You will also see that every aij
is used only once and never again. This means that the corresponding Î±ij or Î²ij can
be stored in the location that the a used to occupy: the decomposition is âin place.â

method. Only partial pivoting (interchange of rows) can be implemented efï¬ciently.
However this is enough to make the method stable. This means, incidentally, that
we donât actually decompose the matrix A into LU form, but rather we decompose
a rowwise permutation of A. (If we keep track of what that permutation is, this
decomposition is just as useful as the original one would have been.)
Pivoting is slightly subtle in Croutâs algorithm. The key point to notice is that
equation (2.3.12) in the case of i = j (its ï¬nal application) is exactly the same as
equation (2.3.13) except for the division in the latter equation; in both cases the
upper limit of the sum is k = j â1 (= i â1). This means that we donât have to
commit ourselves as to whether the diagonal element Î²jj is the one that happens
to fall on the diagonal in the ï¬rst instance, or whether one of the (undivided) Î±ijâs
below it in the column, i = j +1, . . ., N, is to be âpromotedâ to become the diagonal
Î². This can be decided after all the candidates in the column are in hand. As you
should be able to guess by now, we will choose the largest one as the diagonal Î²
(pivot element), then do all the divisions by that element en masse. This is Croutâs
method with partial pivoting. Our implementation has one additional wrinkle: It
initially ï¬nds the largest element in each row, and subsequently (when it is looking
for the maximal pivot element) scales the comparison as if we had initially scaled all
the equations to make their maximum coefï¬cient equal to unity; this is the implicit
pivoting mentioned in Â§2.1.

A but rather as its LU decomposition, determined by the routine ludcmp. indx[1..n] is input
as the permutation vector returned by ludcmp. b[1..n] is input as the right-hand side vector
B, and returns with the solution vector X. a, n, and indx are not modiï¬ed by this routine
and can be left in place for successive calls with diï¬erent right-hand sides b. This routine takes
into account the possibility that b will begin with many zero elements, so it is eï¬cient for use
in matrix inversion.
{
int i,ii=0,ip,j;
float sum;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
When ii is set to a positive value, it will become the
index of the ï¬rst nonvanishing element of b. We now
do the forward substitution, equation (2.3.6). The
only new wrinkle is to unscramble the permutation
as we go.
ip=indx[i];
sum=b[ip];
b[ip]=b[i];
if (ii)
for (j=ii;j<=i-1;j++) sum -= a[i][j]*b[j];
else if (sum) ii=i;
A nonzero element was encountered, so from now on we
will have to do the sums in the loop above.
b[i]=sum;
}
for (i=n;i>=1;i--) {
Now we do the backsubstitution, equation (2.3.7).
sum=b[i];
for (j=i+1;j<=n;j++) sum -= a[i][j]*b[j];
b[i]=sum/a[i][i];
Store a component of the solution vector X.
}
All done!

The LU decomposition in ludcmp requires about 1
3N 3 executions of the inner
loops (each with one multiply and one add).
This is thus the operation count
for solving one (or a few) right-hand sides, and is a factor of 3 better than the
Gauss-Jordan routine gaussj which was given in Â§2.1, and a factor of 1.5 better
than a Gauss-Jordan routine (not given) that does not compute the inverse matrix.
For inverting a matrix, the total count (including the forward and backsubstitution
as discussed following equation 2.3.7 above) is ( 1
3 + 1
6 + 1
2)N 3 = N 3, the same
as gaussj.
To summarize, this is the preferred way to solve the linear set of equations
A Â· x = b:
float **a,*b,d;
int n,*indx;
...
ludcmp(a,n,indx,&d);
lubksb(a,n,indx,b);
The answer x will be given back in b.
Your original matrix A will have
been destroyed.
If you subsequently want to solve a set of equations with the same A but a
different right-hand side b, you repeat only
lubksb(a,n,indx,b);
not, of course, with the original matrix A, but with a and indx as were already
set by ludcmp.
Inverse of a Matrix
Using the above LU decomposition and backsubstitution routines, it is com-
pletely straightforward to ï¬nd the inverse of a matrix column by column.
#define N ...
float **a,**y,d,*col;
int i,j,*indx;
...
ludcmp(a,N,indx,&d);
Decompose the matrix just once.
for(j=1;j<=N;j++) {
Find inverse by columns.
for(i=1;i<=N;i++) col[i]=0.0;
col[j]=1.0;
lubksb(a,N,indx,col);
for(i=1;i<=N;i++) y[i][j]=col[i];
}
The matrix y will now contain the inverse of the original matrix a, which will have
been destroyed. Alternatively, there is nothing wrong with using a Gauss-Jordan
routine like gaussj (Â§2.1) to invert a matrix in place, again destroying the original.
Both methods have practically the same operations count.

Incidentally, if you ever have the need to compute Aâ1 Â· B from matrices A
and B, you should LU decompose A and then backsubstitute with the columns of
B instead of with the unit vectors that would give Aâs inverse. This saves a whole
matrix multiplication, and is also more accurate.
Determinant of a Matrix
The determinant of an LU decomposed matrix is just the product of the
diagonal elements,
det =
N
Y
j=1
Î²jj
(2.3.15)
We donât, recall, compute the decomposition of the original matrix, but rather a
decomposition of a rowwise permutation of it.
Luckily, we have kept track of
whether the number of row interchanges was even or odd, so we just preface the
product by the corresponding sign. (You now ï¬nally know the purpose of setting
d in the routine ludcmp.)
Calculation of a determinant thus requires one call to ludcmp, with no subse-
quent backsubstitutions by lubksb.
#define N ...
float **a,d;
int j,*indx;
...
ludcmp(a,N,indx,&d);
This returns d as Â±1.
for(j=1;j<=N;j++) d *= a[j][j];
The variable d now contains the determinant of the original matrix a, which will
have been destroyed.
For a matrix of any substantial size, it is quite likely that the determinant will
overï¬ow or underï¬ow your computerâs ï¬oating-point dynamic range. In this case
you can modify the loop of the above fragment and (e.g.) divide by powers of ten,
to keep track of the scale separately, or (e.g.) accumulate the sum of logarithms of
the absolute values of the factors and the sign separately.
Complex Systems of Equations
If your matrix A is real, but the right-hand side vector is complex, say b + id, then (i)
LU decompose A in the usual way, (ii) backsubstitute b to get the real part of the solution
vector, and (iii) backsubstitute d to get the imaginary part of the solution vector.
If the matrix itself is complex, so that you want to solve the system
(A + iC) Â· (x + iy) = (b + id)
(2.3.16)
then there are two possible ways to proceed. The best way is to rewrite ludcmp and lubksb
as complex routines. Complex modulus substitutes for absolute value in the construction of
the scaling vector vv and in the search for the largest pivot elements. Everything else goes
through in the obvious way, with complex arithmetic used as needed. (See Â§Â§1.2 and 5.4 for
discussion of complex arithmetic in C.)

is an easy way to proceed.

2.4 Tridiagonal and Band Diagonal Systems
of Equations
The special case of a system of linear equations that is tridiagonal, that is, has
nonzero elements only on the diagonal plus or minus one column, is one that occurs
frequently. Also common are systems that are band diagonal, with nonzero elements
only along a few diagonal lines adjacent to the main diagonal (above and below).
For tridiagonal sets, the procedures of LU decomposition, forward- and back-
substitutioneach take only O(N) operations, and the whole solution can be encoded
very concisely. The resulting routine tridag is one that we will use in later chapters.
Naturally, one does not reserve storage for the full N Ã N matrix, but only for
the nonzero components, stored as three vectors. The set of equations to be solved is

Notice that a1 and cN are undeï¬ned and are not referenced by the routinethat follows.
#include "nrutil.h"
void tridag(float a[], float b[], float c[], float r[], float u[],
unsigned long n)
Solves for a vector u[1..n] the tridiagonal linear set given by equation (2.4.1). a[1..n],

free_vector(gam,1,n);
}
There is no pivoting in tridag. It is for this reason that tridag can fail even
when the underlyingmatrix is nonsingular: A zero pivot can be encountered even for
a nonsingularmatrix. In practice, this is not something to lose sleep about. The kinds
of problems that lead to tridiagonal linear sets usually have additional properties
which guarantee that the algorithm in tridag will succeed. For example, if
|bj| > |aj| + |cj|
j = 1, . . ., N
(2.4.2)
(called diagonal dominance)then it can be shown that the algorithmcannot encounter
a zero pivot.
It is possible to construct special examples in which the lack of pivoting in the
algorithm causes numerical instability. In practice, however, such instability is almost
never encountered â unlike the general matrix problem where pivoting is essential.
The tridiagonal algorithm is the rare case of an algorithm that, in practice, is
more robust than theory says it should be. Of course, should you ever encounter a
problem for which tridag fails, you can instead use the more general method for
band diagonal systems, now described (routines bandec and banbks).
Some other matrix forms consisting of tridiagonal with a small number of
additional elements (e.g., upper right and lower left corners) also allow rapid
solution; see Â§2.7.
Band Diagonal Systems
Where tridiagonal systems have nonzero elements only on the diagonal plus or minus
one, band diagonalsystemsare slightly more general and have (say) m1 â¥0 nonzero elements
immediately to the left of (below) the diagonal and m2 â¥0 nonzero elements immediately to
its right (above it). Of course, this is only a useful classiï¬cation if m1 and m2 are both âªN.

In that case, the solution of the linear system by LU decomposition can be accomplished
much faster, and in much less storage, than for the general N Ã N case.
The precise deï¬nition of a band diagonal matrix with elements aij is that
aij = 0
when
j > i + m2
or
i > j + m1
(2.4.3)
Band diagonal matrices are stored and manipulated in a so-called compact form, which results
if the matrix is tilted 45â¦clockwise, so that its nonzero elements lie in a long, narrow
matrix with m1 + 1 + m2 columns and N rows. This is best illustrated by an example:

Here x denotes elements that are wasted space in the compact format; these will not be
referenced by any manipulations and can have arbitrary values. Notice that the diagonal
of the original matrix appears in column m1 + 1, with subdiagonal elements to its left,
superdiagonal elements to its right.
The simplest manipulation of a band diagonal matrix, stored compactly, is to multiply
it by a vector to its right. Although this is algorithmically trivial, you might want to study
the following routine carefully, as an example of how to pull nonzero elements aij out of the
compact storage format in an orderly fashion.
#include "nrutil.h"
void banmul(float **a, unsigned long n, int m1, int m2, float x[], float b[])
Matrix multiply b = A Â· x, where A is band diagonal with m1 rows below the diagonal and m2
rows above. The input vector x and output vector b are stored as x[1..n] and b[1..n],
respectively. The array a[1..n][1..m1+m2+1] stores A as follows: The diagonal elements
are in a[1..n][m1+1]. Subdiagonal elements are in a[j..n][1..m1] (with j > 1 ap-
propriate to the number of elements on each subdiagonal). Superdiagonal elements are in
a[1..j][m1+2..m1+m2+1] with j < n appropriate to the number of elements on each su-
perdiagonal.

It is not possible to store the LU decomposition of a band diagonal matrix A quite
as compactly as the compact form of A itself. The decomposition (essentially by Croutâs
method, see Â§2.3) produces additional nonzero âï¬ll-ins.â One straightforward storage scheme
is to return the upper triangular factor (U) in the same space that A previously occupied, and
to return the lower triangular factor (L) in a separate compact matrix of size N Ã m1. The
diagonal elements of U (whose product, times d = Â±1, gives the determinant) are returned
in the ï¬rst column of Aâs storage space.
The following routine, bandec, is the band-diagonal analog of ludcmp in Â§2.3:
#include <math.h>
#define SWAP(a,b) {dum=(a);(a)=(b);(b)=dum;}
#define TINY 1.0e-20
void bandec(float **a, unsigned long n, int m1, int m2, float **al,
unsigned long indx[], float *d)
Given an n Ã n band diagonal matrix A with m1 subdiagonal rows and m2 superdiagonal rows,
compactly stored in the array a[1..n][1..m1+m2+1] as described in the comment for routine
banmul, this routine constructs an LU decomposition of a rowwise permutation of A. The upper
triangular matrix replaces a, while the lower triangular matrix is returned in al[1..n][1..m1].
indx[1..n] is an output vector which records the row permutation eï¬ected by the partial
pivoting; d is output as Â±1 depending on whether the number of row interchanges was even
or odd, respectively. This routine is used in combination with banbks to solve band-diagonal
sets of equations.

Some pivoting is possible within the storage limitations of bandec, and the above
routine does take advantage of the opportunity.
In general, when TINY is returned as a
diagonal element of U, then the original matrix (perhaps as modiï¬ed by roundoff error)
is in fact singular. In this regard, bandec is somewhat more robust than tridag above,
which can fail algorithmically even for nonsingular matrices; bandec is thus also useful (with
m1 = m2 = 1) for some ill-behaved tridiagonal systems.
Once the matrix A has beendecomposed,any numberof right-hand sides canbe solved in
turn by repeated calls to banbks, the backsubstitution routine whose analog in Â§2.3 is lubksb.
#define SWAP(a,b) {dum=(a);(a)=(b);(b)=dum;}
void banbks(float **a, unsigned long n, int m1, int m2, float **al,
unsigned long indx[], float b[])
Given the arrays a, al, and indx as returned from bandec, and given a right-hand side vector
b[1..n], solves the band diagonal linear equations A Â· x = b. The solution vector x overwrites
b[1..n]. The other input arrays are not modiï¬ed, and can be left in place for successive calls
with diï¬erent right-hand sides.
{
unsigned long i,k,l;
int mm;
float dum;
mm=m1+m2+1;
l=m1;
for (k=1;k<=n;k++) {
Forward substitution, unscrambling the permuted rows
as we go.
i=indx[k];
if (i != k) SWAP(b[k],b[i])
if (l < n) l++;
for (i=k+1;i<=l;i++) b[i] -= al[k][i-k]*b[k];
}
l=1;
for (i=n;i>=1;i--) {
Backsubstitution.
dum=b[i];
for (k=2;k<=l;k++) dum -= a[i][k]*b[k+i-1];
b[i]=dum/a[i][1];
if (l < mm) l++;
}
}
The routines bandec and banbks are based on the Handbook routines bandet1 and
bansol1 in [1].

2.5 Iterative Improvement of a Solution to
Linear Equations
Obviously it is not easy to obtain greater precision for the solution of a linear
set than the precision of your computerâs ï¬oating-point word. Unfortunately, for
large sets of linear equations, it is not always easy to obtain precision equal to, or
even comparable to, the computerâs limit. In direct methods of solution, roundoff
errors accumulate, and they are magniï¬ed to the extent that your matrix is close
to singular. You can easily lose two or three signiï¬cant ï¬gures for matrices which
(you thought) were far from singular.
If this happens to you, there is a neat trick to restore the full machine precision,
called iterative improvement of the solution. The theory is very straightforward (see
Figure 2.5.1): Suppose that a vector x is the exact solution of the linear set
A Â· x = b
(2.5.1)
You donât, however, know x. You only know some slightly wrong solution x + Î´x,
where Î´x is the unknownerror. When multipliedby the matrix A, your slightlywrong
solutiongives a product slightlydiscrepant fromthe desired right-handside b, namely
A Â· (x + Î´x) = b + Î´b
(2.5.2)
Subtracting (2.5.1) from (2.5.2) gives
A Â· Î´x = Î´b
(2.5.3)

But (2.5.2) can also be solved, trivially, for Î´b. Substituting this into (2.5.3) gives
A Â· Î´x = A Â· (x + Î´x) âb
(2.5.4)
In this equation, the whole right-hand side is known, since x + Î´x is the wrong
solution that you want to improve. It is essential to calculate the right-hand side
in double precision, since there will be a lot of cancellation in the subtraction of b.
Then, we need only solve (2.5.4) for the error Î´x, then subtract this from the wrong
solution to get an improved solution.
An important extra beneï¬t occurs if we obtained the original solution by LU
decomposition. In this case we already have the LU decomposed form of A, and all
we need do to solve (2.5.4) is compute the right-hand side and backsubstitute!
The code to do all this is concise and straightforward:
#include "nrutil.h"
void mprove(float **a, float **alud, int n, int indx[], float b[], float x[])
Improves a solution vector x[1..n] of the linear set of equations A Â· X = B. The matrix
a[1..n][1..n], and the vectors b[1..n] and x[1..n] are input, as is the dimension n.
Also input is alud[1..n][1..n], the LU decomposition of a as returned by ludcmp, and
the vector indx[1..n] also returned by that routine. On output, only x[1..n] is modiï¬ed,
to an improved set of values.
{
void lubksb(float **a, int n, int *indx, float b[]);
int j,i;
double sdp;
float *r;
r=vector(1,n);
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
Calculate the right-hand side, accumulating
the residual in double precision.
sdp = -b[i];
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) sdp += a[i][j]*x[j];
r[i]=sdp;
}
lubksb(alud,n,indx,r);
Solve for the error term,
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) x[i] -= r[i];
and subtract it from the old solution.
free_vector(r,1,n);
}
You should note that the routine ludcmp in Â§2.3 destroys the input matrix as it
LU decomposes it. Since iterative improvement requires both the original matrix
and its LU decomposition, you will need to copy A before calling ludcmp. Likewise
lubksb destroys b in obtaining x, so make a copy of b also. If you donât mind
this extra storage, iterative improvement is highly recommended: It is a process
of order only N 2 operations (multiply vector by matrix, and backsubstitute â see
discussion following equation 2.3.7); it never hurts; and it can really give you your
moneyâs worth if it saves an otherwise ruined solution on which you have already
spent of order N 3 operations.
You can call mprove several times in succession if you want. Unless you are
starting quite far from the true solution, one call is generally enough; but a second
call to verify convergence can be reassuring.

More on Iterative Improvement
It is illuminating (and will be useful later in the book) to give a somewhat more solid
analytical foundation for equation (2.5.4), and also to give some additional results. Implicit in
the previous discussion was the notion that the solution vector x + Î´x has an error term; but
we neglected the fact that the LU decomposition of A is itself not exact.
A different analytical approach starts with some matrix B0 that is assumed to be an
approximate inverse of the matrix A, so that B0 Â· A is approximately the identity matrix 1.
Deï¬ne the residual matrix R of B0 as
R â¡1 âB0 Â· A
(2.5.5)
which is supposed to be âsmallâ (we will be more precise below). Note that therefore
B0 Â· A = 1 âR
(2.5.6)
Next consider the following formal manipulation:
Aâ1 = Aâ1 Â· (Bâ1
0
Â· B0) = (Aâ1 Â· Bâ1
0 ) Â· B0 = (B0 Â· A)â1 Â· B0
= (1 âR)â1 Â· B0 = (1 + R + R2 + R3 + Â· Â· Â·) Â· B0
(2.5.7)
We can deï¬ne the nth partial sum of the last expression by
Bn â¡(1 + R + Â· Â· Â· + Rn) Â· B0
(2.5.8)
so that BââAâ1, if the limit exists.
It now is straightforward to verify that equation (2.5.8) satisï¬es some interesting
recurrence relations. As regards solving A Â· x = b, where x and b are vectors, deï¬ne
xn â¡Bn Â· b
(2.5.9)
Then it is easy to show that
xn+1 = xn + B0 Â· (b âA Â· xn)
(2.5.10)
This is immediately recognizable as equation (2.5.4), with âÎ´x = xn+1 âxn, and with B0
taking the role of Aâ1. We see, therefore, that equation (2.5.4) does not require that the LU
decompositon of A be exact, but only that the implied residual R be small. In rough terms, if
the residual is smaller than the square root of your computerâs roundoff error, then after one
application of equation (2.5.10) (that is, going from x0 â¡B0 Â· b to x1) the ï¬rst neglected term,
of order R2, will be smaller than the roundoff error. Equation (2.5.10), like equation (2.5.4),
moreover, can be applied more than once, since it uses only B0, and not any of the higher Bâs.
A much more surprising recurrence which follows from equation (2.5.8) is one that
more than doubles the order n at each stage:
B2n+1 = 2Bn âBn Â· A Â· Bn
n = 0, 1, 3, 7, . . .
(2.5.11)
Repeated application of equation (2.5.11), from a suitable starting matrix B0, converges
quadratically to the unknown inverse matrix Aâ1 (see Â§9.4 for the deï¬nition of âquadrati-
callyâ). Equation (2.5.11) goes by various names, including Schultzâs Method and Hotellingâs
Method; see Pan and Reif [1] for references. In fact, equation (2.5.11) is simply the iterative
Newton-Raphson method of root-ï¬nding (Â§9.4) applied to matrix inversion.
Before you get too excited about equation (2.5.11), however, you should notice that it
involves two full matrix multiplications at each iteration. Each matrix multiplication involves
N 3 adds and multiplies. But we already saw in Â§Â§2.1â2.3 that direct inversion of A requires
only N 3 adds and N 3 multiplies in toto. Equation (2.5.11) is therefore practical only when
special circumstances allow it to be evaluated much more rapidly than is the case for general
matrices. We will meet such circumstances later, in Â§13.10.
In the spirit of delayed gratiï¬cation, let us nevertheless pursue the two related issues:
When does the series in equation (2.5.7) converge; and what is a suitable initial guess B0 (if,
for example, an initial LU decomposition is not feasible)?

We can deï¬ne the norm of a matrix as the largest ampliï¬cation of length that it is
able to induce on a vector,
â¥Râ¥â¡max
vÌ¸=0
|R Â· v|
|v|
(2.5.12)
If we let equation (2.5.7) act on some arbitrary right-hand side b, as one wants a matrix inverse
to do, it is obvious that a sufï¬cient condition for convergence is
â¥Râ¥< 1
(2.5.13)
Pan and Reif [1] point out that a suitable initial guess for B0 is any sufï¬ciently small constant
Ïµ times the matrix transpose of A, that is,
B0 = ÏµAT
or
R = 1 âÏµAT Â· A
(2.5.14)
To see why this is so involves concepts from Chapter 11; we give here only the briefest
sketch: AT Â· A is a symmetric, positive deï¬nite matrix, so it has real, positive eigenvalues.
In its diagonal representation, R takes the form
R = diag(1 âÏµÎ»1, 1 âÏµÎ»2, . . . , 1 âÏµÎ»N)
(2.5.15)
where all the Î»iâs are positive. Evidently any Ïµ satisfying 0 < Ïµ < 2/(maxi Î»i) will give
â¥Râ¥< 1. It is not difï¬cult to show that the optimal choice for Ïµ, giving the most rapid
convergence for equation (2.5.11), is
Ïµ = 2/(max
i
Î»i + min
i
Î»i)
(2.5.16)
Rarely does one know the eigenvalues of AT Â· A in equation (2.5.16). Pan and Reif
derive several interesting bounds, which are computable directly from A.
The following
choices guarantee the convergence of Bn as n ââ,
Ïµ â¤1

(2.5.17)
The latter expression is truly a remarkable formula, which Pan and Reif derive by noting that
the vector norm in equation (2.5.12) need not be the usual L2 norm, but can instead be either
the Lâ(max) norm, or the L1 (absolute value) norm. See their work for details.
Another approach, with which we have had some success, is to estimate the largest
eigenvalue statistically, by calculating si â¡|AÂ·vi|2 for several unit vector viâs with randomly
chosen directions in N-space. The largest eigenvalue Î» can then be bounded by the maximum
of 2 max si and 2NVar(si)/Âµ(si), where Var and Âµ denote the sample variance and mean,
respectively.

2.6 Singular Value Decomposition
There exists a very powerful set of techniques for dealing with sets of equations
or matrices that are either singular or else numerically very close to singular. In many
cases where Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition fail to give satisfactory
results, this set of techniques, known as singular value decomposition, or SVD,
will diagnose for you precisely what the problem is.
In some cases, SVD will
not only diagnose the problem, it will also solve it, in the sense of giving you a
useful numerical answer, although, as we shall see, not necessarily âtheâ answer
that you thought you should get.
SVD is also the method of choice for solving mostlinear least-squares problems.
We will outline the relevant theory in this section, but defer detailed discussion of
the use of SVD in this application to Chapter 15, whose subject is the parametric
modeling of data.
SVD methods are based on the followingtheorem of linear algebra, whose proof
is beyond our scope: Any M ÃN matrix A whose number of rows M is greater than
or equal to its number of columns N, can be written as the product of an M Ã N
column-orthogonal matrix U, an N Ã N diagonal matrix W with positive or zero
elements (the singular values), and the transpose of an N Ã N orthogonal matrix V.
The various shapes of these matrices will be made clearer by the following tableau:

or equal to its number of columns N, can be written as the product of an M Ã N
column-orthogonal matrix U, an N Ã N diagonal matrix W with positive or zero
elements (the singular values), and the transpose of an N Ã N orthogonal matrix V.
The various shapes of these matrices will be made clearer by the following tableau:

Since V is square, it is also row-orthonormal, V Â· VT = 1.
The SVD decomposition can also be carried out when M < N. In this case
the singular values wj for j = M + 1, . . ., N are all zero, and the corresponding
columns of U are also zero. Equation (2.6.2) then holds only for k, n â¤M.
The decomposition (2.6.1) can always be done, no matter how singular the
matrix is, and it is âalmostâ unique. That is to say, it is unique up to (i) making
the same permutation of the columns of U, elements of W, and columns of V (or
rows of VT ), or (ii) forming linear combinations of any columns of U and V whose
corresponding elements of W happen to be exactly equal. An important consequence
of the permutation freedom is that for the case M < N, a numerical algorithm for
the decomposition need not return zero wjâs for j = M + 1, . . ., N; the N âM
zero singular values can be scattered among all positions j = 1, 2, . . ., N.
At the end of this section, we give a routine, svdcmp, that performs SVD on
an arbitrary matrix A, replacing it by U (they are the same shape) and giving back
W and V separately.
The routine svdcmp is based on a routine by Forsythe et
al. [1], which is in turn based on the original routine of Golub and Reinsch, found, in
various forms, in [2-4] and elsewhere. These references include extensive discussion
of the algorithm used. As much as we dislike the use of black-box routines, we are
going to ask you to accept this one, since it would take us too far aï¬eld to cover
its necessary background material here. Sufï¬ce it to say that the algorithm is very
stable, and that it is very unusual for it ever to misbehave. Most of the concepts that
enter the algorithm (Householder reduction to bidiagonal form, diagonalization by
QR procedure with shifts) will be discussed further in Chapter 11.
If you are as suspicious of black boxes as we are, you will want to verify yourself
that svdcmp does what we say it does. That is very easy to do: Generate an arbitrary
matrix A, call the routine, and then verify by matrix multiplication that (2.6.1) and
(2.6.4) are satisï¬ed. Since these two equations are the only deï¬ning requirements
for SVD, this procedure is (for the chosen A) a complete end-to-end check.
Now let us ï¬nd out what SVD is good for.

SVD of a Square Matrix
If the matrix A is square, N Ã N say, then U, V, and W are all square matrices
of the same size. Their inverses are also trivial to compute: U and V are orthogonal,
so their inverses are equal to their transposes; W is diagonal, so its inverse is the
diagonal matrix whose elements are the reciprocals of the elements wj. From (2.6.1)
it now follows immediately that the inverse of A is
Aâ1 = V Â· [diag (1/wj)] Â· UT
(2.6.5)
The only thing that can go wrong with this construction is for one of the wjâs
to be zero, or (numerically) for it to be so small that its value is dominated by
roundoff error and therefore unknowable. If more than one of the wjâs have this
problem, then the matrix is even more singular. So, ï¬rst of all, SVD gives you a
clear diagnosis of the situation.
Formally, the condition number of a matrix is deï¬ned as the ratio of the largest
(in magnitude) of the wjâs to the smallest of the wjâs. A matrix is singular if its
condition number is inï¬nite, and it is ill-conditioned if its condition number is too
large, that is, if its reciprocal approaches the machineâs ï¬oating-point precision (for
example, less than 10â6 for single precision or 10â12 for double).
For singular matrices, the concepts of nullspace and range are important.
Consider the familiar set of simultaneous equations
A Â· x = b
(2.6.6)
where A is a square matrix, b and x are vectors. Equation (2.6.6) deï¬nes A as a
linear mapping from the vector space x to the vector space b. If A is singular, then
there is some subspace of x, called the nullspace, that is mapped to zero, A Â· x = 0.
The dimension of the nullspace (the number of linearly independent vectors x that
can be found in it) is called the nullity of A.
Now, there is also some subspace of b that can be âreachedâ by A, in the sense
that there exists some x which is mapped there. This subspace of b is called the range
of A. The dimension of the range is called the rank of A. If A is nonsingular, then its
range will be all of the vector space b, so its rank is N. If A is singular, then the rank
will be less than N. In fact, the relevant theorem is ârank plus nullity equals N.â
What has this to do with SVD? SVD explicitly constructs orthonormal bases
for the nullspace and range of a matrix.
Speciï¬cally, the columns of U whose
same-numbered elements wj are nonzero are an orthonormal set of basis vectors that
span the range; the columns of V whose same-numbered elements wj are zero are
an orthonormal basis for the nullspace.
Now letâs have another look at solving the set of simultaneous linear equations
(2.6.6) in the case that A is singular. First, the set of homogeneous equations, where
b = 0, is solved immediately by SVD: Any column of V whose corresponding wj
is zero yields a solution.
When the vector b on the right-hand side is not zero, the important question is
whether it lies in the range of A or not. If it does, then the singular set of equations
does have a solution x; in fact it has more than one solution, since any vector in
the nullspace (any column of V with a corresponding zero wj) can be added to x
in any linear combination.

If we want to single out one particular member of this solution-set of vectors as
a representative, we might want to pick the one with the smallest length |x|2. Here is
how to ï¬nd that vector using SVD: Simply replace 1/wj by zero if wj = 0. (It is not
very often that one gets to set â= 0 !) Then compute (working from right to left)
x = V Â· [diag (1/wj)] Â· (UT Â· b)
(2.6.7)
This will be the solution vector of smallest length; the columns of V that are in the
nullspace complete the speciï¬cation of the solution set.
Proof: Consider |x + xâ²|, where xâ² lies in the nullspace. Then, if Wâ1 denotes
the modiï¬ed inverse of W with some elements zeroed,
|x + xâ²| =
V Â· Wâ1 Â· UT Â· b + xâ²
=
V Â· (Wâ1 Â· UT Â· b + VT Â· xâ²)

=
Wâ1 Â· UT Â· b + VT Â· xâ²
(2.6.8)
Here the ï¬rst equality follows from (2.6.7), the second and third from the orthonor-
mality of V.
If you now examine the two terms that make up the sum on the
right-hand side, you will see that the ï¬rst one has nonzero j components only where
wj Ì¸= 0, while the second one, since xâ² is in the nullspace, has nonzero j components
only where wj = 0. Therefore the minimum length obtains for xâ² = 0, q.e.d.
If b is not in the range of the singular matrix A, then the set of equations (2.6.6)
has no solution. But here is some good news: If b is not in the range of A, then
equation (2.6.7) can still be used to construct a âsolutionâ vector x. This vector x
will not exactly solve A Â· x = b. But, among all possible vectors x, it will do the
closest possible job in the least squares sense. In other words (2.6.7) ï¬nds
x
which minimizes
r â¡|A Â· x âb|
(2.6.9)
The number r is called the residual of the solution.
The proof is similar to (2.6.8): Suppose we modify x by adding some arbitrary
xâ². Then A Â· x âb is modiï¬ed by adding some bâ² â¡A Â· xâ². Obviously bâ² is in
the range of A.
We then have
A Â· x âb + bâ² =
(U Â· W Â· VT ) Â· (V Â· Wâ1 Â· UT Â· b) âb + bâ²
=
(U Â· W Â· Wâ1 Â· UT â1) Â· b + bâ²

=
(W Â· Wâ1 â1) Â· UT Â· b + UT Â· bâ²
(2.6.10)
Now, (W Â· Wâ1 â1) is a diagonal matrix which has nonzero j components only for
wj = 0, while UT bâ² has nonzero j components only for wj Ì¸= 0, since bâ² lies in the
range of A. Therefore the minimum obtains for bâ² = 0, q.e.d.
Figure 2.6.1 summarizes our discussion of SVD thus far.

(a) A nonsingular matrix A maps a vector space into one of the same dimension. The
vector x is mapped into b, so that x satisï¬es the equation A Â· x = b. (b) A singular matrix A maps a
vector space into one of lower dimensionality, here a plane into a line, called the ârangeâ of A. The
ânullspaceâ of A is mapped to zero. The solutions of A Â· x = d consist of any one particular solution plus
any vector in the nullspace, here forming a line parallel to the nullspace. Singular value decomposition
(SVD) selects the particular solution closest to zero, as shown. The point c lies outside of the range
of A, so A Â· x = c has no solution. SVD ï¬nds the least-squares best compromise solution, namely a
solution of A Â· x = câ², as shown.
In the discussion since equation (2.6.6), we have been pretending that a matrix
either is singular or else isnât. That is of course true analytically. Numerically,
however, the far more common situation is that some of the wjâs are very small
but nonzero, so that the matrix is ill-conditioned. In that case, the direct solution
methods of LU decomposition or Gaussian elimination may actually give a formal
solution to the set of equations (that is, a zero pivot may not be encountered); but
the solution vector may have wildly large components whose algebraic cancellation,
when multiplying by the matrix A, may give a very poor approximation to the
right-hand vector b. In such cases, the solution vector x obtained by zeroing the

small wjâs and then using equation (2.6.7) is very often better (in the sense of the
residual |A Â· x âb| being smaller) than both the direct-method solution and the SVD
solution where the small wjâs are left nonzero.
It may seem paradoxical that this can be so, since zeroing a singular value
corresponds to throwing away one linear combination of the set of equations that
we are trying to solve. The resolution of the paradox is that we are throwing away
precisely a combination of equations that is so corrupted by roundoff error as to be at
best useless; usually it is worse than useless since it âpullsâ the solution vector way
off towards inï¬nity along some direction that is almost a nullspace vector. In doing
this, it compounds the roundoff problem and makes the residual |A Â· x âb| larger.
SVD cannot be applied blindly, then. You have to exercise some discretion in
deciding at what threshold to zero the small wjâs, and/or you have to have some idea
what size of computed residual |A Â· x âb| is acceptable.
As an example, here is a âbacksubstitutionâ routine svbksb for evaluating
equation (2.6.7) and obtaining a solution vector x from a right-hand side b, given
that the SVD of a matrix A has already been calculated by a call to svdcmp. Note
that this routine presumes that you have already zeroed the small wjâs. It does not
do this for you. If you havenât zeroed the small wjâs, then this routine is just as
ill-conditioned as any direct method, and you are misusing SVD.
#include "nrutil.h"
void svbksb(float **u, float w[], float **v, int m, int n, float b[], float x[])
Solves AÂ·X = B for a vector X, where A is speciï¬ed by the arrays u[1..m][1..n], w[1..n],
v[1..n][1..n] as returned by svdcmp. m and n are the dimensions of a, and will be equal for
square matrices. b[1..m] is the input right-hand side. x[1..n] is the output solution vector.
No input quantities are destroyed, so the routine may be called sequentially with diï¬erent bâs.
{
int jj,j,i;
float s,*tmp;
tmp=vector(1,n);
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) {
Calculate U T B.
s=0.0;
if (w[j]) {
Nonzero result only if wj is nonzero.
for (i=1;i<=m;i++) s += u[i][j]*b[i];
s /= w[j];
This is the divide by wj.
}
tmp[j]=s;
}
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) {
Matrix multiply by V to get answer.
s=0.0;
for (jj=1;jj<=n;jj++) s += v[j][jj]*tmp[jj];
x[j]=s;
}
free_vector(tmp,1,n);
}
Note that a typical use of svdcmp and svbksb superï¬cially resembles the
typical use of ludcmp and lubksb: In both cases, you decompose the left-hand
matrix A just once, and then can use the decomposition either once or many times
with different right-hand sides. The crucial difference is the âeditingâ of the singular
values before svbksb is called:

SVD for Fewer Equations than Unknowns
If you have fewer linear equations M than unknowns N, then you are not
expecting a unique solution. Usually there will be an N âM dimensional family
of solutions. If you want to ï¬nd this whole solution space, then SVD can readily
do the job.
The SVD decomposition will yield N âM zero or negligible wjâs, since
M < N. There may be additional zero wjâs from any degeneracies in your M
equations. Be sure that you ï¬nd this many small wjâs, and zero them before calling
svbksb, which will give you the particular solution vector x. As before, the columns
of V corresponding to zeroed wjâs are the basis vectors whose linear combinations,
added to the particular solution, span the solution space.
SVD for More Equations than Unknowns
This situation will occur in Chapter 15, when we wish to ï¬nd the least-squares
solution to an overdetermined set of linear equations.

In general, the matrix W will not be singular, and no wjâs will need to be
set to zero. Occasionally, however, there might be column degeneracies in A. In
this case you will need to zero some small wj values after all. The corresponding
column in V gives the linear combination of xâs that is then ill-determined even by
the supposedly overdetermined set.
Sometimes, although you do not need to zero any wjâs for computational
reasons, you may nevertheless want to take note of any that are unusually small:
Their corresponding columns in Vare linear combinations of xâs which are insensitive
to your data. In fact, you may then wish to zero these wjâs, to reduce the number of
free parameters in the ï¬t. These matters are discussed more fully in Chapter 15.
Constructing an Orthonormal Basis
Suppose that you have N vectors in an M-dimensional vector space, with
N â¤M.
Then the N vectors span some subspace of the full vector space.
Often you want to construct an orthonormal set of N vectors that span the same
subspace.
The textbook way to do this is by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization,
starting with one vector and then expanding the subspace one dimension at a
time.
Numerically, however, because of the build-up of roundoff errors, naive
Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is terrible.
The right way to construct an orthonormal basis for a subspace is by SVD:
Form an M Ã N matrix A whose N columns are your vectors. Run the matrix
through svdcmp. The columns of the matrix U (which in fact replaces A on output
from svdcmp) are your desired orthonormal basis vectors.
You might also want to check the output wjâs for zero values. If any occur,
then the spanned subspace was not, in fact, N dimensional; the columns of U
corresponding to zero wjâs should be discarded from the orthonormal basis set.
(QR factorization, discussed in Â§2.10, also constructs an orthonormal basis,
see [5].)
Approximation of Matrices
Note that equation (2.6.1) can be rewritten to express any matrix Aij as a sum
of outer products of columns of U and rows of VT , with the âweighting factorsâ
being the singular values wj,
Aij =
N
X
k=1
wk UikVjk

If you ever encounter a situation where most of the singular values wj of a
matrix A are very small, then A will be well-approximated by only a few terms in the
sum (2.6.13). This means that you have to store only a few columns of U and V (the
same k ones) and you will be able to recover, with good accuracy, the whole matrix.
Note also that it is very efï¬cient to multiply such an approximated matrix by a
vector x: You just dot x with each of the stored columns of V, multiply the resulting
scalar by the corresponding wk, and accumulate that multiple of the corresponding
column of U. If your matrix is approximated by a small number K of singular
values, then this computation of A Â· x takes only about K(M + N) multiplications,
instead of MN for the full matrix.
SVD Algorithm
Here is the algorithm for constructing the singular value decomposition of any
matrix. See Â§11.2âÂ§11.3, and also [4-5], for discussion relating to the underlying
method.
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void svdcmp(float **a, int m, int n, float w[], float **v)
Given a matrix a[1..m][1..n], this routine computes its singular value decomposition, A =
U Â·W Â·V T . The matrix U replaces a on output. The diagonal matrix of singular values W is out-
put as a vector w[1..n]. The matrix V (not the transpose V T ) is output as v[1..n][1..n].

2.7 Sparse Linear Systems
A system of linear equations is called sparse if only a relatively small number
of its matrix elements aij are nonzero. It is wasteful to use general methods of
linear algebra on such problems, because most of the O(N 3) arithmetic operations
devoted to solving the set of equations or inverting the matrix involve zero operands.
Furthermore, you might wish to work problems so large as to tax your available
memory space, and it is wasteful to reserve storage for unfruitful zero elements.
Note that there are two distinct (and not always compatible) goals for any sparse
matrix method: saving time and/or saving space.
We have already considered one archetypal sparse form in Â§2.4, the band
diagonal matrix. In the tridiagonal case, e.g., we saw that it was possible to save
both time (order N instead of N 3) and space (order N instead of N 2).
The
method of solution was not different in principle from the general method of LU
decomposition; it was just applied cleverly, and withdue attentionto the bookkeeping
of zero elements. Many practical schemes for dealing with sparse problems have this
same character. They are fundamentally decomposition schemes, or else elimination
schemes akin to Gauss-Jordan, but carefully optimized so as to minimize the number
of so-called ï¬ll-ins, initially zero elements which must become nonzero during the
solution process, and for which storage must be reserved.
Direct methods for solving sparse equations, then, depend crucially on the
precise pattern of sparsity of the matrix. Patterns that occur frequently, or that are
useful as way-stations in the reduction of more general forms, already have special
names and special methods of solution. We do not have space here for any detailed
review of these. References listed at the end of this section will furnish you with an
âinâ to the specialized literature, and the following list of buzz words (and Figure
2.7.1) will at least let you hold your own at cocktail parties:
â¢ tridiagonal
â¢ band diagonal (or banded) with bandwidth M
â¢ band triangular
â¢ block diagonal
â¢ block tridiagonal
â¢ block triangular
â¢ cyclic banded
â¢ singly (or doubly) bordered block diagonal
â¢ singly (or doubly) bordered block triangular
â¢ singly (or doubly) bordered band diagonal
â¢ singly (or doubly) bordered band triangular
â¢ other (!)
You should also be aware of some of the special sparse forms that occur in the
solution of partial differential equations in two or more dimensions. See Chapter 19.
If your particular pattern of sparsity is not a simple one, then you may wish to
try an analyze/factorize/operate package, which automates the procedure of ï¬guring
out how ï¬ll-ins are to be minimized. The analyze stage is done once only for each
pattern of sparsity. The factorize stage is done once for each particular matrix that
ï¬ts the pattern. The operate stage is performed once for each right-hand side to

prescribed by a sparse matrix method so as to minimize ï¬ll-ins and arithmetic
operations, generally acts to decrease the methodâs numerical stability as compared
to, e.g., regular LU decomposition with pivoting. Scaling your problem so as to
make its nonzero matrix elements have comparable magnitudes (if you can do it)
will sometimes ameliorate this problem.
In the remainder of this section, we present some concepts which are applicable
to some general classes of sparse matrices, and which do not necessarily depend on
details of the pattern of sparsity.
Sherman-Morrison Formula
Suppose that you have already obtained, by herculean effort, the inverse matrix
Aâ1 of a square matrix A.
Now you want to make a âsmallâ change in A, for
example change one element aij, or a few elements, or one row, or one column.
Is there any way of calculating the corresponding change in Aâ1 without repeating
your difï¬cult labors? Yes, if your change is of the form
A â(A + u âv)
(2.7.1)
for some vectors u and v. If u is a unit vector ei, then (2.7.1) adds the components
of v to the ith row. (Recall that u âv is a matrix whose i, jth element is the product
of the ith component of u and the jth component of v.) If v is a unit vector ej, then
(2.7.1) adds the components of u to the jth column. If both u and v are proportional
to unit vectors ei and ej respectively, then a term is added only to the element aij.
The Sherman-Morrison formula gives the inverse (A+uâv)â1, and is derived
brieï¬y as follows:
(A + u âv)â1 = (1 + Aâ1 Â· u âv)â1 Â· Aâ1
= (1 âAâ1 Â· u âv + Aâ1 Â· u âv Â· Aâ1 Â· u âv â. . .) Â· Aâ1
= Aâ1 âAâ1 Â· u âv Â· Aâ1 (1 âÎ» + Î»2 â. . .)
= Aâ1 â(Aâ1 Â· u) â(v Â· Aâ1)
1 + Î»
(2.7.2)
where
Î» â¡v Â· Aâ1 Â· u
(2.7.3)
The second line of (2.7.2) is a formal power series expansion. In the third line, the
associativity of outer and inner products is used to factor out the scalars Î».
The use of (2.7.2) is this: Given Aâ1 and the vectors u and v, we need only
perform two matrix multiplications and a vector dot product,
z â¡Aâ1 Â· u
w â¡(Aâ1)T Â· v
Î» = v Â· z
(2.7.4)
to get the desired change in the inverse
Aâ1
â
Aâ1 âz âw
1 + Î»

The whole procedure requires only 3N 2 multiplies and a like number of adds (an
even smaller number if u or v is a unit vector).
The Sherman-Morrison formula can be directly applied to a class of sparse
problems. If you already have a fast way of calculating the inverse of A (e.g., a
tridiagonal matrix, or some other standard sparse form), then (2.7.4)â(2.7.5) allow
you to build up to your related but more complicated form, adding for example a
row or column at a time. Notice that you can apply the Sherman-Morrison formula
more than once successively, using at each stage the most recent update of Aâ1
(equation 2.7.5). Of course, if you have to modify every row, then you are back to
an N 3 method. The constant in front of the N 3 is only a few times worse than the
better direct methods, but you have deprived yourself of the stabilizing advantages
of pivoting â so be careful.
For some other sparse problems, the Sherman-Morrison formula cannot be
directly applied for the simple reason that storage of the whole inverse matrix Aâ1
is not feasible.
If you want to add only a single correction of the form u âv,
and solve the linear system
(A + u âv) Â· x = b
(2.7.6)
then you proceed as follows. Using the fast method that is presumed available for
the matrix A, solve the two auxiliary problems
A Â· y = b
A Â· z = u
(2.7.7)
for the vectors y and z. In terms of these,
x = y â

v Â· y
1 + (v Â· z)

(2.7.8)
as we see by multiplying (2.7.2) on the right by b.
Cyclic Tridiagonal Systems
So-called cyclic tridiagonal systems occur quite frequently, and are a good
example of how to use the Sherman-Morrison formula in the manner just described.

Here Î³ is arbitrary for the moment. Then the matrix A is the tridiagonal part of the
matrix in (2.7.9), with two terms modiï¬ed:
bâ²
1 = b1 âÎ³,
bâ²
N = bN âÎ±Î²/Î³
(2.7.11)
We now solve equations (2.7.7) with the standard tridiagonal algorithm, and then
get the solution from equation (2.7.8).
The routine cyclic below implements this algorithm. We choose the arbitrary
parameter Î³ = âb1 to avoid loss of precision by subtraction in the ï¬rst of equations
(2.7.11). In the unlikely event that this causes loss of precision in the second of
these equations, you can make a different choice.

float r[], float x[], unsigned long n)
Solves for a vector x[1..n] the âcyclicâ set of linear equations given by equation (2.7.9). a,
b, c, and r are input vectors, all dimensioned as [1..n], while alpha and beta are the corner
entries in the matrix. The input is not modiï¬ed.

Woodbury Formula
If you want to add more than a single correction term, then you cannot use (2.7.8)
repeatedly, since without storing a new Aâ1 you will not be able to solve the auxiliary
problems (2.7.7) efï¬ciently after the ï¬rst step. Instead, you need the Woodbury formula,
which is the block-matrix version of the Sherman-Morrison formula,
(A + U Â· VT )â1
= Aâ1 â

Here A is, as usual, an N Ã N matrix, while U and V are N Ã P matrices with P < N
and usually P âªN. The inner piece of the correction term may become clearer if written

The relation between the Woodbury formula and successiveapplications of the Sherman-

(Note that the subscripts on u and v do not denote components, but rather distinguish the

P corrections in one fell swoop by using (2.7.12), inverting a P Ã P matrix, or else make
them by applying (2.7.5) P successive times.

Inversion by Partitioning
Once in a while, you will encounter a matrix (not even necessarily sparse)
that can be inverted efï¬ciently by partitioning. Suppose that the N Ã N matrix
A is partitioned into
A =

P
Q
R
S

(2.7.22)
where P and S are square matrices of size p Ã p and s Ã s respectively (p + s = N).
The matrices Q and R are not necessarily square, and have sizes p Ã s and s Ã p,
respectively.
If the inverse of A is partitioned in the same manner,
Aâ1 =
" eP
eQ
eR
eS
#
(2.7.23)
then eP, eQ, eR, eS, which have the same sizes as P, Q, R, S, respectively, can be
found by either the formulas
eP = (P âQ Â· Sâ1 Â· R)â1
eQ = â(P âQ Â· Sâ1 Â· R)â1 Â· (Q Â· Sâ1)
eR = â(Sâ1 Â· R) Â· (P âQ Â· Sâ1 Â· R)â1
eS = Sâ1 + (Sâ1 Â· R) Â· (P âQ Â· Sâ1 Â· R)â1 Â· (Q Â· Sâ1)
(2.7.24)
or else by the equivalent formulas
eP = Pâ1 + (Pâ1 Â· Q) Â· (S âR Â· Pâ1 Â· Q)â1 Â· (R Â· Pâ1)
eQ = â(Pâ1 Â· Q) Â· (S âR Â· Pâ1 Â· Q)â1
eR = â(S âR Â· Pâ1 Â· Q)â1 Â· (R Â· Pâ1)
eS = (S âR Â· Pâ1 Â· Q)â1
(2.7.25)
The parentheses in equations (2.7.24) and (2.7.25) highlight repeated factors that
you may wish to compute only once. (Of course, by associativity, you can instead
do the matrix multiplications in any order you like.) The choice between using
equation (2.7.24) and (2.7.25) depends on whether you want eP or eS to have the

Indexed Storage of Sparse Matrices
We havealready seen(Â§2.4) that tri- or band-diagonalmatrices canbe stored in a compact
format that allocates storage only to elements which can be nonzero, plus perhaps a few wasted
locations to make the bookkeeping easier. What about more general sparse matrices? When a
sparse matrix of dimension N Ã N contains only a few times N nonzero elements (a typical
case), it is surely inefï¬cient â and often physically impossible â to allocate storage for all
N 2 elements. Even if one did allocate such storage, it would be inefï¬cient or prohibitive in
machine time to loop over all of it in search of nonzero elements.
Obviously some kind of indexed storage schemeis required, one that stores only nonzero
matrix elements, along with sufï¬cient auxiliary information to determine where an element
logically belongs and how the various elements can be looped over in common matrix
operations. Unfortunately, there is no one standard scheme in general use. Knuth [7] describes
one method. The Yale Sparse Matrix Package [6] and ITPACK [8] describe several other
methods. For most applications, we favor the storage scheme used by PCGPACK [9], which
is almost the same as that described by Bentley [10], and also similar to one of the Yale Sparse
Matrix Package methods. The advantage of this scheme, which can be called row-indexed
sparse storage mode, is that it requires storage of only about two times the number of nonzero
matrix elements. (Other methods can require as much as three or ï¬ve times.) For simplicity,
we will treat only the case of square matrices, which occurs most frequently in practice.
To represent a matrix A of dimension N Ã N, the row-indexed scheme sets up two
one-dimensional arrays, call them sa and ija. The ï¬rst of these stores matrix element values
in single or double precision as desired; the secondstores integer values. The storage rules are:
â¢ The ï¬rst N locations of sa store Aâs diagonal matrix elements, in order. (Note that
diagonal elements are stored even if they are zero; this is at most a slight storage
inefï¬ciency, since diagonal elements are nonzero in most realistic applications.)
â¢ Each of the ï¬rst N locations of ija stores the index of the array sa that contains
the ï¬rst off-diagonal element of the corresponding row of the matrix. (If there are
no off-diagonal elements for that row, it is one greater than the index in sa of the
most recently stored element of a previous row.)
â¢ Location 1 of ija is always equal to N + 2. (It can be read to determine N.)
â¢ Location N + 1 of ija is one greater than the index in sa of the last off-diagonal
element of the last row.
(It can be read to determine the number of nonzero
elements in the matrix, or the number of elements in the arrays sa and ija.)
Location N + 1 of sa is not used and can be set arbitrarily.
â¢ Entries in sa at locations â¥N + 2 contain Aâs off-diagonal values, ordered by
rows and, within each row, ordered by columns.
â¢ Entries in ijaatlocations â¥N+2 contain the column numberofthe corresponding
element in sa.
While these rules seem arbitrary at ï¬rst sight, they result in a rather elegant storage
scheme. As an example, consider the matrix

In row-indexed compact storage, matrix (2.7.27) is represented by the two arrays of length
11, as follows

Here x is an arbitrary value. Notice that, according to the storage rules, the value of N
(namely 5) is ija[1]-2, and the length of each array is ija[ija[1]-1]-1, namely 11.
The diagonal element in row i is sa[i], and the off-diagonal elements in that row are in
sa[k] where k loops from ija[i] to ija[i+1]-1, if the upper limit is greater or equal to
the lower one (as in Câs for loops).
Here is a routine, sprsin, that converts a matrix from full storage mode into row-indexed
sparse storage mode, throwing away any elements that are less than a speciï¬ed threshold.
Of course, the principal use of sparse storage mode is for matrices whose full storage mode
wonât ï¬t into your machine at all; then you have to generate them directly into sparse format.
Nevertheless sprsin is useful as a precise algorithmic deï¬nition of the storage scheme, for
subscale testing of large problems, and for the case where execution time, rather than storage,
furnishes the impetus to sparse storage.
#include <math.h>
void sprsin(float **a, int n, float thresh, unsigned long nmax, float sa[],
unsigned long ija[])
Converts a square matrix a[1..n][1..n] into row-indexed sparse storage mode. Only ele-
ments of a with magnitude â¥thresh are retained. Output is in two linear arrays with dimen-
sion nmax (an input parameter): sa[1..] contains array values, indexed by ija[1..]. The
number of elements ï¬lled of sa and ija on output are both ija[ija[1]-1]-1 (see text).
{
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int i,j;
unsigned long k;
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) sa[j]=a[j][j];
Store diagonal elements.
ija[1]=n+2;
Index to 1st row oï¬-diagonal element, if any.
k=n+1;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
Loop over rows.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) {
Loop over columns.
if (fabs(a[i][j]) >= thresh && i != j) {
if (++k > nmax) nrerror("sprsin: nmax too small");
sa[k]=a[i][j];
Store oï¬-diagonal elements and their columns.
ija[k]=j;
}
}
ija[i+1]=k+1;
As each row is completed, store index to
next.
}
}
The single most important use of a matrix in row-indexed sparse storage mode is to
multiply a vector to its right. In fact, the storage mode is optimized for just this purpose.
The following routine is thus very simple.
void sprsax(float sa[], unsigned long ija[], float x[], float b[],
unsigned long n)
Multiply a matrix in row-index sparse storage arrays sa and ija by a vector x[1..n], giving
a vector b[1..n].

for (k=ija[i];k<=ija[i+1]-1;k++)
Loop over oï¬-diagonal terms.
b[i] += sa[k]*x[ija[k]];
}
}
It is also simple to multiply the transposeof a matrix by a vector to its right. (We will use
this operation later in this section.) Note that the transpose matrix is not actually constructed.
void sprstx(float sa[], unsigned long ija[], float x[], float b[],
unsigned long n)
Multiply the transpose of a matrix in row-index sparse storage arrays sa and ija by a vector
x[1..n], giving a vector b[1..n].
{
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
unsigned long i,j,k;
if (ija[1] != n+2) nrerror("mismatched vector and matrix in sprstx");
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) b[i]=sa[i]*x[i];
Start with diagonal terms.
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
Loop over oï¬-diagonal terms.
for (k=ija[i];k<=ija[i+1]-1;k++) {
j=ija[k];
b[j] += sa[k]*x[i];
}
}
}
(Double precision versions of sprsax and sprstx, named dsprsax and dsprstx, are used
by the routine atimes later in this section. You can easily make the conversion, or else get
the converted routines from the Numerical Recipes diskettes.)
In fact, because the choice of row-indexed storage treats rows and columns quite
differently, it is quite an involved operation to construct the transpose of a matrix, given the
matrix itself in row-indexed sparse storage mode. When the operation cannot be avoided,
it is done as follows: An index of all off-diagonal elements by their columns is constructed
(see Â§8.4).
The elements are then written to the output array in column order.
As each
element is written, its row is determined and stored. Finally, the elements in each column
are sorted by row.
void sprstp(float sa[], unsigned long ija[], float sb[], unsigned long ijb[])
Construct the transpose of a sparse square matrix, from row-index sparse storage arrays sa and
ija into arrays sb and ijb.
{
void iindexx(unsigned long n, long arr[], unsigned long indx[]);
Version of indexx with all float variables changed to long.
unsigned long j,jl,jm,jp,ju,k,m,n2,noff,inc,iv;
float v;
n2=ija[1];
Linear size of matrix plus 2.
for (j=1;j<=n2-2;j++) sb[j]=sa[j];
Diagonal elements.
iindexx(ija[n2-1]-ija[1],(long *)&ija[n2-1],&ijb[n2-1]);

jp=0;
for (k=ija[1];k<=ija[n2-1]-1;k++) {
Loop over output oï¬-diagonal elements.
m=ijb[k]+n2-1;
Use index table to store by (former) columns.
sb[k]=sa[m];
for (j=jp+1;j<=ija[m];j++) ijb[j]=k;
Fill in the index to any omitted rows.

The above routine embeds internally a sorting algorithm from Â§8.1, but calls the external
routine iindexx to construct the initial column index. This routine is identical to indexx,
as listed in Â§8.4, except that the latterâs two float declarations should be changed to long.
(The Numerical Recipes diskettes include both indexx and iindexx.)
In fact, you can
often use indexx without making these changes, since many computers have the property
that numerical values will sort correctly independently of whether they are interpreted as
ï¬oating or integer values.
As ï¬nal examples of the manipulation of sparse matrices, we give two routines for the
multiplication oftwo sparse matrices. These are usefulfortechniquesto be described inÂ§13.10.
In general, the product of two sparse matrices is not itself sparse. One therefore wants
to limit the size of the product matrix in one of two ways: either compute only those elements
of the product that are speciï¬ed in advance by a known pattern of sparsity, or else compute all
nonzero elements, but store only those whose magnitude exceeds some threshold value. The
former technique, when it can be used, is quite efï¬cient. The pattern of sparsity is speciï¬ed
by furnishing an index array in row-index sparse storage format (e.g., ija). The program
then constructs a corresponding value array (e.g., sa). The latter technique runs the danger of
excessive compute times and unknown output sizes, so it must be used cautiously.
With row-index storage, it is much more natural to multiply a matrix (on the left) by
the transpose of a matrix (on the right), so that one is crunching rows on rows, rather than
rows on columns. Our routines therefore calculate A Â· BT , rather than A Â· B. This means
that you have to run your right-hand matrix through the transpose routine sprstp before
sending it to the matrix multiply routine.

Conjugate Gradient Method for a Sparse System
So-called conjugate gradient methods provide a quite general means for solving the
N Ã N linear system
A Â· x = b
(2.7.29)
The attractiveness of these methods for large sparse systems is that they reference A only
through its multiplication of a vector, or the multiplication of its transpose and a vector. As

we have seen, these operations can be very efï¬cient for a properly stored sparse matrix. You,
the âownerâ of the matrix A, can be asked to provide functions that perform these sparse
matrix multiplications as efï¬ciently as possible. We, the âgrand strategistsâ supply the general
routine, linbcg below, that solves the set of linear equations, (2.7.29), using your functions.
The simplest, âordinaryâ conjugate gradient algorithm [11-13] solves (2.7.29) only in the
casethat A is symmetric and positive deï¬nite. It is basedon the idea of minimizing the function
f(x) = 1
2 x Â· A Â· x âb Â· x
(2.7.30)
This function is minimized when its gradient
âf = A Â· x âb
(2.7.31)
is zero, which is equivalent to (2.7.29). The minimization is carried out by generating a
succession of search directions pk and improved minimizers xk. At each stage a quantity Î±k
is found that minimizes f(xk + Î±kpk), and xk+1 is set equal to the new point xk + Î±kpk.
The pk and xk are built up in such a way that xk+1 is also the minimizer of f over the whole
vector space of directions already taken, {p1, p2, . . . , pk}. After N iterations you arrive at
the minimizer over the entire vector space, i.e., the solution to (2.7.29).
Later, in Â§10.6, we will generalize this âordinaryâ conjugate gradient algorithm to the
minimization of arbitrary nonlinear functions. Here, where our interest is in solving linear,
but not necessarily positive deï¬nite or symmetric, equations, a different generalization is
important, the biconjugate gradient method. This method does not, in general, have a simple
connection with function minimization. It constructs four sequences of vectors, rk, rk, pk,
pk, k = 1, 2, . . . . You supply the initial vectors r1 and r1, and set p1 = r1, p1 = r1. Then
you carry out the following recurrence:
Î±k =
rk Â· rk
pk Â· A Â· pk
rk+1 = rk âÎ±kA Â· pk
rk+1 = rk âÎ±kAT Â· pk
Î²k = rk+1 Â· rk+1
rk Â· rk
pk+1 = rk+1 + Î²kpk
pk+1 = rk+1 + Î²kpk
(2.7.32)
This sequence of vectors satisï¬es the biorthogonality condition
ri Â· rj = ri Â· rj = 0,
j < i
(2.7.33)
and the biconjugacy condition
pi Â· A Â· pj = pi Â· AT Â· pj = 0,
j < i
(2.7.34)
There is also a mutual orthogonality,
ri Â· pj = ri Â· pj = 0,
j < i
(2.7.35)
The proof of these properties proceeds by straightforward induction [14].
As long as the
recurrence does not break down earlier because one of the denominators is zero, it must
terminate after m â¤N steps with rm+1 = rm+1 = 0. This is basically because after at most
N steps you run out of new orthogonal directions to the vectors youâve already constructed.
To use the algorithm to solve the system (2.7.29), make an initial guess x1 for the
solution.
Choose r1 to be the residual
r1 = b âA Â· x1
(2.7.36)
and choose r1 = r1. Then form the sequence of improved estimates
xk+1 = xk + Î±kpk
(2.7.37)

while carrying out the recurrence (2.7.32). Equation (2.7.37) guarantees that rk+1 from the
recurrence is in fact the residual b âA Â· xk+1 corresponding to xk+1. Since rm+1 = 0,
xm+1 is the solution to equation (2.7.29).
While there is no guarantee that this whole procedure will not break down or become
unstable for general A, in practice this is rare. More importantly, the exact termination in at
most N iterations occurs only with exact arithmetic. Roundoff error means that you should
regard the process as a genuinely iterative procedure, to be halted when some appropriate
error criterion is met.
The ordinary conjugate gradient algorithm is the special case of the biconjugate gradient
algorithm when A is symmetric, and we choose r1 = r1. Then rk = rk and pk = pk for all
k; you can omit computing them and halve the work of the algorithm. This conjugate gradient
version has the interpretation of minimizing equation (2.7.30). If A is positive deï¬nite as
well as symmetric, the algorithm cannot break down (in theory!). The routine linbcg below
indeed reduces to the ordinary conjugate gradient method if you input a symmetric A, but
it does all the redundant computations.
Another variant of the general algorithm corresponds to a symmetric but non-positive
deï¬nite A, with the choice r1 = A Â· r1 instead of r1 = r1. In this case rk = A Â· rk and
pk = A Â· pk for all k. This algorithm is thus equivalent to the ordinary conjugate gradient
algorithm, but with all dot products aÂ·b replaced by aÂ·A Â·b. It is called the minimum residual
algorithm, because it corresponds to successive minimizations of the function
Î¦(x) = 1
2 r Â· r = 1
2 |A Â· x âb|2
(2.7.38)
where the successiveiterates xk minimize Î¦ overthe sameset of searchdirectionspk generated
in the conjugate gradient method. This algorithm has been generalized in various ways for
unsymmetric matrices. The generalized minimum residual method (GMRES; see [9,15]) is
probably the most robust of these methods.
Note that equation (2.7.38) gives
âÎ¦(x) = AT Â· (A Â· x âb)
(2.7.39)
For any nonsingular matrix A, AT Â· A is symmetric and positive deï¬nite. You might therefore
be tempted to solve equation (2.7.29) by applying the ordinary conjugate gradient algorithm
to the problem
(AT Â· A) Â· x = AT Â· b
(2.7.40)
Donât! The condition number of the matrix AT Â· A is the square of the condition number of
A (see Â§2.6 for deï¬nition of condition number). A large condition number both increases the
number of iterations required, and limits the accuracy to which a solution can be obtained. It
is almost always better to apply the biconjugate gradient method to the original matrix A.
So far we have said nothing about the rate of convergence of these methods.
The
ordinary conjugate gradient method works well for matrices that are well-conditioned, i.e.,
âcloseâ to the identity matrix. This suggests applying these methods to the preconditioned
form of equation (2.7.29),
(eA
â1 Â· A) Â· x = eA
â1 Â· b
(2.7.41)
The idea is that you might already be able to solve your linear system easily for some eA close
to A, in which case eAâ1 Â· A â1, allowing the algorithm to converge in fewer steps. The
matrix eA is called a preconditioner [11], and the overall scheme given here is known as the
preconditioned biconjugate gradient method or PBCG.
For efï¬cient implementation, the PBCG algorithm introduces an additional set of vectors
zk and zk deï¬ned by
eA Â· zk = rk
and
eA
T Â· zk = rk

Î²k = rk+1 Â· zk+1

(2.7.43)
For linbcg, below, we will ask you to supply routines that solve the auxiliary linear systems
(2.7.42). If you have no idea what to use for the preconditioner eA, then use the diagonal part
of A, or even the identity matrix, in which case the burden of convergence will be entirely
on the biconjugate gradient method itself.
The routine linbcg, below,is based on a program originally written by AnneGreenbaum.
(See [13] for a different, less sophisticated, implementation.) There are a few wrinkles you
should know about.
What constitutes âgoodâ convergence is rather application dependent.
The routine
linbcg therefore provides for four possibilities, selected by setting the ï¬ag itol on input.
If itol=1, iteration stops when the quantity |A Â· x âb|/|b| is less than the input quantity
tol.
If itol=2, the required criterion is
|eA
â1 Â· (A Â· x âb)|/|eA
â1 Â· b| < tol
(2.7.44)
If itol=3, the routine uses its own estimate of the error in x, and requires its magnitude,
divided by the magnitude of x, to be less than tol. The setting itol=4is the same as itol=3,
except that the largest (in absolute value) component of the error and largest component of x
are used instead of the vector magnitude (that is, the Lânorm instead of the L2 norm). You
may need to experiment to ï¬nd which of these convergence criteria is best for your problem.
On output, err is the tolerance actually achieved. If the returned count iter does
not indicate that the maximum number of allowed iterations itmax was exceeded, then err
should be less than tol. If you want to do further iterations, leave all returned quantities as
they are and call the routine again. The routine loses its memory of the spanned conjugate
gradient subspace between calls, however, so you should not force it to return more often
than about every N iterations.
Finally, note that linbcg is furnished in double precision, since it will be usually be
used when N is quite large.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"

void linbcg(unsigned long n, double b[], double x[], int itol, double tol,
int itmax, int *iter, double *err)
Solves A Â· x = b for x[1..n], given b[1..n], by the iterative biconjugate gradient method.
On input x[1..n] should be set to an initial guess of the solution (or all zeros); itol is 1,2,3,
or 4, specifying which convergence test is applied (see text); itmax is the maximum number
of allowed iterations; and tol is the desired convergence tolerance. On output, x[1..n] is
reset to the improved solution, iter is the number of iterations actually taken, and err is the
estimated error. The matrix A is referenced only through the user-supplied routines atimes,
which computes the product of either A or its transpose on a vector; and asolve, which solves
eAÂ·x = b or eA
T Â·x = b for some preconditioner matrix eA (possibly the trivial diagonal part of A).

The routine linbcg uses this short utility for computing vector norms:

double snrm(unsigned long n, double sx[], int itol)
Compute one of two norms for a vector sx[1..n], as signaled by itol. Used by linbcg.

unsigned long i,isamax;
double ans;
if (itol <= 3) {
ans = 0.0;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) ans += sx[i]*sx[i];
Vector magnitude norm.
return sqrt(ans);
} else {
isamax=1;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
Largest component norm.
if (fabs(sx[i]) > fabs(sx[isamax])) isamax=i;
}
return fabs(sx[isamax]);
}
}
So that the speciï¬cations for the routines atimes and asolve are clear, we list here
simple versions that assume a matrix A stored somewhere in row-index sparse format.

2.8 Vandermonde Matrices and Toeplitz
Matrices
In Â§2.4 the case of a tridiagonal matrix was treated specially, because that
particular type of linear system admits a solution in only of order N operations,
rather than of order N 3 for the general linear problem. When such particular types
exist, it is important to know about them. Your computational savings, should you
ever happen to be working on a problem that involves the right kind of particular
type, can be enormous.
This section treats two special types of matrices that can be solved in of order
N 2 operations, not as good as tridiagonal, but a lot better than the general case.
(Other than the operations count, these two types having nothing in common.)
Matrices of the ï¬rst type, termed Vandermonde matrices, occur in some problems
having to do with the ï¬tting of polynomials, the reconstruction of distributions from
their moments, and also other contexts. In this book, for example, a Vandermonde
problem crops up in Â§3.5. Matrices of the second type, termed Toeplitz matrices,
tend to occur in problems involving deconvolution and signal processing. In this
book, a Toeplitz problem is encountered in Â§13.7.
These are not the only special types of matrices worth knowing about. The
Hilbert matrices, whose components are of the form aij = 1/(i + j â1), i, j =
1, . . ., N can be inverted by an exact integer algorithm, and are very difï¬cult to
invert in any other way, since they are notoriouslyill-conditioned(see [1] for details).
The Sherman-Morrison and Woodbury formulas, discussed in Â§2.7, can sometimes
be used to convert new special forms into old ones. Reference [2] gives some other
special forms. We have not found these additional forms to arise as frequently as
the two that we now discuss.
Vandermonde Matrices
A Vandermonde matrix of size N Ã N is completely determined by N arbitrary
numbers x1, x2, . . . , xN, in terms of which its N 2 components are the integer powers
xjâ1
i
, i, j = 1, . . . , N. Evidently there are two possible such forms, depending on whether
we view the iâs as rows, jâs as columns, or vice versa. In the former case, we get a linear
system of equations that looks like this,

Performing the matrix multiplication, you will see that this equation solves for the unknown
coefï¬cients ci which ï¬t a polynomial to the N pairs of abscissas and ordinates (xj, yj).
Precisely this problem will arise in Â§3.5, and the routine given there will solve (2.8.1) by the
method that we are about to describe.

(2.8.2)
Write this out and you will see that it relates to the problem of moments: Given the values
of N points xi, ï¬nd the unknown weights wi, assigned so as to match the given values
qj of the ï¬rst N moments. (For more on this problem, consult [3].) The routine given in
this section solves (2.8.2).
The method of solution of both (2.8.1) and (2.8.2) is closely related to Lagrangeâs
polynomial interpolation formula, which we will not formally meet until Â§3.1 below. Notwith-
standing, the following derivation should be comprehensible:
Let Pj(x) be the polynomial of degree N â1 deï¬ned by
Pj(x) =
N
Y
n=1
(nÌ¸=j)
x âxn
xj âxn
=
N
X
k=1
Ajkxkâ1
(2.8.3)
Here the meaning of the last equality is to deï¬ne the components of the matrix Aij as the
coefï¬cients that arise when the product is multiplied out and like terms collected.
The polynomial Pj(x) is a function of x generally.
But you will notice that it is
speciï¬cally designed so that it takes on a value of zero at all xi with i Ì¸= j, and has a value
of unity at x = xj.
In other words,
Pj(xi) = Î´ij =
N
X
k=1
Ajkxkâ1
i
(2.8.4)
But (2.8.4) says that Ajk is exactly the inverse of the matrix of components xkâ1
i
, which
appears in (2.8.2), with the subscript as the column index. Therefore the solution of (2.8.2)
is just that matrix inverse times the right-hand side,
wj =
N
X
k=1
Ajkqk
(2.8.5)
As for the transpose problem (2.8.1), we can use the fact that the inverse of the transpose
is the transpose of the inverse, so
cj =
N
X
k=1
Akjyk
(2.8.6)
The routine in Â§3.5 implements this.
It remains to ï¬nd a good way of multiplying out the monomial terms in (2.8.3), in order
to get the components of Ajk. This is essentially a bookkeeping problem, and we will let you
read the routine itself to see how it can be solved. One trick is to deï¬ne a master P(x) by
P(x) â¡
N
Y
n=1
(x âxn)
(2.8.7)
work out its coefï¬cients, and then obtain the numerators and denominators of the speciï¬c
Pjâs via synthetic division by the one supernumerary term. (See Â§5.3 for more on synthetic
division.)
Since each such division is only a process of order N, the total procedure is
of order N 2.
You should be warned that Vandermonde systems are notoriously ill-conditioned, by
their very nature. (As an aside anticipating Â§5.8, the reason is the same as that which makes
Chebyshev ï¬tting so impressively accurate: there exist high-order polynomials that are very
good uniform ï¬ts to zero. Hence roundoff error can introduce rather substantial coefï¬cients
of the leading terms of these polynomials.) It is a good idea always to compute Vandermonde
problems in double precision.

1, . . . , â1, 0, 1, . . . , N â1. Those numbers are then emplaced as matrix elements constant

(2.8.10)
in turn for M = 1, 2, . . . until M = N, the desired result, is ï¬nally reached. The vector x(M)
j
is the result at the Mth stage, and becomes the desired answer only when N is reached.
Levinsonâs method is well documented in standard texts (e.g., [5]). The useful fact that
the method generalizes to the nonsymmetric case seems to be less well known. At some risk
of excessive detail, we therefore give a derivation here, due to G.B. Rybicki.
In following a recursion from step M to step M + 1 we ï¬nd that our developing solution
x(M) changes in this way:
M
X
j=1
Riâjx(M)
j

i = 1, . . . , M

j = 1, . . . , M
(2.8.16)
Thus, if we can use recursion to ï¬nd the order M quantities x(M) and G(M) and the single
order M + 1 quantity x(M+1)
M+1 , then all of the other x(M+1)
j
will follow. Fortunately, the

The only remaining problem is to develop a recursion relation for G. Before we do
that, however, we should point out that there are actually two distinct sets of solutions to the
original linear problem for a nonsymmetric matrix, namely right-hand solutions (which we
have been discussing) and left-hand solutions zi. The formalism for the left-hand solutions
differs only in that we deal with the equations
M
X
j=1
Rjâiz
(M)
j
= yi
i = 1, . . . , M
(2.8.20)
Then, the same sequence of operations on this set leads to
M
X
j=1
RiâjH(M)
j
= Ri
(2.8.21)
where
H
(M)
j
â¡
z(M)
M+1âj âz(M+1)
M+1âj
z(M+1)
M+1
(2.8.22)
(compare with 2.8.14 â 2.8.15). The reason for mentioning the left-hand solutions now is
that, by equation (2.8.21), the Hj satisfy exactly the same equation as the xj except for
the substitution yi âRi on the right-hand side. Therefore we can quickly deduce from
equation (2.8.19) that
H(M+1)
M+1
=
PM
j=1 RM+1âjH(M)
j
âRM+1
PM
j=1 RM+1âjG(M)
M+1âj âR0
(2.8.23)
By the same token, G satisï¬es the same equation as z, except for the substitution yi âRâi.
This gives
G
(M+1)
M+1
=
PM
j=1 RjâMâ1G(M)
j
âRâMâ1
PM
j=1 RjâMâ1H(M)
M+1âj âR0
(2.8.24)
The sameâmorphismâ also turns equation(2.8.16), and its partnerfor z, into the ï¬nal equations
G(M+1)
j
= G(M)
j
âG(M+1)
M+1 H(M)
M+1âj
H(M+1)
j
= H(M)
j
âH(M+1)
M+1 G(M)
M+1âj
(2.8.25)
Now, starting with the initial values
x(1)
1
= y1/R0
G(1)
1
= Râ1/R0
H(1)
1
= R1/R0
(2.8.26)
we can recurse away.
At each stage M we use equations (2.8.23) and (2.8.24) to ï¬nd
H(M+1)
M+1 , G(M+1)
M+1 , and then equation (2.8.25)toï¬ndtheothercomponents ofH(M+1), G(M+1).
From there the vectors x(M+1) and/or z(M+1) are easily calculated.
The program below does this. It incorporates the second equation in (2.8.25) in the form
H(M+1)
M+1âj = H(M)
M+1âj âH(M+1)
M+1 G(M)
j
(2.8.27)
so that the computation can be done âin place.â
Notice that the above algorithm fails if R0 = 0. In fact, because the bordering method
does not allow pivoting, the algorithm will fail if any of the diagonal principal minors of the
original Toeplitz matrix vanish. (Compare with discussion of the tridiagonal algorithm in
Â§2.4.) If the algorithm fails, your matrix is not necessarily singular â you might just have
to solve your problem by a slower and more general algorithm such as LU decomposition
with pivoting.
The routine that implements equations (2.8.23)â(2.8.27) is also due to Rybicki. Note
that the routineâs r[n+j] is equal to Rj above, so that subscripts on the r array vary from
1 to 2N â1.

2.9 Cholesky Decomposition
If a square matrix A happens to be symmetric and positive deï¬nite, then it has a
special, more efï¬cient, triangular decomposition.
Symmetric means that aij = aji for
i, j = 1, . . . , N, while positive deï¬nite means that
v Â· A Â· v > 0
for all vectors v
(2.9.1)
(In Chapter 11 we will see that positive deï¬nite has the equivalent interpretation that A has
all positive eigenvalues.) While symmetric, positive deï¬nite matrices are rather special, they
occur quite frequently in some applications, so their special factorization, called Cholesky
decomposition, is good to know about. When you can use it, Cholesky decomposition is about
a factor of two faster than alternative methods for solving linear equations.
Instead of seeking arbitrary lower and upper triangular factors L and U, Cholesky
decomposition constructs a lower triangular matrix L whose transpose LT can itself serve as
the upper triangular part. In other words we replace equation (2.3.1) by
L Â· LT = A
(2.9.2)
This factorization is sometimes referred to as âtaking the square rootâ of the matrix A. The
components of LT are of course related to those of L by
LT
ij = Lji
(2.9.3)
Writing out equation (2.9.2) in components, one readily obtains the analogs of equations

2.8 Vandermonde Matrices and Toeplitz
Matrices
In Â§2.4 the case of a tridiagonal matrix was treated specially, because that
particular type of linear system admits a solution in only of order N operations,
rather than of order N 3 for the general linear problem. When such particular types
exist, it is important to know about them. Your computational savings, should you
ever happen to be working on a problem that involves the right kind of particular
type, can be enormous.
This section treats two special types of matrices that can be solved in of order
N 2 operations, not as good as tridiagonal, but a lot better than the general case.
(Other than the operations count, these two types having nothing in common.)
Matrices of the ï¬rst type, termed Vandermonde matrices, occur in some problems
having to do with the ï¬tting of polynomials, the reconstruction of distributions from
their moments, and also other contexts. In this book, for example, a Vandermonde
problem crops up in Â§3.5. Matrices of the second type, termed Toeplitz matrices,
tend to occur in problems involving deconvolution and signal processing. In this
book, a Toeplitz problem is encountered in Â§13.7.
These are not the only special types of matrices worth knowing about. The
Hilbert matrices, whose components are of the form aij = 1/(i + j â1), i, j =
1, . . ., N can be inverted by an exact integer algorithm, and are very difï¬cult to
invert in any other way, since they are notoriouslyill-conditioned(see [1] for details).
The Sherman-Morrison and Woodbury formulas, discussed in Â§2.7, can sometimes
be used to convert new special forms into old ones. Reference [2] gives some other
special forms. We have not found these additional forms to arise as frequently as
the two that we now discuss.
Vandermonde Matrices
A Vandermonde matrix of size N Ã N is completely determined by N arbitrary
numbers x1, x2, . . . , xN, in terms of which its N 2 components are the integer powers
xjâ1
i
, i, j = 1, . . . , N. Evidently there are two possible such forms, depending on whether
we view the iâs as rows, jâs as columns, or vice versa. In the former case, we get a linear
system of equations that looks like this,

(2.8.1)
Performing the matrix multiplication, you will see that this equation solves for the unknown
coefï¬cients ci which ï¬t a polynomial to the N pairs of abscissas and ordinates (xj, yj).
Precisely this problem will arise in Â§3.5, and the routine given there will solve (2.8.1) by the
method that we are about to describe.

(2.8.2)
Write this out and you will see that it relates to the problem of moments: Given the values
of N points xi, ï¬nd the unknown weights wi, assigned so as to match the given values
qj of the ï¬rst N moments. (For more on this problem, consult [3].) The routine given in
this section solves (2.8.2).
The method of solution of both (2.8.1) and (2.8.2) is closely related to Lagrangeâs
polynomial interpolation formula, which we will not formally meet until Â§3.1 below. Notwith-
standing, the following derivation should be comprehensible:
Let Pj(x) be the polynomial of degree N â1 deï¬ned by
Pj(x) =
N
Y
n=1
(nÌ¸=j)
x âxn
xj âxn
=
N
X
k=1
Ajkxkâ1
(2.8.3)
Here the meaning of the last equality is to deï¬ne the components of the matrix Aij as the
coefï¬cients that arise when the product is multiplied out and like terms collected.
The polynomial Pj(x) is a function of x generally.
But you will notice that it is
speciï¬cally designed so that it takes on a value of zero at all xi with i Ì¸= j, and has a value
of unity at x = xj.
In other words,
Pj(xi) = Î´ij =
N
X
k=1
Ajkxkâ1
i
(2.8.4)
But (2.8.4) says that Ajk is exactly the inverse of the matrix of components xkâ1
i
, which
appears in (2.8.2), with the subscript as the column index. Therefore the solution of (2.8.2)
is just that matrix inverse times the right-hand side,
wj =
N
X
k=1
Ajkqk
(2.8.5)
As for the transpose problem (2.8.1), we can use the fact that the inverse of the transpose
is the transpose of the inverse, so
cj =
N
X
k=1
Akjyk
(2.8.6)
The routine in Â§3.5 implements this.
It remains to ï¬nd a good way of multiplying out the monomial terms in (2.8.3), in order
to get the components of Ajk. This is essentially a bookkeeping problem, and we will let you
read the routine itself to see how it can be solved. One trick is to deï¬ne a master P(x) by
P(x) â¡
N
Y
n=1
(x âxn)
(2.8.7)
work out its coefï¬cients, and then obtain the numerators and denominators of the speciï¬c
Pjâs via synthetic division by the one supernumerary term. (See Â§5.3 for more on synthetic
division.)
Since each such division is only a process of order N, the total procedure is
of order N 2.
You should be warned that Vandermonde systems are notoriously ill-conditioned, by
their very nature. (As an aside anticipating Â§5.8, the reason is the same as that which makes
Chebyshev ï¬tting so impressively accurate: there exist high-order polynomials that are very
good uniform ï¬ts to zero. Hence roundoff error can introduce rather substantial coefï¬cients
of the leading terms of these polynomials.) It is a good idea always to compute Vandermonde
problems in double precision.

Toeplitz Matrices
An N Ã N Toeplitz matrix is speciï¬ed by giving 2N â1 numbers Rk, k = âN +
1, . . . , â1, 0, 1, . . . , N â1. Those numbers are then emplaced as matrix elements constant
along the (upper-left to lower-right) diagonals of the matrix:

The linear Toeplitz problem can thus be written as

(2.8.9)
where the xjâs, j = 1, . . . , N, are the unknowns to be solved for.
The Toeplitz matrix is symmetric if Rk = Râk for all k. Levinson [4] developed an
algorithm for fast solution of the symmetric Toeplitz problem, by a bordering method, that is,

(2.8.10)
in turn for M = 1, 2, . . . until M = N, the desired result, is ï¬nally reached. The vector x(M)
j
is the result at the Mth stage, and becomes the desired answer only when N is reached.
Levinsonâs method is well documented in standard texts (e.g., [5]). The useful fact that
the method generalizes to the nonsymmetric case seems to be less well known. At some risk
of excessive detail, we therefore give a derivation here, due to G.B. Rybicki.
In following a recursion from step M to step M + 1 we ï¬nd that our developing solution
x(M) changes in this way:
M
X
j=1
Riâjx(M)
j

i = 1, . . . , M

j = 1, . . . , M

Thus, if we can use recursion to ï¬nd the order M quantities x(M) and G(M) and the single
order M + 1 quantity x(M+1)
M+1 , then all of the other x(M+1)
j
will follow. Fortunately, the

For the unknown order M + 1 quantities x(M+1)

we can substitute the previous order

The only remaining problem is to develop a recursion relation for G. Before we do
that, however, we should point out that there are actually two distinct sets of solutions to the
original linear problem for a nonsymmetric matrix, namely right-hand solutions (which we
have been discussing) and left-hand solutions zi. The formalism for the left-hand solutions
differs only in that we deal with the equations
M
X
j=1
Rjâiz
(M)
j
= yi
i = 1, . . . , M
(2.8.20)
Then, the same sequence of operations on this set leads to
M
X
j=1
RiâjH(M)
j
= Ri
(2.8.21)
where
H
(M)
j
â¡
z(M)
M+1âj âz(M+1)
M+1âj
z(M+1)
M+1
(2.8.22)
(compare with 2.8.14 â 2.8.15). The reason for mentioning the left-hand solutions now is
that, by equation (2.8.21), the Hj satisfy exactly the same equation as the xj except for
the substitution yi âRi on the right-hand side. Therefore we can quickly deduce from
equation (2.8.19) that
H(M+1)
M+1
=
PM
j=1 RM+1âjH(M)
j
âRM+1
PM
j=1 RM+1âjG(M)
M+1âj âR0
(2.8.23)
By the same token, G satisï¬es the same equation as z, except for the substitution yi âRâi.
This gives
G
(M+1)
M+1
=
PM
j=1 RjâMâ1G(M)
j
âRâMâ1
PM
j=1 RjâMâ1H(M)
M+1âj âR0
(2.8.24)
The sameâmorphismâ also turns equation(2.8.16), and its partnerfor z, into the ï¬nal equations
G(M+1)
j
= G(M)
j
âG(M+1)
M+1 H(M)
M+1âj
H(M+1)
j
= H(M)
j
âH(M+1)
M+1 G(M)
M+1âj
(2.8.25)
Now, starting with the initial values
x(1)
1
= y1/R0
G(1)
1
= Râ1/R0
H(1)
1
= R1/R0
(2.8.26)
we can recurse away.
At each stage M we use equations (2.8.23) and (2.8.24) to ï¬nd
H(M+1)
M+1 , G(M+1)
M+1 , and then equation (2.8.25)toï¬ndtheothercomponents ofH(M+1), G(M+1).
From there the vectors x(M+1) and/or z(M+1) are easily calculated.
The program below does this. It incorporates the second equation in (2.8.25) in the form
H(M+1)
M+1âj = H(M)
M+1âj âH(M+1)
M+1 G(M)
j
(2.8.27)
so that the computation can be done âin place.â
Notice that the above algorithm fails if R0 = 0. In fact, because the bordering method
does not allow pivoting, the algorithm will fail if any of the diagonal principal minors of the
original Toeplitz matrix vanish. (Compare with discussion of the tridiagonal algorithm in
Â§2.4.) If the algorithm fails, your matrix is not necessarily singular â you might just have
to solve your problem by a slower and more general algorithm such as LU decomposition
with pivoting.
The routine that implements equations (2.8.23)â(2.8.27) is also due to Rybicki. Note
that the routineâs r[n+j] is equal to Rj above, so that subscripts on the r array vary from
1 to 2N â1.

2.9 Cholesky Decomposition
If a square matrix A happens to be symmetric and positive deï¬nite, then it has a
special, more efï¬cient, triangular decomposition.
Symmetric means that aij = aji for
i, j = 1, . . . , N, while positive deï¬nite means that
v Â· A Â· v > 0
for all vectors v
(2.9.1)
(In Chapter 11 we will see that positive deï¬nite has the equivalent interpretation that A has
all positive eigenvalues.) While symmetric, positive deï¬nite matrices are rather special, they
occur quite frequently in some applications, so their special factorization, called Cholesky
decomposition, is good to know about. When you can use it, Cholesky decomposition is about
a factor of two faster than alternative methods for solving linear equations.
Instead of seeking arbitrary lower and upper triangular factors L and U, Cholesky
decomposition constructs a lower triangular matrix L whose transpose LT can itself serve as
the upper triangular part. In other words we replace equation (2.3.1) by
L Â· LT = A
(2.9.2)
This factorization is sometimes referred to as âtaking the square rootâ of the matrix A. The
components of LT are of course related to those of L by
LT
ij = Lji
(2.9.3)
Writing out equation (2.9.2) in components, one readily obtains the analogs of equations
(2.3.12)â(2.3.13),
Lii =
 
aii â

If you apply equations (2.9.4) and (2.9.5) in the order i = 1, 2, . . . , N, you will see
that the Lâs that occur on the right-hand side are already determined by the time they are
needed. Also, only components aij with j â¥i are referenced. (Since A is symmetric,
these have complete information.) It is convenient, then, to have the factor L overwrite the
subdiagonal (lower triangular but not including the diagonal) part of A, preserving the input
upper triangular values of A. Only one extra vector of length N is needed to store the diagonal
part of L. The operations count is N 3/6 executions of the inner loop (consisting of one
multiply and one subtract), with also N square roots. As already mentioned, this is about a
factor 2 better than LU decomposition of A (where its symmetry would be ignored).
A straightforward implementation is
#include <math.h>
void choldc(float **a, int n, float p[])
Given a positive-deï¬nite symmetric matrix a[1..n][1..n], this routine constructs its Cholesky
decomposition, A = L Â· LT . On input, only the upper triangle of a need be given; it is not
modiï¬ed. The Cholesky factor L is returned in the lower triangle of a, except for its diagonal
elements which are returned in p[1..n].
{
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int i,j,k;
float sum;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
for (j=i;j<=n;j++) {
for (sum=a[i][j],k=i-1;k>=1;k--) sum -= a[i][k]*a[j][k];
if (i == j) {
if (sum <= 0.0)
a, with rounding errors, is not positive deï¬nite.
nrerror("choldc failed");
p[i]=sqrt(sum);
} else a[j][i]=sum/p[i];
}
}
}
You might at this point wonder about pivoting. The pleasant answer is that Cholesky
decomposition is extremely stable numerically, without any pivoting at all. Failure of choldc
simply indicates that the matrix A (or, with roundoff error, another very nearby matrix) is
not positive deï¬nite. In fact, choldc is an efï¬cient way to test whether a symmetric matrix
is positive deï¬nite. (In this application, you will want to replace the call to nrerror with
some less drastic signaling method.)
Once your matrix is decomposed, the triangular factor can be used to solve a linear
equation by backsubstitution. The straightforward implementation of this is
void cholsl(float **a, int n, float p[], float b[], float x[])
Solves the set of n linear equations A Â· x = b, where a is a positive-deï¬nite symmetric matrix.
a[1..n][1..n] and p[1..n] are input as the output of the routine choldc. Only the lower
triangle of a is accessed. b[1..n] is input as the right-hand side vector. The solution vector is
returned in x[1..n]. a, n, and p are not modiï¬ed and can be left in place for successive calls
with diï¬erent right-hand sides b. b is not modiï¬ed unless you identify b and x in the calling
sequence, which is allowed.
{
int i,k;
float sum;
for (i=1;i<=n;i++) {
Solve L Â· y = b, storing y in x.
for (sum=b[i],k=i-1;k>=1;k--) sum -= a[i][k]*x[k];
x[i]=sum/p[i];
}
for (i=n;i>=1;i--) {
Solve LT Â· x = y.
for (sum=x[i],k=i+1;k<=n;k++) sum -= a[k][i]*x[k];

2.10 QR Decomposition
There is another matrix factorization that is sometimes very useful, the so-called QR
decomposition,
A = Q Â· R
(2.10.1)
Here R is upper triangular, while Q is orthogonal, that is,
QT Â· Q = 1
(2.10.2)
where QT is the transpose matrix of Q. Although the decomposition exists for a general
rectangular matrix, we shall restrict our treatment to the case when all the matrices are square,
with dimensions N Ã N.
Like the other matrix factorizations we have met (LU, SVD, Cholesky), QR decompo-
sition can be used to solve systems of linear equations. To solve
A Â· x = b
(2.10.3)
ï¬rst form QT Â· b and then solve
R Â· x = QT Â· b
(2.10.4)
by backsubstitution. Since QR decomposition involves about twice as many operations as
LU decomposition, it is not used for typical systems of linear equations. However, we will
meet special cases where QR is the method of choice.

2.10 QR Decomposition
There is another matrix factorization that is sometimes very useful, the so-called QR
decomposition,
A = Q Â· R
(2.10.1)
Here R is upper triangular, while Q is orthogonal, that is,
QT Â· Q = 1
(2.10.2)
where QT is the transpose matrix of Q. Although the decomposition exists for a general
rectangular matrix, we shall restrict our treatment to the case when all the matrices are square,
with dimensions N Ã N.
Like the other matrix factorizations we have met (LU, SVD, Cholesky), QR decompo-
sition can be used to solve systems of linear equations. To solve
A Â· x = b
(2.10.3)
ï¬rst form QT Â· b and then solve
R Â· x = QT Â· b
(2.10.4)
by backsubstitution. Since QR decomposition involves about twice as many operations as
LU decomposition, it is not used for typical systems of linear equations. However, we will
meet special cases where QR is the method of choice.

The standard algorithm for the QR decomposition involves successive Householder
transformations (to be discussed later in Â§11.2). We write a Householder matrix in the form
1 âu âu/c where c = 1
2u Â· u. An appropriate Householder matrix applied to a given matrix
can zero all elements in a column of the matrix situated below a chosen element. Thus we
arrange for the ï¬rst Householder matrix Q1 to zero all elements in the ï¬rst column of A
below the ï¬rst element. Similarly Q2 zeroes all elements in the second column below the
second element, and so on up to Qnâ1. Thus
R = Qnâ1 Â· Â· Â· Q1 Â· A
(2.10.5)
Since the Householder matrices are orthogonal,
Q = (Qnâ1 Â· Â· Â· Q1)â1 = Q1 Â· Â· Â· Qnâ1
(2.10.6)
In most applications we donât need to form Q explicitly; we instead store it in the factored
form (2.10.6). Pivoting is not usually necessary unless the matrix A is very close to singular.
A generalQR algorithm for rectangular matrices including pivoting is given in [1]. For square
matrices, an implementation is the following:
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void qrdcmp(float **a, int n, float *c, float *d, int *sing)
Constructs the QR decomposition of a[1..n][1..n]. The upper triangular matrix R is re-
turned in the upper triangle of a, except for the diagonal elements of R which are returned in
d[1..n]. The orthogonal matrix Q is represented as a product of n â1 Householder matrices
Q1 . . . Qnâ1, where Qj = 1 âuj âuj/cj. The ith component of uj is zero for i = 1, . . . , j â1
while the nonzero components are returned in a[i][j] for i = j, . . . , n. sing returns as
true (1) if singularity is encountered during the decomposition, but the decomposition is still
completed in this case; otherwise it returns false (0).
{
int i,j,k;
float scale,sigma,sum,tau;
*sing=0;
for (k=1;k<n;k++) {
scale=0.0;
for (i=k;i<=n;i++) scale=FMAX(scale,fabs(a[i][k]));
if (scale == 0.0) {
Singular case.
*sing=1;
c[k]=d[k]=0.0;
} else {
Form Qk and Qk Â· A.
for (i=k;i<=n;i++) a[i][k] /= scale;
for (sum=0.0,i=k;i<=n;i++) sum += SQR(a[i][k]);
sigma=SIGN(sqrt(sum),a[k][k]);
a[k][k] += sigma;
c[k]=sigma*a[k][k];
d[k] = -scale*sigma;
for (j=k+1;j<=n;j++) {
for (sum=0.0,i=k;i<=n;i++) sum += a[i][k]*a[i][j];
tau=sum/c[k];
for (i=k;i<=n;i++) a[i][j] -= tau*a[i][k];
}
}
}
d[n]=a[n][n];
if (d[n] == 0.0) *sing=1;
}
The next routine, qrsolv, is used to solve linear systems. In many applications only the
part (2.10.4) of the algorithm is needed, so we separate it off into its own routine rsolv.

See [2] for details on how to use QR decomposition for constructing orthogonal bases,
and for solving least-squares problems. (We prefer to use SVD, Â§2.6, for these purposes,
because of its greater diagnostic capability in pathological cases.)
Updating a QR decomposition
Some numerical algorithms involve solving a successionof linear systems each of which
differs only slightly from its predecessor. Instead of doing O(N 3) operations each time
to solve the equations from scratch, one can often update a matrix factorization in O(N 2)
operations and use the new factorization to solve the next set of linear equations. The LU
decomposition is complicated to update because of pivoting. However, QR turns out to be
quite simple for a very common kind of update,
A âA + s ât
(2.10.7)
(compare equation 2.7.1). In practice it is more convenient to work with the equivalent form
A = Q Â· R
â
Aâ² = Qâ² Â· Râ² = Q Â· (R + u âv)
(2.10.8)
One can go back and forth between equations (2.10.7) and (2.10.8) using the fact that Q
is orthogonal, giving
t = v
and either
s = Q Â· u
or
u = QT Â· s
(2.10.9)
The algorithm [2] has two phases. In the ï¬rst we apply N â1 Jacobi rotations (Â§11.1) to
reduce R + u âv to upper Hessenberg form. Another N â1 Jacobi rotations transform this
upper Hessenberg matrix to the new upper triangular matrix Râ². The matrix Qâ² is simply the
product of Q with the 2(N â1) Jacobi rotations. In applications we usually want QT , and
the algorithm can easily be rearranged to work with this matrix instead of with Q.

c21 = Q2 + Q4
c12 = Q3 + Q5
c22 = Q1 + Q3 âQ2 + Q6
(2.11.4)
Whatâs the use of this? There is one fewer multiplication than in equation
(2.11.2), but many more additions and subtractions. It is not clear that anything
has been gained. But notice that in (2.11.3) the aâs and bâs are never commuted.
Therefore (2.11.3) and (2.11.4) are valid when the aâs and bâs are themselves
matrices. The problem of multiplying two very large matrices (of order N = 2m for
some integer m) can now be broken down recursively by partitioning the matrices
into quarters, sixteenths, etc. And note the key point: The savings is not just a factor
â7/8â; it is that factor at each hierarchical level of the recursion. In total it reduces
the process of matrix multiplication to order N log2 7 instead of N 3.
What about all the extra additions in (2.11.3)â(2.11.4)? Donât they outweigh
the advantage of the fewer multiplications? For large N, it turns out that there are
six times as many additions as multiplications implied by (2.11.3)â(2.11.4). But,
if N is very large, this constant factor is no match for the change in the exponent
from N 3 to N log2 7.
With this âfastâ matrix multiplication, Strassen also obtained a surprising result
for matrix inversion [1]. Suppose that the matrices

a12
a21
a22

and

c11
c12
c21
c22

(2.11.5)
are inverses of each other. Then the câs can be obtained from the aâs by the following
operations (compare equations 2.7.22 and 2.7.25):
R1 = Inverse(a11)
R2 = a21 Ã R1
R3 = R1 Ã a12
R4 = a21 Ã R3
R5 = R4 âa22
R6 = Inverse(R5)
c12 = R3 Ã R6
c21 = R6 Ã R2
R7 = R3 Ã c21
c11 = R1 âR7
c22 = âR6

In (2.11.6) the âinverseâ operator occurs just twice. It is to be interpreted as the
reciprocal if the aâs and câs are scalars, but as matrix inversion if the aâs and câs are
themselves submatrices. Imagine doing the inversion of a very large matrix, of order
N = 2m, recursively by partitions in half. At each step, halving the order doubles
the number of inverse operations. But this means that there are only N divisions in
all! So divisions donât dominate in the recursive use of (2.11.6). Equation (2.11.6)
is dominated, in fact, by its 6 multiplications. Since these can be done by an N log2 7
algorithm, so can the matrix inversion!
This is fun, but letâs look at practicalities: If you estimate how large N has to be
before the difference between exponent 3 and exponent log2 7 = 2.807 is substantial
enough to outweigh the bookkeeping overhead, arising from the complicated nature
of the recursive Strassen algorithm, you will ï¬nd that LU decomposition is in no
immediate danger of becoming obsolete.
If, on the other hand, you like this kind of fun, then try these: (1) Can you
multiply the complex numbers (a+ib) and (c+id) in only three real multiplications?
[Answer: see Â§5.4.] (2) Can you evaluate a general fourth-degree polynomial in
x for many different values of x with only three multiplications per evaluation?

see Â§5.3.]

Chapter 3.
Interpolation and
Extrapolation
3.0 Introduction
We sometimes know the value of a function f(x) at a set of points x1, x2, . . ., xN
(say, withx1 < . . . < xN), but we donât have an analytic expression for f(x) that lets
us calculate its value at an arbitrary point. For example, the f(xi)âs might result from
some physical measurement or from long numerical calculation that cannot be cast
into a simple functional form. Often the xiâs are equally spaced, but not necessarily.
The task now is to estimate f(x) for arbitrary x by, in some sense, drawing a
smooth curve through (and perhaps beyond) the xi. If the desired x is in between the
largest and smallest of the xiâs, the problem is called interpolation; if x is outside
that range, it is called extrapolation, which is considerably more hazardous (as many
former stock-market analysts can attest).
Interpolation and extrapolation schemes must model the function, between or
beyond the known points, by some plausible functional form.
The form should
be sufï¬ciently general so as to be able to approximate large classes of functions
which might arise in practice. By far most common among the functional forms
used are polynomials (Â§3.1). Rational functions (quotients of polynomials) also turn
out to be extremely useful (Â§3.2). Trigonometric functions, sines and cosines, give
rise to trigonometric interpolation and related Fourier methods, which we defer to
Chapters 12 and 13.
There is an extensive mathematical literature devoted to theorems about what
sort of functions can be well approximated by which interpolating functions. These
theorems are, alas, almost completely useless in day-to-day work: If we know
enough about our function to apply a theorem of any power, we are usually not in
the pitiful state of having to interpolate on a table of its values!
Interpolation is related to, but distinct from, function approximation. That task
consists of ï¬nding an approximate (but easily computable) function to use in place
of a more complicated one. In the case of interpolation, you are given the function f
at points not of your own choosing. For the case of function approximation, you are
allowed to compute the functionf at any desired points for the purpose of developing
your approximation. We deal with function approximation in Chapter 5.
One can easily ï¬nd pathological functions that make a mockery of any interpo-
lation scheme. Consider, for example, the function
f(x) = 3x2 + 1
Ï4 ln(Ï âx)2 + 1

which is well-behaved everywhere except at x = Ï, very mildly singular at x = Ï,
and otherwise takes on all positive and negative values. Any interpolation based
on the values x = 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, will assuredly get a very wrong answer for
the value x = 3.1416, even though a graph plotting those ï¬ve points looks really
quite smooth! (Try it on your calculator.)
Because pathologies can lurk anywhere, it is highly desirable that an interpo-
lation and extrapolation routine should provide an estimate of its own error. Such
an error estimate can never be foolproof, of course. We could have a function that,
for reasons known only to its maker, takes off wildly and unexpectedly between
two tabulated points. Interpolation always presumes some degree of smoothness
for the function interpolated, but within this framework of presumption, deviations
from smoothness can be detected.
Conceptually, the interpolation process has two stages: (1) Fit an interpolating
function to the data points provided.
(2) Evaluate that interpolating function at
the target point x.
However, this two-stage method is generally not the best way to proceed in
practice.
Typically it is computationally less efï¬cient, and more susceptible to
roundoff error, than methods which construct a functional estimate f(x) directly
from the N tabulated values every time one is desired. Most practical schemes start
at a nearby point f(xi), then add a sequence of (hopefully) decreasing corrections,
as information from other f(xi)âs is incorporated. The procedure typically takes
O(N 2) operations. If everything is well behaved, the last correction will be the
smallest, and it can be used as an informal (though not rigorous) bound on the error.
In the case of polynomial interpolation, it sometimes does happen that the
coefï¬cients of the interpolating polynomial are of interest, even though their use
in evaluating the interpolating function should be frowned on. We deal with this
eventuality in Â§3.5.
Local interpolation, using a ï¬nite number of ânearest-neighborâ points, gives
interpolated values f(x) that do not, in general, have continuous ï¬rst or higher
derivatives.
That happens because, as x crosses the tabulated values xi, the
interpolation scheme switches which tabulated points are the âlocalâ ones. (If such
a switch is allowed to occur anywhere else, then there will be a discontinuity in the
interpolated function itself at that point. Bad idea!)
In situations where continuity of derivatives is a concern, one must use
the âstifferâ interpolation provided by a so-called spline function.
A spline is
a polynomial between each pair of table points, but one whose coefï¬cients are
determined âslightlyâ nonlocally. The nonlocality is designed to guarantee global
smoothness in the interpolated functionup to some order of derivative. Cubic splines
(Â§3.3) are the most popular. They produce an interpolated function that is continuous
through the second derivative. Splines tend to be stabler than polynomials, with less
possibility of wild oscillation between the tabulated points.
The number of points (minus one) used in an interpolation scheme is called
the order of the interpolation. Increasing the order does not necessarily increase
the accuracy, especially in polynomial interpolation. If the added points are distant
from the point of interest x, the resulting higher-order polynomial, with its additional
constrained points, tends to oscillate wildly between the tabulated values.
This
oscillation may have no relation at all to the behavior of the âtrueâ function (see
Figure 3.0.1). Of course, adding points close to the desired point usually does help,

(a) A smooth function (solid line) is more accurately interpolated by a high-order
polynomial (shown schematically as dotted line) than by a low-order polynomial (shown as a piecewise
linear dashed line).
(b) A function with sharp corners or rapidly changing higher derivatives is less
accurately approximatedby a high-orderpolynomial(dotted line), which is too âstiff,â than by a low-order
polynomial (dashed lines). Even some smooth functions, such as exponentials or rational functions, can
be badly approximated by high-order polynomials.
but a ï¬ner mesh implies a larger table of values, not always available.
Unless there is solid evidence that the interpolating function is close in form to
the true function f, it is a good idea to be cautious about high-order interpolation.
We enthusiastically endorse interpolationswith 3 or 4 points, we are perhaps tolerant
of 5 or 6; but we rarely go higher than that unless there is quite rigorous monitoring
of estimated errors.
When your table of values contains many more points than the desirable order
of interpolation, you must begin each interpolation with a search for the right âlocalâ
place in the table. While not strictly a part of the subject of interpolation, this task is
important enough (and often enough botched) that we devote Â§3.4 to its discussion.
The routines given for interpolation are also routines for extrapolation. An
important application, in Chapter 16, is their use in the integration of ordinary
differential equations.
There, considerable care is taken with the monitoring of
errors.
Otherwise, the dangers of extrapolation cannot be overemphasized: An
interpolating function, which is perforce an extrapolating function, will typically go
berserk when the argument x is outside the range of tabulated values by more than
the typical spacing of tabulated points.
Interpolation can be done in more than one dimension, e.g., for a function

3.1 Polynomial Interpolation and Extrapolation
Through any two points there is a unique line. Through any three points, a
unique quadratic. Et cetera. The interpolating polynomial of degree N â1 through
the N points y1 = f(x1), y2 = f(x2), . . ., yN = f(xN) is given explicitly by
Lagrangeâs classical formula,
P (x) =

There are N terms, each a polynomial of degree N â1 and each constructed to be
zero at all of the xi except one, at which it is constructed to be yi.
It is not terribly wrong to implement the Lagrange formula straightforwardly,
but it is not terribly right either. The resulting algorithm gives no error estimate, and
it is also somewhat awkward to program. A much better algorithm (for constructing
the same, unique, interpolating polynomial) is Nevilleâs algorithm, closely related to
and sometimes confused with Aitkenâs algorithm, the latter now considered obsolete.

The various P âs form a âtableauâ with âancestorsâ on the left leading to a single
âdescendantâ at the extreme right. For example, with N = 4,
x1 :
y1 = P1

(3.1.2)
Nevilleâs algorithm is a recursive way of ï¬lling in the numbers in the tableau
a column at a time, from left to right. It is based on the relationship between a
âdaughterâ P and its two âparents,â
Pi(i+1)...(i+m) = (x âxi+m)Pi(i+1)...(i+mâ1) + (xi âx)P(i+1)(i+2)...(i+m)
xi âxi+m
(3.1.3)
This recurrence works because the two parents already agree at points xi+1 . . .
xi+mâ1.
An improvement on the recurrence (3.1.3) is to keep track of the small
differences between parents and daughters, namely to deï¬ne (for m = 1, 2, . . .,
N â1),
Cm,i â¡Pi...(i+m) âPi...(i+mâ1)
Dm,i â¡Pi...(i+m) âP(i+1)...(i+m).
(3.1.4)
Then one can easily derive from (3.1.3) the relations
Dm+1,i = (xi+m+1 âx)(Cm,i+1 âDm,i)
xi âxi+m+1
Cm+1,i = (xi âx)(Cm,i+1 âDm,i)
xi âxi+m+1
(3.1.5)
At each level m, the Câs and Dâs are the corrections that make the interpolation one
order higher. The ï¬nal answer P1...N is equal to the sum of any yi plus a set of Câs
and/or Dâs that form a path through the family tree to the rightmost daughter.
Here is a routine for polynomial interpolation or extrapolation from N input
points.
Note that the input arrays are assumed to be unit-offset.
If you have
zero-offset arrays, remember to subtract 1 (see Â§1.2):
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void polint(float xa[], float ya[], int n, float x, float *y, float *dy)
Given arrays xa[1..n] and ya[1..n], and given a value x, this routine returns a value y, and
an error estimate dy. If P(x) is the polynomial of degree N â1 such that P(xai) = yai, i =
1, . . . , n, then the returned value y = P(x).

ns=i;
dif=dift;
}
c[i]=ya[i];
and initialize the tableau of câs and dâs.

This is the initial approximation to y.

For each column of the tableau,
for (i=1;i<=n-m;i++) {
we loop over the current câs and dâs and update
them.
ho=xa[i]-x;
hp=xa[i+m]-x;
w=c[i+1]-d[i];

This error can occur only if two input xaâs are (to within roundoï¬) identical.

Here the câs and dâs are updated.
c[i]=ho*den;

*y += (*dy=(2*ns < (n-m) ? c[ns+1] : d[ns--]));
After each column in the tableau is completed, we decide which correction, c or d,
we want to add to our accumulating value of y, i.e., which path to take through the
tableauâforking up or down. We do this in such a way as to take the most âstraight
lineâ route through the tableau to its apex, updating ns accordingly to keep track of
where we are. This route keeps the partial approximations centered (insofar as possible)
on the target x. The last dy added is thus the error indication.

Quite often you will want to call polint with the dummy arguments xa
and ya replaced by actual arrays with offsets.
For example, the construction
polint(&xx[14],&yy[14],4,x,y,dy)performs 4-point interpolation on the tab-
ulated values xx[15..18], yy[15..18]. For more on this, see the end of Â§3.4.

3.2 Rational Function Interpolation and
Extrapolation
Some functions are not well approximated by polynomials, but are well
approximated by rational functions, that is quotients of polynomials.
We de-
note by Ri(i+1)...(i+m) a rational function passing through the m + 1 points
(xi, yi) . . . (xi+m, yi+m). More explicitly, suppose
Ri(i+1)...(i+m) = PÂµ(x)
QÎ½(x) = p0 + p1x + Â· Â· Â· + pÂµxÂµ
q0 + q1x + Â· Â· Â· + qÎ½xÎ½
(3.2.1)
Since there are Âµ + Î½ + 1 unknown pâs and qâs (q0 being arbitrary), we must have
m + 1 = Âµ + Î½ + 1
(3.2.2)
In specifying a rational function interpolating function, you must give the desired
order of both the numerator and the denominator.
Rational functions are sometimes superior to polynomials, roughly speaking,
because oftheirabilitytomodel functionswithpoles, that is, zeros of the denominator
of equation (3.2.1). These poles might occur for real values of x, if the function
to be interpolated itself has poles. More often, the function f(x) is ï¬nite for all
ï¬nite real x, but has an analytic continuation with poles in the complex x-plane.
Such poles can themselves ruin a polynomial approximation, even one restricted to
real values of x, just as they can ruin the convergence of an inï¬nite power series
in x. If you draw a circle in the complex plane around your m tabulated points,
then you should not expect polynomial interpolation to be good unless the nearest
pole is rather far outside the circle. A rational function approximation, by contrast,
will stay âgoodâ as long as it has enough powers of x in its denominator to account
for (cancel) any nearby poles.
For the interpolation problem, a rational function is constructed so as to go
through a chosen set of tabulated functional values.
However, we should also
mention in passing that rational function approximations can be used in analytic
work. One sometimes constructs a rational function approximation by the criterion
that the rational function of equation (3.2.1) itself have a power series expansion
that agrees with the ï¬rst m + 1 terms of the power series expansion of the desired
function f(x). This is called P adÂ´e approximation, and is discussed in Â§5.12.
Bulirsch and Stoer found an algorithm of the Neville type which performs
rational function extrapolation on tabulated data. A tableau like that of equation
(3.1.2) is constructed column by column, leading to a result and an error estimate.
The Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm produces the so-called diagonal rational function, with
the degrees of numerator and denominator equal (if m is even) or with the degree
of the denominator larger by one (if m is odd, cf. equation 3.2.2 above). For the
derivationof the algorithm, refer to [1]. The algorithmis summarized by a recurrence

Such poles can themselves ruin a polynomial approximation, even one restricted to
real values of x, just as they can ruin the convergence of an inï¬nite power series
in x. If you draw a circle in the complex plane around your m tabulated points,
then you should not expect polynomial interpolation to be good unless the nearest
pole is rather far outside the circle. A rational function approximation, by contrast,
will stay âgoodâ as long as it has enough powers of x in its denominator to account
for (cancel) any nearby poles.
For the interpolation problem, a rational function is constructed so as to go
through a chosen set of tabulated functional values.
However, we should also
mention in passing that rational function approximations can be used in analytic
work. One sometimes constructs a rational function approximation by the criterion
that the rational function of equation (3.2.1) itself have a power series expansion
that agrees with the ï¬rst m + 1 terms of the power series expansion of the desired
function f(x). This is called P adÂ´e approximation, and is discussed in Â§5.12.
Bulirsch and Stoer found an algorithm of the Neville type which performs
rational function extrapolation on tabulated data. A tableau like that of equation
(3.1.2) is constructed column by column, leading to a result and an error estimate.
The Bulirsch-Stoer algorithm produces the so-called diagonal rational function, with
the degrees of numerator and denominator equal (if m is even) or with the degree
of the denominator larger by one (if m is odd, cf. equation 3.2.2 above). For the
derivationof the algorithm, refer to [1]. The algorithmis summarized by a recurrence

(3.3.2)
Equations (3.3.1) and (3.3.2) are a special case of the general Lagrange interpolation
formula (3.1.1).
Since it is (piecewise) linear, equation (3.3.1) has zero second derivative in
the interior of each interval, and an undeï¬ned, or inï¬nite, second derivative at the
abscissas xj. The goal of cubic spline interpolationis to get an interpolationformula
that is smooth in the ï¬rst derivative, and continuous in the second derivative, both
within an interval and at its boundaries.
Suppose, contrary to fact, that in addition to the tabulated values of yi, we
also have tabulated values for the functionâs second derivatives, yâ²â², that is, a set
of numbers yâ²â²
i . Then, within each interval, we can add to the right-hand side of
equation (3.3.1) a cubic polynomial whose second derivative varies linearly from a
value yâ²â²
j on the left to a value yâ²â²
j+1 on the right. Doing so, we will have the desired
continuous second derivative. If we also construct the cubic polynomial to have
zero values at xj and xj+1, then adding it in will not spoil the agreement with the
tabulated functional values yj and yj+1 at the endpoints xj and xj+1.
A little side calculation shows that there is only one way to arrange this
construction, namely replacing (3.3.1) by
y = Ayj + Byj+1 + Cyâ²â²
j + Dyâ²â²
j+1
(3.3.3)
where A and B are deï¬ned in (3.3.2) and
C â¡1
6(A3 âA)(xj+1 âxj)2
D â¡1
6(B3 âB)(xj+1 âxj)2
(3.3.4)
Notice that the dependence on the independent variable x in equations (3.3.3) and
(3.3.4) is entirely through the linear x-dependence of A and B, and (through A and
B) the cubic x-dependence of C and D.
We can readily check that yâ²â² is in fact the second derivative of the new
interpolating polynomial.
We take derivatives of equation (3.3.3) with respect
to x, using the deï¬nitions of A, B, C, D to compute dA/dx, dB/dx, dC/dx, and
dD/dx.
The result is
dy
dx = yj+1 âyj
xj+1 âxj
â3A2 â1
6
(xj+1 âxj)yâ²â²
j + 3B2 â1
6
(xj+1 âxj)yâ²â²
j+1 (3.3.5)
for the ï¬rst derivative, and
d2y
dx2 = Ayâ²â²
j + Byâ²â²
j+1
(3.3.6)
for the second derivative. Since A = 1 at xj, A = 0 at xj+1, while B is just the
other way around, (3.3.6) shows that yâ²â² is just the tabulated second derivative, and
also that the second derivative will be continuous across (e.g.) the boundary between
the two intervals (xjâ1, xj) and (xj, xj+1).

The only problem now is that we supposed the yâ²â²
i âs to be known, when, actually,
they are not. However, we have not yet required that the ï¬rst derivative, computed
from equation (3.3.5), be continuous across the boundary between two intervals. The
key idea of a cubic spline is to require this continuity and to use it to get equations
for the second derivatives yâ²â²
i .
The required equations are obtained by setting equation (3.3.5) evaluated for
x = xj in the interval (xjâ1, xj) equal to the same equation evaluated for x = xj but
in the interval (xj, xj+1). With some rearrangement, this gives (for j = 2, . . ., Nâ1)
xj âxjâ1

j+1 = yj+1 âyj
xj+1 âxj
âyj âyjâ1
xj âxjâ1
(3.3.7)
These are N â2 linear equations in the N unknowns yâ²â²
i , i = 1, . . ., N. Therefore
there is a two-parameter family of possible solutions.
For a unique solution, we need to specify two further conditions, typically taken
as boundary conditionsat x1 and xN. The most common ways of doingthis are either
â¢ set one or both of yâ²â²
1 and yâ²â²
N equal to zero, giving the so-called natural
cubic spline, which has zero second derivative on one or both of its
boundaries, or
â¢ set either of yâ²â²
1 and yâ²â²
N to values calculated from equation (3.3.5) so as
to make the ï¬rst derivative of the interpolating function have a speciï¬ed
value on either or both boundaries.
One reason that cubic splines are especially practical is that the set of equations
(3.3.7), along with the two additional boundary conditions, are not only linear, but
also tridiagonal. Each yâ²â²
j is coupled only to its nearest neighbors at j Â±1. Therefore,
the equations can be solved in O(N) operations by the tridiagonal algorithm (Â§2.4).
That algorithm is concise enough to build right into the spline calculational routine.
This makes the routine not completely transparent as an implementation of (3.3.7),
so we encourage you to study it carefully, comparing with tridag (Â§2.4). Arrays
are assumed to be unit-offset. If you have zero-offset arrays, see Â§1.2.

function at points 1 and n, respectively, this routine returns an array y2[1..n] that contains
the second derivatives of the interpolating function at the tabulated points xi. If yp1 and/or
ypn are equal to 1 Ã 1030 or larger, the routine is signaled to set the corresponding boundary

It is important to understand that the program spline is called only once to
process an entire tabulated function in arrays xi and yi. Once this has been done,
values of the interpolated function for any value of x are obtained by calls (as many
as desired) to a separate routine splint (for âspline interpolationâ):
void splint(float xa[], float ya[], float y2a[], int n, float x, float *y)
Given the arrays xa[1..n] and ya[1..n], which tabulate a function (with the xaiâs in order),
and given the array y2a[1..n], which is the output from spline above, and given a value of
x, this routine returns a cubic-spline interpolated value y.
{
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int klo,khi,k;
float h,b,a;
klo=1;
We will ï¬nd the right place in the table by means of
bisection. This is optimal if sequential calls to this
routine are at random values of x. If sequential calls
are in order, and closely spaced, one would do better
to store previous values of klo and khi and test if
they remain appropriate on the next call.
khi=n;
while (khi-klo > 1) {
k=(khi+klo) >> 1;
if (xa[k] > x) khi=k;
else klo=k;

3.4 How to Search an Ordered Table
Suppose that you have decided to use some particular interpolation scheme,
such as fourth-order polynomial interpolation, to compute a function f(x) from a
set of tabulated xiâs and fiâs. Then you will need a fast way of ï¬nding your place
in the table of xiâs, given some particular value x at which the function evaluation
is desired. This problem is not properly one of numerical analysis, but it occurs so
often in practice that it would be negligent of us to ignore it.
Formally, the problem is this: Given an array of abscissas xx[j], j=1, 2, . . .,n,
with the elements either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing, and
given a number x, ï¬nd an integer j such that x lies between xx[j] and xx[j+1].
For this task, let us deï¬ne ï¬ctitious array elements xx[0] and xx[n+1] equal to
plus or minus inï¬nity (in whichever order is consistent with the monotonicity of the
table). Then j will always be between 0 and n, inclusive; a value of 0 indicates
âoff-scaleâ at one end of the table, n indicates off-scale at the other end.
In most cases, when all is said and done, it is hard to do better than bisection,
which will ï¬nd the right place in the table in about log2n tries. We already did use
bisection in the spline evaluation routine splint of the preceding section, so you
might glance back at that. Standing by itself, a bisection routine looks like this:
void locate(float xx[], unsigned long n, float x, unsigned long *j)
Given an array xx[1..n], and given a value x, returns a value j such that x is between xx[j]
and xx[j+1]. xx must be monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. j=0 or j=n is returned
to indicate that x is out of range.
{
unsigned long ju,jm,jl;
int ascnd;
jl=0;
Initialize lower
ju=n+1;
and upper limits.
ascnd=(xx[n] >= xx[1]);
while (ju-jl > 1) {
If we are not yet done,
jm=(ju+jl) >> 1;
compute a midpoint,
if (x >= xx[jm] == ascnd)
jl=jm;
and replace either the lower limit
else
ju=jm;
or the upper limit, as appropriate.
}
Repeat until the test condition is satisï¬ed.
if (x == xx[1]) *j=1;
Then set the output
else if(x == xx[n]) *j=n-1;
else *j=jl;
}
and return.
A unit-offset array xx is assumed. To use locate with a zero-offset array,
remember to subtract 1 from the address of xx, and also from the returned value j.
Search with Correlated Values
Sometimes you will be in the situation of searching a large table many times,
and with nearly identical abscissas on consecutive searches.
For example, you
may be generating a function that is used on the right-hand side of a differential
equation: Most differential-equation integrators, as we shall see in Chapter 16, call

3.4 How to Search an Ordered Table
Suppose that you have decided to use some particular interpolation scheme,
such as fourth-order polynomial interpolation, to compute a function f(x) from a
set of tabulated xiâs and fiâs. Then you will need a fast way of ï¬nding your place
in the table of xiâs, given some particular value x at which the function evaluation
is desired. This problem is not properly one of numerical analysis, but it occurs so
often in practice that it would be negligent of us to ignore it.
Formally, the problem is this: Given an array of abscissas xx[j], j=1, 2, . . .,n,
with the elements either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing, and
given a number x, ï¬nd an integer j such that x lies between xx[j] and xx[j+1].
For this task, let us deï¬ne ï¬ctitious array elements xx[0] and xx[n+1] equal to
plus or minus inï¬nity (in whichever order is consistent with the monotonicity of the
table). Then j will always be between 0 and n, inclusive; a value of 0 indicates
âoff-scaleâ at one end of the table, n indicates off-scale at the other end.
In most cases, when all is said and done, it is hard to do better than bisection,
which will ï¬nd the right place in the table in about log2n tries. We already did use
bisection in the spline evaluation routine splint of the preceding section, so you
might glance back at that. Standing by itself, a bisection routine looks like this:
void locate(float xx[], unsigned long n, float x, unsigned long *j)
Given an array xx[1..n], and given a value x, returns a value j such that x is between xx[j]
and xx[j+1]. xx must be monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. j=0 or j=n is returned
to indicate that x is out of range.
{
unsigned long ju,jm,jl;
int ascnd;
jl=0;
Initialize lower
ju=n+1;
and upper limits.
ascnd=(xx[n] >= xx[1]);
while (ju-jl > 1) {
If we are not yet done,
jm=(ju+jl) >> 1;
compute a midpoint,
if (x >= xx[jm] == ascnd)
jl=jm;
and replace either the lower limit
else
ju=jm;
or the upper limit, as appropriate.
}
Repeat until the test condition is satisï¬ed.
if (x == xx[1]) *j=1;
Then set the output
else if(x == xx[n]) *j=n-1;
else *j=jl;
}
and return.
A unit-offset array xx is assumed. To use locate with a zero-offset array,
remember to subtract 1 from the address of xx, and also from the returned value j.
Search with Correlated Values
Sometimes you will be in the situation of searching a large table many times,
and with nearly identical abscissas on consecutive searches.
For example, you
may be generating a function that is used on the right-hand side of a differential
equation: Most differential-equation integrators, as we shall see in Chapter 16, call

Figure 3.4.1.
(a) The routine locate ï¬nds a table entry by bisection. Shown here is the sequence
of steps that converge to element 51 in a table of length 64. (b) The routine hunt searches from a
previous known position in the table by increasing steps, then converges by bisection. Shown here is a
particularly unfavorable example, converging to element 32 from element 7. A favorable example would
be convergence to an element near 7, such as 9, which would require just three âhops.â
for right-hand side evaluations at points that hop back and forth a bit, but whose
trend moves slowly in the direction of the integration.
In such cases it is wasteful to do a full bisection, ab initio, on each call. The
following routine instead starts with a guessed position in the table. It ï¬rst âhunts,â
either up or down, in increments of 1, then 2, then 4, etc., until the desired value is
bracketed. Second, it then bisects in the bracketed interval. At worst, this routine is
about a factor of 2 slower than locate above (if the hunt phase expands to include
the whole table). At best, it can be a factor of log2n faster than locate, if the desired
point is usually quite close to the input guess. Figure 3.4.1 compares the two routines.
void hunt(float xx[], unsigned long n, float x, unsigned long *jlo)
Given an array xx[1..n], and given a value x, returns a value jlo such that x is between
xx[jlo] and xx[jlo+1]. xx[1..n] must be monotonic, either increasing or decreasing.
jlo=0 or jlo=n is returned to indicate that x is out of range. jlo on input is taken as the
initial guess for jlo on output.

} else {
inc=1;
Set the hunting increment.
if (x >= xx[*jlo] == ascnd) {
Hunt up:
if (*jlo == n) return;
jhi=(*jlo)+1;
while (x >= xx[jhi] == ascnd) {
Not done hunting,
*jlo=jhi;
inc += inc;
so double the increment
jhi=(*jlo)+inc;
if (jhi > n) {
Done hunting, since oï¬end of table.
jhi=n+1;
break;
}
Try again.

else
jhi=jm;
}
if (x == xx[n]) *jlo=n-1;
if (x == xx[1]) *jlo=1;
}
If your array xx is zero-offset, read the comment following locate, above.
After the Hunt
The problem: Routines locate and hunt return an index j such that your
desired value lies between table entries xx[j] and xx[j+1], where xx[1..n] is the
full length of the table. But, to obtain an m-point interpolated value using a routine
like polint (Â§3.1) or ratint (Â§3.2), you need to supply much shorter xx and yy
arrays, of length m. How do you make the connection?
The solution: Calculate
k = IMIN(IMAX(j-(m-1)/2,1),n+1-m)
(The macros IMIN and IMAX give the minimum and maximum of two integer
arguments; see Â§1.2 and Appendix B.) This expression produces the index of the
leftmost member of an m-point set of points centered (insofar as possible) between
j and j+1, but bounded by 1 at the left and n at the right. C then lets you call the
interpolation routine with array addresses offset by k, e.g.,
polint(&xx[k-1],&yy[k-1],m,. . . )

3.5 Coefï¬cients of the Interpolating Polynomial
Occasionally you may wish to knownot the value of the interpolating polynomial
that passes through a (small!) number of points, but the coefï¬cients of that poly-
nomial.
A valid use of the coefï¬cients might be, for example, to compute
simultaneous interpolated values of the function and of several of its derivatives (see
Â§5.3), or to convolve a segment of the tabulated function with some other function,
where the moments of that other function (i.e., its convolution with powers of x)
are known analytically.
However, please be certain that the coefï¬cients are what youneed. Generally the
coefï¬cients of the interpolating polynomial can be determined much less accurately
than its value at a desired abscissa. Therefore it is not a good idea to determine the
coefï¬cients only for use in calculating interpolating values. Values thus calculated
will not pass exactly through the tabulated points, for example, while values
computed by the routines in Â§3.1âÂ§3.3 will pass exactly through such points.
Also, you should not mistake the interpolating polynomial (and its coefï¬cients)
for its cousin, the best ï¬t polynomial through a data set.
Fitting is a smoothing
process, since the number of ï¬tted coefï¬cients is typically much less than the
number of data points. Therefore, ï¬tted coefï¬cients can be accurately and stably
determined even in the presence of statistical errors in the tabulated values. (See
Â§14.8.) Interpolation, where the number of coefï¬cients and number of tabulated
pointsare equal, takes the tabulated values as perfect. If they in fact contain statistical
errors, these can be magniï¬ed into oscillations of the interpolating polynomial in
between the tabulated points.
As before, we take the tabulated points to be yi â¡y(xi). If the interpolating
polynomial is written as
y = c0 + c1x + c2x2 + Â· Â· Â· + cNxN
(3.5.1)
then the ciâs are required to satisfy the linear equation

This is a Vandermonde matrix, as described in Â§2.8. One could in principle solve

the special method that was derived in Â§2.8 is more efï¬cient by a large factor, of
order N, so it is much better.
Remember that Vandermonde systems can be quite ill-conditioned. In such a
case, no numerical method is going to give a very accurate answer. Such cases do
not, please note, imply any difï¬culty in ï¬nding interpolated values by the methods
of Â§3.1, but only difï¬culty in ï¬nding coefï¬cients.
Like the routine in Â§2.8, the following is due to G.B. Rybicki. Note that the

Another Method
Another technique is to make use of the function value interpolation routine
already given (polint Â§3.1). If we interpolate (or extrapolate) to ï¬nd the value of
the interpolating polynomial at x = 0, then this value will evidently be c0. Now
we can subtract c0 from the yiâs and divide each by its corresponding xi. Throwing
out one point (the one with smallest xi is a good candidate), we can repeat the
procedure to ï¬nd c1, and so on.
It is not instantly obvious that this procedure is stable, but we have generally
found it to be somewhat more stable than the routine immediately preceding. This
method is of order N 3, while the preceding one was of order N 2.
You will
ï¬nd, however, that neither works very well for large N, because of the intrinsic
ill-condition of the Vandermonde problem. In single precision, N up to 8 or 10 is
satisfactory; about double this in double precision.

}
If the point x = 0 is not in (or at least close to) the range of the tabulated xiâs,
then the coefï¬cients of the interpolating polynomial will in general become very large.
However, the real âinformation contentâ of the coefï¬cients is in small differences
from the âtranslation-inducedâ large values. This is one cause of ill-conditioning,
resulting in loss of signiï¬cance and poorly determined coefï¬cients.
You should
consider redeï¬ning the origin of the problem, to put x = 0 in a sensible place.
Another pathology is that, if too high a degree of interpolation is attempted on
a smooth function, the interpolating polynomial will attempt to use its high-degree
coefï¬cients, in combinationswithlarge and almost precisely canceling combinations,
to match the tabulated values down to the last possible epsilon of accuracy. This
effect is the same as the intrinsic tendency of the interpolating polynomial values to
oscillate (wildly) between its constrained points, and would be present even if the
machineâs ï¬oating precision were inï¬nitely good. The above routines polcoe and
polcof have slightly different sensitivities to the pathologies that can occur.
Are you still quite certain that using the coefï¬cients is a good idea?

3.6 Interpolation in Two or More Dimensions
In multidimensional interpolation, we seek an estimate of y(x1, x2, . . ., xn)
from an n-dimensional grid of tabulated values y and n one-dimensional vec-
tors giving the tabulated values of each of the independent variables x1, x2, . . .,
xn. We will not here consider the problem of interpolating on a mesh that is not
Cartesian, i.e., has tabulated function values at ârandomâ points in n-dimensional
space rather than at the vertices of a rectangular array. For clarity, we will consider
explicitly only the case of two dimensions, the cases of three or more dimensions
being analogous in every way.
In two dimensions, we imagine that we are given a matrix of functional values
ya[1..m][1..n]. We are also given an array x1a[1..m], and an array x2a[1..n].
The relation of these input quantities to an underlying function y(x1, x2) is
ya[j][k] = y(x1a[j], x2a[k])
(3.6.1)
We want to estimate, by interpolation, the function y at some untabulated point
(x1, x2).
An important concept is that of the grid square in which the point (x1, x2)
falls, that is, the four tabulated points that surround the desired interior point. For
convenience, we will number these points from 1 to 4, counterclockwise starting
from the lower left (see Figure 3.6.1). More precisely, if
x1a[j] â¤x1 â¤x1a[j+1]
x2a[k] â¤x2 â¤x2a[k+1]
(3.6.2)
deï¬nes j and k, then
y1 â¡ya[j][k]
y2 â¡ya[j+1][k]
y3 â¡ya[j+1][k+1]
y4 â¡ya[j][k+1]
(3.6.3)
The simplest interpolation in two dimensions is bilinear interpolation on the
grid square.
Its formulas are:
t â¡(x1 âx1a[j])/(x1a[j+1] âx1a[j])

3.6 Interpolation in Two or More Dimensions
In multidimensional interpolation, we seek an estimate of y(x1, x2, . . ., xn)
from an n-dimensional grid of tabulated values y and n one-dimensional vec-
tors giving the tabulated values of each of the independent variables x1, x2, . . .,
xn. We will not here consider the problem of interpolating on a mesh that is not
Cartesian, i.e., has tabulated function values at ârandomâ points in n-dimensional
space rather than at the vertices of a rectangular array. For clarity, we will consider
explicitly only the case of two dimensions, the cases of three or more dimensions
being analogous in every way.
In two dimensions, we imagine that we are given a matrix of functional values
ya[1..m][1..n]. We are also given an array x1a[1..m], and an array x2a[1..n].
The relation of these input quantities to an underlying function y(x1, x2) is
ya[j][k] = y(x1a[j], x2a[k])
(3.6.1)
We want to estimate, by interpolation, the function y at some untabulated point
(x1, x2).
An important concept is that of the grid square in which the point (x1, x2)
falls, that is, the four tabulated points that surround the desired interior point. For
convenience, we will number these points from 1 to 4, counterclockwise starting
from the lower left (see Figure 3.6.1). More precisely, if
x1a[j] â¤x1 â¤x1a[j+1]
x2a[k] â¤x2 â¤x2a[k+1]
(3.6.2)
deï¬nes j and k, then
y1 â¡ya[j][k]
y2 â¡ya[j+1][k]
y3 â¡ya[j+1][k+1]
y4 â¡ya[j][k+1]
(3.6.3)
The simplest interpolation in two dimensions is bilinear interpolation on the
grid square.
Its formulas are:
t â¡(x1 âx1a[j])/(x1a[j+1] âx1a[j])
u â¡(x2 âx2a[k])/(x2a[k+1] âx2a[k])
(3.6.4)
(so that t and u each lie between 0 and 1), and
y(x1, x2) = (1 ât)(1 âu)y1 + t(1 âu)y2 + tuy3 + (1 ât)uy4
(3.6.5)
Bilinear interpolation is frequently âclose enough for government work.â As
the interpolating point wanders from grid square to grid square, the interpolated

function value changes continuously.
However, the gradient of the interpolated
function changes discontinuously at the boundaries of each grid square.
There are two distinctly different directions that one can take in going beyond
bilinear interpolation to higher-order methods: One can use higher order to obtain
increased accuracy for the interpolated function (for sufï¬ciently smooth functions!),
without necessarily trying to ï¬x up the continuity of the gradient and higher
derivatives. Or, one can make use of higher order to enforce smoothness of some of
these derivatives as the interpolating point crosses grid-square boundaries. We will
now consider each of these two directions in turn.
Higher Order for Accuracy
The basic idea is to break up the problem into a succession of one-dimensional
interpolations. If we want to do m-1 order interpolation in the x1 direction, and n-1
order in the x2 direction, we ï¬rst locate an m Ã n sub-block of the tabulated function
matrix that contains our desired point (x1, x2).
We then do m one-dimensional
interpolations in the x2 direction, i.e., on the rows of the sub-block, to get function
values at the points (x1a[j], x2), j = 1, . . ., m. Finally, we do a last interpolation
in the x1 direction to get the answer. If we use the polynomial interpolation routine
polint of Â§3.1, and a sub-block which is presumed to be already located (and
addressed through the pointer float **ya, see Â§1.2), the procedure looks like this:
#include "nrutil.h"
void polin2(float x1a[], float x2a[], float **ya, int m, int n, float x1,
float x2, float *y, float *dy)
Given arrays x1a[1..m] and x2a[1..n] of independent variables, and a submatrix of function
values ya[1..m][1..n], tabulated at the grid points deï¬ned by x1a and x2a; and given values
x1 and x2 of the independent variables; this routine returns an interpolated function value y,
and an accuracy indication dy (based only on the interpolation in the x1 direction, however).

Higher Order for Smoothness: Bicubic Interpolation
We will give two methods that are in common use, and which are themselves
not unrelated. The ï¬rst is usually called bicubic interpolation.
Bicubic interpolation requires the user to specify at each grid point not just
the function y(x1, x2), but also the gradients ây/âx1 â¡y,1, ây/âx2 â¡y,2 and
the cross derivative â2y/âx1âx2 â¡y,12.
Then an interpolating function that is
cubic in the scaled coordinates t and u (equation 3.6.4) can be found, with the
following properties: (i) The values of the function and the speciï¬ed derivatives
are reproduced exactly on the grid points, and (ii) the values of the function and
the speciï¬ed derivatives change continuously as the interpolating point crosses from
one grid square to another.
It is important tounderstandthat nothinginthe equations of bicubic interpolation
requires you to specify the extra derivatives correctly! The smoothness properties are
tautologically âforced,â and have nothing to do with the âaccuracyâ of the speciï¬ed
derivatives. It is a separate problem for you to decide how to obtain the values that
are speciï¬ed. The better you do, the more accurate the interpolation will be. But
it will be smooth no matter what you do.
Best of all is to know the derivatives analytically, or to be able to compute them
accurately by numerical means, at the grid points. Next best is to determine them by
numerical differencing from the functional values already tabulated on the grid. The
relevant code would be something like this (using centered differencing):
y1a[j][k]=(ya[j+1][k]-ya[j-1][k])/(x1a[j+1]-x1a[j-1]);
y2a[j][k]=(ya[j][k+1]-ya[j][k-1])/(x2a[k+1]-x2a[k-1]);
y12a[j][k]=(ya[j+1][k+1]-ya[j+1][k-1]-ya[j-1][k+1]+ya[j-1][k-1])
/((x1a[j+1]-x1a[j-1])*(x2a[k+1]-x2a[k-1]));
To do a bicubic interpolation within a grid square, given the function y and the
derivatives y1, y2, y12 at each of the four corners of the square, there are two steps:
First obtain the sixteen quantities cij, i, j = 1, . . ., 4 using the routine bcucof
below. (The formulas that obtain the câs from the function and derivative values
are just a complicated linear transformation, with coefï¬cients which, having been
determined once in the mists of numerical history, can be tabulated and forgotten.)
Next, substitute the câs into any or all of the following bicubic formulas for function
and derivatives, as desired:

The implementationof equation (3.6.6), which performs a bicubic interpolation,
gives back the interpolated function value and the two gradient values, and uses the
above routine bcucof, is simply:
#include "nrutil.h"
void bcuint(float y[], float y1[], float y2[], float y12[], float x1l,
float x1u, float x2l, float x2u, float x1, float x2, float *ansy,
float *ansy1, float *ansy2)
Bicubic interpolation within a grid square. Input quantities are y,y1,y2,y12 (as described in
bcucof); x1l and x1u, the lower and upper coordinates of the grid square in the 1-direction;
x2l and x2u likewise for the 2-direction; and x1,x2, the coordinates of the desired point for
the interpolation. The interpolated function value is returned as ansy, and the interpolated
gradient values as ansy1 and ansy2. This routine calls bcucof.

Higher Order for Smoothness: Bicubic Spline
The other common technique for obtaining smoothness in two-dimensional
interpolation is the bicubic spline.
Actually, this is equivalent to a special case
of bicubic interpolation: The interpolating function is of the same functional form
as equation (3.6.6); the values of the derivatives at the grid points are, however,
determined âgloballyâ by one-dimensional splines. However, bicubic splines are
usually implemented in a form that looks rather different from the above bicubic
interpolation routines, instead looking much closer in form to the routine polin2
above: To interpolate one functional value, one performs m one-dimensional splines
across the rows of the table, followed by one additional one-dimensional spline
down the newly created column. It is a matter of taste (and trade-off between time
and memory) as to how much of this process one wants to precompute and store.
Instead of precomputing and storing all the derivative information (as in bicubic
interpolation), spline users typically precompute and store only one auxiliary table,
of second derivatives in one direction only. Then one need only do spline evaluations
(not constructions) for the m row splines; one must still do a construction and an

evaluation for the ï¬nal column spline. (Recall that a spline construction is a process
of order N, while a spline evaluation is only of order log N â and that is just to
ï¬nd the place in the table!)
Here is a routine to precompute the auxiliary second-derivative table:
void splie2(float x1a[], float x2a[], float **ya, int m, int n, float **y2a)
Given an m by n tabulated function ya[1..m][1..n], and tabulated independent variables
x2a[1..n], this routine constructs one-dimensional natural cubic splines of the rows of ya
and returns the second-derivatives in the array y2a[1..m][1..n]. (The array x1a[1..m] is
included in the argument list merely for consistency with routine splin2.)
{
void spline(float x[], float y[], int n, float yp1, float ypn, float y2[]);
int j;
for (j=1;j<=m;j++)
spline(x2a,ya[j],n,1.0e30,1.0e30,y2a[j]);
Values 1Ã1030 signal a nat-
ural spline.
}
(If you want to interpolate on a sub-block of a bigger matrix, see Â§1.2.)
After the above routine has been executed once, any number of bicubic spline
interpolations can be performed by successive calls of the following routine:
#include "nrutil.h"
void splin2(float x1a[], float x2a[], float **ya, float **y2a, int m, int n,
float x1, float x2, float *y)
Given x1a, x2a, ya, m, n as described in splie2 and y2a as produced by that routine; and
given a desired interpolating point x1,x2; this routine returns an interpolated function value y
by bicubic spline interpolation.
{
void spline(float x[], float y[], int n, float yp1, float ypn, float y2[]);
void splint(float xa[], float ya[], float y2a[], int n, float x, float *y);
int j;
float *ytmp,*yytmp;
ytmp=vector(1,m);
yytmp=vector(1,m);
Perform m evaluations of the row splines constructed by
splie2, using the one-dimensional spline evaluator
splint.
for (j=1;j<=m;j++)
splint(x2a,ya[j],y2a[j],n,x2,&yytmp[j]);
spline(x1a,yytmp,m,1.0e30,1.0e30,ytmp);
Construct the one-dimensional col-
umn spline and evaluate it.

Chapter 4.
Integration of Functions
4.0 Introduction
Numerical integration, which is also called quadrature, has a history extending
back to the invention of calculus and before. The fact that integrals of elementary
functions could not, in general, be computed analytically, while derivatives could
be, served to give the ï¬eld a certain panache, and to set it a cut above the arithmetic
drudgery of numerical analysis during the whole of the 18th and 19th centuries.
With the invention of automatic computing, quadrature became just one numer-
ical task among many, and not a very interesting one at that. Automatic computing,
even the most primitivesort involvingdesk calculators and rooms full of âcomputersâ
(that were, until the 1950s, people rather than machines), opened to feasibility the
much richer ï¬eld of numerical integration of differential equations. Quadrature is
merely the simplest special case: The evaluation of the integral
I =
Z b
a
f(x)dx
(4.0.1)
is precisely equivalent to solving for the value I â¡y(b) the differential equation
dy
dx = f(x)
(4.0.2)
with the boundary condition
y(a) = 0
(4.0.3)
Chapter 16 of this book deals with the numerical integration of differential
equations. In that chapter, much emphasis is given to the concept of âvariableâ or
âadaptiveâ choices of stepsize. We will not, therefore, develop that material here.
If the function that you propose to integrate is sharply concentrated in one or more
peaks, or if its shape is not readily characterized by a single length-scale, then it
is likely that you should cast the problem in the form of (4.0.2)â(4.0.3) and use
the methods of Chapter 16.
The quadrature methods in this chapter are based, in one way or another, on the
obvious device of adding up the value of the integrand at a sequence of abscissas
within the range of integration. The game is to obtain the integral as accurately
as possible with the smallest number of function evaluations of the integrand. Just
as in the case of interpolation (Chapter 3), one has the freedom to choose methods

of various orders, with higher order sometimes, but not always, giving higher
accuracy. âRomberg integration,â which is discussed in Â§4.3, is a general formalism
for making use of integration methods of a variety of different orders, and we
recommend it highly.

midpoint rule,â equation 4.1.19, see Â§4.2), the classical formulas are almost entirely
useless. They are museum pieces, but beautiful ones.
Some notation: We have a sequence of abscissas, denoted x0, x1, . . ., xN,
xN+1 which are spaced apart by a constant step h,
xi = x0 + ih
i = 0, 1, . . ., N + 1
(4.1.1)
A function f(x) has known values at the xiâs,
f(xi) â¡fi
(4.1.2)
We want to integrate the function f(x) between a lower limit a and an upper limit
b, where a and b are each equal to one or the other of the xiâs. An integration
formula that uses the value of the function at the endpoints, f(a) or f(b), is called
a closed formula. Occasionally, we want to integrate a function whose value at one
or both endpoints is difï¬cult to compute (e.g., the computation of f goes to a limit
of zero over zero there, or worse yet has an integrable singularity there). In this
case we want an open formula, which estimates the integral using only xiâs strictly
between a and b (see Figure 4.1.1).
The basic building blocks of the classical formulas are rules for integrating a
function over a small number of intervals. As that number increases, we can ï¬nd
rules that are exact for polynomials of increasingly high order. (Keep in mind that
higher order does not always imply higher accuracy in real cases.) A sequence of
such closed formulas is now given.

of the functionâs second derivative somewhere in the interval of integration. The
coefï¬cient is knowable, and it can be found in all the standard references on this
subject. The point at which the second derivative is to be evaluated is, however,
unknowable. If we knew it, we could evaluate the function there and have a higher-
order method! Since the product of a knowable and an unknowable is unknowable,
we will streamline our formulas and write only O( ), instead of the coefï¬cient.
Equation (4.1.3) is a two-point formula (x1 and x2). It is exact for polynomials
up to and including degree 1, i.e., f(x) = x.
One anticipates that there is a
three-point formula exact up to polynomials of degree 2. This is true; moreover, by a
cancellation of coefï¬cients due to left-right symmetry of the formula, the three-point
formula is exact for polynomials up to and including degree 3, i.e., f(x) = x3:

(4.1.4)
Here f(4) means the fourth derivative of the function f evaluated at an unknown
place in the interval. Note also that the formula gives the integral over an interval
of size 2h, so the coefï¬cients add up to 2.
There is no lucky cancellation in the four-point formula, so it is also exact for
polynomials up to and including degree 3.

Notice that the integral from a = x0 to b = x5 is estimated, using only the interior
points x1, x2, x3, x4. In our opinion, formulas of this type are not useful for the
reasons that (i) they cannot usefully be strung together to get âextendedâ rules, as we
are about to do with the closed formulas, and (ii) for all other possible uses they are
dominated by the Gaussian integration formulas which we will introduce in Â§4.5.
Instead of the Newton-Cotes open formulas, let us set out the formulas for
estimating the integral in the single interval from x0 to x1, using values of the
function f at x1, x2, . . .. These will be useful building blocks for the âextendedâ
open formulas.

24f4

+ O(h5f(4))(4.1.10)
Perhaps a word here would be in order about how formulas like the above can
be derived. There are elegant ways, but the most straightforwardis to write down the
basic form of the formula, replacing the numerical coefï¬cients with unknowns, say
p, q, r, s. Without loss of generality take x0 = 0 and x1 = 1, so h = 1. Substitute in
turn for f(x) (and for f1, f2, f3, f4) the functions f(x) = 1, f(x) = x, f(x) = x2,
and f(x) = x3. Doing the integral in each case reduces the left-hand side to a
number, and the right-hand side to a linear equation for the unknowns p, q, r, s.
Solving the four equations produced in this way gives the coefï¬cients.
Extended Formulas (Closed)
If we use equation (4.1.3) N â1 times, to do the integration in the intervals
(x1, x2), (x2, x3), . . ., (xNâ1, xN), and then add the results,we obtain an âextendedâ
or âcompositeâ formula for the integral from x1 to xN.

(4.1.11)
Here we have written the error estimate in terms of the interval b âa and the number
of points N instead of in terms of h. This is clearer, since one is usually holding
a and b ï¬xed and wanting to know (e.g.) how much the error will be decreased

by taking twice as many steps (in this case, it is by a factor of 4). In subsequent
equations we will show only the scaling of the error term with the number of steps.
For reasons that will not become clear until Â§4.2, equation (4.1.11) is in fact
the most important equation in this section, the basis for most practical quadrature
schemes.
The extended formula of order 1/N 3 is:

(4.1.12)
(We will see in a moment where this comes from.)
If we apply equation (4.1.4) to successive, nonoverlapping pairs of intervals,
we get the extended Simpsonâs rule:

Notice that the 2/3, 4/3 alternation continues throughout the interior of the evalu-
ation. Many people believe that the wobbling alternation somehow contains deep
information about the integral of their function that is not apparent to mortal eyes.
In fact, the alternation is an artifact of using the building block (4.1.4). Another
extended formula with the same order as Simpsonâs rule is

(4.1.14)
This equation is constructed by ï¬tting cubic polynomials through successive groups
of four points; we defer details to Â§18.3, where a similar technique is used in the
solution of integral equations. We can, however, tell you where equation (4.1.12)
came from.
It is Simpsonâs extended rule, averaged with a modiï¬ed version of
itself in which the ï¬rst and last step are done with the trapezoidal rule (4.1.3). The
trapezoidal step is two orders lower than Simpsonâs rule; however, its contribution
to the integral goes down as an additional power of N (since it is used only twice,
not N times). This makes the resulting formula of degree one less than Simpson.

Extended Formulas (Open and Semi-open)
We can construct open and semi-open extended formulas by adding the closed
formulas (4.1.11)â(4.1.14), evaluated for the second and subsequent steps, to the
extrapolative open formulas for the ï¬rst step, (4.1.7)â(4.1.10).
As discussed
immediately above, it is consistent to use an end step that is of one order lower
than the (repeated) interior step.
The resulting formulas for an interval open at
both ends are as follows:

The interior points alternate 4/3 and 2/3. If we want to avoid this alternation,
we can combine equations (4.1.9) and (4.1.14), giving

We should mention in passing another extended open formula, for use where
the limits of integration are located halfway between tabulated abscissas. This one is
known as the extended midpoint rule, and is accurate to the same order as (4.1.15):

evaluate the integrand only at those new points necessary to reï¬ne the grid. The bottom line shows the
totality of function evaluations after the fourth call. The routine qsimp, by weighting the intermediate
results, transforms the trapezoid rule into Simpsonâs rule with essentially no additional overhead.
There are also formulas of higher order for this situation, but we will refrain from
giving them.
The semi-open formulas are just the obvious combinations of equations (4.1.11)â
(4.1.14) with (4.1.15)â(4.1.18), respectively. At the closed end of the integration,
use the weights from the former equations; at the open end use the weights from
the latter equations. One example should give the idea, the formula with error term
decreasing as 1/N 3 which is closed on the right and open on the left:

4.2 Elementary Algorithms
Our starting point is equation (4.1.11), the extended trapezoidal rule. There are
two facts about the trapezoidal rule which make it the starting point for a variety of
algorithms. One fact is rather obvious, while the second is rather âdeep.â
The obvious fact is that, for a ï¬xed function f(x) to be integrated between ï¬xed
limits a and b, one can double the number of intervals in the extended trapezoidal
rule without losing the beneï¬t of previous work. The coarsest implementation of
the trapezoidal rule is to average the function at its endpoints a and b. The ï¬rst
stage of reï¬nement is to add to this average the value of the function at the halfway
point. The second stage of reï¬nement is to add the values at the 1/4 and 3/4 points.
And so on (see Figure 4.2.1).
Without further ado we can write a routine with this kind of logic to it:

evaluate the integrand only at those new points necessary to reï¬ne the grid. The bottom line shows the
totality of function evaluations after the fourth call. The routine qsimp, by weighting the intermediate
results, transforms the trapezoid rule into Simpsonâs rule with essentially no additional overhead.
There are also formulas of higher order for this situation, but we will refrain from

The semi-open formulas are just the obvious combinations of equations (4.1.11)â

use the weights from the former equations; at the open end use the weights from
the latter equations. One example should give the idea, the formula with error term

4.2 Elementary Algorithms
Our starting point is equation (4.1.11), the extended trapezoidal rule. There are
two facts about the trapezoidal rule which make it the starting point for a variety of
algorithms. One fact is rather obvious, while the second is rather âdeep.â
The obvious fact is that, for a ï¬xed function f(x) to be integrated between ï¬xed
limits a and b, one can double the number of intervals in the extended trapezoidal
rule without losing the beneï¬t of previous work. The coarsest implementation of
the trapezoidal rule is to average the function at its endpoints a and b. The ï¬rst
stage of reï¬nement is to add to this average the value of the function at the halfway
point. The second stage of reï¬nement is to add the values at the 1/4 and 3/4 points.
And so on (see Figure 4.2.1).
Without further ado we can write a routine with this kind of logic to it:

#define FUNC(x) ((*func)(x))
float trapzd(float (*func)(float), float a, float b, int n)
This routine computes the nth stage of reï¬nement of an extended trapezoidal rule. func is input
as a pointer to the function to be integrated between limits a and b, also input. When called with
n=1, the routine returns the crudest estimate of R b
a f(x)dx. Subsequent calls with n=2,3,...
(in that sequential order) will improve the accuracy by adding 2n-2 additional interior points.
{
float x,tnm,sum,del;
static float s;
int it,j;
if (n == 1) {
return (s=0.5*(b-a)*(FUNC(a)+FUNC(b)));
} else {
for (it=1,j=1;j<n-1;j++) it <<= 1;
tnm=it;
del=(b-a)/tnm;
This is the spacing of the points to be added.
x=a+0.5*del;
for (sum=0.0,j=1;j<=it;j++,x+=del) sum += FUNC(x);
s=0.5*(s+(b-a)*sum/tnm);
This replaces s by its reï¬ned value.
return s;
}
}
The above routine (trapzd) is a workhorse that can be harnessed in several
ways. The simplest and crudest is to integrate a function by the extended trapezoidal
rule where you know in advance (we canât imagine how!) the number of steps you
want. If you want 2M + 1, you can accomplish this by the fragment
for(j=1;j<=m+1;j++) s=trapzd(func,a,b,j);
with the answer returned as s.
Much better, of course, is to reï¬ne the trapezoidal rule until some speciï¬ed
degree of accuracy has been achieved:
#include <math.h>
#define EPS 1.0e-5
#define JMAX 20
float qtrap(float (*func)(float), float a, float b)
Returns the integral of the function func from a to b. The parameters EPS can be set to the
desired fractional accuracy and JMAX so that 2 to the power JMAX-1 is the maximum allowed
number of steps. Integration is performed by the trapezoidal rule.
{
float trapzd(float (*func)(float), float a, float b, int n);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int j;
float s,olds;
olds = -1.0e30;
Any number that is unlikely to be the average of the
function at its endpoints will do here.
for (j=1;j<=JMAX;j++) {
s=trapzd(func,a,b,j);
if (j > 5)
Avoid spurious early convergence.
if (fabs(s-olds) < EPS*fabs(olds) ||
(s == 0.0 && olds == 0.0)) return s;
olds=s;
}

Unsophisticated as it is, routine qtrap is in fact a fairly robust way of doing
integrals of functions that are not very smooth. Increased sophistication will usually
translate into a higher-order method whose efï¬ciency will be greater only for
sufï¬ciently smooth integrands. qtrap is the method of choice, e.g., for an integrand
which is a function of a variable that is linearly interpolated between measured data
points. Be sure that you do not require too stringent an EPS, however: If qtrap takes
too many steps in trying to achieve your required accuracy, accumulated roundoff
errors may start increasing, and the routine may never converge.
A value 10â6
is just on the edge of trouble for most 32-bit machines; it is achievable when the
convergence is moderately rapid, but not otherwise.
We come now to the âdeepâ fact about the extended trapezoidal rule, equation
(4.1.11). It is this: The error of the approximation, which begins with a term of
order 1/N 2, is in fact entirely even when expressed in powers of 1/N. This follows
directly from the Euler-Maclaurin Summation Formula,

(4.2.3)
Equation (4.2.1) is not a convergent expansion, but rather only an asymptotic
expansion whose error when truncated at any point is always less than twice the
magnitude of the ï¬rst neglected term. The reason that it is not convergent is that
the Bernoulli numbers become very large, e.g.,
B50 = 495057205241079648212477525
66
The key point is that only even powers of h occur in the error series of (4.2.1).
This fact is not, in general, shared by the higher-order quadrature rules in Â§4.1.
For example, equation (4.1.12) has an error series beginning with O(1/N 3), but
continuing with all subsequent powers of N: 1/N 4, 1/N 5, etc.
Suppose we evaluate (4.1.11) with N steps, getting a result SN, and then again
with 2N steps, getting a result S2N. (This is done by any two consecutive calls of

trapzd.) The leading error term in the second evaluation will be 1/4 the size of the
error in the ï¬rst evaluation. Therefore the combination
S = 4
3S2N â1
3SN
(4.2.4)
will cancel out the leading order error term. But there is no error term of order
1/N 3, by (4.2.1). The surviving error is of order 1/N 4, the same as Simpsonâs rule.
In fact, it should not take long for you to see that (4.2.4) is exactly Simpsonâs rule
(4.1.13), alternating 2/3âs, 4/3âs, and all. This is the preferred method for evaluating
that rule, and we can write it as a routine exactly analogous to qtrap above:
#include <math.h>
#define EPS 1.0e-6
#define JMAX 20
float qsimp(float (*func)(float), float a, float b)
Returns the integral of the function func from a to b. The parameters EPS can be set to the
desired fractional accuracy and JMAX so that 2 to the power JMAX-1 is the maximum allowed
number of steps. Integration is performed by Simpsonâs rule.

st=trapzd(func,a,b,j);

(s == 0.0 && os == 0.0)) return s;
os=s;
ost=st;
}
nrerror("Too many steps in routine qsimp");
return 0.0;
Never get here.
}
The routine qsimp will in general be more efï¬cient than qtrap (i.e., require
fewer function evaluations) when the function to be integrated has a ï¬nite 4th
derivative (i.e., a continuous 3rd derivative). The combination of qsimp and its
necessary workhorse trapzd is a good one for light-duty work.

4.3 Romberg Integration
We can view Rombergâs method as the natural generalization of the routine
qsimp in the last section to integration schemes that are of higher order than
Simpsonâs rule. The basic idea is to use the results from k successive reï¬nements
of the extended trapezoidal rule (implemented in trapzd) to remove all terms in
the error series up to but not including O(1/N 2k). The routine qsimp is the case
of k = 2. This is one example of a very general idea that goes by the name of
Richardsonâs deferred approach to the limit: Perform some numerical algorithm for
various values of a parameter h, and then extrapolate the result to the continuum
limit h = 0.
Equation (4.2.4), which subtracts off the leading error term, is a special case of
polynomial extrapolation. In the more general Romberg case, we can use Nevilleâs
algorithm (see Â§3.1) to extrapolate the successive reï¬nements to zero stepsize.
Nevilleâs algorithm can in fact be coded very concisely withina Romberg integration
routine. For clarity of the program, however, it seems better to do the extrapolation
by function call to polint, already given in Â§3.1.
#include <math.h>
#define EPS 1.0e-6
#define JMAX 20
#define JMAXP (JMAX+1)
#define K 5
Here EPS is the fractional accuracy desired, as determined by the extrapolation error estimate;
JMAX limits the total number of steps; K is the number of points used in the extrapolation.
float qromb(float (*func)(float), float a, float b)
Returns the integral of the function func from a to b. Integration is performed by Rombergâs
method of order 2K, where, e.g., K=2 is Simpsonâs rule.
{
void polint(float xa[], float ya[], int n, float x, float *y, float *dy);
float trapzd(float (*func)(float), float a, float b, int n);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
float ss,dss;
float s[JMAXP],h[JMAXP+1];
These store the successive trapezoidal approxi-
mations and their relative stepsizes.
int j;
h[1]=1.0;
for (j=1;j<=JMAX;j++) {
s[j]=trapzd(func,a,b,j);
if (j >= K) {
polint(&h[j-K],&s[j-K],K,0.0,&ss,&dss);
if (fabs(dss) <= EPS*fabs(ss)) return ss;
}
h[j+1]=0.25*h[j];
This is a key step: The factor is 0.25 even though the stepsize is decreased by only
0.5. This makes the extrapolation a polynomial in h2 as allowed by equation (4.2.1),
not just a polynomial in h.
}
nrerror("Too many steps in routine qromb");
return 0.0;

The routine qromb, along with its required trapzd and polint, is quite

4.4 Improper Integrals
For our present purposes, an integral will be âimproperâ if it has any of the
following problems:
â¢ its integrand goes to a ï¬nite limiting value at ï¬nite upper and lower limits,
but cannot be evaluated right on one of those limits (e.g., sin x/x at x = 0)
â¢ its upper limit is â, or its lower limit is ââ
â¢ it has an integrable singularity at either limit (e.g., xâ1/2 at x = 0)
â¢ it has an integrable singularity at a known place between its upper and
lower limits
â¢ it has an integrable singularity at an unknown place between its upper
and lower limits
If an integral is inï¬nite (e.g.,
R â
1
xâ1dx), or does not exist in a limiting sense
(e.g., R â
ââcos xdx), we do not call it improper; we call it impossible. No amount of
clever algorithmics will return a meaningful answer to an ill-posed problem.
In this section we will generalize the techniques of the preceding two sections
to cover the ï¬rst four problems on the above list. A more advanced discussion of
quadrature with integrable singularities occurs in Chapter 18, notably Â§18.3. The
ï¬fth problem, singularity at unknown location, can really only be handled by the
use of a variable stepsize differential equation integration routine, as will be given
in Chapter 16.
We need a workhorse like the extended trapezoidal rule (equation 4.1.11), but
one which is an open formula in the sense of Â§4.1, i.e., does not require the integrand
to be evaluated at the endpoints. Equation (4.1.19), the extended midpoint rule, is
the best choice. The reason is that (4.1.19) shares with (4.1.11) the âdeepâ property

the best choice. The reason is that (4.1.19) shares with (4.1.11) the âdeepâ property

This equation can be derived by writing out (4.2.1) with stepsize h, then writing it
out again with stepsize h/2, then subtracting the ï¬rst from twice the second.
It is not possible to double the number of steps in the extended midpoint rule
and still have the beneï¬t of previous function evaluations (try it!). However, it is
possible to triple the number of steps and do so. Shall we do this, or double and
accept the loss? On the average, tripling does a factor
â
3 of unnecessary work,
since the ârightâ number of steps for a desired accuracy criterion may in fact fall
anywhere in the logarithmic interval implied by tripling. For doubling, the factor
is only
â
2, but we lose an extra factor of 2 in being unable to use all the previous
evaluations. Since 1.732 < 2 Ã 1.414, it is better to triple.
Here is the resulting routine, which is directly comparable to trapzd.
#define FUNC(x) ((*func)(x))
float midpnt(float (*func)(float), float a, float b, int n)
This routine computes the nth stage of reï¬nement of an extended midpoint rule. func is input
as a pointer to the function to be integrated between limits a and b, also input. When called with
n=1, the routine returns the crudest estimate of
R b
a f(x)dx. Subsequent calls with n=2,3,...
(in that sequential order) will improve the accuracy of s by adding (2/3) Ã 3n-1 additional
interior points. s should not be modiï¬ed between sequential calls.

The new sum is combined with the old integral

The routine midpnt can exactly replace trapzd in a driver routine like qtrap
(Â§4.2); one simply changes trapzd(func,a,b,j) to midpnt(func,a,b, j), and
perhaps also decreases the parameter JMAX since 3JMAXâ1 (from step tripling) is a
much larger number than 2JMAXâ1 (step doubling).
The open formula implementation analogous to Simpsonâs rule (qsimp in Â§4.2)
substitutes midpnt for trapzd and decreases JMAX as above, but now also changes
the extrapolation step to be
s=(9.0*st-ost)/8.0;
since, when the number of steps is tripled, the error decreases to 1/9th its size, not
1/4th as with step doubling.
Either the modiï¬ed qtrap or the modiï¬ed qsimp will ï¬x the ï¬rst problem
on the list at the beginning of this section. Yet more sophisticated is to generalize
Romberg integration in like manner:
#include <math.h>
#define EPS 1.0e-6
#define JMAX 14
#define JMAXP (JMAX+1)
#define K 5
float qromo(float (*func)(float), float a, float b,
float (*choose)(float(*)(float), float, float, int))
Romberg integration on an open interval. Returns the integral of the function func from a to b,
using any speciï¬ed integrating function choose and Rombergâs method. Normally choose will
be an open formula, not evaluating the function at the endpoints. It is assumed that choose
triples the number of steps on each call, and that its error series contains only even powers of
the number of steps. The routines midpnt, midinf, midsql, midsqu, midexp, are possible
choices for choose. The parameters have the same meaning as in qromb.
{
void polint(float xa[], float ya[], int n, float x, float *y, float *dy);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int j;
float ss,dss,h[JMAXP+1],s[JMAXP];
h[1]=1.0;
for (j=1;j<=JMAX;j++) {
s[j]=(*choose)(func,a,b,j);
if (j >= K) {
polint(&h[j-K],&s[j-K],K,0.0,&ss,&dss);
if (fabs(dss) <= EPS*fabs(ss)) return ss;
}
h[j+1]=h[j]/9.0;
This is where the assumption of step tripling and an even
error series is used.
}
nrerror("Too many steps in routing qromo");
return 0.0;
Never get here.
}
Donât be put off by qromoâs complicated ANSI declaration. A typical invocation
(integrating the Bessel function Y0(x) from 0 to 2) is simply

The differences between qromo and qromb (Â§4.3) are so slight that it is perhaps
gratuitous to list qromo in full. It, however, is an excellent driver routine for solving
all the other problems of improper integrals in our ï¬rst list (except the intractable
ï¬fth), as we shall now see.
The basic trick for improper integrals is to make a change of variables to
eliminate the singularity, or to map an inï¬nite range of integration to a ï¬nite one.
For example, the identity
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
Z 1/a
1/b
1
t2 f
1
t

dt
ab > 0
(4.4.2)
can be used with either b ââand a positive, or with a âââand b negative, and
works for any function which decreases towards inï¬nity faster than 1/x2.
You can make the change of variable implied by (4.4.2) either analytically and
then use (e.g.) qromo and midpnt to do the numerical evaluation, or you can let
the numerical algorithm make the change of variable for you. We prefer the latter
method as being more transparent to the user. To implement equation (4.4.2) we
simply write a modiï¬ed version of midpnt, called midinf, which allows b to be
inï¬nite (or, more precisely, a very large number on your particular machine, such
as 1 Ã 1030), or a to be negative and inï¬nite.
#define FUNC(x) ((*funk)(1.0/(x))/((x)*(x)))
Eï¬ects the change of variable.
float midinf(float (*funk)(float), float aa, float bb, int n)
This routine is an exact replacement for midpnt, i.e., returns the nth stage of reï¬nement of
the integral of funk from aa to bb, except that the function is evaluated at evenly spaced
points in 1/x rather than in x. This allows the upper limit bb to be as large and positive as
the computer allows, or the lower limit aa to be as large and negative, but not both. aa and
bb must have the same sign.
{
float x,tnm,sum,del,ddel,b,a;
static float s;
int it,j;
b=1.0/aa;
These two statements change the limits of integration.
a=1.0/bb;
if (n == 1) {
From this point on, the routine is identical to midpnt.
return (s=(b-a)*FUNC(0.5*(a+b)));
} else {
for(it=1,j=1;j<n-1;j++) it *= 3;
tnm=it;
del=(b-a)/(3.0*tnm);
ddel=del+del;
x=a+0.5*del;
sum=0.0;
for (j=1;j<=it;j++) {
sum += FUNC(x);
x += ddel;
sum += FUNC(x);
x += del;
}
return (s=(s+(b-a)*sum/tnm)/3.0);
}
}

If you need to integrate from a negative lower limit to positive inï¬nity, you do
this by breaking the integral into two pieces at some positive value, for example,
answer=qromo(funk,-5.0,2.0,midpnt)+qromo(funk,2.0,1.0e30,midinf);
Where should you choose the breakpoint? At a sufï¬ciently large positive value so
that the function funk is at least beginning to approach its asymptotic decrease to
zero value at inï¬nity. The polynomial extrapolation implicit in the second call to
qromo deals with a polynomial in 1/x, not in x.
To deal with an integral that has an integrable power-law singularity at its lower
limit, one also makes a change of variable. If the integrand diverges as (x âa)Î³,
0 â¤Î³ < 1, near x = a, use the identity
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
1
1 âÎ³
Z (bâa)1âÎ³
0
t
Î³
1âÎ³ f(t
1
1âÎ³ + a)dt
(b > a)
(4.4.3)
If the singularity is at the upper limit, use the identity
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
1
1 âÎ³
Z (bâa)1âÎ³
0
t
Î³
1âÎ³ f(b ât
1
1âÎ³ )dt
(b > a)
(4.4.4)
If there is a singularity at both limits, divide the integral at an interior breakpoint
as in the example above.
Equations (4.4.3) and (4.4.4) are particularly simple in the case of inverse
square-root singularities, a case that occurs frequently in practice:
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
Z âbâa
0
2tf(a + t2)dt
(b > a)
(4.4.5)
for a singularity at a, and
Z b
a
f(x)dx =
Z âbâa
0
2tf(b ât2)dt
(b > a)
(4.4.6)
for a singularity at b. Once again, we can implement these changes of variable
transparently to the user by deï¬ning substitute routines for midpnt which make the
change of variable automatically:
#include <math.h>
#define FUNC(x) (2.0*(x)*(*funk)(aa+(x)*(x)))
float midsql(float (*funk)(float), float aa, float bb, int n)
This routine is an exact replacement for midpnt, except that it allows for an inverse square-root
singularity in the integrand at the lower limit aa.
{
float x,tnm,sum,del,ddel,a,b;
static float s;
int it,j;
b=sqrt(bb-aa);
a=0.0;
if (n == 1) {
The rest of the routine is exactly like midpnt and is omitted.

Similarly,

a=0.0;
if (n == 1) {

One last example should sufï¬ce to show how these formulas are derived in
general. Suppose the upper limit of integration is inï¬nite, and the integrand falls off
exponentially. Then we want a change of variable that maps eâxdx into (Â±)dt (with
the sign chosen to keep the upper limit of the new variable larger than the lower
limit). Doing the integration gives by inspection
t = eâx
or
x = âlog t
(4.4.7)
so that
Z x=â
x=a
f(x)dx =
Z t=eâa
t=0
f(âlog t)dt
t
(4.4.8)
The user-transparent implementation would be
#include <math.h>
#define FUNC(x) ((*funk)(-log(x))/(x))
float midexp(float (*funk)(float), float aa, float bb, int n)
This routine is an exact replacement for midpnt, except that bb is assumed to be inï¬nite
(value passed not actually used). It is assumed that the function funk decreases exponentially
rapidly at inï¬nity.
{
float x,tnm,sum,del,ddel,a,b;
static float s;
int it,j;
b=exp(-aa);
a=0.0;
if (n == 1) {
The rest of the routine is exactly like midpnt and is omitted.

4.5 Gaussian Quadratures and Orthogonal
Polynomials
In the formulas of Â§4.1, the integral of a function was approximated by the sum
of its functional values at a set of equally spaced points, multiplied by certain aptly
chosen weighting coefï¬cients. We saw that as we allowed ourselves more freedom
in choosing the coefï¬cients, we could achieve integration formulas of higher and
higher order. The idea of Gaussian quadratures is to give ourselves the freedom to
choose not only the weighting coefï¬cients, but also the location of the abscissas at
which the function is to be evaluated: They will no longer be equally spaced. Thus,
we will have twice the number of degrees of freedom at our disposal; it will turn out
that we can achieve Gaussian quadrature formulas whose order is, essentially, twice
that of the Newton-Cotes formula with the same number of function evaluations.
Does this sound too good to be true? Well, in a sense it is. The catch is a
familiar one, which cannot be overemphasized: High order is not the same as high
accuracy. High order translates to high accuracy only when the integrand is very
smooth, in the sense of being âwell-approximated by a polynomial.â
There is, however, one additional feature of Gaussian quadrature formulas that
adds to their usefulness: We can arrange the choice of weights and abscissas to make
the integral exact for a class of integrands âpolynomials times some known function
W(x)â rather than for the usual class of integrands âpolynomials.â The function
W(x) can then be chosen to remove integrable singularitiesfrom the desired integral.
Given W(x), in other words, and given an integer N, we can ï¬nd a set of weights
wj and abscissas xj such that the approximation
Z b
a
W(x)f(x)dx â
N

j=1
wjf(xj)
(4.5.1)
is exact if f(x) is a polynomial. For example, to do the integral

dx
(4.5.2)
(not a very natural looking integral, it must be admitted), we might well be interested
in a Gaussian quadrature formula based on the choice
W(x) =
1
â
1 âx2
(4.5.3)
in the interval (â1, 1). (This particular choice is called Gauss-Chebyshev integration,
for reasons that will become clear shortly.)

Notice that the integration formula (4.5.1) can also be written with the weight
function W(x) not overtly visible: Deï¬ne g(x) â¡W(x)f(x) and vj â¡wj/W(xj).
Then (4.5.1) becomes
Z b
a
g(x)dx â
N
X
j=1
vjg(xj)
(4.5.4)
Where did the function W(x) go?
It is lurking there, ready to give high-order
accuracy to integrands of the form polynomials times W(x), and ready to deny high-
order accuracy to integrands that are otherwise perfectly smooth and well-behaved.
When you ï¬nd tabulations of the weights and abscissas for a given W(x), you have
to determine carefully whether they are to be used with a formula in the form of
(4.5.1), or like (4.5.4).
Here is an example of a quadrature routine that contains the tabulated abscissas
and weights for the case W(x) = 1 and N = 10. Since the weights and abscissas
are, in this case, symmetric around the midpoint of the range of integration, there
are actually only ï¬ve distinct values of each:
float qgaus(float (*func)(float), float a, float b)
Returns the integral of the function func between a and b, by ten-point Gauss-Legendre inte-
gration: the function is evaluated exactly ten times at interior points in the range of integration.

xm=0.5*(b+a);
xr=0.5*(b-a);
s=0;
Will be twice the average value of the function, since the
ten weights (ï¬ve numbers above each used twice)
sum to 2.
for (j=1;j<=5;j++) {
dx=xr*x[j];
s += w[j]*((*func)(xm+dx)+(*func)(xm-dx));
}
return s *= xr;
Scale the answer to the range of integration.
}
The above routine illustrates that one can use Gaussian quadratures without
necessarily understandingthe theory behind them: One just locates tabulated weights
and abscissas in a book (e.g., [1] or [2]). However, the theory is very pretty, and it
will come in handy if you ever need to construct your own tabulation of weights and
abscissas for an unusual choice of W(x). We will therefore give, without any proofs,
some useful results that will enable you to do this. Several of the results assume that
W(x) does not change sign inside (a, b), which is usually the case in practice.
The theory behind Gaussian quadratures goes back to Gauss in 1814, who
used continued fractions to develop the subject. In 1826 Jacobi rederived Gaussâs
results by means of orthogonal polynomials. The systematic treatment of arbitrary
weight functions W(x) using orthogonal polynomials is largely due to Christoffel in
1877. To introduce these orthogonal polynomials, let us ï¬x the interval of interest
to be (a, b). We can deï¬ne the âscalar product of two functions f and g over a

(4.5.5)
The scalar product is a number, not a function of x. Two functions are said to be
orthogonal if their scalar product is zero. A function is said to be normalized if its
scalar product with itself is unity. A set of functions that are all mutually orthogonal
and also all individually normalized is called an orthonormal set.
We can ï¬nd a set of polynomials (i) that includes exactly one polynomial of
order j, called pj(x), for each j = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and (ii) all of which are mutually
orthogonal over the speciï¬ed weight function W(x). A constructive procedure for
ï¬nding such a set is the recurrence relation
pâ1(x) â¡0
p0(x) â¡1
pj+1(x) = (x âaj)pj(x) âbjpjâ1(x)
j = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(4.5.6)
where
aj = â¨xpj|pjâ©
â¨pj|pjâ©
j = 0, 1, . . .
bj =
â¨pj|pjâ©
â¨pjâ1|pjâ1â©
j = 1, 2, . . .
(4.5.7)
The coefï¬cient b0 is arbitrary; we can take it to be zero.
The polynomials deï¬ned by (4.5.6) are monic, i.e., the coefï¬cient of their
leading term [xj for pj(x)] is unity.
If we divide each pj(x) by the constant
[â¨pj|pjâ©]1/2 we can render the set of polynomials orthonormal. One also encounters
orthogonal polynomials with various other normalizations. You can convert from
a given normalization to monic polynomials if you know that the coefï¬cient of
xj in pj is Î»j, say; then the monic polynomials are obtained by dividing each pj
by Î»j. Note that the coefï¬cients in the recurrence relation (4.5.6) depend on the
adopted normalization.
The polynomial pj(x) can be shown to have exactly j distinct roots in the
interval (a, b). Moreover, it can be shown that the roots of pj(x) âinterleaveâ the
j â1 roots of pjâ1(x), i.e., there is exactly one root of the former in between each
two adjacent roots of the latter. This fact comes in handy if you need to ï¬nd all the
roots: You can start with the one root of p1(x) and then, in turn, bracket the roots
of each higher j, pinning them down at each stage more precisely by Newtonâs rule
or some other root-ï¬nding scheme (see Chapter 9).
Why would you ever want to ï¬nd all the roots of an orthogonal polynomial
pj(x)? Because the abscissas of the N-point Gaussian quadrature formulas (4.5.1)
and (4.5.4) with weightingfunction W(x) in the interval (a, b) are precisely the roots
of the orthogonal polynomial pN(x) for the same interval and weighting function.
This is the fundamental theorem of Gaussian quadratures, and lets you ï¬nd the
abscissas for any particular case.

Once you know the abscissas x1, . . ., xN, you need to ï¬nd the weights wj,
j = 1, . . ., N. One way to do this (not the most efï¬cient) is to solve the set of
linear equations

(4.5.8)
Equation (4.5.8) simply solves for those weights such that the quadrature (4.5.1)
gives the correct answer for the integral of the ï¬rst N orthogonal polynomials. Note
that the zeros on the right-hand side of (4.5.8) appear because p1(x), . . ., pNâ1(x)
are all orthogonal to p0(x), which is a constant. It can be shown that, with those
weights, the integral of the next N â1 polynomials is also exact, so that the
quadrature is exact for all polynomials of degree 2N â1 or less. Another way to
evaluate the weights (though one whose proof is beyond our scope) is by the formula
wj =
â¨pNâ1|pNâ1â©
pNâ1(xj)pâ²
N(xj)
(4.5.9)
where pâ²
N(xj) is the derivative of the orthogonal polynomial at its zero xj.
The computation of Gaussian quadrature rules thus involvestwo distinct phases:
(i) the generation of the orthogonal polynomials p0, . . ., pN, i.e., the computation of
the coefï¬cients aj, bj in (4.5.6); (ii) the determination of the zeros of pN(x), and
the computation of the associated weights. For the case of the âclassicalâ orthogonal
polynomials, the coefï¬cients aj and bj are explicitly known (equations 4.5.10 â
4.5.14 below) and phase (i) can be omitted. However, if you are confronted with a
ânonclassicalâ weight function W(x), and you donât know the coefï¬cients aj and
bj, the construction of the associated set of orthogonal polynomials is not trivial.
We discuss it at the end of this section.
Computation of the Abscissas and Weights
This task can range from easy to difï¬cult, depending on how much you already
know about your weight function and its associated polynomials. In the case of
classical, well-studied, orthogonal polynomials, practically everything is known,
includinggood approximations for their zeros. These can be used as starting guesses,
enabling Newtonâs method (to be discussed in Â§9.4) to converge very rapidly.
Newtonâs method requires the derivative pâ²
N(x), which is evaluated by standard
relations in terms of pN and pNâ1. The weights are then conveniently evaluated by
equation (4.5.9). For the following named cases, this direct root-ï¬nding is faster,
by a factor of 3 to 5, than any other method.
Here are the weight functions, intervals, and recurrence relations that generate
the most commonly used orthogonal polynomials and their corresponding Gaussian
quadrature formulas.

EPS is the relative precision.
void gauleg(float x1, float x2, float x[], float w[], int n)
Given the lower and upper limits of integration x1 and x2, and given n, this routine returns

for (i=1;i<=m;i++) {
Loop over the desired roots.
z=cos(3.141592654*(i-0.25)/(n+0.5));
Starting with the above approximation to the ith root, we enter the main loop of

Next is a routine for Gauss-Hermite abscissas and weights.
If we use the
âstandardâ normalization of these functions, as given in equation (4.5.13), we ï¬nd
that the computations overï¬ow for large N because of various factorials that occur.
We can avoid this by using instead the orthonormal set of polynomials eHj. They
are generated by the recurrence

Legendre polynomials are special cases of Jacobi polynomials with Î± = Î² = 0,
but it is worth having the separate routine for them, gauleg, given above. Chebyshev
polynomials correspond to Î± = Î² = â1/2 (see Â§5.8). They have analytic abscissas
and weights:

Case of Known Recurrences
Turn now to the case where you do not know good initial guesses for the zeros of your
orthogonal polynomials, but you do have available the coefï¬cients aj and bj that generate
them.
As we have seen, the zeros of pN(x) are the abscissas for the N-point Gaussian
quadrature formula.
The most useful computational formula for the weights is equation
(4.5.9) above, since the derivative pâ²
N can be efï¬ciently computed by the derivative of (4.5.6)
in the general case, or by special relations for the classical polynomials. Note that (4.5.9) is
valid as written only for monic polynomials; for other normalizations, there is an extra factor
of Î»N/Î»Nâ1, where Î»N is the coefï¬cient of xN in pN .
Except in those special cases already discussed, the best way to ï¬nd the abscissas is not
to use a root-ï¬nding method like Newtonâs method on pN (x). Rather, it is generally faster
to use the Golub-Welsch [3] algorithm, which is based on a result of Wilf [4]. This algorithm
notes that if you bring the term xpj to the left-hand side of (4.5.6) and the term pj+1 to the
right-hand side, the recurrence relation can be written in matrix form as

pN(xj) = 0 is equivalent to xj being an eigenvalue of T. Since eigenvalues are preserved
by a similarity transformation, xj is an eigenvalue of the symmetric tridiagonal matrix J.
Moreover, Wilf [4] shows that if vj is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue xj,
normalized so that v Â· v = 1, then
wj = Âµ0v2
j,1
(4.5.27)
where
Âµ0 =
Z b

W(x) dx
(4.5.28)
and where vj,1 is the ï¬rst component of v.
As we shall see in Chapter 11, ï¬nding all
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix is a relatively efï¬cient and
well-conditioned procedure. We accordingly give a routine, gaucof, for ï¬nding the abscissas
and weights, given the coefï¬cients aj and bj. Remember that if you know the recurrence
relation for orthogonal polynomials that are not normalized to be monic, you can easily
convert it to monic form by means of the quantities Î»j.
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void gaucof(int n, float a[], float b[], float amu0, float x[], float w[])
Computes the abscissas and weights for a Gaussian quadrature formula from the Jacobi matrix.
On input, a[1..n] and b[1..n] are the coeï¬cients of the recurrence relation for the set of
monic orthogonal polynomials. The quantity Âµ0 â¡R b
a W(x) dx is input as amu0. The abscissas
x[1..n] are returned in descending order, with the corresponding weights in w[1..n]. The
arrays a and b are modiï¬ed. Execution can be speeded up by modifying tqli and eigsrt to
compute only the ï¬rst component of each eigenvector.

Orthogonal Polynomials with Nonclassical Weights
This somewhat specialized subsection will tell you what to do if your weight function
is not one of the classical ones dealt with above and you do not know the ajâs and bjâs
of the recurrence relation (4.5.6) to use in gaucof.
Then, a method of ï¬nding the ajâs
and bjâs is needed.
The procedure of Stieltjes is to compute a0 from (4.5.7), then p1(x) from (4.5.6).
Knowing p0 and p1, we can compute a1 and b1 from (4.5.7), and so on. But how are we
to compute the inner products in (4.5.7)?

The textbook approach is to represent each pj(x) explicitly as a polynomial in x and
to compute the inner products by multiplying out term by term. This will be feasible if we
know the ï¬rst 2N moments of the weight function,
Âµj =
Z b
a
xjW(x)dx
j = 0, 1, . . . , 2N â1
(4.5.29)
However, the solution of the resulting set of algebraic equations for the coefï¬cients aj and bj
in terms of the moments Âµj is in general extremely ill-conditioned. Even in double precision,
it is not unusual to lose all accuracy by the time N = 12. We thus reject any procedure
based on the moments (4.5.29).
Sack and Donovan [5] discovered that the numerical stability is greatly improved if,
instead of using powers of x as a set of basis functions to represent the pjâs, one uses some
other known set of orthogonal polynomials Ïj(x), say. Roughly speaking, the improved
stability occurs because the polynomial basis âsamplesâ the interval (a, b) better than the
power basis when the inner product integrals are evaluated, especially if its weight function
resembles W(x).
So assume that we know the modiï¬ed moments
Î½j =
Z b
a
Ïj(x)W(x)dx
j = 0, 1, . . . , 2N â1
(4.5.30)
where the Ïjâs satisfy a recurrence relation analogous to (4.5.6),
Ïâ1(x) â¡0
Ï0(x) â¡1
Ïj+1(x) = (x âÎ±j)Ïj(x) âÎ²jÏjâ1(x)
j = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(4.5.31)
and the coefï¬cients Î±j, Î²j are known explicitly. Then Wheeler [6] has given an efï¬cient
O(N 2) algorithm equivalent to that of Sack and Donovan for ï¬nding aj and bj via a set
of intermediate quantities
Ïk,l = â¨pk|Ïlâ©
k, l â¥â1
(4.5.32)
Initialize
Ïâ1,l = 0
l = 1, 2, . . . , 2N â2

l = 0, 1, . . . , 2N â1
a0 = Î±0 + Î½1
Î½0
b0 = 0
(4.5.33)
Then, for k = 1, 2, . . . , N â1, compute
Ïk,l = Ïkâ1,l+1 â(akâ1 âÎ±l)Ïkâ1,l âbkâ1Ïkâ2,l + Î²lÏkâ1,lâ1

(4.5.34)
Note that the normalization factors can also easily be computed if needed:

â¨pj|pjâ©= bj â¨pjâ1|pjâ1â©
j = 1, 2, . . .
(4.5.35)
You can ï¬nd a derivation of the above algorithm in Ref. [7].
Wheelerâs algorithm requires thatthe modiï¬ed moments (4.5.30)be accurately computed.
In practical cases there is often a closed form, or else recurrence relations can be used. The

algorithm is extremely successfulfor ï¬nite intervals (a, b). For inï¬nite intervals, the algorithm
does not completely remove the ill-conditioning. In this case, Gautschi [8,9] recommends
reducing the interval to a ï¬nite interval by a change of variable, and then using a suitable
discretization procedure to compute the inner products.
You will have to consult the
references for details.
We give the routine orthog for generating the coefï¬cients aj and bj by Wheelerâs
algorithm, given the coefï¬cients Î±j and Î²j, and the modiï¬ed moments Î½j. For consistency
with gaucof, the vectors Î±, Î², a and b are 1-based. Correspondingly, we increase the indices
of the Ï matrix by 2, i.e., sig[k,l] = Ïkâ2,lâ2.

the recurrence relation for the chosen basis of orthogonal polynomials. The modiï¬ed moments
Î½j are input in anu[1..2*n]. The ï¬rst n coeï¬cients are returned in a[1..n] and b[1..n].

As an example of the use of orthog, consider the problem [7] of generating orthogonal
polynomials with the weight function W(x) = âlog x on the interval (0, 1). A suitable set
of Ïjâs is the shifted Legendre polynomials

A call to orthog with this input allows one to generate the required polynomials to machine
accuracyfor very large N, and hencedo Gaussianquadraturewith this weight function. Before
Sack and Donovanâs observation, this seemingly simple problem was essentially intractable.
Extensions of Gaussian Quadrature
There are many different ways in which the ideas of Gaussian quadrature have
been extended. One important extension is the case of preassigned nodes: Some
points are required to be included in the set of abscissas, and the problem is to choose
the weights and the remaining abscissas to maximize the degree of exactness of the
the quadrature rule. The most common cases are Gauss-Radau quadrature, where
one of the nodes is an endpoint of the interval, either a or b, and Gauss-Lobatto
quadrature, where both a and b are nodes. Golub [10] has given an algorithm similar
to gaucof for these cases.
The second important extension is the Gauss-Kronrod formulas. For ordinary
Gaussian quadrature formulas, as N increases the sets of abscissas have no points
in common. This means that if you compare results with increasing N as a way of
estimating the quadrature error, you cannot reuse the previous function evaluations.
Kronrod [11] posed the problem of searching for optimal sequences of rules, each
of which reuses all abscissas of its predecessor. If one starts with N = m, say,
and then adds n new points, one has 2n + m free parameters: the n new abscissas
and weights, and m new weights for the ï¬xed previous abscissas. The maximum
degree of exactness one would expect to achieve would therefore be 2n + m â1.
The question is whether this maximum degree of exactness can actually be achieved
in practice, when the abscissas are required to all lie inside (a, b). The answer to
this question is not known in general.
Kronrod showed that if you choose n = m + 1, an optimal extension can
be found for Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Patterson [12] showed how to compute
continued extensions of this kind. Sequences such as N = 10, 21, 43, 87, . . . are
popular in automatic quadrature routines [13] that attempt to integrate a function until
some speciï¬ed accuracy has been achieved.

4.6 Multidimensional Integrals
Integrals of functions of several variables, over regions with dimension greater
than one, are not easy. There are two reasons for this. First, the number of function
evaluations needed to sample an N-dimensional space increases as the Nth power
of the number needed to do a one-dimensional integral. If you need 30 function
evaluations to do a one-dimensional integral crudely, then you will likely need on
the order of 30000 evaluations to reach the same crude level for a three-dimensional
integral. Second, the region of integration in N-dimensional space is deï¬ned by
an N â1 dimensional boundary which can itself be terribly complicated: It need
not be convex or simply connected, for example. By contrast, the boundary of a
one-dimensional integral consists of two numbers, its upper and lower limits.
The ï¬rst question to be asked, when faced with a multidimensional integral,
is, âcan it be reduced analytically to a lower dimensionality?â
For example,
so-called iterated integrals of a function of one variable f(t) can be reduced to
one-dimensional integrals by the formula
Z x
0
dtn
Z tn
0
dtnâ1 Â· Â· Â·
Z t3
0
dt2
Z t2
0
f(t1)dt1
=
1
(n â1)!
Z x
0
(x ât)nâ1f(t)dt
(4.6.1)
Alternatively, the function may have some special symmetry in the way it depends
on its independent variables.
If the boundary also has this symmetry, then the
dimension can be reduced. In three dimensions, for example, the integration of a
spherically symmetric function over a spherical region reduces, in polar coordinates,
to a one-dimensional integral.
The next questions to be asked will guide your choice between two entirely
different approaches to doing the problem. The questions are: Is the shape of the
boundary of the region of integration simple or complicated? Inside the region, is
the integrand smooth and simple, or complicated, or locally strongly peaked? Does

4.6 Multidimensional Integrals
Integrals of functions of several variables, over regions with dimension greater
than one, are not easy. There are two reasons for this. First, the number of function
evaluations needed to sample an N-dimensional space increases as the Nth power
of the number needed to do a one-dimensional integral. If you need 30 function
evaluations to do a one-dimensional integral crudely, then you will likely need on
the order of 30000 evaluations to reach the same crude level for a three-dimensional
integral. Second, the region of integration in N-dimensional space is deï¬ned by
an N â1 dimensional boundary which can itself be terribly complicated: It need
not be convex or simply connected, for example. By contrast, the boundary of a
one-dimensional integral consists of two numbers, its upper and lower limits.
The ï¬rst question to be asked, when faced with a multidimensional integral,
is, âcan it be reduced analytically to a lower dimensionality?â
For example,
so-called iterated integrals of a function of one variable f(t) can be reduced to
one-dimensional integrals by the formula
Z x
0
dtn
Z tn
0
dtnâ1 Â· Â· Â·
Z t3
0
dt2
Z t2
0
f(t1)dt1
=
1
(n â1)!
Z x
0
(x ât)nâ1f(t)dt
(4.6.1)
Alternatively, the function may have some special symmetry in the way it depends
on its independent variables.
If the boundary also has this symmetry, then the
dimension can be reduced. In three dimensions, for example, the integration of a
spherically symmetric function over a spherical region reduces, in polar coordinates,
to a one-dimensional integral.
The next questions to be asked will guide your choice between two entirely
different approaches to doing the problem. The questions are: Is the shape of the
boundary of the region of integration simple or complicated? Inside the region, is
the integrand smooth and simple, or complicated, or locally strongly peaked? Does

the problem require high accuracy, or does it require an answer accurate only to
a percent, or a few percent?
If your answers are that the boundary is complicated, the integrand is not
strongly peaked in very small regions, and relatively low accuracy is tolerable, then
your problem is a good candidate for Monte Carlo integration. This method is very
straightforward to program, in its cruder forms. One needs only to know a region
with simple boundaries that includes the complicated region of integration, plus a
method of determining whether a random point is inside or outside the region of
integration. Monte Carlo integration evaluates the function at a random sample of
points, and estimates its integral based on that random sample. We will discuss it in
more detail, and with more sophistication, in Chapter 7.
If the boundary is simple, and the function is very smooth, then the remaining
approaches, breaking up the problem into repeated one-dimensional integrals, or
multidimensional Gaussian quadratures, will be effective and relatively fast [1]. If
you require high accuracy, these approaches are in any case the only ones available
to you, since Monte Carlo methods are by nature asymptotically slow to converge.
For low accuracy, use repeated one-dimensional integrationor multidimensional
Gaussian quadratures when the integrand is slowly varying and smooth in the region
of integration, Monte Carlo when the integrand is oscillatory or discontinuous, but
not strongly peaked in small regions.
If the integrand is strongly peaked in small regions, and you know where those
regions are, break the integral up into several regions so that the integrand is smooth
in each, and do each separately. If you donât know where the stronglypeaked regions
are, you might as well (at the level of sophistication of this book) quit: It is hopeless
to expect an integration routine to search out unknown pockets of large contribution
in a huge N-dimensional space. (But see Â§7.8.)
If, on the basis of the above guidelines, you decide to pursue the repeated one-
dimensional integration approach, here is how it works. For deï¬niteness, we will
consider the case of a three-dimensional integral in x, y, z-space. Two dimensions,
or more than three dimensions, are entirely analogous.
The ï¬rst step is to specify the region of integration by (i) its lower and upper
limits in x, which we will denote x1 and x2; (ii) its lower and upper limits in y at a
speciï¬ed value of x, denoted y1(x) and y2(x); and (iii) its lower and upper limits
in z at speciï¬ed x and y, denoted z1(x, y) and z2(x, y). In other words, ï¬nd the
numbers x1 and x2, and the functions y1(x), y2(x), z1(x, y), and z2(x, y) such that

dx
Z y2(x)
y1(x)

Z z2(x,y)

Figure 4.6.1.
Function evaluations for a two-dimensional integral over an irregular region, shown
schematically. The outer integration routine, in y, requests values of the inner, x, integral at locations
along the y axis of its own choosing.
The inner integration routine then evaluates the function at
x locations suitable to it.
This is more accurate in general than, e.g., evaluating the function on a
Cartesian mesh of points.
Now we can deï¬ne a function G(x, y) that does the innermost integral,
G(x, y) â¡

In an implementation of equations (4.6.4)â(4.6.6), some basic one-dimensional
integration routine (e.g., qgaus in the program following) gets called recursively:
once to evaluate the outer integral I, then many times to evaluate the middle integral
H, then even more times to evaluate the inner integral G (see Figure 4.6.1). Current
values of x and y, and the pointer to your function func, are passed âover the headâ
of the intermediate calls through static top-level variables.

Evaluation of Functions
5.0 Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to acquaint you with a selection of the techniques
that are frequently used in evaluating functions. In Chapter 6, we will apply and
illustrate these techniques by giving routines for a variety of speciï¬c functions.
The purposes of this chapter and the next are thus mostly in harmony, but there
is nevertheless some tension between them: Routines that are clearest and most
illustrative of the general techniques of this chapter are not always the methods of
choice for a particular special function. By comparing this chapter to the next one,
you should get some idea of the balance between âgeneralâ and âspecialâ methods
that occurs in practice.
Insofar as that balance favors general methods, this chapter should give you
ideas about how to write your own routine for the evaluation of a function which,
while âspecialâ to you, is not so special as to be included in Chapter 6 or the
standard program libraries.

it with a multiply. Similarly, the form of the coefï¬cients a is often such as to make
use of previous work: Terms like k! or (2k)! can be updated in a multiply or two.

How do you know when you have summed enough terms? In practice, the
terms had better be getting small fast, otherwise the series is not a good technique
to use in the ï¬rst place. While not mathematically rigorous in all cases, standard
practice is to quit when the term you have just added is smaller in magnitude than
some small Ïµ times the magnitude of the sum thus far accumulated. (But watch out
if isolated instances of ak = 0 are possible!).
A weakness of a power series representation is that it is guaranteed not to
converge farther than that distance from x0 at which a singularity is encountered
in the complex plane. This catastrophe is not usually unexpected: When you ï¬nd
a power series in a book (or when you work one out yourself), you will generally
also know the radius of convergence. An insidious problem occurs with series that
converge everywhere (in the mathematical sense), but almost nowhere fast enough
to be useful in a numerical method. Two familiar examples are the sine function
and the Bessel function of the ï¬rst kind,
sin x =
â
X
k=0
(â1)k
(2k + 1)!x2k+1
(5.1.2)
Jn(x) =
x
2
n â
X
k=0
(â1
4x2)k
k!(k + n)!
(5.1.3)
Both of these series converge for all x.
But both donât even start to converge
until k â«|x|; before this, their terms are increasing.
This makes these series
useless for large x.
Accelerating the Convergence of Series
There are several tricks for accelerating the rate of convergence of a series (or,
equivalently, of a sequence of partial sums). These tricks will not generally help in
cases like (5.1.2) or (5.1.3) while the size of the terms is still increasing. For series
with terms of decreasing magnitude, however, some accelerating methods can be
startlingly good. Aitkenâs Î´2-process is simply a formula for extrapolating the partial
sums of a series whose convergence is approximately geometric. If Snâ1, Sn, Sn+1
are three successive partial sums, then an improved estimate is
Sâ²
n â¡Sn+1 â
(Sn+1 âSn)2
Sn+1 â2Sn + Snâ1
(5.1.4)
You can also use (5.1.4) with n + 1 and n â1 replaced by n + p and n âp
respectively, for any integer p. If you form the sequence of Sâ²
iâs, you can apply
(5.1.4) a second time to that sequence, and so on. (In practice, this iteration will
only rarely do much for you after the ï¬rst stage.) Note that equation (5.1.4) should
be computed as written; there exist algebraically equivalent forms that are much
more susceptible to roundoff error.
For alternating series (where the terms in the sum alternate in sign), Eulerâs
transformation can be a powerful tool.
Generally it is advisable to do a small

â3un â¡un+3 â3un+2 + 3un+1 âun
etc.
(5.1.6)
Of course you donât actually do the inï¬nite sum on the right-hand side of (5.1.5),
but only the ï¬rst, say, p terms, thus requiring the ï¬rst p differences (5.1.6) obtained
from the terms starting at un.
Eulerâs transformation can be applied not only to convergent series. In some
cases it will produce accurate answers from the ï¬rst terms of a series that is formally
divergent. It is widely used in the summation of asymptotic series. In this case
it is generally wise not to sum farther than where the terms start increasing in
magnitude; and you should devise some independent numerical check that the results
are meaningful.
There is an elegant and subtle implementation of Eulerâs transformation due
to van Wijngaarden [1]: It incorporates the terms of the original alternating series
one at a time, in order. For each incorporation it either increases p by 1, equivalent
to computing one further difference (5.1.6), or else retroactively increases n by 1,
without having to redo all the difference calculations based on the old n value! The
decision as to which to increase, n or p, is taken in such a way as to make the
convergence most rapid. Van Wijngaardenâs technique requires only one vector of
saved partial differences. Here is the algorithm:
#include <math.h>
void eulsum(float *sum, float term, int jterm, float wksp[])
Incorporates into sum the jtermâth term, with value term, of an alternating series. sum is
input as the previous partial sum, and is output as the new partial sum. The ï¬rst call to this
routine, with the ï¬rst term in the series, should be with jterm=1. On the second call, term
should be set to the second term of the series, with sign opposite to that of the ï¬rst call, and
jterm should be 2. And so on. wksp is a workspace array provided by the calling program,
dimensioned at least as large as the maximum number of terms to be incorporated.

The powerful Euler technique is not directly applicable to a series of positive
terms. Occasionally it is useful to convert a series of positiveterms intoan alternating
series, just so that the Euler transformation can be used! Van Wijngaarden has given
a transformation for accomplishing this [1]:
â
X
r=1
vr =
â
X
r=1
(â1)râ1wr
(5.1.7)
where
wr â¡vr + 2v2r + 4v4r + 8v8r + Â· Â· Â·
(5.1.8)
Equations (5.1.7) and (5.1.8) replace a simple sum by a two-dimensional sum, each
term in (5.1.7) being itself an inï¬nite sum (5.1.8). This may seem a strange way to
save on work! Since, however, the indices in (5.1.8) increase tremendously rapidly,
as powers of 2, it often requires only a few terms to converge (5.1.8) to extraordinary
accuracy.
You do, however, need to be able to compute the vrâs efï¬ciently for
ârandomâ values r. The standard âupdatingâ tricks for sequential râs, mentioned
above following equation (5.1.1), canât be used.
Actually, Eulerâs transformation is a special case of a more general transforma-
tion of power series. Suppose that some known function g(z) has the series
g(z) =
â
X
n=0
bnzn
(5.1.9)
and that you want to sum the new, unknown, series
f(z) =
â
X
n=0
cnbnzn
(5.1.10)
Then it is not hard to show (see [2]) that equation (5.1.10) can be written as
f(z) =
â
X
n=0
[â(n)c0]g(n)
n! zn
(5.1.11)

5.2 Evaluation of Continued Fractions
Continued fractions are often powerful ways of evaluating functions that occur
in scientiï¬c applications. A continued fraction looks like this:
f(x) = b0 +
a1
b1 +
a2
b2+
a3
b3+
a4
b4+
a5
b5+Â·Â·Â·
(5.2.1)
Printers prefer to write this as
f(x) = b0 +
a1
b1 +
a2
b2 +
a3
b3 +
a4
b4 +
a5
b5 + Â· Â· Â·
(5.2.2)
In either (5.2.1) or (5.2.2), the aâs and bâs can themselves be functions of x, usually
linear or quadratic monomials at worst (i.e., constants times x or times x2). For
example, the continued fraction representation of the tangent function is
tanx =
x

x2
3 â
x2
5 â

7 âÂ· Â· Â·
(5.2.3)
Continued fractions frequently converge much more rapidly than power series
expansions, and in a much larger domain in the complex plane (not necessarily
including the domain of convergence of the series, however).
Sometimes the
continued fraction converges best where the series does worst, although this is not

a general rule. Blanch [1] gives a good review of the most useful convergence tests
for continued fractions.
There are standard techniques, including the important quotient-difference algo-
rithm, for going back and forth between continued fraction approximations, power
series approximations, and rational function approximations. Consult Acton [2] for
an introduction to this subject, and Fike [3] for further details and references.
How do you tell how far to go when evaluating a continued fraction? Unlike
a series, you canât just evaluate equation (5.2.1) from left to right, stopping when
the change is small. Written in the form of (5.2.1), the only way to evaluate the
continued fraction is from right to left, ï¬rst (blindly!) guessing how far out to
start.
This is not the right way.
The right way is to use a result that relates continued fractions to rational
approximations, and that gives a means of evaluating (5.2.1) or (5.2.2) from left
to right. Let fn denote the result of evaluating (5.2.2) with coefï¬cients through
an and bn.
Then
fn = An
Bn
(5.2.4)
where An and Bn are given by the following recurrence:
Aâ1 â¡1
Bâ1 â¡0
A0 â¡b0
B0 â¡1
Aj = bjAjâ1 + ajAjâ2
Bj = bjBjâ1 + ajBjâ2
j = 1, 2, . . ., n
(5.2.5)
This method was invented by J. Wallis in 1655 (!), and is discussed in his Arithmetica
Inï¬nitorum [4]. You can easily prove it by induction.
In practice, thisalgorithmhas some unattractive features: The recurrence (5.2.5)
frequently generates very large or very small values for the partial numerators and
denominators Aj and Bj. There is thus the danger of overï¬ow or underï¬ow of the
ï¬oating-point representation. However, the recurrence (5.2.5) is linear in the Aâs and
Bâs. At any point you can rescale the currently saved two levels of the recurrence,
e.g., divide Aj, Bj, Ajâ1, and Bjâ1 all by Bj. This incidentally makes Aj = fj
and is convenient for testing whether you have gone far enough: See if fj and fjâ1
from the last iteration are as close as you would like them to be. (If Bj happens to
be zero, which can happen, just skip the renormalization for this cycle. A fancier
level of optimization is to renormalize only when an overï¬ow is imminent, saving
the unnecessary divides. All this complicates the program logic.)
Two newer algorithms have been proposed for evaluating continued fractions.
Steedâs method does not use Aj and Bj explicitly, but only the ratio Dj = Bjâ1/Bj.
One calculates Dj and âfj = fj âfjâ1 recursively using
Dj = 1/(bj + ajDjâ1)
(5.2.6)
âfj = (bjDj â1)âfjâ1
(5.2.7)
Steedâs method (see, e.g., [5]) avoids the need for rescaling of intermediate results.
However, for certain continued fractions you can occasionally run into a situation

where the denominator in (5.2.6) approaches zero, so that Dj and âfj are very
large.
The next âfj+1 will typically cancel this large change, but with loss of
accuracy in the numerical running sum of the fjâs. It is awkward to program around
this, so Steedâs method can be recommended only for cases where you know in
advance that no denominator can vanish. We will use it for a special purpose in
the routine bessik (Â§6.7).
The best general method for evaluating continued fractions seems to be the
modiï¬ed Lentzâs method [6]. The need for rescaling intermediate results is avoided
by using both the ratios
Cj = Aj/Ajâ1,
Dj = Bjâ1/Bj
(5.2.8)
and calculating fj by
fj = fjâ1CjDj
(5.2.9)
From equation (5.2.5), one easily shows that the ratios satisfy the recurrence relations
Dj = 1/(bj + ajDjâ1),
Cj = bj + aj/Cjâ1
(5.2.10)
In this algorithm there is the danger that the denominator in the expression for Dj,
or the quantity Cj itself, might approach zero. Either of these conditions invalidates
(5.2.10). However, Thompson and Barnett [5] show how to modify Lentzâs algorithm
to ï¬x this: Just shift the offending term by a small amount, e.g., 10â30. If you
work through a cycle of the algorithm with this prescription, you will see that fj+1
is accurately calculated.
In detail, the modiï¬ed Lentzâs algorithm is this:
â¢ Set f0 = b0; if b0 = 0 set f0 = tiny.
â¢ Set C0 = f0.
â¢ Set D0 = 0.
â¢ For j = 1, 2, . . .
Set Dj = bj + ajDjâ1.
If Dj = 0, set Dj = tiny.
Set Cj = bj + aj/Cjâ1.
If Cj = 0 set Cj = tiny.
Set Dj = 1/Dj.
Set âj = CjDj.
Set fj = fjâ1âj.
If |âj â1| < eps then exit.
Here eps is your ï¬oating-point precision, say 10â7 or 10â15. The parameter tiny
should be less than typical values of eps|bj|, say 10â30.
The above algorithm assumes that you can terminate the evaluation of the
continued fraction when |fj âfjâ1| is sufï¬ciently small. This is usually the case,
but by no means guaranteed. Jones [7] gives a list of theorems that can be used to
justify this termination criterion for various kinds of continued fractions.
There is at present no rigorousanalysis of errorpropagationin Lentzâs algorithm.
However, empirical tests suggest that it is at least as good as other methods.

Manipulating Continued Fractions
Several important properties of continued fractions can be used to rewrite them
in forms that can speed up numerical computation. An equivalence transformation
an âÎ»an,
bn âÎ»bn,
an+1 âÎ»an+1
(5.2.11)
leaves the value of a continued fraction unchanged. By a suitable choice of the scale
factor Î» you can often simplify the form of the aâs and the bâs. Of course, you
can carry out successive equivalence transformations, possibly with different Î»âs, on
successive terms of the continued fraction.
The even and odd parts of a continued fraction are continued fractions whose
successive convergents are f2n and f2n+1, respectively. Their main use is that they
converge twice as fast as the original continued fraction, and so if their terms are not
much more complicated than the terms in the original there can be a big savings in
computation. The formula for the even part of (5.2.2) is
feven = d0 +
c1
d1 +
c2
d2 + Â· Â· Â·
(5.2.12)
where in terms of intermediate variables
Î±1 = a1
b1
Î±n =
an
bnbnâ1
,
n â¥2
(5.2.13)
we have
d0 = b0,
c1 = Î±1,
d1 = 1 + Î±2
cn = âÎ±2nâ1Î±2nâ2,
dn = 1 + Î±2nâ1 + Î±2n,
n â¥2
(5.2.14)
You can ï¬nd the similar formula for the odd part in the review by Blanch [1]. Often
a combination of the transformations (5.2.14) and (5.2.11) is used to get the best
form for numerical work.
We will make frequent use of continued fractions in the next chapter.

5.3 Polynomials and Rational Functions
A polynomial of degree N is represented numerically as a stored array of
coefï¬cients, c[j] with j= 0, . . ., N. We will always take c[0] to be the constant
term in the polynomial, c[N] the coefï¬cient of xN; but of course other conventions
are possible. There are two kindsof manipulationsthat you can do witha polynomial:
numerical manipulations (such as evaluation), where you are given the numerical
value of its argument, or algebraic manipulations, where you want to transform
the coefï¬cient array in some way without choosing any particular argument. Letâs
start with the numerical.
We assume that you know enough never to evaluate a polynomial this way:
p=c[0]+c[1]*x+c[2]*x*x+c[3]*x*x*x+c[4]*x*x*x*x;
or (even worse!),
p=c[0]+c[1]*x+c[2]*pow(x,2.0)+c[3]*pow(x,3.0)+c[4]*pow(x,4.0);
Come the (computer) revolution, all persons found guilty of such criminal
behavior will be summarily executed, and their programs wonât be! It is a matter
of taste, however, whether to write
p=c[0]+x*(c[1]+x*(c[2]+x*(c[3]+x*c[4])));
or
p=(((c[4]*x+c[3])*x+c[2])*x+c[1])*x+c[0];
If the number of coefï¬cients c[0..n] is large, one writes
p=c[n];
for(j=n-1;j>=0;j--) p=p*x+c[j];
or
p=c[j=n];
while (j>0) p=p*x+c[--j];
Another useful trick is for evaluating a polynomial P (x) and its derivative
dP (x)/dx simultaneously:
p=c[n];
dp=0.0;
for(j=n-1;j>=0;j--) {dp=dp*x+p; p=p*x+c[j];}

while (j>0) {dp=dp*x+p; p=p*x+c[--j];}
which yields the polynomial as p and its derivative as dp.
The above trick, which is basically synthetic division [1,2], generalizes to the
evaluation of the polynomial and nd of its derivatives simultaneously:
void ddpoly(float c[], int nc, float x, float pd[], int nd)
Given the nc+1 coeï¬cients of a polynomial of degree nc as an array c[0..nc] with c[0]
being the constant term, and given a value x, and given a value nd>1, this routine returns the
polynomial evaluated at x as pd[0] and nd derivatives as pd[1..nd].
{
int nnd,j,i;
float cnst=1.0;
pd[0]=c[nc];
for (j=1;j<=nd;j++) pd[j]=0.0;
for (i=nc-1;i>=0;i--) {
nnd=(nd < (nc-i) ? nd : nc-i);
for (j=nnd;j>=1;j--)
pd[j]=pd[j]*x+pd[j-1];
pd[0]=pd[0]*x+c[i];
}
for (i=2;i<=nd;i++) {
After the ï¬rst derivative, factorial constants come in.
cnst *= i;
pd[i] *= cnst;
}
}
As a curiosity, you might be interested to know that polynomials of degree
n > 3 can be evaluated in fewer than n multiplications, at least if you are willing
to precompute some auxiliary coefï¬cients and, in some cases, do an extra addition.
For example, the polynomial
P (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + a4x4
(5.3.1)
where a4 > 0, can be evaluated with 3 multiplications and 5 additions as follows:
P (x) = [(Ax + B)2 + Ax + C][(Ax + B)2 + D] + E
(5.3.2)
where A, B, C, D, and E are to be precomputed by
A = (a4)1/4
B = a3 âA3
4A3
D = 3B2 + 8B3 + a1A â2a2B
A2
C = a2
A2 â2B â6B2 âD
E = a0 âB4 âB2(C + D) âCD

Fifth degree polynomials can be evaluated in 4 multiplies and 5 adds; sixth degree
polynomials can be evaluated in 4 multiplies and 7 adds; if any of this strikes
you as interesting, consult references [3-5]. The subject has something of the same
entertaining, if impractical, ï¬avor as that of fast matrix multiplication, discussed
in Â§2.11.
Turn now to algebraic manipulations. You multiply a polynomial of degree
n â1 (array of range [0..n-1]) by a monomial factor x âa by a bit of code
like the following,
c[n]=c[n-1];
for (j=n-1;j>=1;j--) c[j]=c[j-1]-c[j]*a;
c[0] *= (-a);
Likewise, you divide a polynomial of degree n by a monomial factor x âa
(synthetic division again) using
rem=c[n];
c[n]=0.0;
for(i=n-1;i>=0;i--) {
swap=c[i];
c[i]=rem;
rem=swap+rem*a;
}
which leaves you with a new polynomial array and a numerical remainder rem.
Multiplication of two general polynomials involves straightforward summing
of the products, each involving one coefï¬cient from each polynomial. Division
of two general polynomials, while it can be done awkwardly in the fashion taught
using pencil and paper, is susceptible to a good deal of streamlining. Witness the
following routine based on the algorithm in [3].
void poldiv(float u[], int n, float v[], int nv, float q[], float r[])
Given the n+1 coeï¬cients of a polynomial of degree n in u[0..n], and the nv+1 coeï¬cients
of another polynomial of degree nv in v[0..nv], divide the polynomial u by the polynomial
v (âuâ/âvâ) giving a quotient polynomial whose coeï¬cients are returned in q[0..n], and a
remainder polynomial whose coeï¬cients are returned in r[0..n]. The elements r[nv..n]
and q[n-nv+1..n] are returned as zero.
{
int k,j;
for (j=0;j<=n;j++) {
r[j]=u[j];
q[j]=0.0;
}
for (k=n-nv;k>=0;k--) {
q[k]=r[nv+k]/v[nv];
for (j=nv+k-1;j>=k;j--) r[j] -= q[k]*v[j-k];
}
for (j=nv;j<=n;j++) r[j]=0.0;
}

Rational Functions
You evaluate a rational function like
R(x) = PÂµ(x)
QÎ½(x) = p0 + p1x + Â· Â· Â· + pÂµxÂµ
q0 + q1x + Â· Â· Â· + qÎ½xÎ½
(5.3.4)
in the obvious way, namely as two separate polynomials followed by a divide. As a
matter of convention one usually chooses q0 = 1, obtained by dividing numerator
and denominator by any other q0.
It is often convenient to have both sets of
coefï¬cients stored in a single array, and to have a standard function available for
doing the evaluation:
double ratval(double x, double cof[], int mm, int kk)
Given mm, kk, and cof[0..mm+kk], evaluate and return the rational function (cof[0] +
cof[1]x + Â· Â· Â· + cof[mm]xmm)/(1 + cof[mm+1]x + Â· Â· Â· + cof[mm+kk]xkk).

Note precision! Change to float if desired.

5.4 Complex Arithmetic
As we mentioned in Â§1.2, the lack of built-in complex arithmetic in C is a
nuisance for numerical work. Even in languages like FORTRAN that have complex
data types, it is disconcertingly common to encounter complex operations that
produce overï¬ows or underï¬ows when both the complex operands and the complex
result are perfectly representable. This occurs, we think, because software companies
assign inexperienced programmers to what they believe to be the perfectly trivial
task of implementing complex arithmetic.

Actually, complex arithmetic is not quite trivial.
Addition and subtraction
are done in the obvious way, performing the operation separately on the real and
imaginary parts of the operands. Multiplication can also be done in the obvious way,
with 4 multiplications, one addition, and one subtraction,
(a + ib)(c + id) = (ac âbd) + i(bc + ad)
(5.4.1)
(the addition before the i doesnât count; it just separates the real and imaginary parts
notationally). But it is sometimes faster to multiply via
(a + ib)(c + id) = (ac âbd) + i[(a + b)(c + d) âac âbd]
(5.4.2)
which has only three multiplications (ac, bd, (a + b)(c + d)), plus two additions and
three subtractions. The total operations count is higher by two, but multiplication
is a slow operation on some machines.
While it is true that intermediate results in equations (5.4.1) and (5.4.2) can
overï¬ow even when the ï¬nal result is representable, this happens only when the ï¬nal
answer is on the edge of representability. Not so for the complex modulus, if you
are misguided enough to compute it as
|a + ib| =
p
a2 + b2
(bad!)
(5.4.3)
whose intermediate result will overï¬ow if either a or b is as large as the square
root of the largest representable number (e.g., 1019 as compared to 1038). The right
way to do the calculation is
|a + ib| =
 |a|
p
1 + (b/a)2
|a| â¥|b|
|b|
p
1 + (a/b)2
|a| < |b|
(5.4.4)
Complex division should use a similar trick to prevent avoidable overï¬ows,
underï¬ow, or loss of precision,
a + ib
c + id =
ï£±
ï£´
ï£´
ï£²
ï£´
ï£´
ï£³
[a + b(d/c)] + i[b âa(d/c)]
c + d(d/c)
|c| â¥|d|
[a(c/d) + b] + i[b(c/d) âa]
c(c/d) + d
|c| < |d|
(5.4.5)
Of course you should calculate repeated subexpressions, like c/d or d/c, only once.
Complex square root is even more complicated, since we must both guard
intermediate results, and also enforce a chosen branch cut (here taken to be the
negative real axis). To take the square root of c + id, ï¬rst compute
w â¡

where Î± and Î² are the precomputed coefï¬cients
Î± â¡2 sin2
Î´
2

Î² â¡sin Î´
(5.5.7)
The reason for doing things this way, rather than with the standard (and equivalent)
identities for sums of angles, is that here Î± and Î² do not lose signiï¬cance if the
incremental Î´ is small. Likewise, the adds in equation (5.5.6) should be done in
the order indicated by square brackets. We will use (5.5.6) repeatedly in Chapter
12, when we deal with Fourier transforms.
Another trick, occasionally useful, is to note that both sin Î¸ and cos Î¸ can be
calculated via a single call to tan:
t â¡tan
Î¸
2

cos Î¸ = 1 ât2
1 + t2
sin Î¸ =
2t
1 + t2
(5.5.8)
The cost of getting both sin and cos, if you need them, is thus the cost of tan plus
2 multiplies, 2 divides, and 2 adds. On machines with slow trig functions, this can
be a savings. However, note that special treatment is required if Î¸ âÂ±Ï. And also
note that many modern machines have very fast trig functions; so you should not
assume that equation (5.5.8) is faster without testing.
Stability of Recurrences
You need to be aware that recurrence relations are not necessarily stable
against roundoff error in the direction that you propose to go (either increasing n or
decreasing n). A three-term linear recurrence relation
yn+1 + anyn + bnynâ1 = 0,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(5.5.9)
has two linearly independent solutions, fn and gn say. Only one of these corresponds
to the sequence of functions fn that you are trying to generate. The other one gn
may be exponentially growing in the direction that you want to go, or exponentially
damped, or exponentiallyneutral (growingor dyingas some power law, for example).
If it is exponentially growing, then the recurrence relation is of little or no practical
use in that direction. This is the case, e.g., for (5.5.2) in the direction of increasing
n, when x < n.
You cannot generate Bessel functions of high n by forward
recurrence on (5.5.2).
To state things a bit more formally, if
fn/gn â0
as
n ââ
(5.5.10)
then fn is called the minimal solution of the recurrence relation (5.5.9). Nonminimal
solutions like gn are called dominant solutions. The minimal solution is unique, if it
exists, but dominant solutions are not â you can add an arbitrary multiple of fn to
a given gn. You can evaluate any dominant solution by forward recurrence, but not
the minimal solution. (Unfortunately it is sometimes the one you want.)
Abramowitz and Stegun (in their Introduction) [1] give a list of recurrences that
are stable in the increasing or decreasing directions. That list does not contain all

possible formulas, of course. Given a recurrence relation for some function fn(x)
you can test it yourself with about ï¬ve minutes of (human) labor: For a ï¬xed x
in your range of interest, start the recurrence not with true values of fj(x) and
fj+1(x), but (ï¬rst) with the values 1 and 0, respectively, and then (second) with
0 and 1, respectively. Generate 10 or 20 terms of the recursive sequences in the
direction that you want to go (increasing or decreasing from j), for each of the two
starting conditions. Look at the difference between the corresponding members of
the two sequences. If the differences stay of order unity (absolute value less than
10, say), then the recurrence is stable. If they increase slowly, then the recurrence
may be mildly unstable but quite tolerably so.
If they increase catastrophically,
then there is an exponentially growing solution of the recurrence.
If you know
that the function that you want actually corresponds to the growing solution, then
you can keep the recurrence formula anyway e.g., the case of the Bessel function
Yn(x) for increasing n, see Â§6.5; if you donât know which solution your function
corresponds to, you must at this point reject the recurrence formula. Notice that
you can do this test before you go to the trouble of ï¬nding a numerical method for
computing the two starting functions fj(x) and fj+1(x): stability is a property of
the recurrence, not of the starting values.
An alternative heuristic procedure for testing stability is to replace the recur-
rence relation by a similar one that is linear with constant coefï¬cients. For example,
the relation (5.5.2) becomes
yn+1 â2Î³yn + ynâ1 = 0
(5.5.11)
where Î³ â¡n/x is treated as a constant.
You solve such recurrence relations
by trying solutions of the form yn = an.
Substituting into the above recur-
rence gives
a2 â2Î³a + 1 = 0
or
a = Î³ Â±
p
Î³2 â1
(5.5.12)
The recurrence is stable if |a| â¤1 for all solutions a. This holds (as you can verify)
if |Î³| â¤1 or n â¤x. The recurrence (5.5.2) thus cannot be used, starting with J0(x)
and J1(x), to compute Jn(x) for large n.
Possibly you would at this point like the security of some real theorems on
this subject (although we ourselves always follow one of the heuristic procedures).
Here are two theorems, due to Perron [2]:
Theorem A.
If in (5.5.9) an â¼anÎ±, bn â¼bnÎ² as n ââ, and Î² < 2Î±, then
gn+1/gn â¼âanÎ±,
fn+1/fn â¼â(b/a)nÎ²âÎ±
(5.5.13)
and fn is the minimal solution to (5.5.9).
Theorem B.
Under the same conditions as Theorem A, but with Î² = 2Î±,
consider the characteristic polynomial

and fn is again the minimal solution to (5.5.9). Cases other than those in these
two theorems are inconclusive for the existence of minimal solutions. (For more
on the stability of recurrences, see [3].)
How do you proceed if the solution that you desire is the minimal solution?
The answer lies in that old aphorism, that every cloud has a silver lining: If a
recurrence relation is catastrophically unstable in one direction, then that (undesired)
solution will decrease very rapidly in the reverse direction. This means that you
can start with any seed values for the consecutive fj and fj+1 and (when you have
gone enough steps in the stable direction) you will converge to the sequence of
functions that you want, times an unknown normalization factor. If there is some
other way to normalize the sequence (e.g., by a formula for the sum of the fnâs),
then this can be a practical means of function evaluation. The method is called
Millerâs algorithm. An example often given [1,4] uses equation (5.5.2) in just this
way, along with the normalization formula
1 = J0(x) + 2J2(x) + 2J4(x) + 2J6(x) + Â· Â· Â·
(5.5.16)
Incidentally, there is an important relation between three-term recurrence
relations and continued fractions. Rewrite the recurrence relation (5.5.9) as
yn
ynâ1
= â
bn
an + yn+1/yn
(5.5.17)
Iterating this equation, starting with n, gives
yn
ynâ1
= âbn
an â
bn+1
an+1 âÂ· Â· Â·
(5.5.18)
Pincherleâs Theorem [2] tells us that (5.5.18) converges if and only if (5.5.9) has a
minimal solution fn, in which case it converges to fn/fnâ1. This result, usually for
the case n = 1 and combined with some way to determine f0, underlies many of the
practical methods for computing special functions that we give in the next chapter.
Clenshawâs Recurrence Formula
Clenshawâs recurrence formula [5] is an elegant and efï¬cient way to evaluate a
sum of coefï¬cients times functions that obey a recurrence formula, e.g.,
f(Î¸) =
N
X
k=0
ck cos kÎ¸
or
f(x) =
N
X
k=0
ckPk(x)
Here is how it works: Suppose that the desired sum is
f(x) =
N
X
k=0
ckFk(x)
(5.5.19)
and that Fk obeys the recurrence relation
Fn+1(x) = Î±(n, x)Fn(x) + Î²(n, x)Fnâ1(x)
(5.5.20)

for some functions Î±(n, x) and Î²(n, x).
Now deï¬ne the quantities yk (k =
N, N â1, . . ., 1) by the following recurrence:
yN+2 = yN+1 = 0
yk = Î±(k, x)yk+1 + Î²(k + 1, x)yk+2 + ck
(k = N, N â1, . . ., 1) (5.5.21)
If you solve equation (5.5.21) for ck on the left, and then write out explicitly the
sum (5.5.19), it will look (in part) like this:
f(x) = Â· Â· Â·
+ [y8 âÎ±(8, x)y9 âÎ²(9, x)y10]F8(x)
+ [y7 âÎ±(7, x)y8 âÎ²(8, x)y9]F7(x)
+ [y6 âÎ±(6, x)y7 âÎ²(7, x)y8]F6(x)
+ [y5 âÎ±(5, x)y6 âÎ²(6, x)y7]F5(x)
+ Â· Â· Â·
+ [y2 âÎ±(2, x)y3 âÎ²(3, x)y4]F2(x)
+ [y1 âÎ±(1, x)y2 âÎ²(2, x)y3]F1(x)
+ [c0 + Î²(1, x)y2 âÎ²(1, x)y2]F0(x)
(5.5.22)
Notice that we have added and subtracted Î²(1, x)y2 in the last line. If you examine
the terms containing a factor of y8 in (5.5.22), you will ï¬nd that they sum to zero as
a consequence of the recurrence relation (5.5.20); similarly all the other ykâs down
through y2. The only surviving terms in (5.5.22) are
f(x) = Î²(1, x)F0(x)y2 + F1(x)y1 + F0(x)c0
(5.5.23)
Equations (5.5.21) and (5.5.23) are Clenshawâs recurrence formula for doing the sum
(5.5.19): You make one pass down through the ykâs using (5.5.21); when you have
reached y2 and y1 you apply (5.5.23) to get the desired answer.
Clenshawâs recurrence as written above incorporates the coefï¬cients ck in a
downward order, with k decreasing. At each stage, the effect of all previous ckâs
is ârememberedâ as two coefï¬cients which multiply the functions Fk+1 and Fk
(ultimately F0 and F1). If the functions Fk are small when k is large, and if the
coefï¬cients ck are small when k is small, then the sum can be dominated by small
Fkâs. In this case the remembered coefï¬cients will involve a delicate cancellation
and there can be a catastrophic loss of signiï¬cance. An example would be to sum
the trivial series
J15(1) = 0 Ã J0(1) + 0 Ã J1(1) + . . . + 0 Ã J14(1) + 1 Ã J15(1)
(5.5.24)
Here J15, which is tiny, ends up represented as a canceling linear combination of
J0 and J1, which are of order unity.

The solution in such cases is to use an alternative Clenshaw recurrence that
incorporates ckâs in an upward direction. The relevant equations are

(5.5.27)
The rare case where equations (5.5.25)â(5.5.27) should be used instead of
equations (5.5.21) and (5.5.23) can be detected automatically by testing whether
the operands in the ï¬rst sum in (5.5.23) are opposite in sign and nearly equal in
magnitude. Other than in this special case, Clenshawâs recurrence is always stable,
independent of whether the recurrence for the functions Fk is stable in the upward
or downward direction.

(5.6.3)
If you use either (5.6.2) or (5.6.3) to get the two roots, you are asking for trouble: If
either a or c (or both) are small, then one of the roots will involve the subtraction
of b from a very nearly equal quantity (the discriminant); you will get that root very
inaccurately. The correct way to compute the roots is
q â¡â1

Then the two roots are
x1 = q

and

(5.6.5)
If the coefï¬cients a, b, c, are complex rather than real, then the above formulas
still hold, except that in equation (5.6.4) the sign of the square root should be
chosen so as to make
Re(b*
p
b2 â4ac) â¥0
(5.6.6)
where Re denotes the real part and asterisk denotes complex conjugation.
Apropos of quadratic equations, this seems a convenient place to recall that
the inverse hyperbolic functions sinhâ1 and coshâ1 are in fact just logarithms of
solutions to such equations,
sinhâ1(x) =
ln x +

Equation (5.6.7) is numerically robust for x â¥0. For negative x, use the symmetry
sinhâ1(âx) = âsinhâ1(x). Equation (5.6.8) is of course valid only for x â¥1.
For the cubic equation

spurious loss of a distinct root.
If you need to solve many cubic equations with only slightly different coefï¬-
cients, it is more efï¬cient to use Newtonâs method (Â§9.4).

5.7 Numerical Derivatives
Imagine that you have a procedure which computes a function f(x), and now
you want to compute its derivative fâ²(x).
Easy, right?
The deï¬nition of the
derivative, the limit as h â0 of
fâ²(x) âf(x + h) âf(x)
h
(5.7.1)
practically suggests the program: Pick a small value h; evaluate f(x + h); you
probably have f(x) already evaluated, but if not, do it too; ï¬nally apply equation
(5.7.1).
What more needs to be said?
Quite a lot, actually.
Applied uncritically, the above procedure is almost
guaranteed to produce inaccurate results. Applied properly, it can be the right way
to compute a derivative only when the function f is ï¬ercely expensive to compute,
when you already have invested in computing f(x), and when, therefore, you want
to get the derivative in no more than a single additional function evaluation. In such
a situation, the remaining issue is to choose h properly, an issue we now discuss:
There are two sources of error in equation (5.7.1), truncation error and roundoff
error. The truncation error comes from higher terms in the Taylor series expansion,
f(x + h) = f(x) + hfâ²(x) + 1
2h2fâ²â²(x) + 1
6h3fâ²â²â²(x) + Â· Â· Â·
(5.7.2)
whence
f(x + h) âf(x)
h
= fâ² + 1
2hfâ²â² + Â· Â· Â·
(5.7.3)
The roundoff error has various contributions. First there is roundoff error in h:
Suppose, by way of an example, that you are at a point x = 10.3 and you blindly
choose h = 0.0001. Neither x = 10.3 nor x + h = 10.30001 is a number with
an exact representation in binary; each is therefore represented with some fractional
error characteristic of the machineâs ï¬oating-point format, Ïµm, whose value in single
precision may be â¼10â7. The error in the effective value of h, namely the difference
between x + h and x as represented in the machine, is therefore on the order of Ïµmx,
which implies a fractional error in h of order â¼Ïµmx/h â¼10â2! By equation (5.7.1)
this immediately implies at least the same large fractional error in the derivative.
We arrive at Lesson 1: Always choose h so that x +h and x differ by an exactly
representable number. This can usually be accomplished by the program steps
temp = x + h
h = temp âx
(5.7.4)
Some optimizing compilers, and some computers whose ï¬oating-point chips have
higher internal accuracy than is stored externally, can foil this trick; if so, it is
usually enough to declare temp as volatile, or else to call a dummy function
donothing(temp) between the two equations (5.7.4). This forces temp into and
out of addressable memory.

Suppose, by way of an example, that you are at a point x = 10.3 and you blindly
choose h = 0.0001. Neither x = 10.3 nor x + h = 10.30001 is a number with
an exact representation in binary; each is therefore represented with some fractional
error characteristic of the machineâs ï¬oating-point format, Ïµm, whose value in single
precision may be â¼10â7. The error in the effective value of h, namely the difference
between x + h and x as represented in the machine, is therefore on the order of Ïµmx,
which implies a fractional error in h of order â¼Ïµmx/h â¼10â2! By equation (5.7.1)
this immediately implies at least the same large fractional error in the derivative.
We arrive at Lesson 1: Always choose h so that x +h and x differ by an exactly
representable number. This can usually be accomplished by the program steps
temp = x + h
h = temp âx
(5.7.4)
Some optimizing compilers, and some computers whose ï¬oating-point chips have
higher internal accuracy than is stored externally, can foil this trick; if so, it is
usually enough to declare temp as volatile, or else to call a dummy function
donothing(temp) between the two equations (5.7.4). This forces temp into and
out of addressable memory.

With h an âexactâ number, the roundoff error in equation (5.7.1) is er â¼
Ïµf|f(x)/h|. Here Ïµf is the fractional accuracy with which f is computed; for a
simple function this may be comparable to the machine accuracy, Ïµf âÏµm, but for a
complicated calculation with additional sources of inaccuracy it may be larger. The
truncation error in equation (5.7.3) is on the order of et â¼|hfâ²â²(x)|. Varying h to
minimize the sum er + et gives the optimal choice of h,
h â¼
s
Ïµff
fâ²â² ââÏµfxc
(5.7.5)
where xc â¡(f/fâ²â²)1/2 is the âcurvature scaleâ of the function f, or âcharacteristic
scaleâ over which it changes. In the absence of any other information, one often
assumes xc = x (except near x = 0 where some other estimate of the typical x
scale should be used).
With the choice of equation (5.7.5), the fractional accuracy of the computed
derivative is
(er + et)/|fâ²| â¼âÏµf(ffâ²â²/fâ²2)1/2 â¼âÏµf
(5.7.6)
Here the last order-of-magnitude equality assumes that f, fâ², and fâ²â² all share
the same characteristic length scale, usually the case.
One sees that the simple
ï¬nite-difference equation (5.7.1) gives at best only the square root of the machine
accuracy Ïµm.
If you can afford two function evaluations for each derivative calculation, then
it is signiï¬cantly better to use the symmetrized form
fâ²(x) âf(x + h) âf(x âh)
2h
(5.7.7)
In this case, by equation (5.7.2), the truncation error is et â¼h2fâ²â²â². The roundoff
error er is about the same as before. The optimal choice of h, by a short calculation
analogous to the one above, is now
h â¼
Ïµff
fâ²â²â²

â¼(Ïµf)1/3xc

and the fractional error is

(5.7.9)
which will typically be an order of magnitude (single precision) or two orders of
magnitude (double precision) better than equation (5.7.6). We have arrived at Lesson
2: Choose h to be the correct power of Ïµf or Ïµm times a characteristic scale xc.
You can easily derive the correct powers for other cases [1]. For a function of
two dimensions, for example, and the mixed derivative formula
â2f
âxây = [f(x + h, y + h) âf(x + h, y âh)] â[f(x âh, y + h) âf(x âh, y âh)]

the correct scaling is h â¼Ïµ1/3
f
xc.
It is disappointing, certainly, that no simple ï¬nite-difference formula like
equation (5.7.1) or (5.7.7) gives an accuracy comparable to the machine accuracy
Ïµm, or even the lower accuracy to which f is evaluated, Ïµf. Are there no better
methods?
Yes, there are. All, however, involve exploration of the functionâs behavior
over scales comparable to xc, plus some assumption of smoothness, or analyticity,
so that the high-order terms in a Taylor expansion like equation (5.7.2) have some
meaning. Such methods also involve multiple evaluations of the function f, so their
increased accuracy must be weighed against increased cost.
The general idea of âRichardsonâs deferred approach to the limitâ is particularly
attractive. For numerical integrals, that idea leads to so-called Romberg integration
(for review, see Â§4.3). For derivatives, one seeks to extrapolate, to h â0, the result
of ï¬nite-difference calculations with smaller and smaller ï¬nite values of h. By the
use of Nevilleâs algorithm (Â§3.1), one uses each new ï¬nite-difference calculation to
produce both an extrapolation of higher order, and also extrapolations of previous,
lower, orders but with smaller scales h. Ridders [2] has given a nice implementation
of this idea; the following program, dfridr, is based on his algorithm, modiï¬ed by
an improved termination criterion. Input to the routine is a function f (called func),
a position x, and a largest stepsize h (more analogous to what we have called xc
above than to what we have called h). Output is the returned value of the derivative,
and an estimate of its error, err.
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
#define CON 1.4
Stepsize is decreased by CON at each iteration.
#define CON2 (CON*CON)
#define BIG 1.0e30
#define NTAB 10
Sets maximum size of tableau.
#define SAFE 2.0
Return when error is SAFE worse than the best so
far.
float dfridr(float (*func)(float), float x, float h, float *err)
Returns the derivative of a function func at a point x by Riddersâ method of polynomial
extrapolation. The value h is input as an estimated initial stepsize; it need not be small, but
rather should be an increment in x over which func changes substantially. An estimate of the
error in the derivative is returned as err.

The error strategy is to compare each new extrapolation to one order lower, both
at the present stepsize and the previous one.

}
In dfridr, the number of evaluations of func is typically 6 to 12, but is allowed
to be as great as 2ÃNTAB. As a function of input h, it is typical for the accuracy
to get better as h is made larger, until a sudden point is reached where nonsensical
extrapolation produces early return with a large error. You should therefore choose
a fairly large value for h, but monitor the returned value err, decreasing h if it is
not small. For functions whose characteristic x scale is of order unity, we typically
take h to be a few tenths.
Besides Riddersâ method, there are other possible techniques. If your function
is fairly smooth, and you know that you will want to evaluate its derivative many
times at arbitrary points in some interval, then it makes sense to construct a
Chebyshev polynomial approximation to the function in that interval, and to evaluate
the derivative directly from the resulting Chebyshev coefï¬cients. This method is
described in Â§Â§5.8â5.9, following.
Another technique applies when the function consists of data that is tabulated
at equally spaced intervals, and perhaps also noisy. One might then want, at each
point, to least-squares ï¬t a polynomial of some degree M, using an additional
number nL of points to the left and some number nR of points to the right of each
desired x value. The estimated derivative is then the derivative of the resulting
ï¬tted polynomial. A very efï¬cient way to do this construction is via Savitzky-Golay
smoothing ï¬lters, which will be discussed later, in Â§14.8. There we will give a
routine for gettingï¬lter coefï¬cients that not only construct the ï¬tting polynomial but,
in the accumulation of a single sum of data points times ï¬lter coefï¬cients, evaluate
it as well. In fact, the routine given, savgol, has an argument ld that determines
which derivative of the ï¬tted polynomial is evaluated. For the ï¬rst derivative, the
appropriate setting is ld=1, and the value of the derivative is the accumulated sum
divided by the sampling interval h.

The Chebyshev polynomial of degree n is denoted Tn(x), and is given by
the explicit formula
Tn(x) = cos(n arccos x)

This may look trigonometric at ï¬rst glance (and there is in fact a close relation
between the Chebyshev polynomials and the discrete Fourier transform); however
(5.8.1) can be combined with trigonometric identities to yield explicit expressions
for Tn(x) (see Figure 5.8.1),
T0(x) = 1
T1(x) = x
T2(x) = 2x2 â1
T3(x) = 4x3 â3x
T4(x) = 8x4 â8x2 + 1

(There also exist inverse formulas for the powers of x in terms of the Tnâs â see

is exact for x equal to all of the N zeros of TN(x).
For a ï¬xed N, equation (5.8.8) is a polynomial in x which approximates the
function f(x) in the interval [â1, 1] (where all the zeros of TN(x) are located). Why
is this particular approximating polynomial better than any other one, exact on some
other set of N points? The answer is not that (5.8.8) is necessarily more accurate
than some other approximating polynomial of the same order N (for some speciï¬ed
deï¬nition of âaccurateâ), but rather that (5.8.8) can be truncated to a polynomial of
lower degree m âªN in a very graceful way, one that does yield the âmost accurateâ
approximation of degree m (in a sense that can be made precise). Suppose N is
so large that (5.8.8) is virtually a perfect approximation of f(x).
Now consider
the truncated approximation
f(x) â

X
k=0
ckTk(x)
#
â1

(5.8.9)
with the same cjâs, computed from (5.8.7).
Since the Tk(x)âs are all bounded
between Â±1, the difference between (5.8.9) and (5.8.8) can be no larger than the
sum of the neglected ckâs (k = m, . . . , N â1). In fact, if the ckâs are rapidly
decreasing (which is the typical case), then the error is dominated by cmTm(x),
an oscillatory function with m + 1 equal extrema distributed smoothly over the
interval [â1, 1]. This smooth spreading out of the error is a very important property:
The Chebyshev approximation (5.8.9) is very nearly the same polynomial as that
holy grail of approximating polynomials the minimax polynomial, which (among all
polynomials of the same degree) has the smallest maximum deviation from the true
function f(x). The minimax polynomial is very difï¬cult to ï¬nd; the Chebyshev
approximating polynomial is almost identical and is very easy to compute!
So, given some (perhaps difï¬cult) means of computing the function f(x), we
now need algorithms for implementing (5.8.7) and (after inspection of the resulting
ckâs and choice of a truncating value m) evaluating (5.8.9). The latter equation then
becomes an easy way of computing f(x) for all subsequent time.
The ï¬rst of these tasks is straightforward. A generalization of equation (5.8.7)
that is here implemented is to allow the range of approximation to be between two
arbitrary limitsa and b, instead ofjust â1 to 1. This is effected by a change of variable

ahead to Â§12.3, especially equation 12.3.22, which shows how fast cosine transform
methods can be used to evaluate equation 5.8.7.)
Now that we have the Chebyshev coefï¬cients, how do we evaluate the approxi-
mation? One could use the recurrence relation of equation (5.8.2) to generate values
for Tk(x) from T0 = 1, T1 = x, while also accumulating the sum of (5.8.9). It
is better to use Clenshawâs recurrence formula (Â§5.5), effecting the two processes
simultaneously. Applied to the Chebyshev series (5.8.9), the recurrence is

If we are approximating an even function on the interval [â1, 1], its expansion
will involve only even Chebyshev polynomials. It is wasteful to call chebev with
all the odd coefï¬cients zero [1]. Instead, using the half-angle identity for the cosine
in equation (5.8.1), we get the relation
T2n(x) = Tn(2x2 â1)
(5.8.12)
Thus we can evaluate a series of even Chebyshev polynomials by calling chebev
with the even coefï¬cients stored consecutively in the array c, but with the argument
x replaced by 2x2 â1.
An odd function will have an expansion involving only odd Chebysev poly-
nomials. It is best to rewrite it as an expansion for the function f(x)/x, which
involves only even Chebyshev polynomials.
This will give accurate values for
f(x)/x near x = 0. The coefï¬cients câ²
n for f(x)/x can be found from those for
f(x) by recurrence:
câ²
N+1 = 0
câ²
nâ1 = 2cn âcâ²
n+1,
n = N, N â2, . . .
(5.8.13)
Equation (5.8.13) follows from the recurrence relation in equation (5.8.2).
If you insist on evaluating an odd Chebyshev series, the efï¬cient way is to once
again use chebev with x replaced by y = 2x2 â1, and with the odd coefï¬cients
stored consecutively in the array c. Now, however, you must also change the last
formula in equation (5.8.11) to be
f(x) = x[(2y â1)d2 âd3 + c1]
(5.8.14)
and change the corresponding line in chebev.

5.9 Derivatives or Integrals of a
Chebyshev-approximated Function
If you have obtained the Chebyshev coefï¬cients that approximate a function in
a certain range (e.g., from chebft in Â§5.8), then it is a simple matter to transform
them to Chebyshev coefï¬cients corresponding to the derivative or integral of the
function. Having done this, you can evaluate the derivative or integral just as if it
were a function that you had Chebyshev-ï¬tted ab initio.
The relevant formulas are these: If ci, i = 0, . . ., m â1 are the coefï¬cients
that approximate a function f in equation (5.8.9), Ci are the coefï¬cients that
approximate the indeï¬nite integral of f, and câ²
i are the coefï¬cients that approximate
the derivative of f, then
Ci = ciâ1 âci+1
2(i â1)
(i > 1)
(5.9.1)
câ²
iâ1 = câ²
i+1 + 2(i â1)ci
(i = m â1, m â2, . . ., 2)
(5.9.2)
Equation (5.9.1) is augmented by an arbitrary choice of C0, corresponding to an
arbitrary constant of integration. Equation (5.9.2), which is a recurrence, is started
with the values câ²
m = câ²
mâ1 = 0, corresponding to no information about the m + 1st
Chebyshev coefï¬cient of the original function f.
Here are routines for implementing equations (5.9.1) and (5.9.2).

Clenshaw-Curtis Quadrature
Since a smooth functionâs Chebyshev coefï¬cients ci decrease rapidly, generally expo-
nentially, equation (5.9.1) is often quite efï¬cient as the basis for a quadrature scheme. The
routines chebft and chint, used in that order, can be followed by repeated calls to chebev
if
R x
a f(x)dx is required for many different values of x in the range a â¤x â¤b.
If only the single deï¬nite integral
R b
a f(x)dx is required, then chint and chebev are
replaced by the simpler formula, derived from equation (5.9.1),
Z b
a
f(x)dx = (b âa)

(2k + 1)(2k â1)c2k+1 âÂ· Â· Â·

(5.9.3)
where the ciâs are as returned by chebft. The series can be truncated when c2k+1 becomes
negligible, and the ï¬rst neglected term gives an error estimate.
This scheme is known as Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature [1]. It is often combined with an
adaptive choice of N, the number of Chebyshev coefï¬cients calculated via equation (5.8.7),
which is also the number of function evaluations of f(x). If a modest choice of N does
not give a sufï¬ciently small c2k+1 in equation (5.9.3), then a larger value is tried. In this
adaptive case, it is even better to replace equation (5.8.7) by the so-called âtrapezoidalâ or
Gauss-Lobatto (Â§4.5) variant,

(5.9.4)
where (N.B.!)
the two primes signify that the ï¬rst and last terms in the sum are to be
multiplied by 1/2.
If N is doubled in equation (5.9.4), then half of the new function
evaluation points are identical to the old ones, allowing the previous function evaluations to be
reused. This feature, plus the analytic weights and abscissas (cosine functions in 5.9.4), give
Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature an edge over high-order adaptive Gaussian quadrature (cf. Â§4.5),
which the method otherwise resembles.
If yourproblem forces you to large values of N, you shouldbe aware that equation(5.9.4)
can be evaluated rapidly, and simultaneously for all the values of j, by a fast cosine transform.
(See Â§12.3, especially equation 12.3.17.) (We already remarked that the nontrapezoidal form
(5.8.7) can also be done by fast cosine methods, cf. equation 12.3.22.)

Yes, you can do this (and we will give you the algorithm to do it), but we
caution you against it: Evaluating equation (5.10.1), where the coefï¬cient gâs reï¬ect
an underlying Chebyshev approximation, usually requires more signiï¬cant ï¬gures
than evaluation of the Chebyshev sum directly (as by chebev). This is because
the Chebyshev polynomials themselves exhibit a rather delicate cancellation: The
leading coefï¬cient of Tn(x), for example, is 2nâ1; other coefï¬cients of Tn(x) are
even bigger; yet they all manage to combine into a polynomial that lies between Â±1.
Only when m is no larger than 7 or 8 should you contemplate writing a Chebyshev
ï¬t as a direct polynomial, and even in those cases you should be willing to tolerate
two or so signiï¬cant ï¬gures less accuracy than the roundoff limit of your machine.

5.11 Economization of Power Series
One particular application of Chebyshev methods, the economization of power series, is
an occasionally useful technique, with a ï¬avor of getting something for nothing.
Suppose that you are already computing a function by the use of a convergent power
series, for example
f(x) â¡1 âx
3! + x2
5! âx3
7! + Â· Â· Â·
(5.11.1)
(This function is actually sin(âx)/âx, but pretend you donât know that.) You might be
doing a problem that requires evaluating the series many times in some particular interval, say
[0, (2Ï)2]. Everything is ï¬ne, except that the series requires a large number of terms before
its error (approximated by the ï¬rst neglected term, say) is tolerable. In our example, with
x = (2Ï)2, the ï¬rst term smaller than 10â7 is x13/(27!). This then approximates the error
of the ï¬nite series whose last term is x12/(25!).
Notice that because of the large exponent in x13, the error is much smaller than 10â7
everywhere in the interval except at the very largest values of x. This is the feature that allows
âeconomizationâ: if we are willing to let the error elsewhere in the interval rise to about the
same value that the ï¬rst neglected term has at the extreme end of the interval, then we can
replace the 13-term series by one that is signiï¬cantly shorter.
Here are the steps for doing so:

5.11 Economization of Power Series
One particular application of Chebyshev methods, the economization of power series, is
an occasionally useful technique, with a ï¬avor of getting something for nothing.
Suppose that you are already computing a function by the use of a convergent power
series, for example
f(x) â¡1 âx
3! + x2
5! âx3
7! + Â· Â· Â·
(5.11.1)
(This function is actually sin(âx)/âx, but pretend you donât know that.) You might be
doing a problem that requires evaluating the series many times in some particular interval, say
[0, (2Ï)2]. Everything is ï¬ne, except that the series requires a large number of terms before
its error (approximated by the ï¬rst neglected term, say) is tolerable. In our example, with
x = (2Ï)2, the ï¬rst term smaller than 10â7 is x13/(27!). This then approximates the error
of the ï¬nite series whose last term is x12/(25!).
Notice that because of the large exponent in x13, the error is much smaller than 10â7
everywhere in the interval except at the very largest values of x. This is the feature that allows
âeconomizationâ: if we are willing to let the error elsewhere in the interval rise to about the
same value that the ï¬rst neglected term has at the extreme end of the interval, then we can
replace the 13-term series by one that is signiï¬cantly shorter.
Here are the steps for doing so:
1. Change variables from x to y, as in equation (5.8.10), to map the x interval into
â1 â¤y â¤1.
2. Find the coefï¬cients of the Chebyshev sum (like equation 5.8.8) that exactly equals your
truncated power series (the one with enough terms for accuracy).
3. Truncate this Chebyshev series to a smaller number of terms, using the coefï¬cient of the
ï¬rst neglected Chebyshev polynomial as an estimate of the error.

4. Convert back to a polynomial in y.
5. Change variables back to x.
All of these steps can be done numerically, given the coefï¬cients of the original power
series expansion. The ï¬rst step is exactly the inverse of the routine pcshft (Â§5.10), which
mapped a polynomial from y (in the interval [â1, 1]) to x (in the interval [a, b]). But since
equation (5.8.10) is a linear relation between x and y, one can also use pcshft for the
inverse.
The inverse of
pcshft(a,b,d,n)
turns out to be (you can check this)
pcshft
 
â2 âb âa
b âa
,2 âb âa
b âa
,d,n
!
The secondstep requires the inverse operation to that done by the routine chebpc(which
took Chebyshev coefï¬cients into polynomial coefï¬cients). The following routine, pccheb,
accomplishes this, using the formula [1]
xk =

Tkâ2(x) +

(5.11.3)
void pccheb(float d[], float c[], int n)
Inverse of routine chebpc: given an array of polynomial coeï¬cients d[0..n-1], returns an
equivalent array of Chebyshev coeï¬cients c[0..n-1].
{
int j,jm,jp,k;
float fac,pow;
pow=1.0;
Will be powers of 2.
c[0]=2.0*d[0];
for (k=1;k<n;k++) {
Loop over orders of x in the polynomial.
c[k]=0.0;
Zero corresponding order of Chebyshev.
fac=d[k]/pow;
jm=k;
jp=1;
for (j=k;j>=0;j-=2,jm--,jp++) {
Increment this and lower orders of Chebyshev with the combinatorial coeï¬cent times
d[k]; see text for formula.
c[j] += fac;
fac *= ((float)jm)/((float)jp);
}
pow += pow;
}
}
The fourth and ï¬fth steps are accomplished by the routines chebpc and pcshft,
respectively. Here is how the procedure looks all together:

single precision calculations) are somewhere in this range, yielding a polynomial with 8 â
10 terms instead of the original 13.
Replacing a 13-term polynomial with a (say) 10-term polynomial without any loss of
accuracy â that does seem to be getting something for nothing. Is there some magic in
this technique? Not really. The 13-term polynomial deï¬ned a function f(x). Equivalent to
economizing the series, we could instead have evaluated f(x) at enough points to construct
its Chebyshev approximation in the interval of interest, by the methods of Â§5.8. We would
have obtained just the same lower-order polynomial. The principal lesson is that the rate
of convergence of Chebyshev coefï¬cients has nothing to do with the rate of convergence of
power series coefï¬cients; and it is the former that dictates the number of terms needed in a
polynomial approximation. A function might have a divergent power series in some region
of interest, but if the function itself is well-behaved, it will have perfectly good polynomial
approximations. These can be found by the methods of Â§5.8, but not by economization of

Equations (5.12.3) and (5.12.4) furnish M + N + 1 equations for the unknowns a0, . . . , aM
and b1, . . . , bN. The easiest way to see what these equations are is to equate (5.12.1) and
(5.12.2), multiply both by the denominator of equation (5.12.1), and equate all powers of
x that have either aâs or bâs in their coefï¬cients. If we consider only the special case of
a diagonal rational approximation, M = N (cf. Â§3.2), then we have a0 = c0, with the
remaining aâs and bâs satisfying

(5.12.6)
(note, in equation 5.12.1, that b0 = 1). To solve these, start with equations (5.12.5), which
are a set of linear equations for all the unknown bâs. Although the set is in the form of a
Toeplitz matrix (compare equation 2.8.8), experience shows that the equations are frequently
close to singular, so that one should not solve them by the methods of Â§2.8, but rather by
full LU decomposition. Additionally, it is a good idea to reï¬ne the solution by iterative
improvement (routine mprove in Â§2.5) [1].
Once the bâs are known, then equation (5.12.6) gives an explicit formula for the unknown
aâs, completing the solution.
PadÂ´e approximants are typically used when there is some unknown underlying function
f(x). We suppose that you are able somehow to compute, perhaps by laborious analytic
expansions, the values of f(x) and a few of its derivatives at x = 0: f(0), f â²(0), f â²â²(0),
and so on. These are of course the ï¬rst few coefï¬cients in the power series expansion of
f(x); but they are not necessarily getting small, and you have no idea where (or whether)
the power series is convergent.
By contrast with techniques like Chebyshev approximation (Â§5.8) or economization
of power series (Â§5.11) that only condense the information that you already know about a
function, PadÂ´e approximants can give you genuinely new information about your functionâs
values. It is sometimes quite mysterious how well this can work. (Like other mysteries in
mathematics, it relates to analyticity.) An example will illustrate.
Imagine that, by extraordinary labors, you have ground out the ï¬rst ï¬ve terms in the
power series expansion of an unknown function f(x),
f(x) â2 + 1
9 x + 1
81 x2 â
49
8748x3 +
175
78732 x4 + Â· Â· Â·
(5.12.7)
(It is not really necessary that you know the coefï¬cients in exact rational form â numerical
values are just as good. We here write them as rationals to give you the impression that
they derive from some side analytic calculation.) Equation (5.12.7) is plotted as the curve
labeled âpower seriesâ in Figure 5.12.1. One sees that for x >â¼4 it is dominated by its
largest, quartic, term.
We now take the ï¬ve coefï¬cients in equation (5.12.7) and run them through the routine
pade listed below. It returns ï¬ve rational coefï¬cients, three aâs and two bâs, for use in equation
(5.12.1) with M = N = 2. The curve in the ï¬gure labeled âPadÂ´eâ plots the resulting rational
function. Note that both solid curves derive from the same ï¬ve original coefï¬cient values.

The ï¬ve-term power series expansion and the derived ï¬ve-coefï¬cient PadÂ´e approximant
for a sample function f(x).
The full power series converges only for x < 1.
Note that the PadÂ´e
approximant maintains accuracy far outside the radius of convergence of the series.
To evaluate the results, we need Deus ex machina (a useful fellow, when he is available)
to tell us that equation (5.12.7) is in fact the power series expansion of the function
f(x) = [7 + (1 + x)4/3]1/3
(5.12.8)
which is plotted as the dotted curve in the ï¬gure. This function has a branch point at x = â1,
so its power series is convergent only in the range â1 < x < 1.
In most of the range
shown in the ï¬gure, the series is divergent, and the value of its truncation to ï¬ve terms is
rather meaningless. Nevertheless, those ï¬ve terms, converted to a PadÂ´e approximant, give a
remarkably good representation of the function up to at least x â¼10.
Why does this work? Are there not other functions with the same ï¬rst ï¬ve terms in
their power series, but completely different behavior in the range (say) 2 < x < 10? Indeed
there are. PadÂ´e approximation has the uncanny knack of picking the function you had in
mind from among all the possibilities.
Except when it doesnât!
That is the downside of
PadÂ´e approximation: it is uncontrolled. There is, in general, no way to tell how accurate
it is, or how far out in x it can usefully be extended. It is a powerful, but in the end still
mysterious, technique.
Here is the routine that gets aâs and bâs from your câs. Note that the routine is specialized
to the case M = N, and also that, on output, the rational coefï¬cients are arranged in a format
for use with the evaluation routine ratval (Â§5.3). (Also for consistency with that routine,
the array of câs is passed in double precision.)

5.13 Rational Chebyshev Approximation
In Â§5.8 and Â§5.10 we learned how to ï¬nd good polynomial approximations to a given
function f(x) in a given interval a â¤x â¤b. Here, we want to generalize the task to ï¬nd
good approximations that are rational functions (see Â§5.3). The reason for doing so is that,
for some functions and some intervals, the optimal rational function approximation is able
to achieve substantially higher accuracy than the optimal polynomial approximation with the
same number of coefï¬cients. This must be weighed against the fact that ï¬nding a rational
function approximation is not as straightforward as ï¬nding a polynomial approximation,
which, as we saw, could be done elegantly via Chebyshev polynomials.
Let the desired rational function R(x) have numerator of degree m and denominator
of degree k.
Then we have
R(x) â¡p0 + p1x + Â· Â· Â· + pmxm
1 + q1x + Â· Â· Â· + qkxk
âf(x)
for a â¤x â¤b
(5.13.1)
The unknown quantities that we need to ï¬nd are p0, . . . , pm and q1, . . . , qk, that is, m + k+ 1
quantities in all.
Let r(x) denote the deviation of R(x) from f(x), and let r denote its
maximum absolute value,
r(x) â¡R(x) âf(x)
r â¡max
aâ¤xâ¤b |r(x)|
(5.13.2)
The ideal minimax solution would be that choice of pâs and qâs that minimizes r. Obviously
there is some minimax solution, since r is bounded below by zero. How can we ï¬nd it, or
a reasonable approximation to it?
A ï¬rst hint is furnished by the following fundamental theorem: If R(x) is nondegenerate
(has no common polynomial factors in numerator and denominator), then there is a unique
choice of pâs and qâs that minimizes r; for this choice, r(x) has m + k + 2 extrema in
a â¤x â¤b, all of magnitude r and with alternating sign. (We have omitted some technical
assumptions in this theorem. See Ralston [1] for a precise statement.) We thus learn that the
situation with rational functions is quite analogous to that for minimax polynomials: In Â§5.8
we saw that the error term of an nth order approximation, with n + 1 Chebyshev coefï¬cients,
was generally dominated by the ï¬rst neglected Chebyshev term, namely Tn+1, which itself
has n + 2 extrema of equal magnitude and alternating sign. So, here, the number of rational
coefï¬cients, m + k + 1, plays the same role of the number of polynomial coefï¬cients, n + 1.
A different way to see why r(x) should have m + k + 2 extrema is to note that R(x)
can be made exactly equal to f(x) at any m + k + 1 points xi. Multiplying equation (5.13.1)
by its denominator gives the equations
p0 + p1xi + Â· Â· Â· + pmxm
i = f(xi)(1 + q1xi + Â· Â· Â· + qkxk
i )
i = 1, 2, . . . , m + k + 1
(5.13.3)
This is a set of m + k + 1 linear equations for the unknown pâs and qâs, which can be
solved by standard methods (e.g., LU decomposition). If we choose the xiâs to all be in
the interval (a, b), then there will generically be an extremum between each chosen xi and
xi+1, plus also extrema where the function goes out of the interval at a and b, for a total
of m + k + 2 extrema. For arbitrary xiâs, the extrema will not have the same magnitude.
The theorem says that, for one particular choice of xiâs, the magnitudes can be beaten down
to the identical, minimal, value of r.
Instead of making f(xi) and R(xi) equal at the points xi, one can instead force the
residual r(xi) to any desired values yi by solving the linear equations
p0 + p1xi + Â· Â· Â· + pmxm
i = [f(xi) âyi](1 + q1xi + Â· Â· Â· + qkxk
i )
i = 1, 2, . . . , m + k + 1

In fact, if the xiâs are chosen to be the extrema (not the zeros) of the minimax solution,
then the equations satisï¬ed will be
p0 + p1xi + Â· Â· Â· + pmxm
i = [f(xi) Â± r](1 + q1xi + Â· Â· Â· + qkxk
i )
i = 1, 2, . . . , m + k + 2
(5.13.5)
where the Â± alternates for the alternating extrema. Notice that equation (5.13.5) is satisï¬ed at
m + k + 2 extrema, while equation (5.13.4) was satisï¬ed only at m + k + 1 arbitrary points.
How can this be? The answer is that r in equation (5.13.5) is an additional unknown, so that
the number of both equations and unknowns is m + k + 2. True, the set is mildly nonlinear
(in r), but in general it is still perfectly soluble by methods that we will develop in Chapter 9.
We thus see that, given only the locations of the extrema of the minimax rational
function, we can solve for its coefï¬cients and maximum deviation. Additional theorems,
leading up to the so-called Remes algorithms [1], tell how to converge to these locations by
an iterative process. For example, here is a (slightly simpliï¬ed) statement of Remesâ Second
Algorithm: (1) Find an initial rational function with m + k + 2 extrema xi (not having equal
deviation). (2) Solve equation (5.13.5) for new rational coefï¬cients and r. (3) Evaluate the
resulting R(x) to ï¬nd its actual extrema (which will not be the same as the guessed values).
(4) Replace each guessed value with the nearest actual extremum of the same sign. (5) Go
back to step 2 and iterate to convergence. Under a broad set of assumptions, this method will
converge. Ralston [1] ï¬lls in the necessary details, including how to ï¬nd the initial set of xiâs.
Up to this point, our discussion has been textbook-standard. We now reveal ourselves
as heretics. We donât much like the elegant Remes algorithm. Its two nested iterations (on
r in the nonlinear set 5.13.5, and on the new sets of xiâs) are ï¬nicky and require a lot of
special logic for degenerate cases. Even more heretical, we doubt that compulsive searching
for the exactly best, equal deviation, approximation is worth the effort â except perhaps for
those few people in the world whose business it is to ï¬nd optimal approximations that get
built into compilers and microchips.
When we use rational function approximation, the goal is usually much more pragmatic:
Inside some inner loop we are evaluating some function a zillion times, and we want to
speed up its evaluation. Almost never do we need this function to the last bit of machine
accuracy. Suppose (heresy!) we use an approximation whose error has m + k + 2 extrema
whose deviations differ by a factor of 2.
The theorems on which the Remes algorithms
are based guarantee that the perfect minimax solution will have extrema somewhere within
this factor of 2 range â forcing down the higher extrema will cause the lower ones to rise,
until all are equal. So our âsloppyâ approximation is in fact within a fraction of a least
signiï¬cant bit of the minimax one.
That is good enough for us, especially when we have available a very robust method
for ï¬nding the so-called âsloppyâ approximation. Such a method is the least-squares solution
of overdetermined linear equations by singular value decomposition (Â§2.6 and Â§15.4). We
proceed as follows: First, solve (in the least-squares sense) equation (5.13.3), not just for
m + k + 1 values of xi, but for a signiï¬cantly larger number of xiâs, spaced approximately
like the zeros of a high-order Chebyshev polynomial. This gives an initial guess for R(x).
Second, tabulate the resulting deviations, ï¬nd the mean absolute deviation, call it r, and then
solve (again in the least-squares sense) equation (5.13.5) with r ï¬xed and the Â± chosen to be
the sign of the observed deviation at each point xi. Third, repeat the second step a few times.
You can spot some Remes orthodoxy lurking in our algorithm: The equations we solve
are trying to bring the deviations not to zero, but rather to plus-or-minus some consistent
value. However, we dispense with keeping track of actual extrema; and we solve only linear
equations at each stage. One additional trick is to solve a weighted least-squares problem,
where the weights are chosen to beat down the largest deviations fastest.
Here is a program implementing these ideas. Notice that the only calls to the function fn
occur in the initial ï¬lling of the table fs. You could easily modify the code to do this ï¬lling
outside of the routine. It is not even necessary that your abscissas xs be exactly the ones
that we use, though the quality of the ï¬t will deteriorate if you do not have several abscissas
between each extremum of the (underlying) minimax solution.
Notice that the rational
coefï¬cients are output in a format suitable for evaluation by the routine ratval in Â§5.3.

Integration
In computer programming, the technique of choice is not necessarily the most
efï¬cient, or elegant, or fastest executing one. Instead, it may be the one that is quick
to implement, general, and easy to check.
One sometimes needs only a few, or a few thousand, evaluations of a special
function, perhaps a complex valued function of a complex variable, that has many
different parameters, or asymptotic regimes, or both. Use of the usual tricks (series,
continued fractions, rational function approximations, recurrence relations, and so
forth) may result in a patchwork program with tests and branches to different
formulas. While such a program may be highly efï¬cient in execution, it is often not
the shortest way to the answer from a standing start.
A different technique of considerable generality is direct integration of a
functionâs deï¬ning differential equation â an ab initio integration for each desired
function value â along a path in the complex plane if necessary. While this may at
ï¬rst seem like swatting a ï¬y with a golden brick, it turns out that when you already
have the brick, and the ï¬y is asleep right under it, all you have to do is let it fall!
As a speciï¬c example, let us consider the complex hypergeometric func-
tion 2F1(a, b, c; z), which is deï¬ned as the analytic continuation of the so-called
hypergeometric series,
2F1(a, b, c; z) = 1 + ab

The series converges only within the unit circle |z| < 1 (see [1]), but oneâs interest

The hypergeometric function 2F1 is a solution(in fact the solutionthat is regular
at the origin) of the hypergeometric differential equation, which we can write as

tion 2F1(a, b, c; z), which is deï¬ned as the analytic continuation of the so-called
hypergeometric series,
2F1(a, b, c; z) = 1 + ab

(5.14.1)
The series converges only within the unit circle |z| < 1 (see [1]), but oneâs interest
in the function is often not conï¬ned to this region.
The hypergeometric function 2F1 is a solution(in fact the solutionthat is regular
at the origin) of the hypergeometric differential equation, which we can write as
z(1 âz)F â²â² = abF â[c â(a + b + 1)z]F â²

Here prime denotes d/dz. One can see that the equation has regular singular points
at z = 0, 1, and â. Since the desired solution is regular at z = 0, the values 1 and
âwill in general be branch points. If we want 2F1 to be a single valued function,
we must have a branch cut connecting these two points. A conventional position for
this cut is along the positive real axis from 1 to â, though we may wish to keep
open the possibility of altering this choice for some applications.
Our golden brick consists of a collection of routines for the integration of sets
of ordinary differential equations, which we will develop in detail later, in Chapter
16. For now, we need only a high-level, âblack-boxâ routine that integrates such
a set from initial conditions at one value of a (real) independent variable to ï¬nal
conditions at some other value of the independent variable, while automatically
adjusting its internal stepsize to maintain some speciï¬ed accuracy. That routine is
called odeint and, in one particular invocation, calculates its individual steps with
a sophisticated Bulirsch-Stoer technique.
Suppose that we know values for F and its derivative F â² at some value z0, and
that we want to ï¬nd F at some other point z1 in the complex plane. The straight-line
path connecting these two points is parametrized by
z(s) = z0 + s(z1 âz0)
(5.14.3)
with s a real parameter. The differential equation (5.14.2) can now be written as
a set of two ï¬rst-order equations,
dF
ds = (z1 âz0)F â²
dF â²
ds = (z1 âz0)
abF â[c â(a + b + 1)z]F â²
z(1 âz)

(5.14.4)
to be integrated from s = 0 to s = 1. Here F and F â² are to be viewed as two
independent complex variables. The fact that prime means d/dz can be ignored; it
will emerge as a consequence of the ï¬rst equation in (5.14.4). Moreover, the real and
imaginary parts of equation (5.14.4) deï¬ne a set of four real differential equations,
with independent variable s. The complex arithmetic on the right-hand side can be
viewed as mere shorthand for how the four components are to be coupled. It is
precisely this point of view that gets passed to the routine odeint, since it knows
nothing of either complex functions or complex independent variables.
It remains only to decide where to start, and what path to take in the complex
plane, to get to an arbitrary point z. This is where consideration of the functionâs
singularities, and the adopted branch cut, enter. Figure 5.14.1 shows the strategy
that we adopt. For |z| â¤1/2, the series in equation (5.14.1) will in general converge
rapidly, and it makes sense to use it directly. Otherwise, we integrate along a straight
line path from one of the starting points (Â±1/2, 0) or (0, Â±1/2). The former choices
are natural for 0 < Re(z) < 1 and Re(z) < 0, respectively. The latter choices are
used for Re(z) > 1, above and below the branch cut; the purpose of starting away
from the real axis in these cases is to avoid passing too close to the singularity at
z = 1 (see Figure 5.14.1). The location of the branch cut is deï¬ned by the fact that
our adopted strategy never integrates across the real axis for Re (z) > 1.
An implementation of this algorithm is given in Â§6.12 as the routine hypgeo.

A number of variants on the procedure described thus far are possible, and easy
to program. If successively called values of z are close together (withidentical values
of a, b, and c), then you can save the state vector (F, F â²) and the corresponding value
of z on each call, and use these as starting values for the next call. The incremental
integration may then take only one or two steps. Avoid integrating across the branch
cut unintentionally: the function value will be âcorrect,â but not the one you want.
Alternatively, you may wish to integrate to some position z by a dog-leg path
that does cross the real axis Re z > 1, as a means of moving the branch cut. For
example, in some cases you might want to integrate from (0, 1/2) to (3/2, 1/2),
and go from there to any point with Re z > 1 â with either sign of Im z.
(If
you are, for example, ï¬nding roots of a function by an iterative method, you do
not want the integration for nearby values to take different paths around a branch
point. If it does, your root-ï¬nder will see discontinuous function values, and will
likely not converge correctly!)
In any case, be aware that a loss of numerical accuracy can result if you integrate
through a region of large function value on your way to a ï¬nal answer where the
function value is small. (For the hypergeometric function, a particular case of this is
when a and b are both large and positive, with c and x >â¼1.) In such cases, youâll
need to ï¬nd a better dog-leg path.
The general technique of evaluating a function by integrating its differential
equation in the complex plane can also be applied to other special functions. For

example, the complex Bessel function, Airy function, Coulomb wave function, and
Weber function are all special cases of the conï¬uent hypergeometric function, with a
differential equation similar to the one used above (see, e.g., [1] Â§13.6, for a table of
special cases). The conï¬uent hypergeometric function has no singularities at ï¬nitez:
That makes it easy to integrate. However, its essential singularity at inï¬nity means
that it can have, along some paths and for some parameters, highly oscillatory or
exponentially decreasing behavior: That makes it hard to integrate. Some case by
case judgment (or experimentation) is therefore required.

Special Functions
6.0 Introduction
There is nothing particularly special about a special function, except that
some person in authority or textbook writer (not the same thing!) has decided to
bestow the moniker. Special functions are sometimes called higher transcendental
functions (higher than what?) or functions of mathematical physics (but they occur in
other ï¬elds also) or functions that satisfy certain frequently occurring second-order
differential equations (but not all special functions do). One might simply call them
âuseful functionsâ and let it go at that; it is surely only a matter of taste which
functions we have chosen to include in this chapter.
Good commercially available program libraries, such as NAG or IMSL, contain
routines for a number of special functions. These routines are intended for users who
will have no idea what goes on inside them. Such state of the art âblack boxesâ are
often very messy things, full of branches to completely different methods depending
on the value of the calling arguments. Black boxes have, or should have, careful
control of accuracy, to some stated uniform precision in all regimes.
We will not be quite so fastidious in our examples, in part because we want
to illustrate techniques from Chapter 5, and in part because we want you to
understand what goes on in the routines presented. Some of our routines have an
accuracy parameter that can be made as small as desired, while others (especially
those involving polynomial ï¬ts) give only a certain accuracy, one that we believe
serviceable (typically six signiï¬cant ï¬gures or more). We do not certify that the
routines are perfect black boxes. We do hope that, if you ever encounter trouble
in a routine, you will be able to diagnose and correct the problem on the basis of
the information that we have given.
In short, the special function routines of this chapter are meant to be used â
we use them all the time â but we also want you to be prepared to understand
their inner workings.

6.1 Gamma Function, Beta Function, Factorials,
Binomial Coefï¬cients
The gamma function is deï¬ned by the integral
Î(z) =
Z â
0
tzâ1eâtdt
(6.1.1)
When the argument z is an integer, the gamma function is just the familiar factorial
function, but offset by one,
n! = Î(n + 1)
(6.1.2)
The gamma function satisï¬es the recurrence relation
Î(z + 1) = zÎ(z)
(6.1.3)
If the function is known for arguments z > 1 or, more generally, in the half complex
plane Re(z) > 1 it can be obtained for z < 1 or Re (z) < 1 by the reï¬ection formula
Î(1 âz) =
Ï
Î(z) sin(Ïz) =
Ïz
Î(1 + z) sin(Ïz)
(6.1.4)
Notice that Î(z) has a pole at z = 0, and at all negative integer values of z.
There are a variety of methods in use for calculating the function Î(z)
numerically, but none is quite as neat as the approximation derived by Lanczos [1].
This scheme is entirely speciï¬c to the gamma function, seemingly plucked from
thin air.
We will not attempt to derive the approximation, but only state the
resulting formula: For certain integer choices of Î³ and N, and for certain coefï¬cients
c1, c2, . . ., cN, the gamma function is given by
Î(z + 1) = (z + Î³ + 1
2)z+ 1

c2

cN
z + N + Ïµ

(z > 0)
(6.1.5)
You can see that this is a sort of take-off on Stirlingâs approximation, but with a
series of corrections that take into account the ï¬rst few poles in the left complex
plane. The constant c0 is very nearly equal to 1. The error term is parametrized by Ïµ.
For Î³ = 5, N = 6, and a certain set of câs, the error is smaller than |Ïµ| < 2 Ã 10â10.
Impressed? If not, then perhaps you will be impressed by the fact that (with these
same parameters) the formula (6.1.5) and bound on Ïµ apply for the complex gamma
function, everywhere in the half complex plane Re z > 0.

It is better to implement lnÎ(x) than Î(x), since the latter will overï¬ow many
computersâ ï¬oating-point representation at quite modest values of x.
Often the
gamma function is used in calculations where the large values of Î(x) are divided by
other large numbers, with the result being a perfectly ordinaryvalue. Such operations
would normally be coded as subtraction of logarithms. With (6.1.5) in hand, we can
compute the logarithm of the gamma function with two calls to a logarithm and 25
or so arithmetic operations. This makes it not much more difï¬cult than other built-in
functions that we take for granted, such as sin x or ex:
#include <math.h>
float gammln(float xx)
Returns the value ln[Î(xx)] for xx > 0.

How shall we write a routine for the factorial function n!?
Generally the
factorial function will be called for small integer values (for large values it will
overï¬ow anyway!), and in most applications the same integer value will be called for
many times. It is a proï¬igate waste of computer time to call exp(gammln(n+1.0))
for each required factorial. Better to go back to basics, holding gammln in reserve
for unlikely calls:
#include <math.h>
float factrl(int n)
Returns the value n! as a ï¬oating-point number.
{
float gammln(float xx);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
static int ntop=4;
static float a[33]={1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,24.0};
Fill in table only as required.
int j;
if (n < 0) nrerror("Negative factorial in routine factrl");
if (n > 32) return exp(gammln(n+1.0));
Larger value than size of table is required. Actually, this big a value is going to overï¬ow
on many computers, but no harm in trying.
while (ntop<n) {
Fill in table up to desired value.
j=ntop++;
a[ntop]=a[j]*ntop;
}
return a[n];
}

A useful point is that factrl will be exact for the smaller values of n, since
ï¬oating-point multiplies on small integers are exact on all computers. This exactness
will not hold if we turn to the logarithm of the factorials. For binomial coefï¬cients,
however, we must do exactly this, since the individual factorials in a binomial
coefï¬cient will overï¬ow long before the coefï¬cient itself will.

The notations P (a, x), Î³(a, x), and Î(a, x) are standard; the notation Q(a, x) is
speciï¬c to this book.
There is a series development for Î³(a, x) as follows:

One does not actually need to compute a new Î(a + 1 + n) for each n; one rather
uses equation (6.1.3) and the previous coefï¬cient.

regimes each requires at most a few times âa terms to converge, and this many
only near x = a, where the incomplete gamma functions are varying most rapidly.
Thus (6.2.5) and (6.2.7) together allow evaluation of the function for all positive
a and x. An extra dividend is that we never need compute a function value near
zero by subtracting two nearly equal numbers. The higher-level functions that return
P (a, x) and Q(a, x) are

Returns the incomplete gamma function P(a, x).

} else {
Use the continued fraction representation

float gammq(float a, float x)
Returns the incomplete gamma function Q(a, x) â¡1 âP(a, x).

return 1.0-gamser;
and take its complement.
} else {
Use the continued fraction representation.
gcf(&gammcf,a,x,&gln);
return gammcf;
}
}
The argument gln is set by both the series and continued fraction procedures
to the value ln Î(a); the reason for this is so that it is available to you if you want to
modify the above two procedures to give Î³(a, x) and Î(a, x), in addition to P (a, x)
and Q(a, x) (cf. equations 6.2.1 and 6.2.3).
The functions gser and gcf which implement (6.2.5) and (6.2.7) are

void gser(float *gamser, float a, float x, float *gln)

Error Function
The error function and complementary error function are special cases of the
incomplete gamma function, and are obtained moderately efï¬ciently by the above
procedures.
Their deï¬nitions are
erf(x) =
2
âÏ
Z x
0
eât2dt
(6.2.8)
and
erfc(x) â¡1 âerf(x) =
2
âÏ
Z â
x
eât2dt
(6.2.9)
The functions have the following limiting values and symmetries:
erf(0) = 0
erf(â) = 1
erf(âx) = âerf(x)
(6.2.10)
erfc(0) = 1
erfc(â) = 0
erfc(âx) = 2 âerfc(x)
(6.2.11)
They are related to the incomplete gamma functions by
erf(x) = P
1
2, x2

(x â¥0)
(6.2.12)
and
erfc(x) = Q
1
2, x2

(x â¥0)
(6.2.13)
Weâll put an extra âfâ into our routine names to avoid conï¬icts with names already
in some C libraries:
float erff(float x)
Returns the error function erf(x).
{
float gammp(float a, float x);
return x < 0.0 ? -gammp(0.5,x*x) : gammp(0.5,x*x);
}
float erffc(float x)
Returns the complementary error function erfc(x).
{
float gammp(float a, float x);
float gammq(float a, float x);
return x < 0.0 ? 1.0+gammp(0.5,x*x) : gammq(0.5,x*x);
}
If you care to do so, you can easily remedy the minor inefï¬ciency in erff and
erffc, namely that Î(0.5) = âÏ is computed unnecessarily when gammp or gammq
is called. Before you do that, however, you might wish to consider the following
routine, based on Chebyshev ï¬tting to an inspired guess as to the functional form:

return x >= 0.0 ? ans : 2.0-ans;
}
There are also some functions of two variables that are special cases of the
incomplete gamma function:
Cumulative Poisson Probability Function
Px(< k), for positive x and integer k â¥1, denotes the cumulative Poisson
probability function. It is deï¬ned as the probability that the number of Poisson
random events occurring will be between 0 and k â1 inclusive, if the expected mean
number is x.
It has the limiting values
Px(< 1) = eâx
Px(< â) = 1
(6.2.14)
Its relation to the incomplete gamma function is simply
Px(< k) = Q(k, x) = gammq(k, x)
(6.2.15)
Chi-Square Probability Function
P (Ï2|Î½) is deï¬ned as the probability that the observed chi-square for a correct
model should be less than a value Ï2. (We will discuss the use of this function in
Chapter 15.) Its complement Q(Ï2|Î½) is the probabilitythat the observed chi-square
will exceed the value Ï2 by chance even for a correct model. In both cases Î½ is an
integer, the number of degrees of freedom. The functions have the limiting values
P (0|Î½) = 0
P (â|Î½) = 1
(6.2.16)
Q(0|Î½) = 1
Q(â|Î½) = 0

(6.3.8)
The ï¬rst square bracket is omitted when n = 1. This method of evaluation has the
advantage that for large n the series converges before reaching the term containing
Ï(n). Accordingly, one needs an algorithm for evaluating Ï(n) only for small n,
n <â¼20 â 40. We use equation (6.3.7), although a table look-up would improve
efï¬ciency slightly.
Amos [1] presents a careful discussion of the truncation error in evaluating
equation (6.3.8), and gives a fairly elaborate termination criterion. We have found
that simply stopping when the last term added is smaller than the required tolerance
works about as well.
Two special cases have to be handled separately:
E0(x) = eâx
x
En(0) =
1
n â1,
n > 1
(6.3.9)
The routine expint allows fast evaluation of En(x) to any accuracy EPS
within the reach of your machineâs word length for ï¬oating-point numbers. The
only modiï¬cation required for increased accuracy is to supply Eulerâs constant with
enough signiï¬cant digits. Wrench [2] can provide you with the ï¬rst 328 digits if
necessary!

that the beta functions in the coefï¬cients can be evaluated for each value of n with
just the previous value and a few multiplies, using equations 6.1.9 and 6.1.3.)
The continued fraction representation proves to be much more useful,

(6.4.6)
This continued fraction converges rapidly for x < (a + 1)/(a + b + 2), taking in
the worst case O(

just use the symmetry relation (6.4.3) to obtain an equivalent computation where the
continued fraction will also converge rapidly. Hence we have

Studentâs Distribution Probability Function
Studentâs distribution, denoted A(t|Î½), is useful in several statistical contexts,
notably in the test of whether two observed distributionshave the same mean. A(t|Î½)
is the probability, for Î½ degrees of freedom, that a certain statistic t (measuring the
observed difference of means) would be smaller than the observed value if the
means were in fact the same. (See Chapter 14 for further details.) Two means are
signiï¬cantly different if, e.g., A(t|Î½) > 0.99. In other words, 1 âA(t|Î½) is the
signiï¬cance level at which the hypothesis that the means are equal is disproved.
The mathematical deï¬nition of the function is
A(t|Î½) =

So, you can use (6.4.9) and the above routine betai to evaluate the function.
F-Distribution Probability Function
This function occurs in the statistical test of whether two observed samples
have the same variance. A certain statistic F , essentially the ratio of the observed
dispersion of the ï¬rst sample to that of the second one, is calculated. (For further
details, see Chapter 14.) The probability that F would be as large as it is if the
ï¬rst sampleâs underlying distribution actually has smaller variance than the secondâs
is denoted Q(F |Î½1, Î½2), where Î½1 and Î½2 are the number of degrees of freedom
in the ï¬rst and second samples, respectively. In other words, Q(F |Î½1, Î½2) is the
signiï¬cance level at which the hypothesis â1 has smaller variance than 2â can be
rejected.
A small numerical value implies a very signiï¬cant rejection, in turn
implying high conï¬dence in the hypothesis â1 has variance greater or equal to 2.â
Q(F |Î½1, Î½2) has the limiting values
Q(0|Î½1, Î½2) = 1
Q(â|Î½1, Î½2) = 0
(6.4.10)
Its relation to the incomplete beta function Ix(a, b) as evaluated by betai above is

(6.4.11)
Cumulative Binomial Probability Distribution
Suppose an event occurs with probability p per trial. Then the probability P of
its occurring k or more times in n trials is termed a cumulative binomial probability,
and is related to the incomplete beta function Ix(a, b) as follows:
P â¡
n
X
j=k
n
j

pj(1 âp)nâj = Ip(k, n âk + 1)
(6.4.12)
For n larger than a dozen or so, betai is a much better way to evaluate the sum in
(6.4.12) than would be the straightforward sum with concurrent computation of the
binomial coefï¬cients. (For n smaller than a dozen, either method is acceptable.)

6.5 Bessel Functions of Integer Order
This section and the next one present practical algorithmsfor computing various
kinds of Bessel functions of integer order. In Â§6.7 we deal with fractional order. In
fact, the more complicated routines for fractional order work ï¬ne for integer order
too. For integer order, however, the routines in this section (and Â§6.6) are simpler
and faster.
Their only drawback is that they are limited by the precision of the
underlying rational approximations. For full double precision, it is best to work with
the routines for fractional order in Â§6.7.
For any real Î½, the Bessel function JÎ½(x) can be deï¬ned by the series
representation
JÎ½(x) =

Î½
â

k=0
(â1
4x2)k
k!Î(Î½ + k + 1)
(6.5.1)
The series converges for all x, but it is not computationally very useful for x â«1.
For Î½ not an integer the Bessel function YÎ½(x) is given by
YÎ½(x) = JÎ½(x) cos(Î½Ï) âJâÎ½(x)
sin(Î½Ï)
(6.5.2)
The right-hand side goes to the correct limiting value Yn(x) as Î½ goes to some
integer n, but this is also not computationally useful.
For arguments x < Î½, both Bessel functions look qualitatively like simple
power laws, with the asymptotic forms for 0 < x âªÎ½

6.5 Bessel Functions of Integer Order
This section and the next one present practical algorithmsfor computing various
kinds of Bessel functions of integer order. In Â§6.7 we deal with fractional order. In
fact, the more complicated routines for fractional order work ï¬ne for integer order
too. For integer order, however, the routines in this section (and Â§6.6) are simpler
and faster.
Their only drawback is that they are limited by the precision of the
underlying rational approximations. For full double precision, it is best to work with
the routines for fractional order in Â§6.7.
For any real Î½, the Bessel function JÎ½(x) can be deï¬ned by the series
representation
JÎ½(x) =
1
2x
Î½
â
X
k=0
(â1
4x2)k
k!Î(Î½ + k + 1)
(6.5.1)
The series converges for all x, but it is not computationally very useful for x â«1.
For Î½ not an integer the Bessel function YÎ½(x) is given by
YÎ½(x) = JÎ½(x) cos(Î½Ï) âJâÎ½(x)
sin(Î½Ï)
(6.5.2)
The right-hand side goes to the correct limiting value Yn(x) as Î½ goes to some
integer n, but this is also not computationally useful.
For arguments x < Î½, both Bessel functions look qualitatively like simple
power laws, with the asymptotic forms for 0 < x âªÎ½

For x > Î½, both Bessel functions look qualitatively like sine or cosine waves whose
amplitude decays as xâ1/2. The asymptotic forms for x â«Î½ are

which holds asymptotically for large Î½.
Figure 6.5.1 plots the ï¬rst few Bessel
functions of each kind.
The Bessel functions satisfy the recurrence relations
Jn+1(x) = 2n
x Jn(x) âJnâ1(x)
(6.5.6)
and
Yn+1(x) = 2n
x Yn(x) âYnâ1(x)
(6.5.7)
As already mentioned in Â§5.5, only the second of these (6.5.7) is stable in the
direction of increasing n for x < n.
The reason that (6.5.6) is unstable in the
direction of increasing n is simply that it is the same recurrence as (6.5.7): A small
amount of âpollutingâ Yn introduced by roundoff error will quickly come to swamp
the desired Jn, according to equation (6.5.3).
A practical strategy for computing the Bessel functions of integer order divides
into two tasks: ï¬rst, how to compute J0, J1, Y0, and Y1, and second, how to use the
recurrence relations stably to ï¬nd other Jâs and Y âs. We treat the ï¬rst task ï¬rst:
For x between zero and some arbitrary value (we will use the value 8),
approximate J0(x) and J1(x) by rational functions in x. Likewise approximate by
rational functions the âregular partâ of Y0(x) and Y1(x), deï¬ned as

We now turn to the second task, namely how to use the recurrence formulas
(6.5.6) and (6.5.7) to get the Bessel functions Jn(x) and Yn(x) for n â¥2. The latter
of these is straightforward, since its upward recurrence is always stable:
float bessy(int n, float x)
Returns the Bessel function Yn(x) for positive x and n â¥2.
{
float bessy0(float x);
float bessy1(float x);
void nrerror(char error_text[]);
int j;
float by,bym,byp,tox;
if (n < 2) nrerror("Index n less than 2 in bessy");
tox=2.0/x;
by=bessy1(x);
Starting values for the recurrence.
bym=bessy0(x);
for (j=1;j<n;j++) {
Recurrence (6.5.7).
byp=j*tox*by-bym;
bym=by;
by=byp;
}
return by;
}
The cost of this algorithm is the call to bessy1 and bessy0 (which generate a
call to each of bessj1 and bessj0), plus O(n) operations in the recurrence.
As for Jn(x), things are a bit more complicated. We can start the recurrence
upward on n from J0 and J1, but it will remain stable only while n does not exceed
x.
This is, however, just ï¬ne for calls with large x and small n, a case which
occurs frequently in practice.
The harder case to provide for is that with x < n. The best thing to do here
is to use Millerâs algorithm (see discussion preceding equation 5.5.16), applying
the recurrence downward from some arbitrary starting value and making use of the
upward-unstable nature of the recurrence to put us onto the correct solution. When
we ï¬nally arrive at J0 or J1 we are able to normalize the solution with the sum
(5.5.16) accumulated along the way.
The only subtlety is in deciding at how large an n we need start the downward
recurrence so as to obtain a desired accuracy by the time we reach the n that we
really want. If you play with the asymptotic forms (6.5.3) and (6.5.5), you should
be able to convince yourself that the answer is to start larger than the desired n by

6.6 Modiï¬ed Bessel Functions of Integer Order
The modiï¬ed Bessel functions In(x) and Kn(x) are equivalent to the usual
Bessel functions Jn and Yn evaluated for purely imaginary arguments. In detail,
the relationship is
In(x) = (âi)nJn(ix)
Kn(x) = Ï
2 in+1[Jn(ix) + iYn(ix)]
(6.6.1)
The particular choice of prefactor and of the linear combination of Jn and Yn to form
Kn are simply choices that make the functions real-valued for real arguments x.
For small arguments x âªn, both In(x) and Kn(x) become, asymptotically,
simple powers of their argument
In(x) â1

Kn(x) â(n â1)!

x

ân
n > 0
(6.6.2)
These expressions are virtually identical to those for Jn(x) and Yn(x) in this region,
except for the factor of â2/Ï difference between Yn(x) and Kn(x). In the region
x â«n, however, the modiï¬ed functions have quite different behavior than the
Bessel functions,
In(x) â
1
â
2Ïx exp(x)
Kn(x) â
Ï
â
2Ïx exp(âx)
(6.6.3)
The modiï¬ed functions evidently have exponential rather than sinusoidal
behavior for large arguments (see Figure 6.6.1). The smoothness of the modiï¬ed
Bessel functions, once the exponential factor is removed, makes a simple polynomial
approximation of a few terms quite suitable for the functions I0, I1, K0, and K1.
The following routines, based on polynomial coefï¬cients given by Abramowitz and
Stegun [1], evaluate these four functions, and will provide the basis for upward
recursion for n > 1 when x > n.

Kn are simply choices that make the functions real-valued for real arguments x.
For small arguments x âªn, both In(x) and Kn(x) become, asymptotically,
simple powers of their argument
In(x) â1

(6.6.2)
These expressions are virtually identical to those for Jn(x) and Yn(x) in this region,
except for the factor of â2/Ï difference between Yn(x) and Kn(x). In the region
x â«n, however, the modiï¬ed functions have quite different behavior than the
Bessel functions,
In(x) â

2Ïx exp(x)
Kn(x) â

â
2Ïx exp(âx)
(6.6.3)
The modiï¬ed functions evidently have exponential rather than sinusoidal
behavior for large arguments (see Figure 6.6.1). The smoothness of the modiï¬ed
Bessel functions, once the exponential factor is removed, makes a simple polynomial
approximation of a few terms quite suitable for the functions I0, I1, K0, and K1.
The following routines, based on polynomial coefï¬cients given by Abramowitz and
Stegun [1], evaluate these four functions, and will provide the basis for upward
recursion for n > 1 when x > n.

The recurrence relation for In(x) and Kn(x) is the same as that for Jn(x)
and Yn(x) provided that ix is substituted for x. This has the effect of changing
a sign in the relation,
In+1(x) = â
2n
x

In(x) + Inâ1(x)
Kn+1(x) = +
2n
x

Kn(x) + Knâ1(x)
(6.6.4)
These relations are always unstable for upward recurrence. For Kn, itself growing,
this presents no problem. For In, however, the strategy of downward recursion is
therefore required once again, and the starting point for the recursion may be chosen
in the same manner as for the routine bessj. The only fundamental difference is
that the normalization formula for In(x) has an alternating minus sign in successive
terms, which again arises from the substitution of ix for x in the formula used
previously for Jn
1 = I0(x) â2I2(x) + 2I4(x) â2I6(x) + Â· Â· Â·
(6.6.5)
In fact, we prefer simply to normalize with a call to bessi0.
With this simple modiï¬cation, the recursion routines bessj and bessy become
the new routines bessi and bessk:
float bessk(int n, float x)
Returns the modiï¬ed Bessel function Kn(x) for positive x and n â¥2.

You can easily derive it from the three-term recurrence relation for Bessel functions: Start with
equation (6.5.6) and use equation (5.5.18). Forward evaluation of the continued fraction by
one of the methods of Â§5.2 is essentially equivalent to backward recurrence of the recurrence
relation. The rate of convergence of CF1 is determined by the position of the turning point
xtp =
p
Î½(Î½ + 1) âÎ½, beyond which the Bessel functions become oscillatory. If x <â¼xtp,
convergenceis very rapid. If x >â¼xtp, then each iteration of the continued fraction effectively
increases Î½ by one until x <â¼xtp; thereafter rapid convergence sets in. Thus the number
of iterations of CF1 is of order x for large x. In the routine bessjy we set the maximum
allowed number of iterations to 10,000.
For larger x, you can use the usual asymptotic
expressions for Bessel functions.
One can show that the sign of JÎ½ is the same as the sign of the denominator of CF1
once it has converged.
The complex continued fraction CF2 is deï¬ned by
p + iq â¡J â²
Î½ + iY â²
Î½
JÎ½ + iYÎ½
= â1
2x + i + i
x
(1/2)2 âÎ½2
2(x + i) +
(3/2)2 âÎ½2
2(x + 2i) + Â· Â· Â·
(6.7.3)
(We sketch the derivation of CF2 in the analogous case of modiï¬ed Bessel functions in the
next subsection.) This continued fraction converges rapidly for x >â¼xtp, while convergence
fails as x â0. We have to adopt a special method for small x, which we describe below. For
x not too small, we can ensure that x >â¼xtp by a stable recurrence of JÎ½ and J â²
Î½ downwards
to a value Î½ = Âµ <â¼x, thus yielding the ratio fÂµ at this lower value of Î½. This is the stable
direction for the recurrence relation. The initial values for the recurrence are
JÎ½ = arbitrary,
J â²
Î½ = fÎ½JÎ½,
(6.7.4)
with the sign of the arbitrary initial value of JÎ½ chosen to be the sign of the denominator of
CF1. Choosing the initial value of JÎ½ very small minimizes the possibility of overï¬ow during
the recurrence. The recurrence relations are
JÎ½â1 = Î½
xJÎ½ + J â²
Î½
J â²
Î½â1 = Î½ â1
x
JÎ½â1 âJÎ½
(6.7.5)
Once CF2 has been evaluated at Î½ = Âµ, then with the Wronskian (6.7.1) we have enough
relations to solvefor all four quantities. Theformulas are simpliï¬ed byintroducing the quantity
Î³ â¡p âfÂµ
q
(6.7.6)
Then
JÂµ = Â±

YÂµ = Î³JÂµ
(6.7.9)
Y â²
Âµ = YÂµ

p + q
Î³

(6.7.10)
The sign of JÂµ in (6.7.7) is chosen to be the same as the sign of the initial JÎ½ in (6.7.4).
Once all four functions have been determined at the value Î½ = Âµ, we can ï¬nd them at the
original value of Î½. For JÎ½ and J â²
Î½, simply scale the values in (6.7.4) by the ratio of (6.7.7) to
the value found after applying the recurrence (6.7.5). The quantities YÎ½ and Y â²
Î½ can be found
by starting with the values in (6.7.9) and (6.7.10) and using the stable upwards recurrence
YÎ½+1 = 2Î½
x YÎ½ âYÎ½â1
(6.7.11)
together with the relation
Y â²
Î½ = Î½

Now turn to the case of small x, when CF2 is not suitable. Temme [2] has given a
good method of evaluating YÎ½ and YÎ½+1, and hence Y â²
Î½ from (6.7.12), by series expansions
that accurately handle the singularity as x â0. The expansions work only for |Î½| â¤1/2,
and so now the recurrence (6.7.5) is used to evaluate fÎ½ at a value Î½ = Âµ in this interval.
Then one calculates JÂµ from
JÂµ =
W
Y â²Âµ âYÂµfÂµ
(6.7.13)
and J â²
Âµ from (6.7.8). The values at the original value of Î½ are determined by scaling as before,
and the Y âs are recurred up as before.
Temmeâs series are
YÎ½ = â

(6.7.14)
Here
ck = (âx2/4)k

(6.7.15)
while the coefï¬cients gk and hk are deï¬ned in terms of quantities pk, qk, and fk that can
be found by recursion:
gk = fk + 2

The whole point of writing the formulas in this way is that the potential problems as Î½ â0
can be controlled by evaluating Î½Ï/ sin Î½Ï, sinh Ï/Ï, and Î1 carefully. In particular, Temme
gives Chebyshev expansions for Î1(Î½) and Î2(Î½). We have rearranged his expansion for Î1
to be explicitly an even series in Î½ so that we can use our routine chebev as explained in Â§5.8.
The routine assumes Î½ â¥0. For negative Î½ you can use the reï¬ection formulas
JâÎ½ = cos Î½Ï JÎ½ âsin Î½Ï YÎ½
YâÎ½ = sin Î½Ï JÎ½ + cos Î½Ï YÎ½
(6.7.19)
The routine also assumes x > 0. For x < 0 the functions are in general complex, but
expressible in terms of functions with x > 0. For x = 0, YÎ½ is singular.

Modiï¬ed Bessel Functions
Steedâs method does not work for modiï¬ed Bessel functions because in this case CF2 is
purely imaginary and we have only three relations among the four functions. Temme [3] has
given a normalization condition that provides the fourth relation.
The Wronskian relation is
W â¡IÎ½Kâ²
Î½ âKÎ½Iâ²
Î½ = â1
x
(6.7.20)
The continued fraction CF1 becomes
fÎ½ â¡Iâ²
Î½
IÎ½ = Î½
x +
1
2(Î½ + 1)/x +
1
2(Î½ + 2)/x + Â· Â· Â·
(6.7.21)
To get CF2 and the normalization condition in a convenient form, consider the sequence
of conï¬uent hypergeometric functions
zn(x) = U(Î½ + 1/2 + n, 2Î½ + 1, 2x)
(6.7.22)
for ï¬xed Î½.
Then
KÎ½(x) = Ï1/2(2x)Î½eâxz0(x)
(6.7.23)
KÎ½+1(x)
KÎ½(x)
= 1
x

Î½ + 1
2 + x +

Î½2 â1
4
 z1
z0

(6.7.24)
Equation (6.7.23) is the standard expression for KÎ½ in terms of a conï¬uent hypergeometric
function, while equation (6.7.24) follows from relations between contiguous conï¬uent hy-
pergeometric functions (equations 13.4.16 and 13.4.18 in Abramowitz and Stegun). Now
the functions zn satisfy the three-term recurrence relation (equation 13.4.15 in Abramowitz
and Stegun)
znâ1(x) = bnzn(x) + an+1zn+1
(6.7.25)
with
bn = 2(n + x)
an+1 = â[(n + 1/2)2 âÎ½2]
(6.7.26)
Following the steps leading to equation (5.5.18), we get the continued fraction CF2
z1
z0 =
1
b1 +
a2
b2 + Â· Â· Â·
(6.7.27)
from which (6.7.24) gives KÎ½+1/KÎ½ and thus Kâ²
Î½/KÎ½.
Temmeâs normalization condition is that
â

n=0
Cnzn =

Î½+1/2
(6.7.28)
where
Cn = (â1)n
n!
Î(Î½ + 1/2 + n)
Î(Î½ + 1/2 ân)
(6.7.29)
Note that the Cnâs can be determined by recursion:
C0 = 1,
Cn+1 = âan+1
n + 1Cn
(6.7.30)
We use the condition (6.7.28) by ï¬nding
S =

X
n=1

(6.7.31)
Then
z0 =

and (6.7.23) gives KÎ½.
Thompson and Barnett [4] have given a clever method of doing the sum (6.7.31)
simultaneously with the forward evaluation of the continued fraction CF2.
Suppose the
continued fraction is being evaluated as
z1
z0 =
â
X
n=0
âhn
(6.7.33)
where the increments âhn are being found by, e.g., Steedâs algorithm or the modiï¬ed Lentzâs
algorithm of Â§5.2. Then the approximation to S keeping the ï¬rst N terms can be found as
SN =
N
X
n=1
Qnâhn
(6.7.34)
Here
Qn =
n
X
k=1
Ckqk
(6.7.35)
and qk is found by recursion from
qk+1 = (qkâ1 âbkqk)/ak+1
(6.7.36)
starting with q0 = 0, q1 = 1. For the case at hand, approximately three times as many terms
are needed to get S to converge as are needed simply for CF2 to converge.
To ï¬nd KÎ½ and KÎ½+1 for small x we use series analogous to (6.7.14):
KÎ½ =
â
X
k=0
ckfk
KÎ½+1 = 2
x
â
X
k=0
ckhk
(6.7.37)
Here
ck = (x2/4)k
k!
hk = âkfk + pk
pk = pkâ1
k âÎ½
qk = qkâ1
k + Î½
fk = kfkâ1 + pkâ1 + qkâ1
k2 âÎ½2
(6.7.38)
The initial values for the recurrences are
p0 = 1
2
x

âÎ½
Î(1 + Î½)
q0 = 1

x

cosh ÏÎ1(Î½) + sinh Ï
Ï
ln
 2
x

Î2(Î½)

(6.7.39)
Both the series for small x, and CF2 and the normalization relation (6.7.28) require
|Î½| â¤1/2. In both cases, therefore, we recurse IÎ½ down to a value Î½ = Âµ in this interval, ï¬nd
KÂµ there, and recurse KÎ½ back up to the original value of Î½.
The routine assumes Î½ â¥0. For negative Î½ use the reï¬ection formulas
IâÎ½ = IÎ½ + 2
Ï sin(Î½Ï) KÎ½
KâÎ½ = KÎ½
(6.7.40)
Note that for large x, IÎ½ â¼ex, KÎ½ â¼eâx, and so these functions will overï¬ow or
underï¬ow. It is often desirable to be able to compute the scaled quantities eâxIÎ½ and exKÎ½.
Simply omitting the factor eâx in equation (6.7.23) will ensure that all four quantities will
have the appropriate scaling. If you also want to scale the four quantities for small x when
the series in equation (6.7.37) are used, you must multiply each series by ex.

Spherical Bessel Functions
For integer n, spherical Bessel functions are deï¬ned by
jn(x) =

2xJn+(1/2)(x)
yn(x) =
r
Ï
2xYn+(1/2)(x)
(6.7.47)
They can be evaluated by a call to bessjy, and the derivatives can safely be found from
the derivatives of equation (6.7.47).
Note that in the continued fraction CF2 in (6.7.3) just the ï¬rst term survives forÎ½ = 1/2.
Thus one can make a very simple algorithm for spherical Bessel functions along the lines of
bessjy by always recursing jn down to n = 0, setting p and q from the ï¬rst term in CF2, and
then recursing yn up. No special series is required near x = 0. However, bessjy is already
so efï¬cient that we have not bothered to provide an independent routine for spherical Bessels.

6.8 Spherical Harmonics
Spherical harmonics occur in a large variety of physical problems, for ex-
ample, whenever a wave equation, or Laplaceâs equation, is solved by separa-
tion of variables in spherical coordinates.
The spherical harmonic Ylm(Î¸, Ï),
âl â¤m â¤l, is a function of the two coordinates Î¸, Ï on the surface of a sphere.
The spherical harmonics are orthogonal for different l and m, and they are
normalized so that their integrated square over the sphere is unity:
Z 2Ï
0
dÏ
Z 1
â1
d(cos Î¸)Ylâ²mâ²*(Î¸, Ï)Ylm(Î¸, Ï) = Î´lâ²lÎ´mâ²m
(6.8.1)
Here asterisk denotes complex conjugation.
Mathematically, the spherical harmonics are related to associated Legendre
polynomials by the equation
Ylm(Î¸, Ï) =
s
2l + 1
4Ï
(l âm)!
(l + m)!P m
l (cos Î¸)eimÏ
(6.8.2)
By using the relation
Yl,âm(Î¸, Ï) = (â1)mYlm*(Î¸, Ï)
(6.8.3)
we can always relate a spherical harmonic to an associated Legendre polynomial
with m â¥0. With x â¡cos Î¸, these are deï¬ned in terms of the ordinary Legendre
polynomials (cf. Â§4.5 and Â§5.5) by
P m
l (x) = (â1)m(1 âx2)m/2 dm

(6.8.6)
where the polynomial continues up through the term in (1 âx)lâm. (See [1] for
this and related formulas.) This is not a satisfactory method because evaluation
of the polynomial involves delicate cancellations between successive terms, which
alternate in sign. For large l, the individual terms in the polynomial become very
much larger than their sum, and all accuracy is lost.
In practice, (6.8.6) can be used only in single precision (32-bit) for l up
to 6 or 8, and in double precision (64-bit) for l up to 15 or 18, depending on
the precision required for the answer. A more robust computational procedure is
therefore desirable, as follows:
The associated Legendre functions satisfy numerous recurrence relations, tab-
ulated in [1-2]. These are recurrences on l alone, on m alone, and on both l and
m simultaneously.
Most of the recurrences involving m are unstable, and so
dangerous for numerical work. The following recurrence on l is, however, stable
(compare 5.5.1):
(l âm)P m
l
= x(2l â1)P m
lâ1 â(l + m â1)P m
lâ2
(6.8.7)
It is useful because there is a closed-form expression for the starting value,
P m
m = (â1)m(2m â1)!!(1 âx2)m/2
(6.8.8)
(The notation n!! denotes the product of all odd integers less than or equal to n.)
Using (6.8.7) with l = m + 1, and setting P m
mâ1 = 0, we ï¬nd
P m
m+1 = x(2m + 1)P m
m
(6.8.9)
Equations (6.8.8) and (6.8.9) provide the two starting values required for (6.8.7)
for general l.
The function that implements this is

In the last line we have converted the âstandardâ form of the continued fraction to
its âevenâ form (see Â§5.2), which converges twice as fast. We must be careful not
to evaluate the alternating series (6.9.2) at too large a value of x; inspection of the
terms shows that x = 1.5 is a good point to switch over to the continued fraction.

Thus the precision of the routine frenel may be limited by the precision of the
library routines for sine and cosine for large x.

In the last line we have converted the âstandardâ form of the continued fraction to
its âevenâ form (see Â§5.2), which converges twice as fast. We must be careful not
to evaluate the alternating series (6.9.2) at too large a value of x; inspection of the
terms shows that x = 1.5 is a good point to switch over to the continued fraction.
Note that for large x

S(x) â¼1

(6.9.5)
Thus the precision of the routine frenel may be limited by the precision of the
library routines for sine and cosine for large x.

Cosine and Sine Integrals
The cosine and sine integrals are deï¬ned by
Ci(x) = Î³ + ln x +
Z x

cos t â1
t
dt
Si(x) =
Z x
0
sin t
t
dt
(6.9.6)
Here Î³ â0.5772 . . . is Eulerâs constant.
We only need a way to calculate the
functions for x > 0, because
Si(âx) = âSi(x),
Ci(âx) = Ci(x) âiÏ
(6.9.7)
Once again we can evaluate these functions by a judicious combination of
power series and complex continued fraction. The series are
Si(x) = x â
x3
3 Â· 3! +
x5
5 Â· 5! âÂ· Â· Â·
Ci(x) = Î³ + ln x +

âx2
2 Â· 2! +
x4
4 Â· 4! âÂ· Â· Â·

(6.9.8)
The continued fraction for the exponential integral E1(ix) is
E1(ix) = âCi(x) + i[Si(x) âÏ/2]
= eâix

1
ix +

5 + ix âÂ· Â· Â·

(6.9.9)
The âevenâ form of the continued fraction is given in the last line and converges
twice as fast for about the same amount of computation. A good crossover point
from the alternating series to the continued fraction is x = 2 in this case. As for
the Fresnel integrals, for large x the precision may be limited by the precision of
the sine and cosine routines.

evaluated. Advantage is also taken of the symmetry of the coefï¬cients eâ(nâ²h)2 by
breaking the summation up into positive and negative values of nâ² separately.
In the following routine, the choices h = 0.4 and N = 11 are made. Because
of the symmetry of the summations and the restriction to odd values of n, the limits
on the do loops are 1 to 6. The accuracy of the result in this float version is about
2 Ã 10â7. In order to maintain relative accuracy near x = 0, where F (x) vanishes,
the program branches to the evaluation of the power series [2] for F (x), for |x| < 0.2.

6.11 Elliptic Integrals and Jacobian Elliptic
Functions
Elliptic integrals occur in many applications, because any integral of the form
Z
R(t, s) dt
(6.11.1)
where R is a rational function of t and s, and s is the square root of a cubic or
quartic polynomial in t, can be evaluated in terms of elliptic integrals. Standard
references [1] describe how to carry out the reduction, which was originally done
by Legendre. Legendre showed that only three basic elliptic integrals are required.
The simplest of these is
I1 =
Z x
y
dt
p
(a1 + b1t)(a2 + b2t)(a3 + b3t)(a4 + b4t)
(6.11.2)
where we have written the quartic s2 in factored form. In standard integral tables [2],
one of the limits of integration is always a zero of the quartic, while the other limit
lies closer than the next zero, so that there is no singularity within the interval. To
evaluate I1, we simply break the interval [y, x] into subintervals, each of which
either begins or ends on a singularity. The tables, therefore, need only distinguish
the eight cases in which each of the four zeros (ordered according to size) appears as
the upper or lower limit of integration. In addition, when one of the bâs in (6.11.2)
tends to zero, the quartic reduces to a cubic, with the largest or smallest singularity
moving to Â±â; this leads to eight more cases (actually just special cases of the ï¬rst
eight). The sixteen cases in total are then usually tabulated in terms of Legendreâs
standard elliptic integral of the 1st kind, which we will deï¬ne below. By a change of
the variable of integration t, the zeros of the quartic are mapped to standard locations
on the real axis. Then only two dimensionless parameters are needed to tabulate
Legendreâs integral. However, the symmetry of the original integral (6.11.2) under
permutation of the roots is concealed in Legendreâs notation. We will get back to
Legendreâs notation below. But ï¬rst, here is a better way:

eight). The sixteen cases in total are then usually tabulated in terms of Legendreâs
standard elliptic integral of the 1st kind, which we will deï¬ne below. By a change of
the variable of integration t, the zeros of the quartic are mapped to standard locations
on the real axis. Then only two dimensionless parameters are needed to tabulate
Legendreâs integral. However, the symmetry of the original integral (6.11.2) under
permutation of the roots is concealed in Legendreâs notation. We will get back to
Legendreâs notation below. But ï¬rst, here is a better way:
Carlson [3] has given a new deï¬nition of a standard elliptic integral of the ï¬rst kind,
RF (x, y, z) = 1

where x, y, and z are nonnegative and at most one is zero.
By standardizing the range
of integration, he retains permutation symmetry for the zeros. (Weierstrassâ canonical form
also has this property.)
Carlson ï¬rst shows that when x or y is a zero of the quartic in
(6.11.2), the integral I1 can be written in terms of RF in a form that is symmetric under
permutation of the remaining three zeros. In the general case when neither x nor y is a
zero, two such RF functions can be combined into a single one by an addition theorem,
leading to the fundamental formula
I1 = 2RF (U 2
12, U 2
13, U 2
14)
(6.11.4)
where
Uij = (XiXjYkYm + YiYjXkXm)/(x ây)
(6.11.5)
Xi = (ai + bix)1/2,
Yi = (ai + biy)1/2
(6.11.6)
and i, j,k, m is any permutation of 1, 2, 3, 4. A short-cut in evaluating these expressions is
U 2
13 = U 2
12 â(a1b4 âa4b1)(a2b3 âa3b2)
U 2
14 = U 2
12 â(a1b3 âa3b1)(a2b4 âa4b2)
(6.11.7)
The Uâs correspond to the three ways of pairing the four zeros, and I1 is thus manifestly
symmetric under permutation of the zeros. Equation (6.11.4) therefore reproduces all sixteen
cases when one limit is a zero, and also includes the cases when neither limit is a zero.
Thus Carlsonâs function allows arbitrary ranges of integration and arbitrary positions of
the branch points of the integrand relative to the interval of integration. To handle elliptic
integrals of the second and third kind, Carlson deï¬nes the standard integral of the third kind as
RJ(x, y, z,p) = 3
2
Z â
0
dt
(t + p)
p
(t + x)(t + y)(t + z)
(6.11.8)
which is symmetric in x, y, and z.
The degenerate case when two arguments are equal
is denoted
RD(x, y, z) = RJ(x, y, z, z)
(6.11.9)
and is symmetric in x and y. The function RD replaces Legendreâs integral of the second
kind. The degenerate form of RF is denoted
RC(x, y) = RF (x, y, y)
(6.11.10)
It embraces logarithmic, inverse circular, and inverse hyperbolic functions.
Carlson [4-7] gives integral tables in terms of the exponents of the linear factors of
the quartic in (6.11.1). For example, the integral where the exponents are (1
2, 1
2 ,â1
2,â3
2)
can be expressed as a single integral in terms of RD; it accounts for 144 separate cases in
Gradshteyn and Ryzhik [2]!
Refer to Carlsonâs papers [3-7] for some of the practical details in reducing elliptic
integrals to his standard forms, such as handling complex conjugate zeros.
Turn now to the numerical evaluation of elliptic integrals. The traditional methods [8]
are Gauss or Landen transformations.
Descending transformations decrease the modulus
k of the Legendre integrals towards zero, increasing transformations increase it towards
unity. In these limits the functions have simple analytic expressions. While these methods
converge quadratically and are quite satisfactory for integrals of the ï¬rst and second kinds,
they generally lead to loss of signiï¬cant ï¬gures in certain regimes for integrals of the third
kind. Carlsonâs algorithms [9,10], by contrast, provide a uniï¬ed method for all three kinds
with no signiï¬cant cancellations.
The key ingredient in these algorithms is the duplication theorem:

where
Î» = (xy)1/2 + (xz)1/2 + (yz)1/2
(6.11.12)
This theorem can be proved by a simple change of variable of integration [11]. Equation
(6.11.11) is iterated until the arguments of RF are nearly equal. For equal arguments we have
RF (x, x, x) = xâ1/2
(6.11.13)
When the arguments are close enough, the function is evaluated from a ï¬xed Taylor expansion
about (6.11.13) through ï¬fth-order terms. While the iterative part of the algorithm is only
linearly convergent, the error ultimately decreases by a factor of 46 = 4096 for each iteration.
Typically only two or three iterations are required, perhaps six or seven if the initial values
of the arguments have huge ratios.
We list the algorithm for RF here, and refer you to
Carlsonâs paper [9] for the other cases.
Stage 1: For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . compute
Âµn = (xn + yn + zn)/3
Xn = 1 â(xn/Âµn),
Yn = 1 â(yn/Âµn),
Zn = 1 â(zn/Âµn)
Ïµn = max(|Xn|, |Yn|, |Zn|)
If Ïµn < tol go to Stage 2; else compute
Î»n = (xnyn)1/2 + (xnzn)1/2 + (ynzn)1/2
xn+1 = (xn + Î»n)/4,
yn+1 = (yn + Î»n)/4,
zn+1 = (zn + Î»n)/4
and repeat this stage.

In some applications the argument p in RJ or the argument y in RC is negative, and the
Cauchy principal value of the integral is required. This is easily handled by using the formulas
RJ(x, y,z, p) =
[(Î³ ây)RJ(x, y, z, Î³) â3RF (x, y, z) + 3RC(xz/y,pÎ³/y)] /(y âp)
(6.11.14)
where
Î³ â¡y + (z ây)(y âx)
y âp
(6.11.15)
is positive if p is negative, and
RC(x, y) =

x
x ây

RC(x ây, ây)
(6.11.16)
The Cauchy principal value of RJ has a zero at some value of p < 0, so (6.11.14) will give
some loss of signiï¬cant ï¬gures near the zero.

A value of 0.08 for the error tolerance parameter is adequate for single precision (7
signiï¬cant digits). Since the error scales as Ïµ6
n, we see that 0.0025 will yield double precision
(16 signiï¬cant digits) and require at most two or three more iterations. Since the coefï¬cients
of the sixth-order truncation error are different for the other elliptic functions, these values for
the error tolerance should be changedto 0.04 and 0.0012 in the algorithm for RC, and 0.05 and
0.0015 for RJ and RD. As well as being an algorithm in its own right for certain combinations
of elementary functions, the algorithm for RC is used repeatedly in the computation of RJ.
The C implementations test the input arguments against two machine-dependent con-
stants, TINY and BIG, to ensure that there will be no underï¬ow or overï¬ow during the
computation. We have chosen conservative values, corresponding to a machine minimum
of 3 Ã 10â39 and a machine maximum of 1.7 Ã 1038. You can always extend the range of
admissible argument values by using the homogeneity relations (6.11.22), below.

float ellpi(float phi, float en, float ak)
Legendre elliptic integral of the 3rd kind Î (Ï, n, k), evaluated using Carlsonâs functions RJ and
RF . (Note that the sign convention on n is opposite that of Abramowitz and Stegun.) The
ranges of Ï and k are 0 â¤Ï â¤Ï/2, 0 â¤k sin Ï â¤1.
{
float rf(float x, float y, float z);
float rj(float x, float y, float z, float p);
float cc,enss,q,s;
s=sin(phi);
enss=en*s*s;
cc=SQR(cos(phi));
q=(1.0-s*ak)*(1.0+s*ak);
return s*(rf(cc,q,1.0)-enss*rj(cc,q,1.0,1.0+enss)/3.0);
}
Carlsonâs functions are homogeneous of degree â1
2 and â3
2, so
RF(Î»x, Î»y, Î»z) = Î»â1/2RF(x, y, z)
RJ(Î»x, Î»y, Î»z, Î»p) = Î»â3/2RJ(x, y, z, p)
(6.11.22)
Thus to express a Carlson function in Legendreâs notation, permute the ï¬rst three
arguments into ascending order, use homogeneity to scale the third argument to be
1, and then use equations (6.11.19)â(6.11.21).
Jacobian Elliptic Functions
The Jacobian elliptic function sn is deï¬ned as follows: instead of considering
the elliptic integral
u(y, k) â¡u = F (Ï, k)
(6.11.23)
consider the inverse function
y = sin Ï = sn(u, k)
(6.11.24)
Equivalently,
u =
Z sn
0
dy
p
(1 ây2)(1 âk2y2)
(6.11.25)
When k = 0, sn is just sin. The functions cn and dn are deï¬ned by the relations
sn2 + cn2 = 1,
k2sn2 + dn2 = 1
(6.11.26)
The routine given below actually takes mc â¡k2
c = 1 âk2 as an input parameter.
It also computes all three functions sn, cn, and dn since computing all three is no
harder than computing any one of them. For a description of the method, see [8].

6.12 Hypergeometric Functions
As was discussed in Â§5.14, a fast, general routine for the the complex hyperge-
ometric function 2F1(a, b, c; z), is difï¬cult or impossible. The function is deï¬ned as
the analytic continuation of the hypergeometric series,
2F1(a, b, c; z) = 1 + ab
c
z
1! + a(a + 1)b(b + 1)
c(c + 1)
z2
2! + Â· Â· Â·
+ a(a + 1) . . .(a + j â1)b(b + 1) . . .(b + j â1)
c(c + 1) . . .(c + j â1)
zj
j! + Â· Â· Â·
(6.12.1)
This series converges only within the unit circle |z| < 1 (see [1]), but oneâs interest
in the function is not conï¬ned to this region.
Section 5.14 discussed the method of evaluating this function by direct path
integration in the complex plane. We here merely list the routines that result.
Implementation of the function hypgeo is straightforward, and is described by
comments in the program. The machinery associated with Chapter 16âs routine for
integrating differential equations, odeint, is only minimally intrusive, and need not
even be completely understood: use of odeint requires one zeroed global variable,
one function call, and a prescribed format for the derivative routine hypdrv.
The function hypgeo will fail, of course, for values of z too close to the
singularity at 1. (If you need to approach this singularity, or the one at â, use
the âlinear transformation formulasâ in Â§15.3 of [1].) Away from z = 1, and for
moderate values of a, b, c, it is often remarkable how few steps are required to
integrate the equations. A half-dozen is typical.

Chapter 7.
Random Numbers
7.0 Introduction
It may seem perverse to use a computer, that most precise and deterministic of
all machines conceived by the human mind, to produce ârandomâ numbers. More
than perverse, it may seem to be a conceptual impossibility. Any program, after all,
will produce output that is entirely predictable, hence not truly ârandom.â
Nevertheless, practical computer ârandom number generatorsâ are in common
use. We will leave it to philosophers of the computer age to resolve the paradox in
a deep way (see, e.g., Knuth [1] Â§3.5 for discussion and references). One sometimes
hears computer-generated sequences termed pseudo-random, while the word random
is reserved for the output of an intrinsicallyrandom physical process, like the elapsed
time between clicks of a Geiger counter placed next to a sample of some radioactive
element. We will not try to make such ï¬ne distinctions.
A working, though imprecise, deï¬nition of randomness in the context of
computer-generated sequences, is to say that the deterministic program that produces
a random sequence should be different from, and â in all measurable respects â
statistically uncorrelated with, the computer program that uses its output. In other
words, any two different random number generators ought to produce statistically
the same results when coupled to your particular applications program. If they donât,
then at least one of them is not (from your point of view) a good generator.
The above deï¬nition may seem circular, comparing, as it does, one generator to
another. However, there exists a body of random number generators which mutually
do satisfy the deï¬nition over a very, very broad class of applications programs.
And it is also found empirically that statistically identical results are obtained from
random numbers produced by physical processes. So, because such generators are
known to exist, we can leave to the philosophers the problem of deï¬ning them.
A pragmatic point of view, then, is that randomness is in the eye of the beholder
(or programmer). What is random enough for one application may not be random
enough for another. Still, one is not entirely adrift in a sea of incommensurable
applications programs: There is a certain list of statistical tests, some sensible and
some merely enshrined by history, which on the whole will do a very good job
of ferreting out any correlations that are likely to be detected by an applications
program (in this case, yours). Good random number generators ought to pass all of
these tests; or at least the user had better be aware of any that they fail, so that he or
she will be able to judge whether they are relevant to the case at hand.

As for references on this subject, the one to turn to ï¬rst is Knuth [1]. Then
try [2]. Only a few of the standard books on numerical methods [3-4] treat topics
relating to random numbers.

7.1 Uniform Deviates
Uniform deviates are just random numbers that lie within a speciï¬ed range
(typically 0 to 1), with any one number in the range just as likely as any other. They
are, in other words, what you probably think ârandom numbersâ are.
However,
we want to distinguish uniform deviates from other sorts of random numbers, for
example numbers drawn from a normal (Gaussian) distribution of speciï¬ed mean
and standard deviation. These other sorts of deviates are almost always generated by
performing appropriate operations on one or more uniform deviates, as we will see
in subsequent sections. So, a reliable source of random uniform deviates, the subject
of this section, is an essential building block for any sort of stochastic modeling
or Monte Carlo computer work.
System-Supplied Random Number Generators
Most C implementations have, lurking within, a pair of library routines for
initializing, and then generating, ârandom numbers.â In ANSI C, the synopsis is:
#include <stdlib.h>
#define RAND_MAX ...
void srand(unsigned seed);
int rand(void);
You initialize the random number generator by invoking srand(seed) with
some arbitrary seed.
Each initializing value will typically result in a different
random sequence, or a least a different starting point in some one enormously long

7.1 Uniform Deviates
Uniform deviates are just random numbers that lie within a speciï¬ed range
(typically 0 to 1), with any one number in the range just as likely as any other. They
are, in other words, what you probably think ârandom numbersâ are.
However,
we want to distinguish uniform deviates from other sorts of random numbers, for
example numbers drawn from a normal (Gaussian) distribution of speciï¬ed mean
and standard deviation. These other sorts of deviates are almost always generated by
performing appropriate operations on one or more uniform deviates, as we will see
in subsequent sections. So, a reliable source of random uniform deviates, the subject
of this section, is an essential building block for any sort of stochastic modeling
or Monte Carlo computer work.
System-Supplied Random Number Generators
Most C implementations have, lurking within, a pair of library routines for
initializing, and then generating, ârandom numbers.â In ANSI C, the synopsis is:
#include <stdlib.h>
#define RAND_MAX ...
void srand(unsigned seed);
int rand(void);
You initialize the random number generator by invoking srand(seed) with
some arbitrary seed.
Each initializing value will typically result in a different
random sequence, or a least a different starting point in some one enormously long
sequence. The same initializing value of seed will always return the same random
sequence, however.
You obtain successive random numbers in the sequence by successive calls to
rand().
That function returns an integer that is typically in the range 0 to the
largest representable positive value of type int (inclusive). Usually, as in ANSI C,
this largest value is available as RAND_MAX, but sometimes you have to ï¬gure it out
for yourself. If you want a random float value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0
(exclusive), you get it by an expression like

x = rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.0);
Now our ï¬rst, and perhaps most important, lesson in this chapter is: be very,
very suspicious of a system-supplied rand() that resembles the one just described.
If all scientiï¬c papers whose results are in doubt because of bad rand()s were
to disappear from library shelves, there would be a gap on each shelf about as
big as your ï¬st. System-supplied rand()s are almost always linear congruential
generators, which generate a sequence of integers I1, I2, I3, . . ., each between 0 and
m â1 (e.g., RAND_MAX) by the recurrence relation
Ij+1 = aIj + c
(mod m)
(7.1.1)
Here m is called the modulus, and a and c are positive integers called the multiplier
and the increment respectively. The recurrence (7.1.1) will eventually repeat itself,
with a period that is obviously no greater than m. If m, a, and c are properly chosen,
then the period will be of maximal length, i.e., of length m. In that case, all possible
integers between 0 and m â1 occur at some point, so any initial âseedâ choice of I0
is as good as any other: the sequence just takes off from that point.
Although this general framework is powerful enough to provide quite decent
random numbers, its implementation in many, if not most, ANSI C libraries is quite
ï¬awed; quite a number of implementations are in the category âtotally botched.â
Blame should be apportioned about equally between the ANSI C committee and
the implementors. The typical problems are these: First, since the ANSI standard
speciï¬es that rand() return a value of type int â which is only a two-byte quantity
on many machines â RAND_MAX is often not very large. The ANSI C standard
requires only that it be at least 32767. This can be disastrous in many circumstances:
for a Monte Carlo integration (Â§7.6 and Â§7.8), you might well want to evaluate 106
different points, but actually be evaluating the same 32767 points 30 times each, not
at all the same thing! You should categorically reject any library random number
routine with a two-byte returned value.
Second, the ANSI committeeâs published rationale includes the following
mischievous passage: âThe committee decided that an implementation should be
allowed to provide a rand function which generates the best random sequence
possible in that implementation, and therefore mandated no standard algorithm. It
recognized the value, however, of being able to generate the same pseudo-random
sequence in different implementations, and so it has published an example. . ..
[emphasis added]â The âexampleâ is
unsigned long next=1;
int rand(void) /* NOT RECOMMENDED (see text) */
{
next = next*1103515245 + 12345;
return (unsigned int)(next/65536) % 32768;
}
void srand(unsigned int seed)
{
next=seed;
}

This corresponds to equation(7.1.1) witha = 1103515245,c = 12345, and m = 232
(since arithmetic done on unsigned long quantities is guaranteed to return the
correct low-order bits). These are not particularly good choices for a and c, though
they are not gross embarrassments by themselves. The real botches occur when
implementors, taking the committeeâs statement above as license, try to âimproveâ
on the published example. For example, one popular 32-bit PC-compatible compiler
provides a long generator that uses the above congruence, but swaps the high-order
and low-order 16 bits of the returned value. Somebody probably thought that this
extra ï¬ourish added randomness; in fact it ruins the generator. While these kinds of
blunders can, of course, be ï¬xed, there remains a fundamental ï¬aw in simple linear
congruential generators, which we now discuss.
The linear congruential method has the advantage of being very fast, requiring
only a few operations per call, hence its almost universal use. It has the disadvantage
that it is not free of sequential correlation on successive calls. If k random numbers at
a time are used to plot points in k dimensional space (with each coordinate between
0 and 1), then the points will not tend to âï¬ll upâ the k-dimensional space, but rather
will lie on (k â1)-dimensional âplanes.â There will be at most about m1/k such
planes. If the constants m, a, and c are not very carefully chosen, there will be many
fewer than that. If m is as bad as 32768, then the number of planes on which triples
of points lie in three-dimensional space will be no greater than about the cube root
of 32768, or 32. Even if m is close to the machineâs largest representable integer,
e.g., â¼232, the number of planes on which triples of points lie in three-dimensional
space is usually no greater than about the cube root of 232, about 1600. You might
well be focusing attention on a physical process that occurs in a small fraction of the
total volume, so that the discreteness of the planes can be very pronounced.
Even worse, you might be using a generator whose choices of m, a, and c have
been botched. One infamous such routine, RANDU, with a = 65539 and m = 231,
was widespread on IBM mainframe computers for many years, and widely copied
onto other systems [1]. One of us recalls producing a ârandomâ plot with only 11
planes, and being told by his computer centerâs programming consultant that he
had misused the random number generator: âWe guarantee that each number is
random individually, but we donât guarantee that more than one of them is random.â
Figure that out.
Correlationink-space is not the onlyweakness oflinear congruentialgenerators.
Such generators often have their low-order (least signiï¬cant) bits much less random
than their high-order bits. If you want to generate a random integer between 1 and
10, you should always do it using high-order bits, as in
j=1+(int) (10.0*rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.0));
and never by anything resembling
j=1+(rand() % 10);
(which uses lower-order bits).
Similarly you should never try to take apart a
ârand()â number into several supposedly random pieces.
Instead use separate
calls for every piece.

Portable Random Number Generators
Park and Miller [1] have surveyed a large number of random number generators
that have been used over the last 30 years or more. Along with a good theoretical
review, they present an anecdotal sampling of a number of inadequate generators
that have come into widespread use. The historical record is nothing if not appalling.
There is good evidence, both theoretical and empirical, that the simple mul-
tiplicative congruential algorithm
Ij+1 = aIj
(mod m)
(7.1.2)
can be as good as any of the more general linear congruential generators that have
c Ì¸= 0 (equation 7.1.1) â if the multiplier a and modulus m are chosen exquisitely
carefully. Park and Miller propose a âMinimal Standardâ generator based on the
choices
a = 75 = 16807
m = 231 â1 = 2147483647
(7.1.3)
First proposed by Lewis, Goodman, and Miller in 1969, this generator has in
subsequent years passed all new theoretical tests, and (perhaps more importantly)
has accumulated a large amount of successful use. Park and Miller do not claim that
the generator is âperfectâ (we will see below that it is not), but only that it is a good
minimal standard against which other generators should be judged.
It is not possible to implement equations (7.1.2) and (7.1.3) directly in a
high-level language, since the product of a and m â1 exceeds the maximum value
for a 32-bit integer.
Assembly language implementation using a 64-bit product
register is straightforward, but not portable from machine to machine.
A trick
due to Schrage [2,3] for multiplying two 32-bit integers modulo a 32-bit constant,
without using any intermediates larger than 32 bits (including a sign bit) is therefore
extremely interesting: It allows the Minimal Standard generator to be implemented
in essentially any programming language on essentially any machine.
Schrageâs algorithm is based on an approximate factorization of m,
m = aq + r,
i.e.,
q = [m/a], r = m mod a
(7.1.4)
with square brackets denoting integer part. If r is small, speciï¬cally r < q, and
0 < z < m â1, it can be shown that both a(z mod q) and r[z/q] lie in the range
0, . . ., m â1, and that
az mod m =

a(z mod q) âr[z/q]
if it is â¥0,
a(z mod q) âr[z/q] + m
otherwise
(7.1.5)
The application of Schrageâs algorithm to the constants (7.1.3) uses the values
q = 127773 and r = 2836.
Here is an implementation of the Minimal Standard generator:

}
The period of ran0 is 231 â2 â2.1 Ã 109. A peculiarity of generators of
the form (7.1.2) is that the value 0 must never be allowed as the initial seed â it
perpetuates itself â and it never occurs for any nonzero initial seed. Experience has
shown that users always manage to call random number generators with the seed
idum=0. That is why ran0 performs its exclusive-or with an arbitrary constant both
on entry and exit. If you are the ï¬rst user in history to be proof against human error,
you can remove the two lines with the â§operation.
Park and Miller discuss two other multipliers a that can be used with the same
m = 231 â1. These are a = 48271 (with q = 44488 and r = 3399) and a = 69621
(with q = 30845 and r = 23902). These can be substituted in the routine ran0
if desired; they may be slightly superior to Lewis et al.âs longer-tested values. No
values other than these should be used.
The routine ran0 is a Minimal Standard, satisfactory for the majority of
applications, but we do not recommend it as the ï¬nal word on random number
generators. Our reason is precisely the simplicity of the Minimal Standard. It is
not hard to think of situations where successive random numbers might be used
in a way that accidentally conï¬icts with the generation algorithm. For example,
since successive numbers differ by a multiple of only 1.6 Ã 104 out of a modulus of
more than 2 Ã 109, very small random numbers will tend to be followed by smaller
than average values. One time in 106, for example, there will be a value < 10â6
returned (as there should be), but this will always be followed by a value less than
about 0.0168. One can easily think of applications involving rare events where this
property would lead to wrong results.
There are other, more subtle, serial correlations present in ran0. For example,
if successive points (Ii, Ii+1) are binned into a two-dimensional plane for i =
1, 2, . . ., N, then the resulting distribution fails the Ï2 test when N is greater than a
few Ã107, much less than the period mâ2. Since low-order serial correlations have
historically been such a bugaboo, and since there is a very simple way to remove

The following routine, ran1, uses the Minimal Standard for its random value,
but it shufï¬es the output to remove low-order serial correlations. A random deviate
derived from the jth value in the sequence, Ij, is output not on the jth call, but rather
on a randomized later call, j +32 on average. The shufï¬ing algorithm is due to Bays
and Durham as described in Knuth [4], and is illustrated in Figure 7.1.1.

The routine ran1 passes those statistical tests that ran0 is known to fail. In
fact, we do not know of any statistical test that ran1 fails to pass, except when the
number of calls starts to become on the order of the period m, say > 108 âm/20.
For situations when even longer random sequences are needed, LâEcuyer [6] has
given a good way of combining two different sequences with different periods so
as to obtain a new sequence whose period is the least common multiple of the two
periods. The basic idea is simply to add the two sequences, modulo the modulus of

either of them (call it m). A trick to avoid an intermediate value that overï¬ows the
integer wordsize is to subtract rather than add, and then add back the constant m â1
if the result is â¤0, so as to wrap around into the desired interval 0, . . ., m â1.
Notice that it is not necessary that this wrapped subtraction be able to reach all
values 0, . . ., m â1 from every value of the ï¬rst sequence. Consider the absurd
extreme case where the value subtracted was only between 1 and 10: The resulting
sequence would still be no less random than the ï¬rst sequence by itself.
As a
practical matter it is only necessary that the second sequence have a range covering
substantially all of the range of the ï¬rst. LâEcuyer recommends the use of the two
generators m1 = 2147483563 (with a1 = 40014, q1 = 53668, r1 = 12211) and
m2 = 2147483399 (with a2 = 40692, q2 = 52774, r2 = 3791).
Both moduli
are slightly less than 231. The periods m1 â1 = 2 Ã 3 Ã 7 Ã 631 Ã 81031 and
m2 â1 = 2 Ã 19 Ã 31 Ã 1019 Ã 1789 share only the factor 2, so the period of
the combined generator is â2.3 Ã 1018. For present computers, period exhaustion
is a practical impossibility.
Combining the two generators breaks up serial correlations to a considerable
extent. We nevertheless recommend the additional shufï¬e that is implemented in
the following routine, ran2. We think that, within the limits of its ï¬oating-point
precision, ran2 provides perfect random numbers; a practical deï¬nition of âperfectâ
is that we will pay $1000 to the ï¬rst reader who convinces us otherwise (by ï¬nding a
statistical test that ran2 fails in a nontrivial way, excluding the ordinary limitations
of a machineâs ï¬oating-point representation).

LâEcuyer [6] lists additional short generators that can be combined into longer
ones, including generators that can be implemented in 16-bit integer arithmetic.
Finally, we give you Knuthâs suggestion [4] for a portable routine, which we
have translated to the present conventions as ran3. This is not based on the linear
congruential method at all, but rather on a subtractive method (see also [5]). One
might hope that its weaknesses, if any, are therefore of a highly different character

from the weaknesses, if any, of ran1 above.
If you ever suspect trouble with
one routine, it is a good idea to try the other in the same application. ran3 has
one nice feature: if your machine is poor on integer arithmetic (i.e., is limited
to 16-bit integers), you can declare mj, mk, and ma[] as float, deï¬ne mbig and
mseed as 4000000 and 1618033, respectively, and the routine will be rendered
entirely ï¬oating-point.
#include <stdlib.h>
Change to math.h in K&R C.
#define MBIG 1000000000
#define MSEED 161803398
#define MZ 0
#define FAC (1.0/MBIG)
According to Knuth, any large MBIG, and any smaller (but still large) MSEED can be substituted
for the above values.
float ran3(long *idum)
Returns a uniform random deviate between 0.0 and 1.0. Set idum to any negative value to
initialize or reinitialize the sequence.
{
static int inext,inextp;
static long ma[56];
The value 56 (range ma[1..55]) is special and
should not be modiï¬ed; see Knuth.
static int iff=0;
long mj,mk;
int i,ii,k;
if (*idum < 0 || iff == 0) {
Initialization.
iff=1;
mj=labs(MSEED-labs(*idum));
Initialize ma[55] using the seed idum and the
large number MSEED.
mj %= MBIG;
ma[55]=mj;
mk=1;
for (i=1;i<=54;i++) {
Now initialize the rest of the table,
ii=(21*i) % 55;
in a slightly random order,
ma[ii]=mk;
with numbers that are not especially random.
mk=mj-mk;
if (mk < MZ) mk += MBIG;
mj=ma[ii];
}
for (k=1;k<=4;k++)
We randomize them by âwarming up the gener-
ator.â
for (i=1;i<=55;i++) {
ma[i] -= ma[1+(i+30) % 55];
if (ma[i] < MZ) ma[i] += MBIG;
}
inext=0;
Prepare indices for our ï¬rst generated number.
inextp=31;
The constant 31 is special; see Knuth.
*idum=1;
}
Here is where we start, except on initialization.
if (++inext == 56) inext=1;
Increment inext and inextp, wrapping around
56 to 1.
if (++inextp == 56) inextp=1;
mj=ma[inext]-ma[inextp];
Generate a new random number subtractively.
if (mj < MZ) mj += MBIG;
Be sure that it is in range.
ma[inext]=mj;
Store it,
return mj*FAC;
and output the derived uniform deviate.

Quick and Dirty Generators
One sometimes would like a âquick and dirtyâ generator to embed in a program, perhaps
taking only one or two lines of code, just to somewhat randomize things. One might wish to

process data from an experiment not always in exactly the same order, for example, so that
the ï¬rst output is more âtypicalâ than might otherwise be the case.
For this kind of application, all we really need is a list of âgoodâ choices for m, a, and
c in equation (7.1.1). If we donât need a period longer than 104 to 106, say, we can keep the
value of (m â1)a + c small enough to avoid overï¬ows that would otherwise mandate the
extra complexity of Schrageâs method (above). We can thus easily embed in our programs
unsigned long jran,ia,ic,im;
float ran;
...
jran=(jran*ia+ic) % im;
ran=(float) jran / (float) im;
whenever we want a quick and dirty uniform deviate, or
jran=(jran*ia+ic) % im;
j=jlo+((jhi-jlo+1)*jran)/im;
whenever we want an integer between jlo and jhi, inclusive. (In both cases jran was once
initialized to any seed value between 0 and im-1.)
Be sure to remember, however, that when im is small, the kth root of it, which is the
number of planes in k-space, is even smaller! So a quick and dirty generator should never
be used to select points in k-space with k > 1.
With these caveats, some âgoodâ choicesfor the constants are given in the accompanying
table. These constants (i) give a period of maximal length im, and, more important, (ii) pass
Knuthâs âspectral testâ for dimensions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The increment ic is a prime, close to
the value ( 1
2 â1
6
â
3)im; actually almost any value of ic that is relatively prime to im will do
just as well, but there is some âloreâ favoring this choice (see [4], p. 84).
An Even Quicker Generator
In C, if you multiply two unsigned long int integers on a machine with a 32-bit long
integer representation, the value returned is the low-order 32 bits of the true 64-bit product. If
we now choose m = 232, the âmodâ in equation (7.1.1) is free, and we have simply
Ij+1 = aIj + c
(7.1.6)
Knuth suggests a = 1664525 as a suitable multiplier for this value of m. H.W. Lewis
has conducted extensive tests of this value of a with c = 1013904223, which is a prime close
to (
â
5 â2)m. The resulting in-line generator (we will call it ranqd1) is simply
unsigned long idum;
...
idum = 1664525L*idum + 1013904223L;
This is about as good as any 32-bit linear congruential generator, entirely adequate for many
uses. And, with only a single multiply and add, it is very fast.
To check whether your machine has the desired integer properties, see if you can
generate the following sequence of 32-bit values (given here in hex): 00000000, 3C6EF35F,
47502932, D1CCF6E9, AAF95334, 6252E503, 9F2EC686, 57FE6C2D, A3D95FA8, 81FD-
BEE7, 94F0AF1A, CBF633B1.
If you need ï¬oating-point values instead of 32-bit integers, and want to avoid a divide by
ï¬oating-point 232, a dirty trick is to mask in an exponentthat makesthe value lie between 1 and
2, then subtract 1.0. The resulting in-line generator (call it ranqd2) will look something like

The hex constants 3F800000 and 007FFFFF are the appropriate ones for computers using
the IEEE representation for 32-bit ï¬oating-point numbers (e.g., IBM PCs and most UNIX
workstations). For DEC VAXes, the correct hex constants are, respectively, 00004080 and
FFFF007F. Notice that the IEEE mask results in the ï¬oating-point number being constructed
out of the 23 low-order bits of the integer, which is not ideal.

It is portable, based on
Park and Millerâs Minimal Standard generator with an additional shufï¬e, and has no
known (to us) ï¬aws other than period exhaustion.
If you are generating more than 100,000,000 random numbers in a single
calculation (that is, more than about 5% of ran1âs period), we recommend the use
of ran2, with its much longer period.
Knuthâs subtractive routine ran3 seems to be the timing winner among portable
routines. Unfortunately the subtractive method is not so well studied, and not a
standard. We like to keep ran3 in reserve for a âsecond opinion,â substitutingit when
we suspect another generator of introducingunwanted correlations into a calculation.
The routine ran4 generates extremely good random deviates, and has some
other nice properties, but it is slow. See Â§7.5 for discussion.
Finally, the quick and dirty in-line generators ranqd1 and ranqd2 are very fast,
but they are somewhat machine dependent, and at best only as good as a 32-bit linear
congruential generator ever is â in our view not good enough in many situations.
We would use these only in very special cases, where speed is critical.

7.2 Transformation Method: Exponential and
Normal Deviates
In the previous section, we learned how to generate random deviates with
a uniform probability distribution, so that the probability of generating a number
between x and x + dx, denoted p(x)dx, is given by
p(x)dx =
n dx
0 < x < 1
0
otherwise
(7.2.1)
The probability distribution p(x) is of course normalized, so that
Z â
ââ
p(x)dx = 1
(7.2.2)
Now suppose that we generate a uniform deviatex and then take some prescribed
function of it, y(x). The probability distributionof y, denoted p(y)dy, is determined
by the fundamental transformation law of probabilities, which is simply
|p(y)dy| = |p(x)dx|
(7.2.3)
or
p(y) = p(x)

dx
dy

(7.2.4)
Exponential Deviates
As an example, suppose that y(x) â¡âln(x), and that p(x) is as given by
equation (7.2.1) for a uniform deviate. Then
p(y)dy =

dx
dy
dy = eâydy
(7.2.5)
which is distributed exponentially. This exponential distribution occurs frequently
in real problems, usually as the distribution of waiting times between independent
Poisson-random events, for example the radioactive decay of nuclei. You can also
easily see (from 7.2.4) that the quantity y/Î» has the probability distribution Î»eâÎ»y.
So we have
#include <math.h>

Transformation method for generating a random deviate y from a known probability
distribution p(y). The indeï¬nite integral of p(y) must be known and invertible. A uniform deviate x is
chosen between 0 and 1. Its corresponding y on the deï¬nite-integral curve is the desired deviate.
Letâs see what is involved in using the above transformationmethod to generate
some arbitrary desired distribution of yâs, say one with p(y) = f(y) for some
positive function f whose integral is 1. (See Figure 7.2.1.) According to (7.2.4),
we need to solve the differential equation
dx
dy = f(y)
(7.2.6)
But the solution of this is just x = F (y), where F (y) is the indeï¬nite integral of
f(y). The desired transformation which takes a uniform deviate into one distributed
as f(y) is therefore
y(x) = F â1(x)
(7.2.7)
where F â1 is the inverse function to F . Whether (7.2.7) is feasible to implement
depends on whether the inverse function of the integral of f(y) is itself feasible to
compute, either analytically or numerically. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isnât.
Incidentally, (7.2.7) has an immediate geometric interpretation: Since F (y) is
the area under the probability curve to the left of y, (7.2.7) is just the prescription:
choose a uniform random x, then ï¬nd the value y that has that fraction x of
probability area to its left, and return the value y.
Normal (Gaussian) Deviates
Transformation methods generalize to more than one dimension.
If x1, x2,
. . . are random deviates with a joint probability distribution p(x1, x2, . . .)
dx1dx2 . . ., and if y1, y2, . . . are each functions of all the xâs (same number of

Since this is the product of a function of y2 alone and a function of y1 alone, we see
that each y is independently distributed according to the normal distribution (7.2.9).
One further trick is useful in applying (7.2.10). Suppose that, instead of picking
uniform deviates x1 and x2 in the unit square, we instead pick v1 and v2 as the
ordinate and abscissa of a random point inside the unit circle around the origin. Then
the sum of their squares, R2 â¡v2
1 +v2
2 is a uniform deviate, which can be used for x1,
while the angle that(v1, v2) deï¬nes withrespect tothe v1 axis can serve as the random
angle 2Ïx2. Whatâs the advantage? Itâs that the cosine and sine in (7.2.10) can now
be written as v1/
â
R2 and v2/

R2, obviating the trigonometric function calls!
We thus have

7.3 Rejection Method: Gamma, Poisson,
Binomial Deviates
The rejection method is a powerful, general technique for generating random
deviateswhosedistributionfunctionp(x)dx (probabilityofavalueoccurringbetween
x and x + dx) is known and computable. The rejection method does not require
that the cumulative distribution function [indeï¬nite integral of p(x)] be readily
computable, much less the inverse of that function â which was required for the
transformation method in the previous section.
The rejection method is based on a simple geometrical argument:
Draw a graph of the probability distribution p(x) that you wish to generate, so
that the area under the curve in any range of x corresponds to the desired probability
of generating an x in that range. If we had some way of choosing a random point in
two dimensions, with uniform probability in the area under your curve, then the x
value of that random point would have the desired distribution.
Now, on the same graph, draw any other curve f(x) which has ï¬nite (not
inï¬nite) area and lies everywhere above your original probability distribution. (This
is always possible, because your original curve encloses only unit area, by deï¬nition
of probability.)
We will call this f(x) the comparison function.
Imagine now
that you have some way of choosing a random point in two dimensions that is
uniform in the area under the comparison function. Whenever that point lies outside
the area under the original probability distribution, we will reject it and choose
another random point. Whenever it lies inside the area under the original probability
distribution, we will accept it. It should be obvious that the accepted points are
uniform in the accepted area, so that their x values have the desired distribution. It

Figure 7.3.1. Rejection method for generating a random deviate x from a known probability distribution
p(x) that is everywhere less than some other function f(x). The transformation method is ï¬rst used to
generate a random deviate x of the distribution f (compare Figure 7.2.1). A second uniform deviate is
used to decide whether to accept or reject that x. If it is rejected, a new deviate of f is found; and so on.
The ratio of accepted to rejected points is the ratio of the area under p to the area between p and f.
should also be obvious that the fraction of points rejected just depends on the ratio
of the area of the comparison function to the area of the probability distribution
function, not on the details of shape of either function. For example, a comparison
function whose area is less than 2 will reject fewer than half the points, even if it
approximates the probability function very badly at some values of x, e.g., remains
ï¬nite in some region where x is zero.
It remains only to suggest how to choose a uniform random point in two
dimensions under the comparison function f(x). A variant of the transformation
method (Â§7.2) does nicely: Be sure to have chosen a comparison function whose
indeï¬nite integral is known analytically, and is also analytically invertible to give x
as a function of âarea under the comparison function to the left of x.â Now pick a
uniform deviate between 0 and A, where A is the total area under f(x), and use it
to get a corresponding x. Then pick a uniform deviate between 0 and f(x) as the y
value for the two-dimensional point. You should be able to convince yourself that the
point (x, y) is uniformly distributed in the area under the comparison function f(x).
An equivalent procedure is to pick the second uniform deviate between zero
and one, and accept or reject according to whether it is respectively less than or
greater than the ratio p(x)/f(x).
So, to summarize, the rejection method for some given p(x) requires that one
ï¬nd, once and for all, some reasonably good comparison function f(x). Thereafter,
each deviate generated requires two uniform random deviates, one evaluation of f (to
get the coordinate y), and one evaluation of p (to decide whether to accept or reject
the point x, y). Figure 7.3.1 illustrates the procedure. Then, of course, this procedure
must be repeated, on the average, A times before the ï¬nal deviate is obtained.
Gamma Distribution
The gamma distribution of integer order a > 0 is the waiting time to the ath
event in a Poisson random process of unit mean. For example, when a = 1, it is just
the exponential distribution of Â§7.2, the waiting time to the ï¬rst event.

x and x + dx, where

(7.3.1)
To generate deviates of (7.3.1) for small values of a, it is best to add up a
exponentially distributed waiting times, i.e., logarithms of uniform deviates. Since
the sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product, one really has only to generate
the product of a uniform deviates, then take the log.
For larger values of a, the distribution (7.3.1) has a typically âbell-shapedâ
form, with a peak at x = a and a half-width of about âa.
We will be interested in several probability distributions with this same qual-
itative form.
A useful comparison function in such cases is derived from the
Lorentzian distribution
p(y)dy = 1
Ï

1
1 + y2

dy
(7.3.2)
whose inverse indeï¬nite integral is just the tangent function. It follows that the
x-coordinate of an area-uniform random point under the comparison function
f(x) =
c0
1 + (x âx0)2/a2
0
(7.3.3)
for any constants a0, c0, and x0, can be generated by the prescription
x = a0 tan(ÏU) + x0
(7.3.4)
where U is a uniform deviate between 0 and 1. Thus, for some speciï¬c âbell-shapedâ
p(x) probabilitydistribution,we need only ï¬nd constants a0, c0, x0, with the product
a0c0 (which determines the area) as small as possible, such that (7.3.3) is everywhere
greater than p(x).
Ahrens has done this for the gamma distribution, yielding the following
algorithm (as described in Knuth [1]):
#include <math.h>
float gamdev(int ia, long *idum)
Returns a deviate distributed as a gamma distribution of integer order ia, i.e., a waiting time
to the iath event in a Poisson process of unit mean, using ran1(idum) as the source of
uniform deviates.

Poisson Deviates
The Poisson distribution is conceptually related to the gamma distribution. It
gives the probability of a certain integer number m of unit rate Poisson random
events occurring in a given interval of time x, while the gamma distribution was the
probabilityof waiting time between x and x+dx to the mth event. Note that m takes
on only integer values â¥0, so that the Poisson distribution, viewed as a continuous
distribution function px(m)dm, is zero everywhere except where m is an integer
â¥0. At such places, it is inï¬nite, such that the integrated probability over a region
containing the integer is some ï¬nite number. The total probability at an integer j is
Prob(j) =
Z j+Ïµ
jâÏµ
px(m)dm = xjeâx
j!
(7.3.5)
At ï¬rst sight this might seem an unlikely candidate distribution for the rejection
method, since no continuous comparison function can be larger than the inï¬nitely
tall, but inï¬nitely narrow, Dirac delta functions in px(m). However, there is a trick
that we can do: Spread the ï¬nite area in the spike at j uniformly into the interval
between j and j + 1. This deï¬nes a continuous distribution qx(m)dm given by
qx(m)dm = x[m]eâx
[m]!
dm
(7.3.6)
where [m] represents the largest integer less than m. If we now use the rejection
method to generate a (noninteger) deviate from (7.3.6), and then take the integer
part of that deviate, it will be as if drawn from the desired distribution (7.3.5). (See
Figure 7.3.2.) This trick is general for any integer-valued probability distribution.
For x large enough, the distribution (7.3.6) is qualitatively bell-shaped (albeit
with a bell made out of small, square steps), and we can use the same kind of
Lorentzian comparison function as was already used above. For small x, we can
generate independent exponential deviates (waiting times between events); when the
sum of these ï¬rst exceeds x, then the number of events that would have occurred in
waiting time x becomes known and is one less than the number of terms in the sum.
These ideas produce the following routine:

(7.3.7)
The binomial distribution is integer valued, with m taking on possible values
from 0 to n.
It depends on two parameters, n and q, so is correspondingly a
bit harder to implement than our previous examples. Nevertheless, the techniques
already illustrated are sufï¬ciently powerful to do the job:
#include <math.h>
#define PI 3.141592654
float bnldev(float pp, int n, long *idum)
Returns as a ï¬oating-point number an integer value that is a random deviate drawn from
a binomial distribution of n trials each of probability pp, using ran1(idum) as a source of

The binomial distribution is invariant under changing pp to 1-pp, if we also change the
answer to n minus itself; weâll remember to do this below.
am=n*p;
This is the mean of the deviate to be produced.
if (n < 25) {
Use the direct method while n is not too large.

or more trials, then the distribution is quite
accurately Poisson. Use direct Poisson method.

sufï¬ce it to say that there are special polynomials among those whose coefï¬cients
are zero or one.
An example is
x18 + x5 + x2 + x1 + x0
(7.4.1)
which we can abbreviate by just writing the nonzero powers of x, e.g.,
(18, 5, 2, 1, 0)
Every primitive polynomial modulo 2 of order n (=18 above) deï¬nes a
recurrence relation for obtaining a new random bit from the n preceding ones. The
recurrence relation is guaranteed to produce a sequence of maximal length, i.e.,
cycle through all possible sequences of n bits (except all zeros) before it repeats.
Therefore one can seed the sequence with any initial bit pattern (except all zeros),
and get 2n â1 random bits before the sequence repeats.
Let the bits be numbered from 1 (most recently generated) through n (generated
n steps ago), and denoted a1, a2, . . ., an. We want to give a formula for a new bit
a0. After generating a0 we will shift all the bits by one, so that the old an is ï¬nally
lost, and the new a0 becomes a1. We then apply the formula again, and so on.
âMethod Iâ is the easiest to implement in hardware, requiring only a single
shift register n bits long and a few XOR (âexclusive orâ or bit addition mod 2)
gates, the operation denoted in C by ââ§â. For the primitive polynomial given above,
the recurrence formula is
a0 = a18 â§a5 â§a2 â§a1
(7.4.2)
The terms that are â§âd together can be thought of as âtapsâ on the shift register,
â§âd into the registerâs input. More generally, there is precisely one term for each
nonzero coefï¬cient in the primitive polynomial except the constant (zero bit) term.
So the ï¬rst term will always be an for a primitive polynomial of degree n, while the
last term might or might not be a1, depending on whether the primitive polynomial
has a term in x1.
While it is simple in hardware, Method I is somewhat cumbersome in C, because
the individual bits must be collected by a sequence of full-word masks:
int irbit1(unsigned long *iseed)
Returns as an integer a random bit, based on the 18 low-signiï¬cance bits in iseed (which is
modiï¬ed for the next call).
{
unsigned long newbit;
The accumulated XORâs.
newbit = (*iseed >> 17) & 1
Get bit 18.
^ (*iseed >> 4) & 1
XOR with bit 5.
^ (*iseed >> 1) & 1
XOR with bit 2.
^ (*iseed & 1);
XOR with bit 1.
*iseed=(*iseed << 1) | newbit;
Leftshift the seed and put the result of the
XORâs in its bit 1.
return (int) newbit;

Figure 7.4.1.
Two related methods for obtaining random bits from a shift register and a primitive
polynomial modulo 2. (a) The contents of selected taps are combined by exclusive-or (addition modulo
2), and the result is shifted in from the right. This method is easiest to implement in hardware. (b)
Selected bits are modiï¬ed by exclusive-or with the leftmost bit, which is then shifted in from the right.
This method is easiest to implement in software.
âMethod IIâ is less suited to direct hardware implementation (though still
possible), but is beautifully suited to C. It modiï¬es more than one bit among the
saved n bits as each new bit is generated (Figure 7.4.1). It generates the maximal
length sequence, but not in the same order as Method I. The prescription for the
primitive polynomial (7.4.1) is:
a0 = a18
a5 = a5 â§a0
a2 = a2 â§a0
a1 = a1 â§a0
(7.4.3)
In general there will be an exclusive-or for each nonzero term in the primitive
polynomial except 0 and n.
The nice feature about Method II is that all the
exclusive-orâs can usually be done as a single full-word exclusive-or operation:
#define IB1 1
Powers of 2.
#define IB2 2
#define IB5 16
#define IB18 131072
#define MASK (IB1+IB2+IB5)
int irbit2(unsigned long *iseed)
Returns as an integer a random bit, based on the 18 low-signiï¬cance bits in iseed (which is
modiï¬ed for the next call).
{
if (*iseed & IB18) {
Change all masked bits, shift, and put 1 into bit 1.
*iseed=((*iseed ^ MASK) << 1) | IB1;
return 1;
} else {
Shift and put 0 into bit 1.

7.5 Random Sequences Based on Data
Encryption
In NumericalRecipesâï¬rstedition,we described how to use theData Encryption Standard
(DES) [1-3] for the generation of random numbers. Unfortunately, when implemented in
software in a high-level language like C, DES is very slow, so excruciatingly slow, in fact, that
our previous implementation can be viewed as more mischievous than useful. Here we give
a much faster and simpler algorithm which, though it may not be secure in the cryptographic
sense, generates about equally good random numbers.
DES, like its progenitor cryptographic system LUCIFER, is a so-called âblock product
cipherâ [4]. It acts on 64 bits of input by iteratively applying (16 times, in fact) a kind of highly
nonlinear bit-mixing function. Figure 7.5.1 shows the ï¬ow of information in DES during
this mixing. The function g, which takes 32-bits into 32-bits, is called the âcipher function.â
Meyer and Matyas [4] discuss the importance of the cipher function being nonlinear, as well
as other design criteria.
DES constructs its cipher function g from an intricate set of bit permutations and table
lookups acting on short sequences of consecutive bits. Apparently, this function was chosen
to be particularly strong cryptographically (or conceivably as some critics contend, to have
an exquisitely subtle cryptographic ï¬aw!). For our purposes, a different function g that can
be rapidly computed in a high-level computer language is preferable. Such a function may
weaken the algorithm cryptographically. Our purposes are not, however, cryptographic: We
want to ï¬nd the fastest g, and smallest number of iterations of the mixing procedure in Figure
7.5.1, such that our output random sequence passes the standard tests that are customarily
applied to random number generators. The resulting algorithm will not be DES, but rather a
kind of âpseudo-DES,â better suited to the purpose at hand.
Following the criterion, mentioned above, that g should be nonlinear, we must give
the integer multiply operation a prominent place in g.
Because 64-bit registers are not
generally accessible in high-level languages, we must conï¬ne ourselves to multiplying 16-bit

operands into a 32-bit result. So, the general idea of g, almost forced, is to calculate the three
distinct 32-bit products of the high and low 16-bit input half-words, and then to combine
these, and perhaps additional ï¬xed constants, by fast operations (e.g., add or exclusive-or)
into a single 32-bit result.
There are only a limited number of ways of effecting this general scheme, allowing
systematic exploration of the alternatives. Experimentation, and tests of the randomness of
the output, lead to the sequence of operations shown in Figure 7.5.2. The few new elements
in the ï¬gure need explanation: The values C1 and C2 are ï¬xed constants, chosen randomly
with the constraint that they have exactly 16 1-bits and 16 0-bits; combining these constants
via exclusive-or ensures that the overall g has no bias towards 0 or 1 bits.
The âreverse half-wordsâ operation in Figure 7.5.2 turns out to be essential; otherwise,
the very lowest and very highest bits are not properly mixed by the three multiplications.
The nonobvious choices in g are therefore: where along the vertical âpipelineâ to do the
reverse; in what order to combine the three products and C2; and with which operation (add
or exclusive-or) should each combining be done? We tested these choices exhaustively before
settling on the algorithm shown in the ï¬gure.
It remains to determine the smallest number of iterations Nit that we can get away with.
The minimum meaningful Nit is evidently two, since a single iteration simply moves one
32-bit word without altering it. One can use the constants C1 and C2 to help determine an
appropriate Nit: When Nit = 2 and C1 = C2 = 0 (an intentionally very poor choice), the
generator fails several tests of randomness by easily measurable, though not overwhelming,
amounts.
When Nit = 4, on the other hand, or with Nit = 2 but with the constants
C1, C2 nonsparse, we have been unable to ï¬nd any statistical deviation from randomness in
sequencesof up to 109 ï¬oating numbers ri derived from this scheme. The combined strength
of Nit = 4 and nonsparse C1, C2 should therefore give sequences that are random to tests
even far beyond those that we have actually tried. These are our recommended conservative

has no nonrandomness discernible (by us).
Implementation of these ideas is straightforward. The following routine is not quite
strictly portable, since it assumes that unsigned long integers are 32-bits, as is the case
on most machines. However, there is no reason to believe that longer integers would be in
any way inferior (with suitable extensions of the constants C1, C2). C does not provide a
convenient,portable way to divide a long integerinto half words, so we must use a combination
of masking (& 0xffff) with left- and right-shifts by 16 bits (<<16 and >>16). On some
machines the half-word extraction could be made faster by the use of Câs union construction,
but this would generally not be portable between âbig-endianâ and âlittle-endianâ machines.

The routine ran4, listed below, uses psdes to generate uniform random deviates. We
adopt the conventionthat a negative value of the argumentidum sets the left 32-bit word, while
a positive value i sets the right 32-bit word, returns the ith random deviate, and increments
idum to i + 1. This is no more than a convenient way of deï¬ning many different sequences
(negative values of idum), but still with random access to each sequence (positive values of
idum). For getting a ï¬oating-point number from the 32-bit integer, we like to do it by the
masking trick described at the end of Â§7.1, above. The hex constants3F800000and 007FFFFF
are the appropriate ones for computers using the IEEE representation for 32-bit ï¬oating-point
numbers (e.g., IBM PCs and most UNIX workstations). For DEC VAXes, the correct hex
constants are, respectively, 00004080 and FFFF007F. For greater portability, you can instead
construct a ï¬oating number by making the (signed) 32-bit integer nonnegative (typically, you
add exactly 231 if it is negative)and then multiplying it by a ï¬oating constant(typically 2.â31).
An interesting, and sometimes useful, feature of the routine ran4, below, is that it allows
random access to the nth random value in a sequence, without the necessity of ï¬rst generating
values 1 Â· Â· Â· n â1. This property is shared by any random number generator based on hashing
(the technique of mapping data keys, which may be highly clustered in value, approximately
uniformly into a storage address space) [5,6]. One might have a simulation problem in which
some certain rare situation becomes recognizable by its consequencesonly considerably after
it has occurred. One may wish to restart the simulation back at that occurrence, using identical
random values but, say, varying some other control parameters. The relevant question might
then be something like âwhat random numbers were used in cycle number 337098901?â It
might already be cycle number 395100273 before the question comes up. Random generators
based on recursion, rather than hashing, cannot easily answer such a question.
float ran4(long *idum)
Returns a uniform random deviate in the range 0.0 to 1.0, generated by pseudo-DES (DES-
like) hashing of the 64-bit word (idums,idum), where idums was set by a previous call with
negative idum. Also increments idum. Routine can be used to generate a random sequence
by successive calls, leaving idum unaltered between calls; or it can randomly access the nth
deviate in a sequence by calling with idum = n. Diï¬erent sequences are initialized by calls with
diï¬ering negative values of idum.

Suppose that we pick N random points, uniformly distributed in a multidimen-
sional volume V . Call them x1, . . ., xN. Then the basic theorem of Monte Carlo

(7.6.2)
The âplus-or-minusâ term in (7.6.1) is a one standard deviation error estimate for
the integral, not a rigorous bound; further, there is no guarantee that the error
is distributed as a Gaussian, so the error term should be taken only as a rough
indication of probable error.
Suppose that you want to integrate a function g over a region W that is not
easy to sample randomly. For example, W might have a very complicated shape.
No problem. Just ï¬nd a region V that includes W and that can easily be sampled
(Figure 7.6.1), and then deï¬ne f to be equal to g for points in W and equal to zero
for points outside of W (but still inside the sampled V ). You want to try to make
V enclose W as closely as possible, because the zero values of f will increase the
error estimate term of (7.6.1). And well they should: points chosen outside of W
have no information content, so the effective value of N, the number of points, is
reduced. The error estimate in (7.6.1) takes this into account.
General purpose routines for Monte Carlo integration are quite complicated
(see Â§7.8), but a worked example will show the underlying simplicity of the method.
Suppose that we want to ï¬nd the weight and the position of the center of mass of an
object of complicated shape, namely the intersection of a torus with the edge of a
large box. In particular let the object be deï¬ned by the three simultaneous conditions
z2 +

x â¥1
y â¥â3
(7.6.4)
(two faces of the box, see Figure 7.6.2). Suppose for the moment that the object
has a constant density Ï.
We want to estimate the following integrals over the interior of the complicated
object:
Z
Ï dx dy dz
Z
xÏ dx dy dz
Z
yÏ dx dy dz
Z
zÏ dx dy dz
(7.6.5)
The coordinates of the center of mass will be the ratio of the latter three integrals
(linear moments) to the ï¬rst one (the weight).
In the following fragment, the region V , enclosing the piece-of-torus W, is the
rectangular box extending from 1 to 4 in x, â3 to 4 in y, and â1 to 1 in z.

A change of variable can often be extremely worthwhile in Monte Carlo
integration. Suppose, for example, that we want to evaluate the same integrals,
but for a piece-of-torus whose density is a strong function of z, in fact varying
according to
Ï(x, y, z) = e5z
(7.6.6)
One way to do this is to put the statement
den=exp(5.0*z);
inside the if (...) block, just before den is ï¬rst used. This will work, but it is
a poor way to proceed. Since (7.6.6) falls so rapidly to zero as z decreases (down
to its lower limit â1), most sampled points contribute almost nothing to the sum
of the weight or moments. These points are effectively wasted, almost as badly
as those that fall outside of the region W. A change of variable, exactly as in the
transformation methods of Â§7.2, solves this problem. Let
ds = e5zdz
so that
s = 1
5e5z,
z = 1
5 ln(5s)
(7.6.7)
Then Ïdz = ds, and the limits â1 < z < 1 become .00135 < s < 29.682. The
program fragment now looks like this

If you think for a minute, you will realize that equation (7.6.7) was useful only
because the part of the integrandthat we wanted toeliminate (e5z) was bothintegrable
analytically, and had an integral that could be analytically inverted. (Compare Â§7.2.)
In general these properties will not hold. Question: What then? Answer: Pull out
of the integrand the âbestâ factor that can be integrated and inverted. The criterion
for âbestâ is to try to reduce the remaining integrand to a function that is as close
as possible to constant.
The limiting case is instructive: If you manage to make the integrand f exactly
constant, and if the region V , of known volume, exactly encloses the desired region
W, then the average of f that you compute will be exactly its constant value, and the
error estimate in equation (7.6.1) will exactly vanish. You will, in fact, have done
the integral exactly, and the Monte Carlo numerical evaluations are superï¬uous. So,
backing off from the extreme limiting case, to the extent that you are able to make f
approximately constant by change of variable, and to the extent that you can sample a
region only slightlylarger than W, you will increase the accuracy of the Monte Carlo
integral. This technique is generically called reduction of variance in the literature.
The fundamental disadvantage of simple Monte Carlo integration is that its
accuracy increases only as the square root of N, the number of sampled points. If
your accuracy requirements are modest, or if your computer budget is large, then
the technique is highly recommended as one of great generality. In the next two
sections we will see that there are techniques available for âbreaking the square root
of N barrierâ and achieving, at least in some cases, higher accuracy with fewer
function evaluations.

7.7 Quasi- (that is, Sub-) Random Sequences
We have just seen that choosing N points uniformly randomly in an n-
dimensional space leads to an error term in Monte Carlo integration that decreases
as 1/
â
N. In essence, each new point sampled adds linearly to an accumulated sum
that will become the function average, and also linearly to an accumulated sum of
squares that will become the variance (equation 7.6.2). The estimated error comes
from the square root of this variance, hence the power N â1/2.
Just because this square root convergence is familiar does not, however, mean
that it is inevitable. A simple counterexample is to choose sample points that lie
on a Cartesian grid, and to sample each grid point exactly once (in whatever order).
The Monte Carlo method thus becomes a deterministic quadrature scheme â albeit
a simple one â whose fractional error decreases at least as fast as N â1 (even faster
if the function goes to zero smoothly at the boundaries of the sampled region, or
is periodic in the region).
The trouble with a grid is that one has to decide in advance how ï¬ne it should
be. One is then committed to completing all of its sample points. With a grid, it is
not convenient to âsample untilâ some convergence or termination criterion is met.
One might ask if there is not some intermediate scheme, some way to pick sample
points âat random,â yet spread out in some self-avoiding way, avoiding the chance
clustering that occurs with uniformly random points.
A similar question arises for tasks other than Monte Carlo integration. We might
want to search an n-dimensional space for a point where some (locally computable)
condition holds. Of course, for the task to be computationally meaningful, there
had better be continuity, so that the desired condition will hold in some ï¬nite n-
dimensional neighborhood. We may not know a priori how large that neighborhood
is, however. We want to âsample untilâ the desired point is found, moving smoothly
to ï¬ner scales with increasing samples. Is there any way to do this that is better
than uncorrelated, random samples?
The answer to the above question is âyes.â
Sequences of n-tuples that ï¬ll
n-space more uniformly than uncorrelated random points are called quasi-random
sequences. That term is somewhat of a misnomer, since there is nothing ârandomâ
about quasi-random sequences: They are cleverly crafted to be, in fact, sub-random.
The sample points in a quasi-random sequence are, in a precise sense, âmaximally
avoidingâ of each other.
A conceptually simple example is Haltonâs sequence [1]. In one dimension, the
jth number Hj in the sequence is obtained by the following steps: (i) Write j as a
number in base b, where b is some prime. (For example j = 17 in base b = 3 is
122.) (ii) Reverse the digits and put a radix point (i.e., a decimal point base b) in

First 1024 points of a two-dimensional Sobolâ sequence. The sequence is generated
number-theoretically, rather than randomly, so successive points at any stage âknowâ how to ï¬ll in the
gaps in the previously generated distribution.
front of the sequence. (In the example, we get 0.221 base 3.) The result is Hj. To
get a sequence of n-tuples in n-space, you make each component a Halton sequence
with a different prime base b. Typically, the ï¬rst n primes are used.
It is not hard to see how Haltonâs sequence works: Every time the number of
digits in j increases by one place, jâs digit-reversed fraction becomes a factor of
b ï¬ner-meshed. Thus the process is one of ï¬lling in all the points on a sequence
of ï¬ner and ï¬ner Cartesian grids â and in a kind of maximally spread-out order
on each grid (since, e.g., the most rapidly changing digit in j controls the most
signiï¬cant digit of the fraction).
Other ways of generating quasi-random sequences have been suggested by
Faure, Sobolâ, Niederreiter, and others. Bratley and Fox [2] provide a good review
and references, and discuss a particularly efï¬cient variant of the Sobolâ [3] sequence
suggested by Antonov and Saleev [4].
It is this Antonov-Saleev variant whose
implementation we now discuss.

*Expressed as a decimal integer representing the interior bits (that is, omitting the

The Sobolâsequencegeneratesnumbersbetween zeroand one directly as binary fractions
of length w bits, from a set of w special binary fractions, Vi, i = 1, 2, . . . , w, called direction
numbers. In Sobolâs original method, the jth number Xj is generated by XORing (bitwise
exclusive or) together the set of Viâs satisfying the criterion on i, âthe ith bit of j is nonzero.â
As j increments, in other words, different ones of the Viâs ï¬ash in and out of Xj on different
time scales. V1 alternates between being present and absent most quickly, while Vk goes from
present to absent (or vice versa) only every 2kâ1 steps.
Antonov and Saleevâs contribution was to show that instead of using the bits of the
integer j to select direction numbers, one could just as well use the bits of the Gray code of j,
G(j). (For a quick review of Gray codes, look at Â§20.2.)
Now G(j) and G(j + 1) differ in exactly one bit position, namely in the position of the
rightmost zero bit in the binary representation of j (adding a leading zero to j if necessary). A
consequence is that the j + 1st Sobolâ-Antonov-Saleev number can be obtained from the jth
by XORing it with a single Vi, namely with i the position of the rightmost zero bit in j. This
makes the calculation of the sequence very efï¬cient, as we shall see.
Figure 7.7.1 plots the ï¬rst 1024 points generated by a two-dimensional Sobolâ sequence.
One sees that successive points do âknowâ about the gaps left previously, and keep ï¬lling
them in, hierarchically.
We havedeferred to this point a discussionof howthe direction numbersVi are generated.
Some nontrivial mathematics is involved in that, so we will content ourself with a cookbook
summary only: Each different Sobolâ sequence (or component of an n-dimensional sequence)
is based on a different primitive polynomial over the integers modulo 2, that is, a polynomial
whose coefï¬cients are either 0 or 1, and which generates a maximal length shift register
sequence. (Primitive polynomials modulo 2 were used in Â§7.4, and are further discussed in
Â§20.3.) Suppose P is such a polynomial, of degree q,
P = xq + a1xqâ1 + a2xqâ2 + Â· Â· Â· + aqâ1 + 1

Parenthesized values are not freely speciï¬able, but are forced by the required recurrence
for this degree.
Deï¬ne a sequence of integers Mi by the q-term recurrence relation,
Mi = 2a1Miâ1 â22a2Miâ2 âÂ· Â· Â· â2qâ1Miâq+1aqâ1 â(2qMiâq âMiâq)
(7.7.2)
Here bitwise XOR is denoted by â. The starting values forthis recurrence are thatM1, . . . , Mq
can be arbitrary odd integers less than 2, . . . , 2q, respectively. Then, the direction numbers
Vi are given by
Vi = Mi/2i
i = 1, . . . , w
(7.7.3)
The accompanying table lists all primitive polynomials modulo 2 with degree q â¤10.
Since the coefï¬cients are either 0 or 1, and since the coefï¬cients of xq and of 1 are predictably
1, it is convenientto denote a polynomial by its middle coefï¬cients taken as the bits of a binary
number (higher powers of x being more signiï¬cant bits). The table uses this convention.
Turn now to the implementation of the Sobolâ sequence. Successivecalls to the function
sobseq (after a preliminary initializing call) return successive points in an n-dimensional
Sobolâ sequence based on the ï¬rst n primitive polynomials in the table.
As given, the
routine is initialized for maximum n of 6 dimensions, and for a word length w of 30 bits.
These parameters can be altered by changing MAXBIT (â¡w) and MAXDIM, and by adding
more initializing data to the arrays ip (the primitive polynomials from the table), mdeg (their
degrees), and iv (the starting values for the recurrence, equation 7.7.2). A second table,
above, elucidates the initializing data in the routine.
#include "nrutil.h"
#define MAXBIT 30
#define MAXDIM 6
void sobseq(int *n, float x[])
When n is negative, internally initializes a set of MAXBIT direction numbers for each of MAXDIM
diï¬erent Sobolâ sequences. When n is positive (but â¤MAXDIM), returns as the vector x[1..n]
the next values from n of these sequences. (n must not be changed between initializations.)

How good is a Sobolâ sequence, anyway? For Monte Carlo integration of a smooth
function in n dimensions, the answer is that the fractional error will decrease with N, the
number of samples, as (ln N)n/N, i.e., almost as fast as 1/N. As an example, let us integrate
a function that is nonzero inside a torus (doughnut) in three-dimensional space. If the major
radius of the torus is R0, the minor radial coordinate r is deï¬ned by
r =

[(x2 + y2)1/2 âR0]2 + z21/2
(7.7.4)
Let us try the function
f(x, y, z) =

r < r0

r â¥r0
(7.7.5)
which can be integrated analytically in cylindrical coordinates, giving
Z Z Z
dx dy dz f(x,y, z) = 2Ï2a2R0
(7.7.6)
With parameters R0 = 0.6, r0 = 0.3, we did 100 successive Monte Carlo integrations of
equation (7.7.4), sampling uniformly in the region â1 < x, y, z < 1, for the two cases of
uncorrelated random points and the Sobolâ sequence generated by the routine sobseq. Figure
7.7.2 shows the results, plotting the r.m.s. average error of the 100 integrations as a function
of the number of points sampled. (For any single integration, the error of course wanders
from positive to negative, or vice versa, so a logarithmic plot of fractional error is not very
informative.) The thin, dashed curve corresponds to uncorrelated random points and shows
the familiar N â1/2 asymptotics. The thin, solid gray curve shows the result for the Sobolâ

Figure 7.7.2. Fractional accuracy of Monte Carlo integrations as a function of numberof points sampled,
for two different integrands and two different methods of choosing random points. The quasi-random
Sobolâ sequence converges much more rapidly than a conventional pseudo-random sequence. Quasi-
random sampling does better when the integrand is smooth (âsoft boundaryâ) than when it has step
discontinuities (âhard boundaryâ). The curves shown are the r.m.s. average of 100 trials.
sequence. The logarithmic term in the expected (ln N)3/N is readily apparent as curvature
in the curve, but the asymptotic N â1 is unmistakable.
To understand the importance of Figure 7.7.2, suppose that a Monte Carlo integration of
f with 1% accuracy is desired. The Sobolâ sequence achieves this accuracy in a few thousand
samples, while pseudorandom sampling requires nearly 100,000 samples. The ratio would
be even greater for higher desired accuracies.
A different, not quite so favorable, case occurs when the function being integrated has
hard (discontinuous) boundaries inside the sampling region, for example the function that is
one inside the torus, zero outside,
f(x, y, z) =
n 1
r < r0
0
r â¥r0
(7.7.7)
where r is deï¬ned in equation (7.7.4). Not by coincidence, this function has the same analytic
integral as the function of equation (7.7.5), namely 2Ï2a2R0.
The carefully hierarchical Sobolâ sequence is based on a set of Cartesian grids, but the
boundary of the torus has no particular relation to those grids. The result is that it is essentially
random whether sampled points in a thin layer at the surface of the torus, containing on the
order of N 2/3 points, come out to be inside, or outside, the torus. The square root law, applied
to this thin layer, gives N 1/3 ï¬uctuations in the sum, or N â2/3 fractional error in the Monte
Carlo integral. One sees this behavior veriï¬ed in Figure 7.7.2 by the thicker gray curve. The
thicker dashed curve in Figure 7.7.2 is the result of integrating the function of equation (7.7.7)
using independent random points. While the advantage of the Sobolâ sequence is not quite so
dramatic as in the case of a smooth function, it can nonetheless be a signiï¬cant factor (â¼5)
even at modest accuracies like 1%, and greater at higher accuracies.

Note that we have not provided the routine sobseq with a means of starting the
sequence at a point other than the beginning, but this feature would be easy to add. Once
the initialization of the direction numbers iv has been done, the jth point can be obtained
directly by XORing together those direction numbers corresponding to nonzero bits in the
Gray code of j, as described above.
The Latin Hypercube
We might here give passing mention the unrelated technique of Latin square or
Latin hypercube sampling, which is useful when you must sample an N-dimensional
space exceedingly sparsely, at M points. For example, you may want to test the
crashworthiness of cars as a simultaneous function of 4 different design parameters,
but with a budget of only three expendable cars. (The issue is not whether this is a
good plan â it isnât â but rather how to make the best of the situation!)
The idea is to partition each design parameter (dimension) into M segments, so
that the whole space is partitioned into M N cells. (You can choose the segments in
each dimension to be equal or unequal, according to taste.) With 4 parameters and 3
cars, for example, you end up with 3 Ã 3 Ã 3 Ã 3 = 81 cells.
Next, choose M cells to contain the sample points by the following algorithm:
Randomly choose one of the M N cells for the ï¬rst point. Now eliminate all cells
that agree with this point on any of its parameters (that is, cross out all cells in the
same row, column, etc.), leaving (M â1)N candidates. Randomly choose one of
these, eliminate new rows and columns, and continue the process until there is only
one cell left, which then contains the ï¬nal sample point.
The result of this construction is that each design parameter will have been
tested in every one of its subranges.
If the response of the system under test is
dominated by one of the design parameters, that parameter will be found with
this sampling technique. On the other hand, if there is an important interaction
among different design parameters, then the Latin hypercube gives no particular
advantage.
Use with care.

7.8 Adaptive and Recursive Monte Carlo
Methods
This section discusses more advanced techniques of Monte Carlo integration.
As
examples of the use of these techniques, we include two rather different, fairly sophisticated,
multidimensional Monte Carlo codes: vegas [1,2], and miser [3]. The techniques that we
discuss all fall under the general rubric of reduction of variance (Â§7.6), but are otherwise
quite distinct.
Importance Sampling
The use of importance sampling was already implicit in equations (7.6.6) and (7.6.7).
We now return to it in a slightly more formal way. Suppose that an integrand f can be written
as the product of a function h that is almost constant times another, positive, function g. Then
its integral over a multidimensional volume V is
Z
f dV =
Z
(f/g) gdV =
Z
h gdV
(7.8.1)
In equation (7.6.7) we interpreted equation (7.8.1) as suggesting a change of variable to
G, the indeï¬nite integral of g. That made gdV a perfect differential. We then proceeded
to use the basic theorem of Monte Carlo integration, equation (7.6.1).
A more general
interpretation of equation (7.8.1) is that we can integrate f by instead sampling h â not,
however, with uniform probability density dV , but rather with nonuniform density gdV . In
this second interpretation, the ï¬rst interpretation follows as the special case, where the means
of generating the nonuniform sampling of gdV is via the transformation method, using the
indeï¬nite integral G (see Â§7.2).
More directly, one can go back and generalize the basic theorem (7.6.1) to the case
of nonuniform sampling: Suppose that points xi are chosen within the volume V with a
probability density p satisfying
Z
p dV = 1
(7.8.2)
The generalized fundamental theorem is that the integral of any function f is estimated, using
N sample points xi, . . . , xN, by

where angle brackets denote arithmetic means over the N points, exactly as in equation
(7.6.2). As in equation (7.6.1), the âplus-or-minusâ term is a one standard deviation error
estimate. Notice that equation (7.6.1) is in fact the special case of equation (7.8.3), with
p = constant = 1/V .
What is the best choice for the sampling density p?
Intuitively, we have already
seen that the idea is to make h = f/p as close to constant as possible. We can be more
rigorous by focusing on the numerator inside the square root in equation (7.8.3), which is
the variance per sample point. Both angle brackets are themselves Monte Carlo estimators
of integrals, so we can write

R
|f| dV
(7.8.6)
where Î» has been chosen to enforce the constraint (7.8.2).
If f has one sign in the region of integration, then we get the obvious result that the
optimal choice of p â if one can ï¬gure out a practical way of effecting the sampling â is
that it be proportional to |f|. Then the variance is reduced to zero. Not so obvious, but seen
to be true, is the fact that p â|f| is optimal even if f takes on both signs. In that case the
variance per sample point (from equations 7.8.4 and 7.8.6) is
S = Soptimal =

|f| dV

(7.8.7)
One curiosity is that one can add a constant to the integrand to make it all of one sign,
since this changes the integral by a known amount, constant Ã V . Then, the optimal choice
of p always gives zero variance, that is, a perfectly accurate integral!
The resolution of
this seeming paradox (already mentioned at the end of Â§7.6) is that perfect knowledge of p
in equation (7.8.6) requires perfect knowledge of
R
|f|dV , which is tantamount to already
knowing the integral you are trying to compute!
If your function f takes on a known constant value in most of the volume V , it is
certainly a good idea to add a constant so as to make that value zero. Having done that, the
accuracy attainable by importance sampling depends in practice not on how small equation
(7.8.7) is, but rather on how small is equation (7.8.4) for an implementable p, likely only a
crude approximation to the ideal.
Stratiï¬ed Sampling
The idea of stratiï¬ed sampling is quite different from importance sampling. Let us
expand our notation slightly and let â¨â¨fâ©â©denote the true average of the function f over
the volume V (namely the integral divided by V ), while â¨fâ©denotes as before the simplest
(uniformly sampled) Monte Carlo estimator of that average:

Monte Carlo integration, is asymptotically related to the variance of the function, Var(f) â¡

Here Vara (f) denotes the variance of f in subregion a, that is, â¨â¨f 2â©â©a ââ¨â¨fâ©â©2

correspondingly for b.

(7.8.12)
(In physics, this formula for combining second moments is the âparallel axis theorem.â)
Comparing equations (7.8.9), (7.8.11), and (7.8.12), one sees that the stratiï¬ed (into two
subvolumes) sampling gives a variance that is never larger than the simple Monte Carlo case
â and smaller whenever the means of the stratiï¬ed samples, â¨â¨fâ©â©a and â¨â¨fâ©â©b, are different.
We have not yet exploited the possibility of sampling the two subvolumes with different
numbers of points, say Na in subregion a and Nb â¡N âNa in subregion b. Let us do so
now. Then the variance of the estimator is

N =
Ïa
Ïa + Ïb
(7.8.14)
Here we have adopted the shorthand notation Ïa â¡[Vara (f)]1/2, and correspondingly for b.
If Na satisï¬es equation (7.8.14), then equation (7.8.13) reduces to
Var
 â¨fâ©â²
= (Ïa + Ïb)2
4N
(7.8.15)
Equation (7.8.15) reduces to equation (7.8.9) if Var(f) = Vara (f) = Varb (f), in which case
stratifying the sample makes no difference.
A standard way to generalize the above result is to consider the volume V divided into
more than two equalsubregions. One can readily obtain the result that the optimal allocation of
sample points among the regions is to have the number of points in each region j proportional
to Ïj (that is, the square root of the variance of the function f in that subregion). In spaces
of high dimensionality (say d >â¼4) this is not in practice very useful, however. Dividing a
volume into K segments along each dimension implies Kd subvolumes, typically much too
large a number when one contemplates estimating all the corresponding Ïjâs.
Mixed Strategies
Importance sampling and stratiï¬ed sampling seem, at ï¬rst sight, inconsistent with each
other. The former concentrates sample points where the magnitude of the integrand |f| is
largest, that latter where the variance of f is largest. How can both be right?
The answer is that (like so much else in life) it all depends on what you know and how
well you know it. Importance sampling depends on already knowing some approximation to
your integral, so that you are able to generate random points xi with the desired probability
density p. To the extent that your p is not ideal, you are left with an error that decreases
only as N â1/2. Things are particularly bad if your p is far from ideal in a region where the
integrand f is changing rapidly, since then the sampled function h = f/p will have a large
variance. Importance sampling works by smoothing the values of the sampled function h,
and is effective only to the extent that you succeed in this.
Stratiï¬ed sampling, by contrast, does not necessarily require that you know anything
about f. Stratiï¬ed sampling works by smoothing out the ï¬uctuations of the number of points
in subregions, not by smoothing the values of the points. The simplest stratiï¬ed strategy,
dividing V into N equal subregions and choosing one point randomly in each subregion,
already gives a method whose error decreases asymptotically as N â1, much faster than
N â1/2. (Note that quasi-random numbers, Â§7.7, are another way of smoothing ï¬uctuations in
the density of points, giving nearly as good a result as the âblindâ stratiï¬cation strategy.)
However, âasymptoticallyâ is an important caveat: For example, if the integrand is
negligible in all but a single subregion, then the resulting one-sample integration is all but

useless. Information, even very crude, allowing importance sampling to put many points in
the active subregion would be much better than blind stratiï¬ed sampling.
Stratiï¬ed sampling really comes into its own if you have some way of estimating the
variances, so that you can put unequal numbers of points in different subregions, according to
(7.8.14) or its generalizations, and if you can ï¬nd a way of dividing a region into a practical
number of subregions (notably not Kd with large dimension d), while yet signiï¬cantly
reducing the variance of the function in each subregion compared to its variance in the full
volume. Doing this requires a lot of knowledge about f, though different knowledge from
what is required for importance sampling.
In practice, importance sampling and stratiï¬ed sampling are not incompatible. In many,
if not most, cases of interest, the integrand f is small everywhere in V except for a small
fractional volume of âactive regions.â In these regions the magnitude of |f| and the standard
deviation Ï = [Var(f)]1/2 are comparable in size, so both techniques will give about the
same concentration of points. In more sophisticated implementations, it is also possible to
ânestâ the two techniques, so that (e.g.) importance sampling on a crude grid is followed
by stratiï¬cation within each grid cell.
Adaptive Monte Carlo: VEGAS
The VEGAS algorithm, invented by Peter Lepage [1,2], is widely used for multidimen-
sional integrals that occur in elementary particle physics. VEGAS is primarily based on
importance sampling, but it also does some stratiï¬ed sampling if the dimension d is small
enough to avoid Kd explosion (speciï¬cally, if (K/2)d < N/2, with N the number of sample
points). The basic technique for importance sampling in VEGAS is to construct, adaptively,
a multidimensional weight function g that is separable,
p âg(x, y, z,. . .) = gx(x)gy(y)gz(z) . . .
(7.8.16)
Such a function avoids the Kd explosion in two ways: (i) It can be stored in the computer
as d separate one-dimensional functions, each deï¬ned by K tabulated values, say â so that
K Ã d replaces Kd. (ii) It can be sampled as a probability density by consecutively sampling
the d one-dimensional functions to obtain coordinate vector components (x, y, z, . . .).
The optimal separable weight function can be shown to be [1]
gx(x) â
Z
dy
Z
dz . . . f 2(x, y, z, . . .)
gy(y)gz(z) . . .
1/2
(7.8.17)
(and correspondingly for y, z,. . .).
Notice that this reduces to g â|f| (7.8.6) in one
dimension. Equation (7.8.17) immediately suggests VEGASâ adaptive strategy: Given a
set of g-functions (initially all constant, say), one samples the function f, accumulating not
only the overall estimator of the integral, but also the Kd estimators (K subdivisions of the
independent variable in each of d dimensions) of the right-hand side of equation (7.8.17).
These then determine improved g functions for the next iteration.
When the integrand f is concentrated in one, or at most a few, regions in d-space, then
the weight function gâs quickly become large at coordinate values that are the projections of
these regions onto the coordinate axes. The accuracy of the Monte Carlo integration is then
enormously enhanced over what simple Monte Carlo would give.
The weakness of VEGAS is the obvious one: To the extent that the projection of the
function f onto individual coordinate directions is uniform, VEGAS gives no concentration
of sample points in those dimensions. The worst case for VEGAS, e.g., is an integrand that
is concentrated close to a body diagonal line, e.g., one from (0, 0, 0, . . .) to (1, 1, 1, . . .).
Since this geometry is completely nonseparable, VEGAS can give no advantage at all. More
generally, VEGAS may not do well when the integrand is concentrated in one-dimensional
(or higher) curved trajectories (or hypersurfaces), unless these happen to be oriented close
to the coordinate directions.
The routine vegas that follows is essentially Lepageâs standard version, minimally
modiï¬ed to conform to our conventions. (We thank Lepage for permission to reproduce the
program here.) For consistency with other versions of the VEGAS algorithm in circulation,

we have preserved original variable names. The parameter NDMX is what we have called K,
the maximum number of increments along each axis; MXDIM is the maximum value of d; some
other parameters are explained in the comments.
The vegas routine performs m = itmx statistically independent evaluations of the
desired integral, each with N = ncall function evaluations. While statistically independent,
these iterations do assist each other, since each one is used to reï¬ne the sampling grid for
the next one. The results of all iterations are combined into a single best answer, and its
estimated error, by the relations

If this is signiï¬cantly larger than 1, then the results of the iterations are statistically

The input ï¬ag init can be used to advantage. One might have a call with init=0,
ncall=1000, itmx=5immediately followed by a call with init=1, ncall=100000, itmx=1.
The effect would be to develop a sampling grid over 5 iterations of a small number of samples,
then to do a single high accuracy integration on the optimized grid.
Note that the user-supplied integrand function, fxn, has an argument wgt in addition
to the expected evaluation point x. In most applications you ignore wgt inside the function.
Occasionally, however, you may want to integrate some additional function or functions along
with the principal function f. The integral of any such function g can be estimated by
Ig =
X
i
wig(x)
(7.8.20)
where the wiâs and xâs are the arguments wgt and x, respectively. It is straightforward to
accumulate this sum inside your function fxn, and to pass the answer back to your main
program via global variables. Of course, g(x) had better resemble the principal function f to
some degree, since the sampling will be optimized for f.

Recursive Stratiï¬ed Sampling
The problem with stratiï¬ed sampling, we have seen, is that it may not avoid the Kd
explosion inherent in the obvious, Cartesian, tesselation of a d-dimensional volume.
A
technique called recursive stratiï¬ed sampling [3] attempts to do this by successive bisections
of a volume, not along all d dimensions, but rather along only one dimension at a time.

The starting points are equations (7.8.10) and (7.8.13), applied to bisections of successively
smaller subregions.
Suppose that we have a quota of N evaluations of the function f, and want to evaluate
â¨fâ©â² in the rectangular parallelepiped region R = (xa, xb). (We denote such a region by the
two coordinate vectors of its diagonally opposite corners.) First, we allocate a fraction p of
N towards exploring the variance of f in R: We sample pN function values uniformly in
R and accumulate the sums that will give the d different pairs of variances corresponding to
the d different coordinate directions along which R can be bisected. In other words, in pN
samples, we estimate Var(f) in each of the regions resulting from a possible bisection of R,
Rai â¡(xa, xb â1
2ei Â· (xb âxa)ei)
Rbi â¡(xa + 1
2ei Â· (xb âxa)ei, xb)
(7.8.21)
Here ei is the unit vector in the ith coordinate direction, i = 1, 2, . . . , d.
Second, we inspect the variances to ï¬nd the most favorable dimension i to bisect. By
equation (7.8.15), we could, for example, choose that i for which the sum of the square roots
of the variance estimators in regions Rai and Rbi is minimized. (Actually, as we will explain,
we do something slightly different.)
Third, we allocate the remaining (1 âp)N function evaluations between the regions
Rai and Rbi. If we used equation (7.8.15) to choose i, we should do this allocation according
to equation (7.8.14).
We now have two parallelepipeds each with its own allocation of function evaluations
for estimating the mean of f. Our âRSSâ algorithm now shows itself to be recursive: To
evaluate the mean in each region, we go back to the sentence beginning âFirst,...â in the
paragraph above equation (7.8.21). (Of course, when the allocation of points to a region falls
below some number, we resort to simple Monte Carlo rather than continue with the recursion.)
Finally, we combine the means, and also estimated variances of the two subvolumes,
using equation (7.8.10) and the ï¬rst line of equation (7.8.11).
This completes the RSS algorithm in its simplest form.
Before we describe some
additional tricks under the general rubric of âimplementation details,â we need to return
brieï¬y to equations (7.8.13)â(7.8.15) and derive the equations that we actually use instead of
these. The right-hand side of equation (7.8.13) applies the familiar scaling law of equation
(7.8.9) twice, once to a and again to b. This would be correct if the estimates â¨fâ©a and â¨fâ©b
were each made by simple Monte Carlo, with uniformly random sample points. However, the
two estimates of the mean are in fact made recursively. Thus, there is no reason to expect
equation (7.8.9) to hold. Rather, we might substitute for equation (7.8.13) the relation,
Var
 â¨fâ©â²

Vara (f)
N Î±
a
+
Varb (f)
(N âNa)Î±

(7.8.22)
where Î± is an unknown constant â¥1 (the case of equality corresponding to simple Monte
Carlo). In that case, a short calculation shows that Var
 â¨fâ©â²
is minimized when
Na
N =
Vara (f)1/(1+Î±)
Vara (f)1/(1+Î±) + Varb (f)1/(1+Î±)

and that its minimum value is

 â¨fâ©â²
â
h
Vara (f)1/(1+Î±) + Varb (f)1/(1+Î±)i1+Î±
(7.8.24)
Equations (7.8.22)â(7.8.24) reduce to equations (7.8.13)â(7.8.15) when Î± = 1. Numerical
experiments to ï¬nd a self-consistent value for Î± ï¬nd that Î± â2. That is, when equation
(7.8.23) with Î± = 2 is used recursively to allocate sample opportunities, the observedvariance
of the RSS algorithm goes approximately as N â2, while any other value of Î± in equation
(7.8.23) gives a poorer fall-off. (The sensitivity to Î± is, however, not very great; it is not
known whether Î± = 2 is an analytically justiï¬able result, or only a useful heuristic.)
The principal difference between miserâs implementation and the algorithm as described
thus far lies in how the variances on the right-hand side of equation (7.8.23) are estimated.

We ï¬nd empirically that it is somewhat more robust to use the square of the difference of
maximum and minimum sampled function values, instead of the genuine second moment
of the samples.
This estimator is of course increasingly biased with increasing sample
size; however, equation (7.8.23) uses it only to compare two subvolumes (a and b) having
approximately equal numbers of samples. The âmax minus minâ estimator proves its worth
when the preliminary sampling yields only a single point, or small number of points, in active
regions of the integrand. In many realistic cases, these are indicators of nearby regions of
even greater importance, and it is useful to let them attract the greater sampling weight that
âmax minus minâ provides.
A second modiï¬cation embodied inthe code isthe introduction ofaâdithering parameter,â
dith, whose nonzero value causessubvolumes to be divided not exactly down the middle, but
rather into fractions 0.5Â±dith, with the sign of the Â± randomly chosen by a built-in random
number routine. Normally dith can be set to zero. However, there is a large advantage in
taking dith to be nonzero if some special symmetry of the integrand puts the active region
exactly at the midpoint of the region, or at the center of some power-of-two submultiple of
the region. One wants to avoid the extreme case of the active region being evenly divided
into 2d abutting corners of a d-dimensional space. A typical nonzero value of dith, on
those occasions when it is useful, might be 0.1. Of course, when the dithering parameter
is nonzero, we must take the differing sizes of the subvolumes into account; the code does
this through the variable fracl.
One ï¬nal feature in the code deserves mention. The RSS algorithm uses a single set
of sample points to evaluate equation (7.8.23) in all d directions. At bottom levels of the
recursion, the number of sample points can be quite small. Although rare, it can happen that
in one direction all the samples are in one half of the volume; in that case, that direction
is ignored as a candidate for bifurcation. Even more rare is the possibility that all of the
samples are in one half of the volume in all directions. In this case, a random direction is
chosen. If this happens too often in your application, then you should increase MNPT (see
line if (!jb). . . in the code).
Note that miser, as given, returns as ave an estimate of the average function value

returns as tgral the integral. The two conventions are of course trivially related, by equation
(7.8.8), since the volume V of the rectangular region is known.

Here PFAC is the fraction of remaining function evaluations used at each stage to explore the
variance of func. At least MNPT function evaluations are performed in any terminal subregion;
a subregion is further bisected only if at least MNBS function evaluations are available. We take

void miser(float (*func)(float []), float regn[], int ndim, unsigned long npts,
float dith, float *ave, float *var)
Monte Carlo samples a user-supplied ndim-dimensional function func in a rectangular volume
speciï¬ed by regn[1..2*ndim], a vector consisting of ndim âlower-leftâ coordinates of the
region followed by ndim âupper-rightâ coordinates. The function is sampled a total of npts
times, at locations determined by the method of recursive stratiï¬ed sampling. The mean value
of the function in the region is returned as ave; an estimate of the statistical uncertainty of ave
(square of standard deviation) is returned as var. The input parameter dith should normally
be set to zero, but can be set to (e.g.) 0.1 if funcâs active region falls on the boundary of a
power-of-two subdivision of region.

generate its points via the quasi-random routine sobseq (Â§7.7). We ï¬nd that miser with
sobseq can be considerably more accurate than miser with uniform random deviates. Since
the use of RSS and the use of quasi-random numbers are completely separable, however, we
have not made the code given here dependent on sobseq. A similar remark might be made
regarding importance sampling, which could in principle be combined with RSS. (One could
in principle combine vegas and miser, although the programming would be intricate.)

Chapter 8.
Sorting
8.0 Introduction
This chapter almost doesnât belong in a book on numerical methods. However,
some practical knowledge of techniques for sorting is an indispensable part of any
good programmerâs expertise. We would not want you to consider yourself expert in
numerical techniques while remaining ignorant of so basic a subject.
In conjunction with numerical work, sorting is frequently necessary when data
(either experimental or numerically generated) are being handled. One has tables
or lists of numbers, representing one or more independent (or âcontrolâ) variables,
and one or more dependent (or âmeasuredâ) variables. One may wish to arrange
these data, in various circumstances, in order by one or another of these variables.
Alternatively, one may simply wish to identify the âmedianâ value, or the âupper
quartileâ value of one of the lists of values. This task, closely related to sorting,
is called selection.
Here, more speciï¬cally, are the tasks that this chapter will deal with:
â¢ Sort, i.e., rearrange, an array of numbers into numerical order.
â¢ Rearrange an array into numerical order while performing the corre-
sponding rearrangement of one or more additional arrays, so that the
correspondence between elements in all arrays is maintained.
â¢ Given an array, prepare an index table for it, i.e., a table of pointers
telling which number array element comes ï¬rst in numerical order, which
second, and so on.
â¢ Given an array, prepare a rank table for it, i.e., a table telling what is
the numerical rank of the ï¬rst array element, the second array element,
and so on.
â¢ Select the Mth largest element from an array.
For the basic task of sorting N elements, the best algorithms require on the
order of several times N log2 N operations. The algorithm inventor tries to reduce
the constant in front of this estimate to as small a value as possible. Two of the
best algorithms are Quicksort (Â§8.2), invented by the inimitable C.A.R. Hoare, and
Heapsort (Â§8.3), invented by J.W.J. Williams.
For large N (say > 1000), Quicksort is faster, on most machines, by a factor of
1.5 or 2; it requires a bit of extra memory, however, and is a moderately complicated
program.
Heapsort is a true âsort in place,â and is somewhat more compact to
program and therefore a bit easier to modify for special purposes. On balance, we
recommend Quicksort because of its speed, but we implement both routines.

For small N one does better to use an algorithm whose operation count goes
as a higher, i.e., poorer, power of N, if the constant in front is small enough. For
N < 20, roughly, the method of straight insertion (Â§8.1) is concise and fast enough.
We include it with some trepidation: It is an N 2 algorithm, whose potential for
misuse (by using it for too large an N) is great. The resultant waste of computer
time is so awesome, that we were tempted not to include any N 2 routine at all. We
will draw the line, however, at the inefï¬cient N 2 algorithm, beloved of elementary
computer science texts, called bubble sort. If you know what bubble sort is, wipe it
from your mind; if you donât know, make a point of never ï¬nding out!
For N < 50, roughly, Shellâs method (Â§8.1), only slightly more complicated to
program than straight insertion, is competitive with the more complicated Quicksort
on many machines. This method goes as N 3/2 in the worst case, but is usually faster.

detailed references to the literature.

8.1 Straight Insertion and Shellâs Method
Straight insertion is an N 2 routine, and should be used only for small N,
say < 20.
The technique is exactly the one used by experienced card players to sort their
cards: Pick out the second card and put it in order with respect to the ï¬rst; then pick
out the third card and insert it into the sequence among the ï¬rst two; and so on until
the last card has been picked out and inserted.
void piksrt(int n, float arr[])
Sorts an array arr[1..n] into ascending numerical order, by straight insertion. n is input; arr
is replaced on output by its sorted rearrangement.
{
int i,j;
float a;
for (j=2;j<=n;j++) {
Pick out each element in turn.
a=arr[j];
i=j-1;
while (i > 0 && arr[i] > a) {
Look for the place to insert it.
arr[i+1]=arr[i];
i--;
}
arr[i+1]=a;
Insert it.
}
}
What if you also want to rearrange an array brr at the same time as you sort
arr? Simply move an element of brr whenever you move an element of arr:

For the case of rearranging a larger number of arrays by sorting on one of
them, see Â§8.4.
Shellâs Method
This is actuallya variant onstraight insertion,but a very powerfulvariant indeed.
The rough idea, e.g., for the case of sorting 16 numbers n1 . . . n16, is this: First sort,
by straight insertion, each of the 8 groups of 2 (n1, n9), (n2, n10), . . ., (n8, n16).
Next, sort each of the 4 groups of 4 (n1, n5, n9, n13), . . ., (n4, n8, n12, n16). Next
sort the 2 groups of 8 records, beginning with (n1, n3, n5, n7, n9, n11, n13, n15).
Finally, sort the whole list of 16 numbers.
Of course, only the last sort is necessary for putting the numbers into order. So
what is the purpose of the previous partial sorts? The answer is that the previous
sorts allow numbers efï¬ciently to ï¬lter up or down to positions close to their ï¬nal
resting places. Therefore, the straight insertion passes on the ï¬nal sort rarely have to
go past more than a âfewâ elements before ï¬nding the right place. (Think of sorting
a hand of cards that are already almost in order.)
The spacings between the numbers sorted on each pass throughthe data (8,4,2,1
in the above example) are called the increments, and a Shell sort is sometimes
called a diminishing increment sort. There has been a lot of research into how to
choose a good set of increments, but the optimum choice is not known. The set
. . ., 8, 4, 2, 1 is in fact not a good choice, especially for N a power of 2. A much
better choice is the sequence
(3k â1)/2, . . ., 40, 13, 4, 1
(8.1.1)
which can be generated by the recurrence
i1 = 1,
ik+1 = 3ik + 1,
k = 1, 2, . . .
(8.1.2)
It can be shown (see [1]) that for this sequence of increments the number of operations
required in all is of order N 3/2 for the worst possible ordering of the original data.

8.2 Quicksort
Quicksort is, on most machines, on average, for large N, the fastest known
sorting algorithm.
It is a âpartition-exchangeâ sorting method: A âpartitioning
elementâ a is selected from the array. Then by pairwise exchanges of elements, the
original array is partitioned into two subarrays. At the end of a round of partitioning,
the element a is in its ï¬nal place in the array. All elements in the left subarray are
â¤a, while all elements in the right subarray are â¥a. The process is then repeated
on the left and right subarrays independently, and so on.
The partitioning process is carried out by selecting some element, say the
leftmost, as the partitioning element a. Scan a pointer up the array until you ï¬nd
an element > a, and then scan another pointer down from the end of the array
until you ï¬nd an element < a. These two elements are clearly out of place for the
ï¬nal partitioned array, so exchange them. Continue this process until the pointers
cross. This is the right place to insert a, and that round of partitioning is done. The

8.2 Quicksort
Quicksort is, on most machines, on average, for large N, the fastest known
sorting algorithm.
It is a âpartition-exchangeâ sorting method: A âpartitioning
elementâ a is selected from the array. Then by pairwise exchanges of elements, the
original array is partitioned into two subarrays. At the end of a round of partitioning,
the element a is in its ï¬nal place in the array. All elements in the left subarray are
â¤a, while all elements in the right subarray are â¥a. The process is then repeated
on the left and right subarrays independently, and so on.
The partitioning process is carried out by selecting some element, say the
leftmost, as the partitioning element a. Scan a pointer up the array until you ï¬nd
an element > a, and then scan another pointer down from the end of the array
until you ï¬nd an element < a. These two elements are clearly out of place for the
ï¬nal partitioned array, so exchange them. Continue this process until the pointers
cross. This is the right place to insert a, and that round of partitioning is done. The

question of the best strategy when an element is equal to the partitioning element
is subtle; we refer you to Sedgewick [1] for a discussion. (Answer: You should
stop and do an exchange.)
For speed of execution, we do not implement Quicksort using recursion. Thus
the algorithm requires an auxiliary array of storage, of length 2 log2 N, which it uses
as a push-down stack for keeping track of the pending subarrays. When a subarray
has gotten down to some size M, it becomes faster to sort it by straight insertion
(Â§8.1), so we will do this. The optimal setting of M is machine dependent, but
M = 7 is not too far wrong. Some people advocate leaving the short subarrays
unsorted until the end, and then doing one giant insertion sort at the end. Since
each element moves at most 7 places, this is just as efï¬cient as doing the sorts
immediately, and saves on the overhead. However, on modern machines with paged
memory, there is increased overhead when dealing with a large array all at once. We
have not found any advantage in saving the insertion sorts till the end.
As already mentioned, Quicksortâs average running time is fast, but its worst
case running time can be very slow: For the worst case it is, in fact, an N 2 method!
And for the most straightforward implementation of Quicksort it turns out that the
worst case is achieved for an input array that is already in order! This ordering
of the input array might easily occur in practice. One way to avoid this is to use
a little random number generator to choose a random element as the partitioning
element. Another is to use instead the median of the ï¬rst, middle, and last elements
of the current subarray.
The great speed of Quicksort comes from the simplicity and efï¬ciency of its
inner loop. Simply adding one unnecessary test (for example, a test that your pointer
has not moved off the end of the array) can almost double the running time! One
avoids such unnecessary tests by placing âsentinelsâ at either end of the subarray
being partitioned.
The leftmost sentinel is â¤a, the rightmost â¥a.
With the
âmedian-of-threeâ selection of a partitioning element, we can use the two elements
that were not the median to be the sentinels for that subarray.
Our implementation closely follows [1]:
#include "nrutil.h"
#define SWAP(a,b) temp=(a);(a)=(b);(b)=temp;
#define M 7
#define NSTACK 50
Here M is the size of subarrays sorted by straight insertion and NSTACK is the required auxiliary
storage.

brr, but this becomes wasteful as the number of such arrays becomes large. The
preferred technique is to make use of an index table, as described in Â§8.4.

8.3 Heapsort
While usually not quite as fast as Quicksort, Heapsort is one of our favorite
sorting routines. It is a true âin-placeâ sort, requiring no auxiliary storage. It is an
N log2 N process, not onlyon average, but also for the worst-case order of input data.
In fact, its worst case is only 20 percent or so worse than its average running time.
It is beyond our scope to give a complete exposition on the theory of Heapsort.
We will mention the general principles, then let you refer to the references [1,2], or
analyze the program yourself, if you want to understand the details.
A set of N numbers ai, i = 1, . . ., N, is said to form a âheapâ if it satisï¬es
the relation
aj/2 â¥aj
for
1 â¤j/2 < j â¤N
(8.3.1)
Here the division in j/2 means âinteger divide,â i.e., is an exact integer or else
is rounded down to the closest integer. Deï¬nition (8.3.1) will make sense if you
think of the numbers ai as being arranged in a binary tree, with the top, âboss,â
node being a1, the two âunderlingâ nodes being a2 and a3, their four underling
nodes being a4 through a7, etc.
(See Figure 8.3.1.)
In this form, a heap has
every âsupervisorâ greater than or equal to its two âsupervisees,â down through
the levels of the hierarchy.
If you have managed to rearrange your array into an order that forms a heap,
then sorting it is very easy: You pull off the âtop of the heap,â which will be the
largest element yet unsorted. Then you âpromoteâ to the top of the heap its largest
underling. Then you promote its largest underling, and so on. The process is like
what happens (or is supposed to happen) in a large corporation when the chairman
of the board retires. You then repeat the whole process by retiring the new chairman
of the board. Evidently the whole thing is an N log2 N process, since each retiring
chairman leads to log2 N promotions of underlings.
Well, how do you arrange the array into a heap in the ï¬rst place? The answer
is again a âsift-upâ process like corporate promotion. Imagine that the corporation
starts out with N/2 employees on the production line, but with no supervisors. Now
a supervisor is hired to supervise two workers. If he is less capable than one of
his workers, that one is promoted in his place, and he joins the production line.

Ordering implied by a âheap,â here of 12 elements. Elements connected by an upward
path are sorted with respect to one another, but there is not necessarily any ordering among elements
related only âlaterally.â
After supervisors are hired, then supervisors of supervisors are hired, and so on up
the corporate ladder. Each employee is brought in at the top of the tree, but then
immediately sifted down, with more capable workers promoted until their proper
corporate level has been reached.
In the Heapsort implementation, the same âsift-upâ code can be used for the
initial creation of the heap and for the subsequent retirement-and-promotion phase.
One execution of the Heapsort function represents the entire life-cycle of a giant
corporation: N/2 workers are hired; N/2 potential supervisors are hired; there is a
sifting up in the ranks, a sort of super Peter Principle: in due course, each of the
original employees gets promoted to chairman of the board.

8.4 Indexing and Ranking
The concept of keys plays a prominent role in the management of data ï¬les. A
data record in such a ï¬le may contain several items, or ï¬elds. For example, a record
in a ï¬le of weather observations may have ï¬elds recording time, temperature, and
wind velocity. When we sort the records, we must decide which of these ï¬elds we
want to be brought into sorted order. The other ï¬elds in a record just come along
for the ride, and will not, in general, end up in any particular order. The ï¬eld on
which the sort is performed is called the key ï¬eld.
For a data ï¬le with many records and many ï¬elds, the actual movement of N
records into the sorted order of their keys Ki, i = 1, . . ., N, can be a daunting task.
Instead, one can construct an index table Ij, j = 1, . . ., N, such that the smallest
Ki has i = I1, the second smallest has i = I2, and so on up to the largest Ki with
i = IN.
In other words, the array
KIj
j = 1, 2, . . ., N
(8.4.1)
is in sorted order when indexed by j. When an index table is available, one need not
move records from their original order. Further, different index tables can be made
from the same set of records, indexing them to different keys.
The algorithm for constructing an index table is straightforward: Initialize the
index array with the integers from 1 to N, then perform the Quicksort algorithm,
moving the elements around as if one were sorting the keys. The integer that initially
numbered the smallest key thus ends up in the number one position, and so on.

Ki has i = I1, the second smallest has i = I2, and so on up to the largest Ki with
i = IN.
In other words, the array
KIj
j = 1, 2, . . ., N
(8.4.1)
is in sorted order when indexed by j. When an index table is available, one need not
move records from their original order. Further, different index tables can be made
from the same set of records, indexing them to different keys.
The algorithm for constructing an index table is straightforward: Initialize the
index array with the integers from 1 to N, then perform the Quicksort algorithm,
moving the elements around as if one were sorting the keys. The integer that initially
numbered the smallest key thus ends up in the number one position, and so on.

If you want to sort an array while making the corresponding rearrangement of
several or many other arrays, you should ï¬rst make an index table, then use it to
rearrange each array in turn. This requires two arrays of working space: one to
hold the index, and another into which an array is temporarily moved, and from
which it is redeposited back on itself in the rearranged order. For 3 arrays, the
procedure looks like this:
#include "nrutil.h"
void sort3(unsigned long n, float ra[], float rb[], float rc[])
Sorts an array ra[1..n] into ascending numerical order while making the corresponding re-
arrangements of the arrays rb[1..n] and rc[1..n]. An index table is constructed via the
routine indexx.
{
void indexx(unsigned long n, float arr[], unsigned long indx[]);
unsigned long j,*iwksp;
float *wksp;
iwksp=lvector(1,n);
wksp=vector(1,n);
indexx(n,ra,iwksp);
Make the index table.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) wksp[j]=ra[j];
Save the array ra.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) ra[j]=wksp[iwksp[j]];
Copy it back in rearranged order.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) wksp[j]=rb[j];
Ditto rb.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) rb[j]=wksp[iwksp[j]];
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) wksp[j]=rc[j];
Ditto rc.
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) rc[j]=wksp[iwksp[j]];
free_vector(wksp,1,n);
free_lvector(iwksp,1,n);
}
The generalization to any other number of arrays is obviously straightforward.
A rank table is different from an index table. A rank tableâs jth entry gives the

rank of the jth element of the original array of keys, ranging from 1 (if that element
was the smallest) to N (if that element was the largest). One can easily construct
a rank table from an index table, however:
void rank(unsigned long n, unsigned long indx[], unsigned long irank[])
Given indx[1..n] as output from the routine indexx, returns an array irank[1..n], the
corresponding table of ranks.

unsigned long j;
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) irank[indx[j]]=j;

Figure 8.4.1 summarizes the concepts discussed in this section.
8.5 Selecting the Mth Largest
Selection is sortingâsaustere sister. (Say that ï¬ve times quickly!) Where sorting
demands the rearrangement of an entire data array, selection politely asks for a single
returned value: What isthekthsmallest (or, equivalently,them = N+1âkthlargest)
element out of N elements? The fastest methods for selection do, unfortunately,
rearrange the array for their own computational purposes, typicallyputtingall smaller
elements to the left of the kth, all larger elements to the right, and scrambling the
order within each subset. This side effect is at best innocuous, at worst downright
inconvenient. When the array is verylong, so that making a scratch copy ofit is taxing
on memory, or when the computational burden of the selection is a negligible part
of a larger calculation, one turns to selection algorithms without side effects, which
leave the original array undisturbed. Such in place selection is slower than the faster
selection methods by a factor of about 10. We give routines of both types, below.
The most common use of selection is in the statistical characterization of a set
of data. One often wants to know the median element in an array, or the top and
bottom quartile elements.
When N is odd, the median is the kth element, with
k = (N +1)/2. When N is even, statistics books deï¬ne the median as the arithmetic
mean of the elements k = N/2 and k = N/2 + 1 (that is, N/2 from the bottom
and N/2 from the top). If you accept such pedantry, you must perform two separate
selections to ï¬nd these elements. For N > 100 we usually deï¬ne k = N/2 to be
the median element, pedants be damned.
The fastest general method for selection, allowing rearrangement, is partition-
ing, exactly as was done in the Quicksort algorithm (Â§8.2). Selecting a ârandomâ
partition element, one marches through the array, forcing smaller elements to the
left, larger elements to the right. As in Quicksort, it is important to optimize the
inner loop, using âsentinelsâ (Â§8.2) to minimize the number of comparisons. For
sorting, one would then proceed to further partition both subsets. For selection,
we can ignore one subset and attend only to the one that contains our desired kth
element. Selection by partitioning thus does not need a stack of pending operations,
and its operations count scales as N rather than as N log N (see [1]). Comparison
with sort in Â§8.2 should make the following routine obvious:

In-place, nondestructive, selection is conceptually simple, but it requires a lot
of bookkeeping, and it is correspondingly slower. The general idea is to pick some
number M of elements at random, to sort them, and then to make a pass through
the array counting how many elements fall in each of the M + 1 intervals deï¬ned
by these elements. The kth largest will fall in one such interval â call it the âliveâ
interval. One then does a second round, ï¬rst picking M random elements in the live
interval, and then determining which of the new, ï¬ner, M + 1 intervals all presently
live elements fall into. And so on, until the kth element is ï¬nally localized within a
single array of size M, at which point direct selection is possible.
How shall we pick M? The number of rounds, logM N = log2 N/ log2 M,
will be smaller if M is larger; but the work to locate each element among M + 1
subintervals will be larger, scaling as log2 M for bisection, say.
Each round

Two minor additional tricks in the following routine, selip, are (i) augmenting
the set of M random values by an M + 1st, the arithmetic mean, and (ii) choosing
the M random values âon the ï¬yâ in a pass through the data, by a method that makes
later values no less likely to be chosen than earlier ones. (The underlying idea is to
give element m > M an M/m chance of being brought into the set. You can prove
by induction that this yields the desired result.)

Approximate timings: selip is about 10 times slower than select. Indeed,
for N in the range of â¼105, selip is about 1.5 times slower than a full sort with
sort, while select is about 6 times faster than sort. You should weigh time
against memory and convenience carefully.
Of course neither of the above routines should be used for the trivial cases of
ï¬nding the largest, or smallest, element in an array. Those cases, you code by hand
as simple for loops. There are also good ways to code the case where k is modest in
comparison to N, so that extra memory of order k is not burdensome. An example
is to use the method of Heapsort (Â§8.3) to make a single pass through an array of
length N while saving the m largest elements. The advantage of the heap structure
is that only log m, rather than m, comparisons are required every time a new element
is added to the candidate list. This becomes a real savings when m > O(
â
N), but
it never hurts otherwise and is easy to code. The following program gives the idea.
void hpsel(unsigned long m, unsigned long n, float arr[], float heap[])
Returns in heap[1..m] the largest m elements of the array arr[1..n], with heap[1] guaran-
teed to be the the mth largest element. The array arr is not altered. For eï¬ciency, this routine
should be used only when m âªn.

Create initial heap by overkill! We assume m âªn.

8.6 Determination of Equivalence Classes
A number of techniques for sorting and searching relate to data structures whose details
are beyond the scope of this book, for example, trees, linked lists, etc. These structures and
their manipulations are the bread and butter of computer science, as distinct from numerical
analysis, and there is no shortage of books on the subject.
In working with experimental data, we have found that one particular such manipulation,
namely the determination of equivalence classes, arises sufï¬ciently often to justify inclusion
here.
The problem is this: There are N âelementsâ (or âdata pointsâ or whatever), numbered
1, . . . , N.
You are given pairwise information about whether elements are in the same
equivalence class of âsameness,â by whatever criterion happens to be of interest.
For
example, you may have a list of facts like: âElement 3 and element 7 are in the same class;

class, . . . .â Alternatively, you may have a procedure, given the numbers of two elements
j and k, for deciding whether they are in the same class or different classes. (Recall that

Efï¬cient algorithms work like this: Let F(j) be the class or âfamilyâ number of element
j. Start off with each element in its own family, so that F(j) = j. The array F(j) can be
interpreted as a tree structure, whereF(j) denotesthe parent of j. If we arrange for eachfamily
to be its own tree, disjoint from all the other âfamily trees,â then we can label each family
(equivalence class) by its most senior great-great-. . .grandparent. The detailed topology of
the tree doesnât matter at all, as long as we graft each related element onto it somewhere.
Therefore, we process each elemental datum âj is equivalent to kâ by (i) tracking j
up to its highest ancestor, (ii) tracking k up to its highest ancestor, (iii) giving j to k as a
new parent, or vice versa (it makes no difference). After processing all the relations, we go
through all the elements j and reset their F(j)âs to their highest possible ancestors, which
then label the equivalence classes.
The following routine, based on Knuth [1], assumes that there are m elemental pieces
of information, stored in two arrays of length m, lista,listb, the interpretation being
that lista[j] and listb[j], j=1...m, are the numbers of two elements which (we are
thus told) are related.

8.6 Determination of Equivalence Classes
A number of techniques for sorting and searching relate to data structures whose details
are beyond the scope of this book, for example, trees, linked lists, etc. These structures and
their manipulations are the bread and butter of computer science, as distinct from numerical
analysis, and there is no shortage of books on the subject.
In working with experimental data, we have found that one particular such manipulation,
namely the determination of equivalence classes, arises sufï¬ciently often to justify inclusion
here.
The problem is this: There are N âelementsâ (or âdata pointsâ or whatever), numbered
1, . . . , N.
You are given pairwise information about whether elements are in the same
equivalence class of âsameness,â by whatever criterion happens to be of interest.
For
example, you may have a list of facts like: âElement 3 and element 7 are in the same class;
element 19 and element 4 are in the same class; element 7 and element 12 are in the same
class, . . . .â Alternatively, you may have a procedure, given the numbers of two elements
j and k, for deciding whether they are in the same class or different classes. (Recall that
an equivalence relation can be anything satisfying the RST properties: reï¬exive, symmetric,
transitive. This is compatible with any intuitive deï¬nition of âsameness.â)
The desired output is an assignment to each of the N elements of an equivalence class
number, such that two elements are in the same class if and only if they are assigned the
same class number.
Efï¬cient algorithms work like this: Let F(j) be the class or âfamilyâ number of element
j. Start off with each element in its own family, so that F(j) = j. The array F(j) can be
interpreted as a tree structure, whereF(j) denotesthe parent of j. If we arrange for eachfamily
to be its own tree, disjoint from all the other âfamily trees,â then we can label each family
(equivalence class) by its most senior great-great-. . .grandparent. The detailed topology of
the tree doesnât matter at all, as long as we graft each related element onto it somewhere.
Therefore, we process each elemental datum âj is equivalent to kâ by (i) tracking j
up to its highest ancestor, (ii) tracking k up to its highest ancestor, (iii) giving j to k as a
new parent, or vice versa (it makes no difference). After processing all the relations, we go
through all the elements j and reset their F(j)âs to their highest possible ancestors, which
then label the equivalence classes.
The following routine, based on Knuth [1], assumes that there are m elemental pieces
of information, stored in two arrays of length m, lista,listb, the interpretation being
that lista[j] and listb[j], j=1...m, are the numbers of two elements which (we are
thus told) are related.

void eclass(int nf[], int n, int lista[], int listb[], int m)
Given m equivalences between pairs of n individual elements in the form of the input arrays
lista[1..m] and listb[1..m], this routine returns in nf[1..n] the number of the equiv-
alence class of each of the n elements, integers between 1 and n (not all such integers used).
{
int l,k,j;
for (k=1;k<=n;k++) nf[k]=k;
Initialize each element its own class.
for (l=1;l<=m;l++) {
For each piece of input information...
j=lista[l];
while (nf[j] != j) j=nf[j];
Track ï¬rst element up to its ancestor.
k=listb[l];
while (nf[k] != k) k=nf[k];
Track second element up to its ancestor.
if (j != k) nf[j]=k;
If they are not already related, make them
so.
}
for (j=1;j<=n;j++)
Final sweep up to highest ancestors.
while (nf[j] != nf[nf[j]]) nf[j]=nf[nf[j]];
}
Alternatively, we may be able to construct a function equiv(j,k)that returns a nonzero
(true) value if elements j and k are related, or a zero (false) value if they are not. Then we
want to loop over all pairs of elements to get the complete picture. D. Eardley has devised
a clever way of doing this while simultaneously sweeping the tree up to high ancestors in a
manner that keeps it current and obviates most of the ï¬nal sweep phase:
void eclazz(int nf[], int n, int (*equiv)(int, int))
Given a user-supplied boolean function equiv which tells whether a pair of elements, each in
the range 1...n, are related, return in nf[1..n] equivalence class numbers for each element.
{
int kk,jj;
nf[1]=1;
for (jj=2;jj<=n;jj++) {
Loop over ï¬rst element of all pairs.
nf[jj]=jj;
for (kk=1;kk<=(jj-1);kk++) {
Loop over second element of all pairs.
nf[kk]=nf[nf[kk]];
Sweep it up this much.
if ((*equiv)(jj,kk)) nf[nf[nf[kk]]]=jj;
Good exercise for the reader to ï¬gure out why this much ancestry is necessary!
}
}
for (jj=1;jj<=n;jj++) nf[jj]=nf[nf[jj]];
Only this much sweeping is needed
ï¬nally.

Chapter 9.
Root Finding and
Nonlinear Sets of Equations
9.0 Introduction
We now consider that most basic of tasks, solving equations numerically. While
most equations are born with both a right-hand side and a left-hand side, one
traditionally moves all terms to the left, leaving
f(x) = 0
(9.0.1)
whose solutionor solutionsare desired. When there is onlyone independent variable,
the problem is one-dimensional, namely to ï¬nd the root or roots of a function.
With more than one independent variable, more than one equation can be
satisï¬ed simultaneously.
You likely once learned the implicit function theorem
which (in this context) gives us the hope of satisfying N equations in N unknowns
simultaneously. Note that we have only hope, not certainty. A nonlinear set of
equations may have no (real) solutions at all. Contrariwise, it may have more than
one solution. The implicit function theorem tells us that âgenericallyâ the solutions
will be distinct, pointlike, and separated from each other. If, however, life is so
unkind as to present you with a nongeneric, i.e., degenerate, case, then you can get
a continuous family of solutions. In vector notation, we want to ï¬nd one or more
N-dimensional solution vectors x such that
f(x) = 0
(9.0.2)
where f is the N-dimensional vector-valued function whose components are the
individual equations to be satisï¬ed simultaneously.
Donât be fooled by the apparent notational similarity of equations (9.0.2) and
(9.0.1). Simultaneous solution of equations in N dimensions is much more difï¬cult
than ï¬nding roots in the one-dimensional case. The principal difference between one
and many dimensions isthat, inone dimension, it ispossible tobracket or âtrapâ a root
between bracketing values, and then hunt it down like a rabbit. In multidimensions,
you can never be sure that the root is there at all until you have found it.
Except in linear problems, root ï¬nding invariably proceeds by iteration, and
this is equally true in one or in many dimensions. Starting from some approximate
trial solution, a useful algorithm will improve the solution until some predetermined
convergence criterion is satisï¬ed. For smoothly varying functions, good algorithms

will always converge, provided that the initial guess is good enough. Indeed one can
even determine in advance the rate of convergence of most algorithms.
It cannot be overemphasized, however, how crucially success depends on
having a good ï¬rst guess for the solution, especially for multidimensional problems.
This crucial beginning usually depends on analysis rather than numerics. Carefully
crafted initial estimates reward you not only with reduced computational effort, but
also with understanding and increased self-esteem. Hammingâs motto, âthe purpose
of computing is insight, not numbers,â is particularly apt in the area of ï¬nding
roots. You should repeat this motto aloud whenever your program converges, with
ten-digit accuracy, to the wrong root of a problem, or whenever it fails to converge
because there is actually no root, or because there is a root but your initial estimate
was not sufï¬ciently close to it.
âThis talk of insight is all very well, but what do I actually do?â For one-
dimensional root ï¬nding, it is possible to give some straightforward answers: You
should try to get some idea of what your function looks like before trying to ï¬nd
its roots. If you need to mass-produce roots for many different functions, then you
should at least know what some typical members of the ensemble look like. Next,
you should always bracket a root, that is, know that the function changes sign in an
identiï¬ed interval, before trying to converge to the rootâs value.
Finally (this is advice with which some daring souls might disagree, but
we give it nonetheless) never let your iteration method get outside of the best
bracketing bounds obtained at any stage. We will see below that some pedagogically
important algorithms, such as secant method or Newton-Raphson, can violate this
last constraint, and are thus not recommended unless certain ï¬xups are implemented.
Multiple roots, or very close roots, are a real problem, especially if the
multiplicity is an even number.
In that case, there may be no readily apparent
sign change in the function, so the notion of bracketing a root â and maintaining
the bracket â becomes difï¬cult.
We are hard-liners: we nevertheless insist on
bracketing a root, even if it takes the minimum-searching techniques of Chapter 10
to determine whether a tantalizing dip in the function really does cross zero or not.
(You can easily modify the simple golden section routine of Â§10.1 to return early
if it detects a sign change in the function. And, if the minimum of the function is
exactly zero, then you have found a double root.)
As usual, we want to discourage you from using routines as black boxes without
understanding them. However, as a guide to beginners, here are some reasonable
starting points:
â¢ Brentâs algorithm in Â§9.3 is the method of choice to ï¬nd a bracketed root
of a general one-dimensional function, when you cannot easily compute
the functionâs derivative. Riddersâ method (Â§9.2) is concise, and a close
competitor.
â¢ When you can compute the functionâs derivative, the routine rtsafe in
Â§9.4, which combines the Newton-Raphson method with some bookkeep-
ing on bounds, is recommended. Again, you must ï¬rst bracket your root.
â¢ Roots of polynomials are a special case.
Laguerreâs method, in Â§9.5,
is recommended as a starting point.
Beware: Some polynomials are
ill-conditioned!
â¢ Finally, for multidimensional problems, the only elementary method is
Newton-Raphson (Â§9.6), which works very well if you can supply a

9.1 Bracketing and Bisection
We will say that a root is bracketed in the interval (a, b) if f(a) and f(b)
have opposite signs. If the function is continuous, then at least one root must lie in
that interval (the intermediate value theorem). If the function is discontinuous, but
bounded, then instead of a root there might be a step discontinuity which crosses
zero (see Figure 9.1.1). For numerical purposes, that might as well be a root, since
the behavior is indistinguishable from the case of a continuous function whose zero
crossing occurs in between two âadjacentâ ï¬oating-point numbers in a machineâs
ï¬nite-precision representation.
Only for functions with singularities is there the
possibility that a bracketed root is not really there, as for example
f(x) =
1
x âc
(9.1.1)
Some root-ï¬nding algorithms (e.g., bisection in this section) will readily converge
to c in (9.1.1). Luckily there is not much possibility of your mistaking c, or any
number x close to it, for a root, since mere evaluation of |f(x)| will give a very
large, rather than a very small, result.
If you are given a function in a black box, there is no sure way of bracketing
its roots, or of even determining that it has roots. If you like pathological examples,
think about the problem of locating the two real roots of equation (3.0.1), which dips
below zero only in the ridiculously small interval of about x = Ï Â± 10â667.
In the next chapter we will deal with the related problem of bracketing a
functionâs minimum. There it is possible to give a procedure that always succeeds;
in essence, âGo downhill, taking steps of increasing size, until your function starts
back uphill.â There is no analogous procedure for roots. The procedure âgo downhill
until your function changes sign,â can be foiled by a function that has a simple
extremum. Nevertheless, if you are prepared to deal with a âfailureâ outcome, this
procedure is often a good ï¬rst start; success is usual if your function has opposite
signs in the limit x âÂ±â.

int zbrac(float (*func)(float), float *x1, float *x2)
Given a function func and an initial guessed range x1 to x2, the routine expands the range
geometrically until a root is bracketed by the returned values x1 and x2 (in which case zbrac
returns 1) or until the range becomes unacceptably large (in which case zbrac returns 0).

Alternatively, you might want to âlook inwardâ on an initial interval, rather
than âlook outwardâ from it, asking if there are any roots of the function f(x) in
the interval from x1 to x2 when a search is carried out by subdivision into n equal
intervals. The following function calculates brackets for up to nb distinct intervals
which each contain one or more roots.
void zbrak(float (*fx)(float), float x1, float x2, int n, float xb1[],
float xb2[], int *nb)
Given a function fx deï¬ned on the interval from x1-x2 subdivide the interval into n equally
spaced segments, and search for zero crossings of the function. nb is input as the maximum num-
ber of roots sought, and is reset to the number of bracketing pairs xb1[1..nb], xb2[1..nb]
that are found.

Bisection Method
Once we know that an interval contains a root, several classical procedures are
available to reï¬ne it. These proceed with varying degrees of speed and sureness
towards the answer. Unfortunately, the methods that are guaranteed to converge plod
along most slowly, while those that rush to the solutionin the best cases can also dash
rapidly to inï¬nity without warning if measures are not taken to avoid such behavior.
The bisection method is one that cannot fail. It is thus not to be sneered at
as a method for otherwise badly behaved problems.
The idea is simple.
Over
some interval the function is known to pass through zero because it changes sign.
Evaluate the function at the intervalâs midpoint and examine its sign.
Use the
midpoint to replace whichever limit has the same sign.
After each iteration the
bounds containing the root decrease by a factor of two. If after n iterations the root
is known to be within an interval of size Ïµn, then after the next iteration it will be
bracketed within an interval of size
Ïµn+1 = Ïµn/2
(9.1.2)
neither more nor less. Thus, we know in advance the number of iterations required
to achieve a given tolerance in the solution,
n = log2
Ïµ0
Ïµ
(9.1.3)
where Ïµ0 is the size of the initially bracketing interval, Ïµ is the desired ending
tolerance.
Bisection must succeed. If the interval happens to contain two or more roots,
bisection will ï¬nd one of them. If the interval contains no roots and merely straddles
a singularity, it will converge on the singularity.
When a method converges as a factor (less than 1) times the previous uncertainty
to the ï¬rst power (as is the case for bisection), it is said to converge linearly. Methods
that converge as a higher power,
Ïµn+1 = constant Ã (Ïµn)m
m > 1
(9.1.4)
are said to converge superlinearly. In other contexts âlinearâ convergence would be
termed âexponential,â orâgeometrical.â That isnot toobadat all: Linearconvergence
means that successive signiï¬cant ï¬gures are won linearly with computational effort.
It remains to discuss practical criteria for convergence. It is crucial to keep in
mind that computers use a ï¬xed number of binary digits to represent ï¬oating-point
numbers. While your function might analyticallypass throughzero, it is possible that
its computed value is never zero, for any ï¬oating-point argument. One must decide
what accuracy on the root is attainable: Convergence to within 10â6 in absolute
value is reasonable when the root lies near 1, but certainly unachievable if the root
lies near 1026. One might thus think to specify convergence by a relative (fractional)
criterion, but this becomes unworkable for roots near zero. To be most general, the
routines below will require you to specify an absolute tolerance, such that iterations
continue until the interval becomes smaller than this tolerance in absolute units.
Usually you may wish to take the tolerance to be Ïµ(|x1| + |x2|)/2 where Ïµ is the
machine precision and x1 and x2 are the initial brackets. When the root lies near zero
you ought to consider carefully what reasonable tolerance means for your function.
The following routine quits after 40 bisections in any event, with 2â40 â10â12.

9.2 Secant Method, False Position Method,
and Riddersâ Method
For functions that are smooth near a root, the methods known respectively
as false position (or regula falsi) and secant method generally converge faster than
bisection. In both of these methods the function is assumed to be approximately
linear in the local region of interest, and the next improvement in the root is taken as
the point where the approximating line crosses the axis. After each iteration one of
the previous boundary points is discarded in favor of the latest estimate of the root.
The only difference between the methods is that secant retains the most recent
of the prior estimates (Figure 9.2.1; this requires an arbitrary choice on the ï¬rst
iteration), while false position retains that prior estimate for which the function value
has opposite sign from the function value at the current best estimate of the root,
so that the two points continue to bracket the root (Figure 9.2.2). Mathematically,
the secant method converges more rapidly near a root of a sufï¬ciently continuous
function. Its order of convergence can be shown to be the âgolden ratioâ 1.618 . . .,
so that
lim
kââ|Ïµk+1| âconst Ã |Ïµk|1.618
(9.2.1)
The secant method has, however, the disadvantage that the root does not necessarily
remain bracketed. For functions that are not sufï¬ciently continuous, the algorithm
can therefore not be guaranteed to converge: Local behavior might send it off
towards inï¬nity.

Example where both the secant and false position methods will take many iterations to
arrive at the true root. This function would be difï¬cult for many other root-ï¬nding methods.
False position, since it sometimes keeps an older rather than newer function
evaluation, has a lower order of convergence. Since the newer function value will
sometimes be kept, the method is often superlinear, but estimation of its exact order
is not so easy.
Here are sample implementations of these two related methods. While these
methods are standard textbook fare, Riddersâ method, described below, or Brentâs

Riddersâ Method
A powerful variant on false position is due to Ridders [1].
When a root is
bracketed between x1 and x2, Riddersâ method ï¬rst evaluates the function at the
midpoint x3 = (x1 + x2)/2. It then factors out that unique exponential function
which turns the residual function into a straight line. Speciï¬cally, it solves for a
factor eQ that gives
f(x1) â2f(x3)eQ + f(x2)e2Q = 0
(9.2.2)
This is a quadratic equation in eQ, which can be solved to give
eQ = f(x3) + sign[f(x2)]
p
f(x3)2 âf(x1)f(x2)
f(x2)
(9.2.3)
Now the false position method is applied, not to the values f(x1), f(x3), f(x2), but
to the values f(x1), f(x3)eQ, f(x2)e2Q, yielding a new guess for the root, x4. The
overall updating formula (incorporating the solution 9.2.3) is
x4 = x3 + (x3 âx1)sign[f(x1) âf(x2)]f(x3)
p
f(x3)2 âf(x1)f(x2)
(9.2.4)
Equation (9.2.4) has some very nice properties. First, x4 is guaranteed to lie
in the interval (x1, x2), so the method never jumps out of its brackets. Second,
the convergence of successive applications of equation (9.2.4) is quadratic, that is,
m = 2 in equation (9.1.4). Since each application of (9.2.4) requires two function
evaluations, the actual order of the method is
â
2, not 2; but this is still quite
respectably superlinear: the number of signiï¬cant digits in the answer approximately
doubles with each two function evaluations. Third, taking out the functionâs âbendâ
via exponential (that is, ratio) factors, rather than via a polynomial technique (e.g.,
ï¬tting a parabola), turns out to give an extraordinarily robust algorithm. In both
reliability and speed, Riddersâ method is generally competitive with the more highly
developed and better established(but more complicated) method ofVan Wijngaarden,
Dekker, and Brent, which we next discuss.

9.3 Van WijngaardenâDekkerâBrent Method
While secant and false position formally converge faster than bisection, one
ï¬nds in practice pathological functions for which bisection converges more rapidly.
These can be choppy, discontinuousfunctions, or even smooth functionsif the second
derivative changes sharply near the root. Bisection always halves the interval, while
secant and false position can sometimes spend many cycles slowly pulling distant
bounds closer to a root. Riddersâ method does a much better job, but it too can
sometimes be fooled. Is there a way to combine superlinear convergence with the
sureness of bisection?

9.3 Van WijngaardenâDekkerâBrent Method
While secant and false position formally converge faster than bisection, one
ï¬nds in practice pathological functions for which bisection converges more rapidly.
These can be choppy, discontinuousfunctions, or even smooth functionsif the second
derivative changes sharply near the root. Bisection always halves the interval, while
secant and false position can sometimes spend many cycles slowly pulling distant
bounds closer to a root. Riddersâ method does a much better job, but it too can
sometimes be fooled. Is there a way to combine superlinear convergence with the
sureness of bisection?

Yes. We can keep track of whether a supposedly superlinear method is actually
converging the way it is supposed to, and, if it is not, we can intersperse bisection
steps so as to guarantee at least linear convergence. This kind of super-strategy
requires attention to bookkeeping detail, and also careful consideration of how
roundoff errors can affect the guiding strategy. Also, we must be able to determine
reliably when convergence has been achieved.
An excellent algorithm that pays close attention to these matters was developed
in the 1960s by van Wijngaarden, Dekker, and others at the Mathematical Center
in Amsterdam, and later improved by Brent [1]. For brevity, we refer to the ï¬nal
form of the algorithm as Brentâs method.
The method is guaranteed (by Brent)
to converge, so long as the function can be evaluated within the initial interval
known to contain a root.
Brentâs method combines root bracketing, bisection, and inverse quadratic
interpolation to converge from the neighborhood of a zero crossing. While the false
position and secant methods assume approximately linear behavior between two
prior root estimates, inverse quadratic interpolation uses three prior points to ï¬t an
inverse quadratic function (x as a quadratic function of y) whose value at y = 0 is
taken as the next estimate of the root x. Of course one must have contingency plans
for what to do if the root falls outside of the brackets. Brentâs method takes care of
all that. If the three point pairs are [a, f(a)], [b, f(b)], [c, f(c)] then the interpolation
formula (cf. equation 3.1.1) is
x =
[y âf(a)][y âf(b)]c
[f(c) âf(a)][f(c) âf(b)] +
[y âf(b)][y âf(c)]a
[f(a) âf(b)][f(a) âf(c)]
+
[y âf(c)][y âf(a)]b
[f(b) âf(c)][f(b) âf(a)]
(9.3.1)
Setting y to zero gives a result for the next root estimate, which can be written as
x = b + P/Q
(9.3.2)
where, in terms of
R â¡f(b)/f(c),
S â¡f(b)/f(a),
T â¡f(a)/f(c)
(9.3.3)
we have
P = S [T(R âT)(c âb) â(1 âR)(b âa)]
(9.3.4)
Q = (T â1)(R â1)(S â1)
(9.3.5)
In practice b is the current best estimate of the root and P/Q ought to be a âsmallâ
correction. Quadratic methods work well only when the function behaves smoothly;
they run the serious risk of giving very bad estimates of the next root or causing
machine failure by an inappropriate division by a very small number (Q â0).
Brentâs method guards against this problem by maintaining brackets on the root
and checking where the interpolation would land before carrying out the division.
When the correction P/Q would not land within the bounds, or when the bounds
are not collapsing rapidly enough, the algorithm takes a bisection step.
Thus,

9.4 Newton-Raphson Method Using Derivative
Perhaps the most celebrated of all one-dimensional root-ï¬ndingroutines isNew-
tonâs method, also called the Newton-Raphson method. This method is distinguished
from the methods of previous sections by the fact that it requires the evaluation
of both the function f(x), and the derivative fâ²(x), at arbitrary points x.
The
Newton-Raphson formula consists geometrically of extending the tangent line at a
current point xi until it crosses zero, then setting the next guess xi+1 to the abscissa
of that zero-crossing (see Figure 9.4.1). Algebraically, the method derives from the
familiar Taylor series expansion of a function in the neighborhood of a point,
f(x + Î´) âf(x) + fâ²(x)Î´ + fâ²â²(x)
2
Î´2 + . . . .
(9.4.1)
For small enough values of Î´, and for well-behaved functions, the terms beyond
linear are unimportant, hence f(x + Î´) = 0 implies
Î´ = âf(x)
fâ²(x).
(9.4.2)
Newton-Raphson is not restricted to one dimension.
The method readily
generalizes to multiple dimensions, as we shall see in Â§9.6 and Â§9.7, below.
Far from a root, where the higher-order terms in the series are important, the
Newton-Raphson formula can give grossly inaccurate, meaningless corrections. For
instance, the initial guess for the root might be so far from the true root as to let
the search interval include a local maximum or minimum of the function. This can
be death to the method (see Figure 9.4.2). If an iteration places a trial guess near
such a local extremum, so that the ï¬rst derivative nearly vanishes, then Newton-
Raphson sends its solution off to limbo, with vanishingly small hope of recovery.

Unfortunate case where Newtonâs method enters a nonconvergent cycle. This behavior
is often encountered when the function f is obtained, in whole or in part, by table interpolation. With
a better initial guess, the method would have succeeded.
Like most powerful tools, Newton-Raphson can be destructive used in inappropriate
circumstances. Figure 9.4.3 demonstrates another possible pathology.
Why do we call Newton-Raphson powerful? The answer lies in its rate of
convergence: Within a small distance Ïµ of x the function and its derivative are
approximately:
f(x + Ïµ) = f(x) + Ïµfâ²(x) + Ïµ2 fâ²â²(x)
2
+ Â· Â· Â·,
fâ²(x + Ïµ) = fâ²(x) + Ïµfâ²â²(x) + Â· Â· Â·
(9.4.3)
By the Newton-Raphson formula,
xi+1 = xi âf(xi)
fâ²(xi),
(9.4.4)
so that
Ïµi+1 = Ïµi âf(xi)
fâ²(xi).
(9.4.5)
When a trial solution xi differs from the true root by Ïµi, we can use (9.4.3) to express
f(xi), fâ²(xi) in (9.4.4) in terms of Ïµi and derivatives at the root itself. The result is
a recurrence relation for the deviations of the trial solutions

Equation (9.4.6) says that Newton-Raphson converges quadratically (cf. equa-
tion 9.2.3).
Near a root, the number of signiï¬cant digits approximately doubles
with each step. This very strong convergence property makes Newton-Raphson the
method of choice for any function whose derivative can be evaluated efï¬ciently, and
whose derivative is continuous and nonzero in the neighborhood of a root.
Even where Newton-Raphson is rejected for the early stages of convergence
(because of its poor global convergence properties), it is very common to âpolish
upâ a root with one or two steps of Newton-Raphson, which can multiply by two
or four its number of signiï¬cant ï¬gures!
For an efï¬cient realization of Newton-Raphson the user provides a routine that
evaluates both f(x) and its ï¬rst derivative fâ²(x) at the point x. The Newton-Raphson
formula can also be applied using a numerical difference to approximate the true
local derivative,
fâ²(x) âf(x + dx) âf(x)
dx
.
(9.4.7)
This is not, however, a recommended procedure for the following reasons: (i) You
are doing two function evaluations per step, so at best the superlinear order of
convergence will be only
â
2.
(ii) If you take dx too small you will be wiped
out by roundoff, while if you take it too large your order of convergence will be
only linear, no better than using the initial evaluation fâ²(x0) for all subsequent
steps. Therefore, Newton-Raphson with numerical derivatives is (in one dimension)
always dominated by the secant method of Â§9.2. (In multidimensions, where there
is a paucity of available methods, Newton-Raphson with numerical derivatives must
be taken more seriously. See Â§Â§9.6â9.7.)
The following function calls a user supplied function funcd(x,fn,df) which
supplies the function value as fn and the derivative as df.
We have included
input bounds on the root simply to be consistent with previous root-ï¬nding routines:
Newton does not adjust bounds, and works only on local information at the point
x. The bounds are used only to pick the midpoint as the ï¬rst guess, and to reject
the solution if it wanders outside of the bounds.

While Newton-Raphsonâs global convergence properties are poor, it is fairly
easy to design a fail-safe routine that utilizes a combination of bisection and Newton-

For many functions the derivative fâ²(x) often converges to machine accuracy
before the function f(x) itself does. When that is the case one need not subsequently
update fâ²(x). This shortcut is recommended only when you conï¬dently understand
the generic behavior of your function, but it speeds computations when the derivative
calculation is laborious. (Formally this makes the convergence only linear, but if the
derivative isnât changing anyway, you can do no better.)
Newton-Raphson and Fractals
An interesting sidelight to our repeated warnings about Newton-Raphsonâs
unpredictable global convergence properties â its very rapid local convergence
notwithstanding â is to investigate, for some particular equation, the set of starting
values from which the method does, or doesnât converge to a root.
Consider the simple equation
z3 â1 = 0
(9.4.8)
whose single real root is z = 1, but which also has complex roots at the other two
cube roots of unity, exp(Â±2Ïi/3). Newtonâs method gives the iteration
zj+1 = zj âz3
j â1
3z2
j
(9.4.9)
Up to now, we have applied an iteration like equation (9.4.9) only for real
starting values z0, but in fact all of the equations in this section also apply in the
complex plane. We can therefore map out the complex plane into regions from which
a starting value z0, iterated in equation (9.4.9), will, or wonât, converge to z = 1.
Naively, we might expect to ï¬nd a âbasin of convergenceâ somehow surrounding
the root z = 1. We surely do not expect the basin of convergence to ï¬ll the whole
plane, because the plane must also contain regions that converge to each of the two
complex roots. In fact, by symmetry, the three regions must have identical shapes.
Perhaps they will be three symmetric 120â¦wedges, with one root centered in each?
Now take a look at Figure 9.4.4, which shows the result of a numerical
exploration.
The basin of convergence does indeed cover 1/3 the area of the
complex plane, but its boundary is highly irregular â in fact, fractal. (A fractal, so
called, has self-similar structure that repeats on all scales of magniï¬cation.) How
does this fractal emerge from something as simple as Newtonâs method, and an
equation as simple as (9.4.8)? The answer is already implicit in Figure 9.4.2, which
showed how, on the real line, a local extremum causes Newtonâs method to shoot
off to inï¬nity. Suppose one is slightly removed from such a point. Then one might
be shot off not to inï¬nity, but â by luck â right into the basin of convergence

of the desired root. But that means that in the neighborhood of an extremum there
must be a tiny, perhaps distorted, copy of the basin of convergence â a kind of
âone-bounce awayâ copy.
Similar logic shows that there can be âtwo-bounceâ
copies, âthree-bounceâ copies, and so on. A fractal thus emerges.
Notice that, for equation (9.4.8), almost the whole real axis is in the domain of
convergence for the root z = 1. We say âalmostâ because of the peculiar discrete
points on the negative real axis whose convergence is indeterminate (see ï¬gure).
What happens if you start Newtonâs method from one of these points? (Try it.)

9.5 Roots of Polynomials
Here we present a few methods for ï¬nding roots of polynomials. These will
serve for most practical problems involving polynomials of low-to-moderate degree
or for well-conditioned polynomials of higher degree. Not as well appreciated as it
ought to be is the fact that some polynomials are exceedingly ill-conditioned. The
tiniest changes in a polynomialâs coefï¬cients can, in the worst case, send its roots
sprawling all over the complex plane. (An infamous example due to Wilkinson is
detailed by Acton [1].)
Recall that a polynomial of degree n will have n roots. The roots can be real
or complex, and they might not be distinct. If the coefï¬cients of the polynomial are
real, then complex roots will occur in pairs that are conjugate, i.e., if x1 = a + bi
is a root then x2 = a âbi will also be a root. When the coefï¬cients are complex,
the complex roots need not be related.
Multipleroots, or closely spaced roots, produce the most difï¬culty for numerical
algorithms (see Figure 9.5.1). For example, P (x) = (x âa)2 has a double real root
at x = a. However, we cannot bracket the root by the usual technique of identifying
neighborhoods where the function changes sign, nor will slope-following methods
such as Newton-Raphson work well, because both the function and its derivative
vanish at a multiple root.
Newton-Raphson may work, but slowly, since large
roundoff errors can occur. When a root is known in advance to be multiple, then
special methods of attack are readily devised. Problems arise when (as is generally
the case) we do not know in advance what pathology a root will display.
Deï¬ation of Polynomials
When seeking several or all roots of a polynomial, the total effort can be
signiï¬cantly reduced by the use of deï¬ation. As each root r is found, the polynomial
is factored into a product involving the root and a reduced polynomial of degree
one less than the original, i.e., P (x) = (x âr)Q(x).
Since the roots of Q are
exactly the remaining roots of P , the effort of ï¬nding additional roots decreases,
because we work with polynomials of lower and lower degree as we ï¬nd successive
roots. Even more important, with deï¬ation we can avoid the blunder of having our
iterative method converge twice to the same (nonmultiple) root instead of separately
to two different roots.
Deï¬ation, which amounts to synthetic division, is a simple operation that acts
on the array of polynomial coefï¬cients. The concise code for synthetic division by a
monomial factor was given in Â§5.3 above. You can deï¬ate complex roots either by
converting that code to complex data type, or else â in the case of a polynomial with
real coefï¬cients but possibly complex roots â by deï¬ating by a quadratic factor,
[x â(a + ib)] [x â(a âib)] = x2 â2ax + (a2 + b2)
(9.5.1)
The routine poldiv in Â§5.3 can be used to divide the polynomial by this factor.
Deï¬ation must, however, be utilized with care. Because each new root is known
with only ï¬nite accuracy, errors creep into the determination of the coefï¬cients of
the successively deï¬ated polynomial. Consequently, the roots can become more and
more inaccurate. It matters a lot whether the inaccuracy creeps in stably (plus or

minus a few multiples of the machine precision at each stage) or unstably (erosion of
successive signiï¬cant ï¬gures until the results become meaningless). Which behavior
occurs depends on just how the root is divided out. Forward deï¬ation, where the
new polynomial coefï¬cients are computed in the order from the highest power of x
down to the constant term, was illustrated in Â§5.3. This turns out to be stable if the
root of smallest absolute value is divided out at each stage. Alternatively, one can do
backward deï¬ation, where new coefï¬cients are computed in order from the constant
term up to the coefï¬cient of the highest power of x. This is stable if the remaining
root of largest absolute value is divided out at each stage.
A polynomial whose coefï¬cients are interchanged âend-to-end,â so that the
constant becomes the highest coefï¬cient, etc., has its roots mapped into their
reciprocals.
(Proof: Divide the whole polynomial by its highest power xn and
rewrite it as a polynomial in 1/x.) The algorithm for backward deï¬ation is therefore
virtually identical to that of forward deï¬ation, except that the original coefï¬cients are
taken in reverse order and the reciprocal of the deï¬ating root is used. Since we will
use forward deï¬ation below, we leave to you the exercise of writing a concise coding
for backward deï¬ation (as in Â§5.3). For more on the stability of deï¬ation, consult [2].
To minimize the impact of increasing errors (even stable ones) when using
deï¬ation, it is advisable to treat roots of the successively deï¬ated polynomials as
onlytentativerootsof the originalpolynomial. One then polishesthese tentativeroots
by taking them as initial guesses that are to be re-solved for, using the nondeï¬ated
original polynomial P . Again you must beware lest two deï¬ated roots are inaccurate
enough that, under polishing, they both converge to the same undeï¬ated root; in that
case you gain a spurious root-multiplicity and lose a distinct root. This is detectable,
since you can compare each polished root for equality to previous ones from distinct
tentative roots. When it happens, you are advised to deï¬ate the polynomial just
once (and for this root only), then again polish the tentative root, or to use Maehlyâs
procedure (see equation 9.5.29 below).
Below we say more about techniques for polishing real and complex-conjugate

tentative roots. First, letâs get back to overall strategy.
There are two schools of thought about how to proceed when faced with a
polynomial of real coefï¬cients. One school says to go after the easiest quarry, the
real, distinct roots, by the same kinds of methods that we have discussed in previous
sections for general functions, i.e., trial-and-error bracketing followed by a safe
Newton-Raphson as in rtsafe. Sometimes you are only interested in real roots, in
which case the strategy is complete. Otherwise, you then go after quadratic factors
of the form (9.5.1) by any of a variety of methods. One such is Bairstowâs method,
which we will discuss below in the context of root polishing. Another is Mullerâs
method, which we here brieï¬y discuss.
Mullerâs Method
Mullerâs method generalizes the secant method, but uses quadratic interpolation
among three points instead of linear interpolation between two. Solving for the
zeros of the quadratic allows the method to ï¬nd complex pairs of roots. Given three
previous guesses for the root xiâ2, xiâ1, xi, and the values of the polynomial P (x)
at those points, the next approximation xi+1 is produced by the following formulas,
q â¡
xi âxiâ1
xiâ1 âxiâ2
A â¡qP (xi) âq(1 + q)P (xiâ1) + q2P (xiâ2)
B â¡(2q + 1)P (xi) â(1 + q)2P (xiâ1) + q2P (xiâ2)
C â¡(1 + q)P (xi)

xi+1 = xi â(xi âxiâ1)

(9.5.3)
where the sign in the denominator is chosen to make its absolute value or modulus
as large as possible. You can start the iterations with any three values of x that you
like, e.g., three equally spaced values on the real axis. Note that you must allow
for the possibility of a complex denominator, and subsequent complex arithmetic,
in implementing the method.
Mullerâs method is sometimes also used for ï¬nding complex zeros of analytic
functions (not just polynomials) in the complex plane, for example in the IMSL
routine ZANLY [3].
Laguerreâs Method
The second school regarding overall strategy happens to be the one to which
we belong. That school advises you to use one of a very small number of methods
that will converge (though with greater or lesser efï¬ciency) to all types of roots:
real, complex, single, or multiple. Use such a method to get tentative values for all
n roots of your nth degree polynomial. Then go back and polish them as you desire.

Laguerreâs method is by far the most straightforward of these general, complex
methods. It does require complex arithmetic, even while converging to real roots;
however, for polynomials with all real roots, it is guaranteed to converge to a
root from any starting point. For polynomials with some complex roots, little is
theoretically proved about the methodâs convergence. Much empirical experience,
however, suggests that nonconvergence is extremely unusual, and, further, can almost
always be ï¬xed by a simple scheme to break a nonconverging limit cycle. (This is
implemented in our routine, below.) An example of a polynomial that requires this
cycle-breaking scheme is one of high degree (>â¼20), with all its roots just outside of
the complex unit circle, approximately equally spaced around it. When the method
converges on a simple complex zero, it is known that its convergence is third order.
In some instances the complex arithmetic in the Laguerre method is no
disadvantage, since the polynomial itself may have complex coefï¬cients.
To motivate (although not rigorously derive) the Laguerre formulas we can note
the following relations between the polynomial and its roots and derivatives
Pn(x) = (x âx1)(x âx2) . . .(x âxn)
(9.5.4)

Starting from these relations, the Laguerre formulas make what Acton [1] nicely calls
âa rather drastic set of assumptionsâ: The root x1 that we seek is assumed to be
located some distance a from our current guess x, while all other roots are assumed
to be located at a distance b
x âx1 = a

x âxi = b

The method operates iteratively: For a trial value x, a is calculated by equation
(9.5.11).
Then x âa becomes the next trial value.
This continues until a is
sufï¬ciently small.
The following routine implements the Laguerre method to ï¬nd one root of a
given polynomial of degree m, whose coefï¬cients can be complex. As usual, the ï¬rst
coefï¬cient a[0] is the constant term, while a[m] is the coefï¬cient of the highest
power of x. The routine implements a simpliï¬ed version of an elegant stopping
criterion due to Adams [5], which neatly balances the desire to achieve full machine
accuracy, on the one hand, with the danger of iterating forever in the presence of
roundoff error, on the other.

Eigenvalue Methods
The eigenvalues of a matrix A are the roots of the âcharacteristic polynomialâ
P (x) = det[A âxI]. However, as we will see in Chapter 11, root-ï¬nding is not
generally an efï¬cient way to ï¬nd eigenvalues.
Turning matters around, we can
use the more efï¬cient eigenvalue methods that are discussed in Chapter 11 to ï¬nd
the roots of arbitrary polynomials.
You can easily verify (see, e.g., [6]) that the
characteristic polynomial of the special m Ã m companion matrix
A =

(9.5.13)
If the coefï¬cients ai are real, rather than complex, then the eigenvalues of A can be
found using the routines balanc and hqr in Â§Â§11.5â11.6 (see discussion there). This
method, implemented in the routine zrhqr following, is typically about a factor 2
slower than zroots (above). However, for some classes of polynomials, it is a more
robust technique, largely because of the fairly sophisticated convergence methods
embodied in hqr.
If your polynomial has real coefï¬cients, and you are having
trouble with zroots, then zrhqr is a recommended alternative.
#include "nrutil.h"

Find all the roots of a polynomial with real coeï¬cients, Pm
i=0 a(i)xi, given the degree m
and the coeï¬cients a[0..m]. The method is to construct an upper Hessenberg matrix whose
eigenvalues are the desired roots, and then use the routines balanc and hqr. The real and
imaginary parts of the roots are returned in rtr[1..m] and rti[1..m], respectively.

Other Sure-Fire Techniques
The Jenkins-Traub method has become practically a standard in black-box
polynomial root-ï¬nders, e.g., in the IMSL library [3]. The method is too complicated
to discuss here, but is detailed, with references to the primary literature, in [4].
The Lehmer-Schur algorithm is one of a class of methods that isolate roots in
the complex plane by generalizing the notion of one-dimensional bracketing. It is
possible to determine efï¬ciently whether there are any polynomial roots within a
circle of given center and radius. From then on it is a matter of bookkeeping to
hunt down all the roots by a series of decisions regarding where to place new trial
circles.
Consult [1] for an introduction.
Techniques for Root-Polishing
Newton-Raphson works very well for real roots once the neighborhood of
a root has been identiï¬ed.
The polynomial and its derivative can be efï¬ciently
simultaneously evaluated as in Â§5.3. For a polynomial of degree n with coefï¬cients
c[0]...c[n], the following segment of code embodies one cycle of Newton-
Raphson:
p=c[n]*x+c[n-1];
p1=c[n];
for(i=n-2;i>=0;i--) {
p1=p+p1*x;
p=c[i]+p*x;
}
if (p1 == 0.0) nrerror("derivative should not vanish");
x -= p/p1;
Once all real roots of a polynomial have been polished, one must polish the
complex roots, either directly, or by looking for quadratic factors.
Direct polishing by Newton-Raphson is straightforwardfor complex roots if the
above code is converted to complex data types. With real polynomial coefï¬cients,
note that your starting guess (tentative root) must be off the real axis, otherwise
you will never get off that axis â and may get shot off to inï¬nity by a minimum
or maximum of the polynomial.
For real polynomials, the alternative means of polishing complex roots (or, for that
matter, double real roots) is Bairstowâs method, which seeks quadratic factors. The advantage

of going after quadratic factors is that it avoids all complex arithmetic. Bairstowâs method
seeks a quadratic factor that embodies the two roots x = a Â± ib, namely
x2 â2ax + (a2 + b2) â¡x2 + Bx + C
(9.5.14)
In general if we divide a polynomial by a quadratic factor, there will be a linear remainder
P(x) = (x2 + Bx + C)Q(x) + Rx + S.
(9.5.15)
Given B and C, R and S can be readily found, by polynomial division (Â§5.3). We can
consider R and S to be adjustable functions of B and C, and they will be zero if the
quadratic factor is zero.
In the neighborhood of a root a ï¬rst-order Taylor series expansion approximates the
variation of R, S with respect to small changes in B, C
R(B + Î´B, C + Î´C) âR(B, C) + âR
âB Î´B + âR
âC Î´C
(9.5.16)
S(B + Î´B, C + Î´C) âS(B, C) + âS
âB Î´B + âS
âC Î´C
(9.5.17)
To evaluate the partial derivatives, consider the derivative of (9.5.15) with respect to C. Since
P(x) is a ï¬xed polynomial, it is independent of C, hence
0 = (x2 + Bx + C)âQ
âC + Q(x) + âR
âC x + âS
âC
(9.5.18)
which can be rewritten as
âQ(x) = (x2 + Bx + C)âQ
âC + âR
âC x + âS
âC
(9.5.19)
Similarly, P(x) is independent of B, so differentiating (9.5.15) with respect to B gives
âxQ(x) = (x2 + Bx + C)âQ
âB + âR
âB x + âS
âB
(9.5.20)
Now note that equation (9.5.19) matches equation (9.5.15) in form. Thus if we perform a
secondsynthetic divisionof P(x), i.e., a division ofQ(x), yielding a remainderR1x+S1, then
âR
âC = âR1
âS
âC = âS1
(9.5.21)
To get the remaining partial derivatives, evaluate equation (9.5.20) at the two roots of the
quadratic, x+ and xâ.
Since
Q(xÂ±) = R1xÂ± + S1
(9.5.22)
we get
âR
âB x+ + âS
âB = âx+(R1x+ + S1)
(9.5.23)
âR
âB xâ+ âS
âB = âxâ(R1xâ+ S1)
(9.5.24)
Solve these two equations for the partial derivatives, using
x+ + xâ= âB
x+xâ= C
(9.5.25)
and ï¬nd
âR
âB = BR1 âS1
âS
âB = CR1
(9.5.26)
Bairstowâs method now consists of using Newton-Raphson in two dimensions (which is
actually the subject of the next section) to ï¬nd a simultaneous zero of R and S. Synthetic
division is used twice per cycle to evaluate R, S and their partial derivatives with respect to
B, C. Like one-dimensionalNewton-Raphson, the method works well in the vicinity of a root
pair (real or complex), but it can fail miserably when started at a random point. We therefore
recommend it only in the context of polishing tentative complex roots.

We have already remarked on the annoyance of having two tentative roots
collapse to one value under polishing.
You are left not knowing whether your
polishing procedure has lost a root, or whether there is actually a double root,
which was split only by roundoff errors in your previous deï¬ation. One solution
is deï¬ate-and-repolish; but deï¬ation is what we are trying to avoid at the polishing
stage. An alternative is Maehlyâs procedure. Maehly pointed out that the derivative

no relation to each other at all! There is nothing special about a common point from

the zero contours will (in general) consist of an unknown number of disjoint closed

This method gives you a very efï¬cient means of
converging to a root, if you have a sufï¬ciently good initial guess.
It can also
spectacularly fail to converge, indicating (though not proving) that your putative
root does not exist nearby. In Â§9.7 we discuss more sophisticated implementations
of the Newton-Raphson method, which try to improve on Newton-Raphsonâs poor
global convergence. A multidimensional generalization of the secant method, called
Broydenâs method, is also discussed in Â§9.7.
A typical problem gives N functional relations to be zeroed, involvingvariables
xi, i = 1, 2, . . ., N:
Fi(x1, x2, . . ., xN) = 0
i = 1, 2, . . ., N.
(9.6.2)
We let x denote the entire vector of values xi and F denote the entire vector of
functions Fi. In the neighborhood of x, each of the functions Fi can be expanded

(9.6.4)
In matrix notation equation (9.6.3) is
F(x + Î´x) = F(x) + J Â· Î´x + O(Î´x2).
(9.6.5)
By neglecting terms of order Î´x2 and higher and by setting F(x + Î´x) = 0, we
obtain a set of linear equations for the corrections Î´x that move each function closer
to zero simultaneously, namely
J Â· Î´x = âF.
(9.6.6)
Matrix equation (9.6.6) can be solved by LU decomposition as described in
Â§2.3. The corrections are then added to the solution vector,
xnew = xold + Î´x
(9.6.7)
and the process is iterated to convergence. In general it is a good idea to check the
degree to which both functions and variables have converged. Once either reaches
machine accuracy, the other wonât change.
The following routine mnewt performs ntrial iterations starting from an
initial guess at the solution vector x[1..n]. Iteration stops if either the sum of the
magnitudes of the functions Fi is less than some tolerance tolf, or the sum of the
absolute values of the corrections to Î´xi is less than some tolerance tolx. mnewt
calls a user supplied function usrfun which must provide the function values F and
the Jacobian matrix J. If J is difï¬cult to compute analytically, you can try having
usrfun call the routine fdjac of Â§9.7 to compute the partial derivatives by ï¬nite
differences. You should not make ntrial too big; rather inspect to see what is
happening before continuing for some further iterations.

Newtonâs Method versus Minimization
In the next chapter, we will ï¬nd that there are efï¬cient general techniques for
ï¬nding a minimum of a function of many variables. Why is that task (relatively)
easy, while multidimensional root ï¬nding is often quite hard? Isnât minimization
equivalent to ï¬ndinga zero of an N-dimensional gradient vector, not so different from
zeroing an N-dimensional function? No! The components of a gradient vectorare not
independent, arbitrary functions. Rather, they obey so-called integrabilityconditions
that are highly restrictive. Put crudely, you can always ï¬nd a minimum by sliding
downhill on a single surface. The test of âdownhillnessâ is thus one-dimensional.
There is no analogous conceptual procedure for ï¬nding a multidimensional root,
where âdownhillâmust mean simultaneouslydownhillin N separate functionspaces,
thus allowing a multitude of trade-offs, as to how much progress in one dimension
is worth compared with progress in another.
It might occur to you to carry out multidimensional root ï¬nding by collapsing
all these dimensions into one: Add up the sums of squares of the individual functions
Fi to get a master function F which (i) is positive deï¬nite, and (ii) has a global
minimum of zero exactly at all solutions of the original set of nonlinear equations.
Unfortunately, as you will see in the next chapter, the efï¬cient algorithms for ï¬nding
minima come to rest on global and local minima indiscriminately. You will often
ï¬nd, to your great dissatisfaction, that your function F has a great number of local
minima. In Figure 9.6.1, for example, there is likely to be a local minimum wherever
the zero contours of f and g make a close approach to each other. The point labeled
M is such a point, and one sees that there are no nearby roots.
However, we will now see that sophisticated strategies for multidimensional
root ï¬nding can in fact make use of the idea of minimizing a master function F , by
combining it with Newtonâs method applied to the full set of functions Fi. While

9.7 Globally Convergent Methods for Nonlinear
Systems of Equations
We have seen that Newtonâs method for solving nonlinear equations has an
unfortunate tendency to wander off into the wild blue yonder if the initial guess
is not sufï¬ciently close to the root.
A global method is one that converges to
a solution from almost any starting point.
In this section we will develop an
algorithm that combines the rapid local convergence of Newtonâs method with a
globally convergent strategy that will guarantee some progress towards the solution
at each iteration. The algorithm is closely related to the quasi-Newton method of
minimization which we will describe in Â§10.7.
Recall our discussion of Â§9.6: the Newton step for the set of equations

is
xnew = xold + Î´x
(9.7.2)
where
Î´x = âJâ1 Â· F
(9.7.3)
Here J is the Jacobian matrix. How do we decide whether to accept the Newton step
Î´x? A reasonable strategy is to require that the step decrease |F|2 = F Â· F. This is
the same requirement we would impose if we were trying to minimize

Thus our strategy is quite simple: We always ï¬rst try the full Newton step,
because once we are close enough to the solution we will get quadratic convergence.
However, we check at each iteration that the proposed step reduces f. If not, we
backtrack along the Newton direction until we have an acceptable step. Because the
Newton step is a descent direction for f, we are guaranteed to ï¬nd an acceptable step
by backtracking. We will discuss the backtracking algorithm in more detail below.
Note that this method essentially minimizes f by taking Newton steps designed
to bring F to zero. This is not equivalent to minimizing f directly by taking Newton
steps designed to bring âf to zero. While the method can still occasionally fail by
landing on a local minimum of f, this is quite rare in practice. The routine newt
below will warn you if this happens. The remedy is to try a new starting point.
Line Searches and Backtracking
When we are not close enough to the minimum of f, taking the full Newton step p = Î´x
need not decrease the function; we may move too far for the quadratic approximation to
be valid.
All we are guaranteed is that initially f decreases as we move in the Newton
direction. So the goal is to move to a new point xnew along the direction of the Newton
step p, but not necessarily all the way:
xnew = xold + Î»p,
0 < Î» â¤1
(9.7.6)
The aim is to ï¬nd Î» so that f(xold + Î»p) has decreased sufï¬ciently. Until the early 1970s,
standard practice was to choose Î» so that xnew exactly minimizes f in the direction p.
However, we now know that it is extremely wasteful of function evaluations to do so. A
better strategy is as follows: Since p is always the Newton direction in our algorithms, we
ï¬rst try Î» = 1, the full Newton step. This will lead to quadratic convergence when x is
sufï¬ciently close to the solution. However, if f(xnew) does not meet our acceptance criteria,
we backtrack along the Newton direction, trying a smaller value of Î», until we ï¬nd a suitable
point. Since the Newton direction is a descent direction, we are guaranteed to decrease f
for sufï¬ciently small Î».
What should the criterion for accepting a step be? It is not sufï¬cient to require merely
that f(xnew) < f(xold). This criterion can fail to converge to a minimum of f in one of
two ways. First, it is possible to construct a sequence of steps satisfying this criterion with
f decreasing too slowly relative to the step lengths. Second, one can have a sequence where
the step lengths are too small relative to the initial rate of decrease of f. (For examples of
such sequences, see [1], p. 117.)
A simple way to ï¬x the ï¬rst problem is to require the average rate of decrease of f to
be at least some fraction Î± of the initial rate of decrease âf Â· p:
f(xnew) â¤f(xold) + Î±âf Â· (xnew âxold)
(9.7.7)
Here the parameter Î± satisï¬es 0 < Î± < 1. We can get away with quite small values of
Î±; Î± = 10â4 is a good choice.
The second problem can be ï¬xed by requiring the rate of decrease of f at xnew to be
greater than some fraction Î² of the rate of decrease of f at xold. In practice, we will not
need to impose this second constraint because our backtracking algorithm will have a built-in
cutoff to avoid taking steps that are too small.
Here is the strategy for a practical backtracking routine: Deï¬ne
g(Î») â¡f(xold + Î»p)
(9.7.8)
so that
gâ²(Î») = âf Â· p
(9.7.9)
If we need to backtrack, then we model g with the most current information we have and
choose Î» to minimize the model. We start with g(0) and gâ²(0) available. The ï¬rst step is

well. We can therefore model g(Î») as a quadratic:
g(Î») â[g(1) âg(0) âgâ²(0)]Î»2 + gâ²(0)Î» + g(0)

2 for small Î±. We need to guard against
too small a value of Î», however. We set Î»min = 0.1.
On second and subsequent backtracks, we model g as a cubic in Î», using the previous
value g(Î»1) and the second most recent value g(Î»2):
g(Î») = aÎ»3 + bÎ»2 + gâ²(0)Î» + g(0)

Given an initial guess x[1..n] for a root in n dimensions, ï¬nd the root by a globally convergent
Newtonâs method. The vector of functions to be zeroed, called fvec[1..n] in the routine
below, is returned by the user-supplied routine vecfunc(n,x,fvec). The output quantity
check is false (0) on a normal return and true (1) if the routine has converged to a local
minimum of the function fmin deï¬ned below. In this case try restarting from a diï¬erent initial
guess.

The routine newt assumesthat typical values of all componentsof x and of F are of order
unity, and it can fail if this assumption is badly violated. You should rescale the variables by
their typical values before invoking newt if this problem occurs.
Multidimensional Secant Methods: Broydenâs Method
Newtonâs method as implemented above is quite powerful, but it still has several
disadvantages. One drawback is that the Jacobian matrix is needed. In many problems
analytic derivatives are unavailable. If function evaluation is expensive, then the cost of
ï¬nite-difference determination of the Jacobian can be prohibitive.
Just as the quasi-Newton methods to be discussedin Â§10.7 provide cheapapproximations
for the Hessian matrix in minimization algorithms, there are quasi-Newton methods that
provide cheap approximations to the Jacobianfor zero ï¬nding. These methods are often called
secant methods, since they reduce to the secantmethod (Â§9.2) in one dimension (see, e.g., [1]).
The best of these methods still seems to be the ï¬rst one introduced, Broydenâs method [2].
Let us denote the approximate Jacobian by B. Then the ith quasi-Newton step Î´xi
is the solution of
Bi Â· Î´xi = âFi
(9.7.15)
where Î´xi = xi+1 âxi (cf. equation 9.7.3). The quasi-Newton or secant condition is that
Bi+1 satisfy
Bi+1 Â· Î´xi = Î´Fi
(9.7.16)
where Î´Fi = Fi+1 âFi. This is the generalization of the one-dimensional secant approxima-
tion to the derivative, Î´F/Î´x. However, equation (9.7.16) does not determine Bi+1 uniquely
in more than one dimension.
Many different auxiliary conditions to pin down Bi+1 have been explored, but the
best-performing algorithm in practice results from Broydenâs formula. This formula is based
on the idea of getting Bi+1 by making the least change to Bi consistent with the secant
equation (9.7.16). Broyden showed that the resulting formula is
Bi+1 = Bi + (Î´Fi âBi Â· Î´xi) âÎ´xi
Î´xi Â· Î´xi
(9.7.17)
You can easily check that Bi+1 satisï¬es (9.7.16).
Early implementations of Broydenâs method used the Sherman-Morrison formula,
equation (2.7.2), to invert equation (9.7.17) analytically,
Bâ1
i+1 = Bâ1
i
+ (Î´xi âBâ1
i
Â· Î´Fi) âÎ´xi Â· Bâ1
i
Î´xi Â· Bâ1
i
Â· Î´Fi
(9.7.18)
Then instead of solving equation (9.7.3) by e.g., LU decomposition, one determined
Î´xi = âBâ1
i
Â· Fi
(9.7.19)
by matrix multiplication in O(N 2) operations.
The disadvantage of this method is that
it cannot easily be embedded in a globally convergent strategy, for which the gradient of
equation (9.7.4) requires B, not Bâ1,
â( 1
2F Â· F) âBT Â· F
(9.7.20)
Accordingly, we implement the update formula in the form (9.7.17).
However, wecan still preservethe O(N 2) solution of(9.7.3) by usingQR decomposition
(Â§2.10)instead ofLU decomposition. The reason is that because ofthe special form ofequation
(9.7.17), the QR decomposition of Bi can be updated into the QR decomposition of Bi+1 in
O(N 2) operations (Â§2.10). All we need is an initial approximation B0 to start the ball rolling.
It is often acceptable to start simply with the identity matrix, and then allow O(N) updates to
produce a reasonable approximation to the Jacobian. We prefer to spend the ï¬rst N function
evaluations on a ï¬nite-difference approximation to initialize B via a call to fdjac.

Since B is not the exact Jacobian, we are not guaranteed that Î´x is a descent direction for
f = 1
2FÂ·F (cf. equation 9.7.5). Thus the line search algorithm can fail to return a suitable step
if B wanders far from the true Jacobian. In this case, we reinitialize B by another call to fdjac.
Like the secant method in one dimension, Broydenâs method converges superlinearly
once you get close enough to the root. Embedded in a global strategy, it is almost as robust
as Newtonâs method, and often needs far fewer function evaluations to determine a zero.
Note that the ï¬nal value of B is not always close to the true Jacobian at the root, even
when the method converges.
The routine broydn given below is very similar to newt in organization. The principal
differences are the use of QR decomposition instead of LU, and the updating formula instead
of directly determining the Jacobian. The remarks at the end of newt about scaling the
variables apply equally to broydn.

More Advanced Implementations
One of the principal ways that the methods described so far can fail is if J (in Newtonâs
method) or B in (Broydenâs method) becomes singular or nearly singular, so that Î´x cannot
be determined. If you are lucky, this situation will not occur very often in practice. Methods
developed so far to deal with this problem involve monitoring the condition number of J and
perturbing J if singularity or near singularity is detected. This is most easily implemented
if the QR decomposition is used instead of LU in Newtonâs method (see [1] for details).
Our personal experience is that, while such an algorithm can solve problems where J is
exactly singular and the standard Newtonâs method fails, it is occasionally less robust on
other problems where LU decomposition succeeds. Clearly implementation details involving
roundoff, underï¬ow, etc., are important here and the last word is yet to be written.
Our global strategies both for minimization and zero ï¬nding have been based on line
searches. Other global algorithms, such as the hook step and dogleg step methods, are based
instead on the model-trust region approach, which is related to the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm for nonlinear least-squares (Â§15.5). While somewhat more complicated than line
searches, these methods have a reputation for robustness even when starting far from the
desired zero or minimum [1].

Chapter 10.
Minimization or
Maximization of Functions
10.0 Introduction
In a nutshell: You are given a single function f that depends on one or more
independent variables. You want to ï¬nd the value of those variables where f takes
on a maximum or a minimum value. You can then calculate what value of f is
achieved at the maximum or minimum. The tasks of maximization and minimization
are trivially related to each other, since one personâs function f could just as well
be anotherâs âf. The computational desiderata are the usual ones: Do it quickly,
cheaply, and in small memory.
Often the computational effort is dominated by
the cost of evaluating f (and also perhaps its partial derivatives with respect to all
variables, if the chosen algorithm requires them). In such cases the desiderata are
sometimes replaced by the simple surrogate: Evaluate f as few times as possible.
An extremum (maximum or minimum point) can be either global (truly
the highest or lowest function value) or local (the highest or lowest in a ï¬nite
neighborhood and not on the boundary of that neighborhood). (See Figure 10.0.1.)
Finding a global extremum is, in general, a very difï¬cult problem. Two standard
heuristics are widely used: (i) ï¬nd local extrema starting from widely varying
starting values of the independent variables (perhaps chosen quasi-randomly, as in
Â§7.7), and then pick the most extreme of these (if they are not all the same); or
(ii) perturb a local extremum by taking a ï¬nite amplitude step away from it, and
then see if your routine returns you to a better point, or âalwaysâ to the same
one.
Relatively recently, so-called âsimulated annealing methodsâ (Â§10.9) have
demonstrated important successes on a variety of global extremization problems.
Our chapter title could just as well be optimization, which is the usual name
for this very large ï¬eld of numerical research.
The importance ascribed to the
various tasks in this ï¬eld depends strongly on the particular interests of whom
you talk to.
Economists, and some engineers, are particularly concerned with
constrained optimization, where there are a priori limitations on the allowed values
of independent variables. For example, the production of wheat in the U.S. must
be a nonnegative number.
One particularly well-developed area of constrained
optimization is linear programming, where both the function to be optimized and
the constraints happen to be linear functions of the independent variables. Section
10.8, which is otherwise somewhat disconnected from the rest of the material that we
have chosen to include in this chapter, implements the so-called âsimplex algorithmâ
for linear programming problems.

Extrema of a function in an interval. Points A, C, and E are local, but not global
maxima. Points B and F are local, but not global minima. The global maximum occurs at G, which
is on the boundary of the interval so that the derivative of the function need not vanish there.
The
global minimum is at D. At point E, derivatives higher than the ï¬rst vanish, a situation which can
cause difï¬culty for some algorithms. The points X, Y , and Z are said to âbracketâ the minimum F,
since Y is less than both X and Z.
One other section, Â§10.9, also lies outside of our main thrust, but for a different
reason: so-called âannealing methodsâ are relatively new, so we do not yet know
where they will ultimately ï¬t into the scheme of things. However, these methods
have solved some problems previously thought to be practically insoluble; they
address directly the problem of ï¬nding global extrema in the presence of large
numbers of undesired local extrema.
The other sections in this chapter constitute a selection of the best established
algorithms in unconstrained minimization. (For deï¬niteness, we will henceforth
regard the optimization problem as that of minimization.)
These sections are
connected, with later ones depending on earlier ones. If you are just looking for
the one âperfectâ algorithm to solve your particular application, you may feel that
we are telling you more than you want to know. Unfortunately, there is no perfect
optimization algorithm. This is a case where we strongly urge you to try more than
one method in comparative fashion. Your initial choice of method can be based
on the following considerations:
â¢ You must choose between methods that need only evaluations of the
function to be minimized and methods that also require evaluations of the
derivative of that function. In the multidimensional case, this derivative
is the gradient, a vector quantity. Algorithms using the derivative are
somewhat more powerful than those using only the function, but not
always enough so as to compensate for the additional calculations of
derivatives. We can easily construct examples favoring one approach or
favoring the other. However, if you can compute derivatives, be prepared
to try using them.
â¢ For one-dimensional minimization (minimize a function of one variable)
without calculation of the derivative, bracket the minimum as described in
Â§10.1, and then use Brentâs method as described in Â§10.2. If your function
has a discontinuous second (or lower) derivative, then the parabolic

interpolations of Brentâs method are of no advantage, and you might wish
to use the simplest form of golden section search, as described in Â§10.1.
â¢ For one-dimensional minimizationwith calculation of the derivative, Â§10.3
supplies a variant of Brentâs method which makes limited use of the ï¬rst
derivative information.
We shy away from the alternative of using
derivative information to construct high-order interpolating polynomials.
In our experience the improvement in convergence very near a smooth,
analytic minimum does not make up for the tendency of polynomials
sometimes to give wildly wrong interpolations at early stages, especially
for functions that may have sharp, âexponentialâ features.
We now turn to the multidimensional case, both with and without computation
of ï¬rst derivatives.
â¢ You must choose between methods that require storage of order N 2 and
those that require only of order N, where N is the number of dimensions.
For moderate values of N and reasonable memory sizes this is not a
serious constraint.
There will be, however, the occasional application
where storage may be critical.
â¢ We give in Â§10.4 a sometimes overlooked downhill simplex method due
to Nelder and Mead.
(This use of the word âsimplexâ is not to be
confused with the simplex method of linear programming.) This method
just crawls downhill in a straightforward fashion that makes almost no
special assumptions about your function. This can be extremely slow, but
it can also, in some cases, be extremely robust. Not to be overlooked is
the fact that the code is concise and completely self-contained: a general
N-dimensional minimization program in under 100 program lines! This
method is most useful when the minimization calculation is only an
incidental part of your overall problem. The storage requirement is of
order N 2, and derivative calculations are not required.
â¢ Section 10.5 deals with direction-set methods, of which Powellâs method
is the prototype. These are the methods of choice when you cannot easily
calculate derivatives, and are not necessarily to be sneered at even if you
can.
Although derivatives are not needed, the method does require a
one-dimensional minimization sub-algorithm such as Brentâs method (see
above). Storage is of order N 2.
There are two major families of algorithms for multidimensional minimization
with calculation of ï¬rst derivatives.
Both families require a one-dimensional
minimization sub-algorithm, which can itself either use, or not use, the derivative
information, as you see ï¬t (depending on the relative effort of computingthe function
and of its gradient vector). We do not think that either family dominates the other in
all applications; you should think of them as available alternatives:
â¢ The ï¬rst family goes under the name conjugate gradient methods, as typi-
ï¬ed by the Fletcher-Reeves algorithmand the closely related and probably
superior Polak-Ribiere algorithm.
Conjugate gradient methods require
only of order a few times N storage, require derivative calculations and

10.1 Golden Section Search in One Dimension
Recall how the bisection method ï¬nds roots of functions in one dimension
(Â§9.1): The root is supposed to have been bracketed in an interval (a, b).
One
then evaluates the function at an intermediate point x and obtains a new, smaller
bracketing interval, either (a, x) or (x, b). The process continues until the bracketing
interval is acceptably small. It is optimal to choose x to be the midpoint of (a, b)
so that the decrease in the interval length is maximized when the function is as
uncooperative as it can be, i.e., when the luck of the draw forces you to take the
bigger bisected segment.
There is a precise, though slightly subtle, translation of these considerations to
the minimization problem: What does it mean to bracket a minimum? A root of a
function is known to be bracketed by a pair of points, a and b, when the function
has opposite sign at those two points. A minimum, by contrast, is known to be
bracketed only when there is a triplet of points, a < b < c (or c < b < a), such that
f(b) is less than both f(a) and f(c). In this case we know that the function (if it
is nonsingular) has a minimum in the interval (a, c).
The analog of bisection is to choose a new point x, either between a and b or
between b and c. Suppose, to be speciï¬c, that we make the latter choice. Then we
evaluate f(x). If f(b) < f(x), then the new bracketing triplet of points is (a, b, x);

Figure 10.1.1.
Successive bracketing of a minimum. The minimum is originally bracketed by points
1,3,2. The function is evaluated at 4, which replaces 2; then at 5, which replaces 1; then at 6, which
replaces 4. The rule at each stage is to keep a center point that is lower than the two outside points. After
the steps shown, the minimum is bracketed by points 5,3,6.
contrariwise, if f(b) > f(x), then the new bracketing triplet is (b, x, c). In all cases
the middle point of the new triplet is the abscissa whose ordinate is the best minimum
achieved so far; see Figure 10.1.1. We continue the process of bracketing until the
distance between the two outer points of the triplet is tolerably small.
How small is âtolerablyâ small?
For a minimum located at a value b, you
might naively think that you will be able to bracket it in as small a range as
(1 âÏµ)b < b < (1 + Ïµ)b, where Ïµ is your computerâs ï¬oating-point precision, a
number like 3 Ã 10â8 (for float) or 10â15 (for double). Not so! In general, the
shape of your function f(x) near b will be given by Taylorâs theorem
f(x) âf(b) + 1
2fâ²â²(b)(x âb)2
(10.1.1)
The second term will be negligible compared to the ï¬rst (that is, will be a factor Ïµ
smaller and will act just like zero when added to it) whenever
|x âb| < âÏµ|b|
s
2 |f(b)|
b2fâ²â²(b)
(10.1.2)
The reason for writing the right-hand side in this way is that, for most functions,
the ï¬nal square root is a number of order unity. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, it
is hopeless to ask for a bracketing interval of width less than âÏµ times its central
value, a fractional width of only about 10â4 (single precision) or 3 Ã 10â8 (double
precision). Knowing this inescapable fact will save you a lot of useless bisections!
The minimum-ï¬nding routines of this chapter will often call for a user-supplied
argument tol, and return with an abscissa whose fractional precision is about Â±tol
(bracketing interval of fractional size about 2Ãtol).

estimate for the right-hand side of equation (10.1.2), you should set tol equal to
(not much less than) the square root of your machineâs ï¬oating-point precision, since
smaller values will gain you nothing.
It remains to decide on a strategy for choosing the new point x, given (a, b, c).
Suppose that b is a fraction w of the way between a and c, i.e.
b âa
c âa = w
c âb
c âa = 1 âw
(10.1.3)
Also suppose that our next trial point x is an additional fraction z beyond b,
x âb
c âa = z
(10.1.4)
Then the next bracketing segment will either be of lengthw +z relative to the current
one, or else of length 1 âw. If we want to minimize the worst case possibility, then
we will choose z to make these equal, namely
z = 1 â2w
(10.1.5)
We see at once that the new point is the symmetric point to b in the original interval,
namely with |b âa| equal to |x âc|. This implies that the point x lies in the larger
of the two segments (z is positive only if w < 1/2).
But where in the larger segment? Where did the value of w itself come from?
Presumably from the previous stage of applying our same strategy. Therefore, if z
is chosen to be optimal, then so was w before it. This scale similarity implies that
x should be the same fraction of the way from b to c (if that is the bigger segment)
as was b from a to c, in other words,
z
1 âw = w
(10.1.6)
Equations (10.1.5) and (10.1.6) give the quadratic equation
w2 â3w + 1 = 0
yielding
w = 3 â
â

â0.38197
(10.1.7)
In other words, the optimal bracketing interval (a, b, c) has its middle point b a
fractional distance 0.38197 from one end (say, a), and 0.61803 from the other end
(say, b). These fractions are those of the so-called golden mean or golden section,
whose supposedly aesthetic properties hark back to the ancient Pythagoreans. This
optimal method of function minimization, the analog of the bisection method for
ï¬nding zeros, is thus called the golden section search, summarized as follows:
Given, at each stage, a bracketing triplet of points, the next point to be tried
is that which is a fraction 0.38197 into the larger of the two intervals (measuring
from the central point of the triplet). If you start out with a bracketing triplet whose
segments are not in the golden ratios, the procedure of choosing successive points
at the golden mean point of the larger segment will quickly converge you to the
proper, self-replicating ratios.
The golden section search guarantees that each new function evaluation will
(after self-replicating ratios have been achieved) bracket the minimum to an interval

just 0.61803 times the size of the preceding interval. This is comparable to, but not
quite as good as, the 0.50000 that holds when ï¬nding roots by bisection. Note that
the convergence is linear (in the language of Chapter 9), meaning that successive
signiï¬cant ï¬gures are won linearly with additional function evaluations.
In the
next section we will give a superlinear method, where the rate at which successive
signiï¬cant ï¬gures are liberated increases with each successive function evaluation.
Routine for Initially Bracketing a Minimum
The preceding discussion has assumed that you are able to bracket the minimum
in the ï¬rst place. We consider this initial bracketing to be an essential part of any
one-dimensional minimization. There are some one-dimensional algorithms that
do not require a rigorous initial bracketing. However, we would never trade the
secure feeling of knowing that a minimum is âin there somewhereâ for the dubious
reduction of function evaluations that these nonbracketing routines may promise.
Please bracket your minima (or, for that matter, your zeros) before isolating them!
There is not much theory as to how to do this bracketing. Obviously you want
to step downhill. But how far? We like to take larger and larger steps, starting with
some (wild?) initial guess and then increasing the stepsize at each step either by
a constant factor, or else by the result of a parabolic extrapolation of the preceding
points that is designed to take us to the extrapolated turning point. It doesnât much
matter if the steps get big. After all, we are stepping downhill, so we already have
the left and middle points of the bracketing triplet. We just need to take a big enough
step to stop the downhill trend and get a high third point.
Our standard routine is this:
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
#define GOLD 1.618034
#define GLIMIT 100.0
#define TINY 1.0e-20
#define SHFT(a,b,c,d) (a)=(b);(b)=(c);(c)=(d);
Here GOLD is the default ratio by which successive intervals are magniï¬ed; GLIMIT is the
maximum magniï¬cation allowed for a parabolic-ï¬t step.
void mnbrak(float *ax, float *bx, float *cx, float *fa, float *fb, float *fc,
float (*func)(float))
Given a function func, and given distinct initial points ax and bx, this routine searches in
the downhill direction (deï¬ned by the function as evaluated at the initial points) and returns
new points ax, bx, cx that bracket a minimum of the function. Also returned are the function
values at the three points, fa, fb, and fc.

(Because of the housekeeping involved in moving around three or four points and

That is true of several other programs in this chapter as well. The underlying ideas,
however, are quite simple.)

Given a function f, and given a bracketing triplet of abscissas ax, bx, cx (such that bx is
between ax and cx, and f(bx) is less than both f(ax) and f(cx)), this routine performs a
golden section search for the minimum, isolating it to a fractional precision of about tol. The
abscissa of the minimum is returned as xmin, and the minimum function value is returned as
golden, the returned function value.

10.2 Parabolic Interpolation and Brentâs
Method in One Dimension
We already tipped our hand about the desirability of parabolic interpolation in
the previous sectionâs mnbrak routine, but it is now time to be more explicit. A
golden section search is designed to handle, in effect, the worst possible case of
function minimization, with the uncooperative minimum hunted down and cornered
like a scared rabbit. But why assume the worst? If the function is nicely parabolic
near to the minimum â surely the generic case for sufï¬ciently smooth functions â
then the parabola ï¬tted through any three points ought to take us in a single leap
to the minimum, or at least very near to it (see Figure 10.2.1). Since we want to
ï¬nd an abscissa rather than an ordinate, the procedure is technically called inverse
parabolic interpolation.
The formula for the abscissa x that is the minimum of a parabola through three
points f(a), f(b), and f(c) is
x = b â1

away). Note, however, that (10.2.1) is as happy jumping to a parabolic maximum
as to a minimum. No minimization scheme that depends solely on (10.2.1) is likely
to succeed in practice.
The exacting task is to invent a scheme that relies on a sure-but-slow technique,
like golden section search, when the function is not cooperative, but that switches
over to (10.2.1) when the function allows.
The task is nontrivial for several
reasons, includingthese: (i) The housekeeping needed to avoid unnecessary function
evaluations in switching between the two methods can be complicated. (ii) Careful
attention must be given to the âendgame,â where the function is being evaluated
very near to the roundoff limit of equation (10.1.2). (iii) The scheme for detecting a
cooperative versus noncooperative function must be very robust.
Brentâs method [1] is up to the task in all particulars. At any particular stage,
it is keeping track of six function points (not necessarily all distinct), a, b, u, v,
w and x, deï¬ned as follows: the minimum is bracketed between a and b; x is the
point with the very least function value found so far (or the most recent one in
case of a tie); w is the point with the second least function value; v is the previous
value of w; u is the point at which the function was evaluated most recently. Also
appearing in the algorithm is the point xm, the midpoint between a and b; however,
the function is not evaluated there.
You can read the code below to understand the methodâs logical organization.
Mention of a few general principles here may, however, be helpful: Parabolic
interpolation is attempted, ï¬tting through the points x, v, and w. To be acceptable,
the parabolic step must (i) fall within the bounding interval (a, b), and (ii) imply a
movement from the best current value x that is less than half the movement of the
step before last. This second criterion insures that the parabolic steps are actually
converging to something, rather than, say, bouncing around in some nonconvergent
limit cycle. In the worst possible case, where the parabolic steps are acceptable but

useless, the method will approximately alternate between parabolic steps and golden
sections, converging in due course by virtue of the latter. The reason for comparing
to the step before last seems essentially heuristic: Experience shows that it is better
not to âpunishâ the algorithm for a single bad step if it can make it up on the next one.
Another principle exempliï¬ed in the code is never to evaluate the function less
than a distance tol from a point already evaluated (or from a known bracketing
point).
The reason is that, as we saw in equation (10.1.2), there is simply no
information content in doing so: the function will differ from the value already
evaluated only by an amount of order the roundofferror. Therefore in the code below
you will ï¬nd several tests and modiï¬cations of a potential new point, imposing this
restriction. This restriction also interacts subtly with the test for âdoneness,â which
the method takes into account.
A typical ending conï¬guration for Brentâs method is that a and b are 2ÃxÃtol
apart, with x (the best abscissa) at the midpoint of a and b, and therefore fractionally
accurate to Â±tol.
Indulge us a ï¬nal reminder that tol should generally be no smaller than the
square root of your machineâs ï¬oating-point precision.

In principle, we might simply search for a zero of the derivative, ignoring the
function value information, using a root ï¬nder like rtflsp or zbrent (Â§Â§9.2â9.3).
It doesnât take long to reject that idea: How do we distinguishmaxima from minima?
Where do we go from initial conditions where the derivatives on one or both of
the outer bracketing points indicate that âdownhillâ is in the direction out of the
bracketed interval?
We donât want to give up our strategy of maintaining a rigorous bracket on the
minimum at all times. The only way to keep such a bracket is to update it using
function (not derivative) information, with the central point in the bracketing triplet
always that with the lowest function value. Therefore the role of the derivatives can
only be to help us choose new trial points within the bracket.
One school of thought is to âuse everythingyouâve gotâ: Compute a polynomial
of relatively high order (cubic or above) that agrees with some number of previous
function and derivative evaluations. For example, there is a unique cubic that agrees
with function and derivative at two points, and one can jump to the interpolated
minimum of that cubic (if there is a minimum within the bracket). Suggested by
Davidon and others, formulas for this tactic are given in [1].
We like to be more conservative than this. Once superlinear convergence sets
in, it hardly matters whether its order is moderately lower or higher. In practical
problems that we have met, most function evaluations are spent in getting globally
close enough to the minimum for superlinear convergence to commence. So we are
more worried about all the funny âstiffâ things that high-order polynomials can do
(cf. Figure 3.0.1b), and about their sensitivities to roundoff error.
This leads us to use derivative information only as follows: The sign of the
derivative at the central point of the bracketing triplet (a, b, c) indicates uniquely
whether the next test point should be taken in the interval (a, b) or in the interval
(b, c). The value of this derivative and of the derivative at the second-best-so-far
point are extrapolated to zero by the secant method (inverse linear interpolation),
which by itself is superlinear of order 1.618. (The golden mean again: see [1], p. 57.)
We impose the same sort of restrictions on this new trial point as in Brentâs method.
If the trial point must be rejected, we bisect the interval under scrutiny.
Yes, we are fuddy-duddies when it comes to making ï¬amboyant use of derivative
information in one-dimensional minimization. But we have met too many functions
whose computed âderivativesâ donât integrate up to the function value and donât
accurately point the way to the minimum, usually because of roundoff errors,
sometimes because of truncation error in the method of derivative evaluation.
You will see that the following routine is closely modeled on brent in the
previous section.

bx, cx [such that bx is between ax and cx, and f(bx) is less than both f(ax) and f(cx)],
this routine isolates the minimum to a fractional precision of about tol using a modiï¬cation of
Brentâs method that uses derivatives. The abscissa of the minimum is returned as xmin, and

described inÂ§10.8, also makes use of the geometrical concept ofa simplex. Otherwise
it is completely unrelated to the algorithm that we are describing in this section.) In
general we are only interested in simplexes that are nondegenerate, i.e., that enclose
a ï¬nite inner N-dimensional volume. If any point of a nondegenerate simplex is
taken as the origin, then the N other points deï¬ne vector directions that span the
N-dimensional vector space.
In one-dimensional minimization, it was possible to bracket a minimum, so that
the success of a subsequent isolation was guaranteed. Alas! There is no analogous
procedure in multidimensional space. For multidimensional minimization, the best
we can do is give our algorithm a starting guess, that is, an N-vector of independent
variables as the ï¬rst point to try. The algorithm is then supposed to make its own way

downhill through the unimaginable complexity of an N-dimensional topography,
until it encounters a (local, at least) minimum.
The downhill simplex method must be started not just with a single point,
but with N + 1 points, deï¬ning an initial simplex. If you think of one of these
points (it matters not which) as being your initial starting point P0, then you can
take the other N points to be
Pi = P0 + Î»ei
(10.4.1)
where the eiâs are N unit vectors, and where Î» is a constant which is your guess
of the problemâs characteristic length scale. (Or, you could have different Î»iâs for
each vector direction.)
The downhill simplex method now takes a series of steps, most steps just
moving the point of the simplex where the function is largest (âhighest pointâ)
through the opposite face of the simplex to a lower point. These steps are called
reï¬ections, and they are constructed to conserve the volume of the simplex (hence
maintain its nondegeneracy). When it can do so, the method expands the simplex
in one or another direction to take larger steps. When it reaches a âvalley ï¬oor,â
the method contracts itself in the transverse direction and tries to ooze down the
valley. If there is a situation where the simplex is trying to âpass through the eye
of a needle,â it contracts itself in all directions, pulling itself in around its lowest
(best) point. The routine name amoeba is intended to be descriptive of this kind of
behavior; the basic moves are summarized in Figure 10.4.1.
Termination criteria can be delicate in any multidimensional minimization
routine.
Without bracketing, and with more than one independent variable, we
no longer have the option of requiring a certain tolerance for a single independent
variable. We typically can identify one âcycleâ or âstepâ of our multidimensional
algorithm. It is then possible to terminate when the vector distance moved in that
step is fractionally smaller in magnitude than some tolerance tol. Alternatively,
we could require that the decrease in the function value in the terminating step be
fractionally smaller than some tolerance ftol.
Note that while tol should not
usually be smaller than the square root of the machine precision, it is perfectly
appropriate to let ftol be of order the machine precision (or perhaps slightly larger
so as not to be diddled by roundoff).
Note well that either of the above criteria might be fooled by a single anomalous
step that, for one reason or another, failed to get anywhere. Therefore, it is frequently
a good idea to restart a multidimensional minimization routine at a point where
it claims to have found a minimum. For this restart, you should reinitialize any
ancillary input quantities. In the downhill simplex method, for example, you should
reinitialize N of the N + 1 vertices of the simplex again by equation (10.4.1), with
P0 being one of the vertices of the claimed minimum.
Restarts should never be very expensive; your algorithm did, after all, converge
to the restart point once, and now you are starting the algorithm already there.
Consider, then, our N-dimensional amoeba:

direction n, then any function of N variables f(P) can be minimized along the line
n by our one-dimensional methods. One can dream up various multidimensional
minimization methods that consist of sequences ofsuch lineminimizations. Different
methods will differ only by how, at each stage, they choose the next direction n to
try. All such methods presume the existence of a âblack-boxâ sub-algorithm, which
we might call linmin (given as an explicit routine at the end of this section), whose
deï¬nition can be taken for now as
linmin: Given as input the vectors P and n, and the
function f, ï¬nd the scalar Î» that minimizes f(P +Î»n).
Replace P by P + Î»n. Replace n by Î»n. Done.
All the minimization methods in this section and in the two sections following
fall under this general schema of successive line minimizations. (The algorithm
in Â§10.7 does not need very accurate line minimizations. Accordingly, it has its
own approximate line minimization routine, lnsrch.) In this section we consider
a class of methods whose choice of successive directions does not involve explicit
computation of the functionâs gradient; the next two sections do require such gradient
calculations. You will note that we need not specify whether linmin uses gradient
information or not. That choice is up to you, and its optimization depends on your
particular function. You would be crazy, however, to use gradients in linmin and
not use them in the choice of directions, since in this latter role they can drastically
reduce the total computational burden.
But what if, in your application, calculation of the gradient is out of the question.
You might ï¬rst think of this simple method: Take the unit vectors e1, e2, . . .eN as a
set of directions. Using linmin, move along the ï¬rst direction to its minimum, then
from there along the second direction to its minimum, and so on, cycling through the
whole set of directions as many times as necessary, until the function stops decreasing.
This simple method is actually not too bad for many functions. Even more
interesting is why it is bad, i.e. very inefï¬cient, for some other functions. Consider
a function of two dimensions whose contour map (level lines) happens to deï¬ne a
long, narrow valley at some angle to the coordinate basis vectors (see Figure 10.5.1).
Then the only way âdown the length of the valleyâ going along the basis vectors at
each stage is by a series of many tiny steps. More generally, in N dimensions, if
the functionâs second derivatives are much larger in magnitude in some directions
than in others, then many cycles through all N basis vectors will be required in
order to get anywhere. This condition is not all that unusual; according to Murphyâs
Law, you should count on it.
Obviously what we need is a better set of directions than the eiâs. All direction
set methods consist of prescriptions for updating the set of directions as the method
proceeds, attempting to come up with a set which either (i) includes some very
good directions that will take us far along narrow valleys, or else (more subtly)
(ii) includes some number of ânon-interferingâ directions with the special property
that minimization along one is not âspoiledâ by subsequent minimization along
another, so that interminable cycling through the set of directions can be avoided.

Successive minimizations along coordinate directions in a long, narrow âvalleyâ (shown
as contour lines). Unless the valley is optimally oriented, this method is extremely inefï¬cient, taking
many tiny steps to get to the minimum, crossing and re-crossing the principal axis.
Conjugate Directions
This concept of ânon-interferingâ directions, more conventionally called con-
jugate directions, is worth making mathematically explicit.
First, note that if we minimize a function along some direction u, then the
gradient of the function must be perpendicular to u at the line minimum; if not, then
there would still be a nonzero directional derivative along u.
Next take some particular point P as the origin of the coordinate system with
coordinates x. Then any function f can be approximated by its Taylor series

In the approximation of (10.5.1), the gradient of f is easily calculated as
âf = A Â· x âb
(10.5.3)
(This implies that the gradient will vanish â the function will be at an extremum â
at a value of x obtained by solving A Â· x = b. This idea we will return to in Â§10.7!)
How does the gradient âf change as we move along some direction? Evidently
Î´(âf) = A Â· (Î´x)
(10.5.4)
Suppose that we have moved along some direction u to a minimum and now
propose to move along some new direction v. The condition that motion along v not
spoil our minimization along u is just that the gradient stay perpendicular to u, i.e.,
that the change in the gradient be perpendicular to u. By equation (10.5.4) this is just
0 = u Â· Î´(âf) = u Â· A Â· v
(10.5.5)
When (10.5.5) holds for two vectors u and v, they are said to be conjugate.
When the relation holds pairwise for all members of a set of vectors, they are said
to be a conjugate set. If you do successive line minimization of a function along
a conjugate set of directions, then you donât need to redo any of those directions
(unless, of course, you spoil things by minimizing along a direction that they are
not conjugate to).
A triumph for a direction set method is to come up with a set of N linearly
independent, mutually conjugate directions. Then, one pass of N line minimizations
will put it exactly at the minimum of a quadratic form like (10.5.1). For functions
f that are not exactly quadratic forms, it wonât be exactly at the minimum; but
repeated cycles of N line minimizations will in due course converge quadratically
to the minimum.
Powellâs Quadratically Convergent Method
Powell ï¬rst discovered a direction set method that does produce N mutually
conjugate directions.
Here is how it goes: Initialize the set of directions ui to
the basis vectors,
ui = ei
i = 1, . . ., N
(10.5.6)
Now repeat the following sequence of steps (âbasic procedureâ) until your function
stops decreasing:
â¢ Save your starting position as P0.
â¢ For i = 1, . . ., N, move Piâ1 to the minimum along direction ui and
call this point Pi.
â¢ For i = 1, . . ., N â1, set ui âui+1.
â¢ Set uN âPN âP0.
â¢ Move PN to the minimum along direction uN and call this point P0.

Powell, in 1964, showed that, for a quadratic form like (10.5.1), k iterations
of the above basic procedure produce a set of directions ui whose last k members
are mutually conjugate. Therefore, N iterations of the basic procedure, amounting
to N(N + 1) line minimizations in all, will exactly minimize a quadratic form.
Brent [1] gives proofs of these statements in accessible form.
Unfortunately, there is a problem with Powellâs quadratically convergent al-
gorithm. The procedure of throwing away, at each stage, u1 in favor of PN âP0
tends to produce sets of directions that âfold up on each otherâ and become linearly
dependent. Once this happens, then the procedure ï¬nds the minimum of the function
f only over a subspace of the full N-dimensional case; in other words, it gives the
wrong answer. Therefore, the algorithm must not be used in the form given above.
There are a number of ways to ï¬x up the problem of linear dependence in
Powellâs algorithm, among them:
1. You can reinitialize the set of directions ui to the basis vectors ei after every
N or N + 1 iterations of the basic procedure. This produces a serviceable method,
which we commend to you if quadratic convergence is important for your application
(i.e., if your functions are close to quadratic forms and if you desire high accuracy).
2.
Brent points out that the set of directions can equally well be reset to
the columns of any orthogonal matrix. Rather than throw away the information
on conjugate directions already built up, he resets the direction set to calculated
principal directions of the matrix A (which he gives a procedure for determining).
The calculation is essentially a singular value decomposition algorithm (see Â§2.6).
Brent has a number of other cute tricks up his sleeve, and his modiï¬cation of
Powellâs method is probably the best presently known. Consult [1] for a detailed
description and listing of the program. Unfortunately it is rather too elaborate for
us to include here.
3. You can give up the property of quadratic convergence in favor of a more
heuristic scheme (due to Powell) which tries to ï¬nd a few good directions along
narrow valleys instead of N necessarily conjugate directions. This is the method
that we now implement. (It is also the version of Powellâs method given in Acton [2],
from which parts of the following discussion are drawn.)
Discarding the Direction of Largest Decrease
The fox and the grapes: Now that we are going to give up the property of
quadratic convergence, was it so important after all? That depends on the function
that you are minimizing. Some applications produce functions with long, twisty
valleys. Quadratic convergence is of no particular advantage to a program which
must slalom down the length of a valley ï¬oor that twists one way and another (and
another, and another, . . . â there are N dimensions!). Along the long direction,
a quadratically convergent method is trying to extrapolate to the minimum of a
parabola which just isnât (yet) there; while the conjugacy of the N â1 transverse
directions keeps getting spoiled by the twists.
Sooner or later, however, we do arrive at an approximately ellipsoidal minimum
(cf. equation 10.5.1 when b, the gradient, is zero). Then, depending on how much
accuracy we require, a method with quadratic convergence can save us several times
N 2 extra line minimizations, since quadratic convergence doubles the number of
signiï¬cant ï¬gures at each iteration.

The basic idea of our now-modiï¬ed Powellâs method is still to take PN âP0 as
a new direction; it is, after all, the average direction moved after tryingall N possible
directions. For a valley whose long direction is twisting slowly, this direction is
likely to give us a good run along the new long direction. The change is to discard
the old direction along which the function f made its largest decrease. This seems
paradoxical, since that direction was the best of the previous iteration. However, it
is also likely to be a major component of the new direction that we are adding, so
dropping it gives us the best chance of avoiding a buildup of linear dependence.
There are a couple of exceptions to this basic idea. Sometimes it is better not
to add a new direction at all.
Deï¬ne
f0 â¡f(P0)
fN â¡f(PN)
fE â¡f(2PN âP0)
(10.5.7)
Here fE is the function value at an âextrapolatedâ point somewhat further along
the proposed new direction. Also deï¬ne âf to be the magnitude of the largest
decrease along one particular direction of the present basic procedure iteration. (âf
is a positive number.)
Then:
1. If fE â¥f0, then keep the old set of directions for the next basic procedure,
because the average direction PN âP0 is all played out.
2. If 2 (f0 â2fN +fE) [(f0 âfN )ââf]2 â¥(f0 âfE)2âf, then keep the old
set of directions for the next basic procedure, because either (i) the decrease along
the average direction was not primarily due to any single directionâs decrease, or
(ii) there is a substantial second derivative along the average direction and we seem
to be near to the bottom of its minimum.

Implementation of Line Minimization
Make no mistake, there is a right way to implement linmin: It is to use
the methods of one-dimensional minimization described in Â§10.1âÂ§10.3, but to
rewrite the programs of those sections so that their bookkeeping is done on vector-
valued points P (all lying along a given direction n) rather than scalar-valued
abscissas x. That straightforward task produces long routines densely populated
with âfor(k=1;k<=n;k++)â loops.
We do not have space to include such routines in this book. Our linmin, which
works just ï¬ne, is instead a kind of bookkeeping swindle. It constructs an âartiï¬cialâ
function of one variable called f1dim, which is the value of your function, say,
func, along the line going through the point p in the direction xi. linmin calls our
familiar one-dimensional routines mnbrak (Â§10.1) and brent (Â§10.3) and instructs
them to minimize f1dim. linmin communicates with f1dim âover the headâ of
mnbrak and brent, through global (external) variables. That is also how it passes
to f1dim a pointer to your user-supplied function.
The only thinginefï¬cient about linmin is this: Its use as an interface between a
multidimensional minimizationstrategy and a one-dimensional minimizationroutine
results in some unnecessary copying of vectors hither and yon. That should not

10.6 Conjugate Gradient Methods in
Multidimensions
We consider now the case where you are able to calculate, at a given N-
dimensional point P, not just the value of a function f(P) but also the gradient
(vector of ï¬rst partial derivatives) âf(P).
A rough countingargument will show how advantageous it is to use the gradient
information: Suppose that the function f is roughly approximated as a quadratic
form, as above in equation (10.5.1),
f(x) âc âb Â· x + 1
2 x Â· A Â· x
(10.6.1)
Then the number of unknown parameters in f is equal to the number of free
parameters in A and b, which is 1
2N(N + 1), which we see to be of order N 2.
Changing any one of these parameters can move the location of the minimum.
Therefore, we should not expect to be able to ï¬nd the minimum until we have
collected an equivalent information content, of order N 2 numbers.
In the direction set methods of Â§10.5, we collected the necessary information by
making on the order of N 2 separate line minimizations, each requiring âa fewâ (but
sometimes a big few!) function evaluations. Now, each evaluation of the gradient
will bring us N new components of information. If we use them wisely, we should
need to make only of order N separate line minimizations. That is in fact the case
for the algorithms in this section and the next.
A factor of N improvement in computational speed is not necessarily implied.
As a rough estimate, we might imagine that the calculation of each component of
the gradient takes about as long as evaluating the function itself. In that case there
will be of order N 2 equivalent function evaluations both with and without gradient
information. Even if the advantage is not of order N, however, it is nevertheless
quite substantial: (i) Each calculated component of the gradient will typically save
not just one function evaluation, but a number of them, equivalent to, say, a whole
line minimization. (ii) There is often a high degree of redundancy in the formulas
for the various components of a functionâs gradient; when this is so, especially when
there is also redundancy with the calculation of the function, then the calculation of
the gradient may cost signiï¬cantly less than N function evaluations.

(a) Steepest descent method in a long, narrow âvalley.â While more efï¬cient than the
strategy of Figure 10.5.1, steepest descent is nonetheless an inefï¬cient strategy, taking many steps to
reach the valley ï¬oor. (b) Magniï¬ed view of one step: A step starts off in the local gradient direction,
perpendicular to the contour lines, and traverses a straight line until a local minimum is reached, where
the traverse is parallel to the local contour lines.
A common beginnerâs error is to assume that any reasonable way of incorporat-
ing gradient information should be about as good as any other. This line of thought
leads to the following not very good algorithm, the steepest descent method:
Steepest Descent: Start at a point P0. As many times
as needed, move from point Pi to the point Pi+1 by
minimizing along the line from Pi in the direction of
the local downhill gradient ââf(Pi).
The problem with the steepest descent method (which, incidentally, goes back
to Cauchy), is similar to the problem that was shown in Figure 10.5.1. The method
will perform many small steps in going down a long, narrow valley, even if the valley
is a perfect quadratic form. You might have hoped that, say in two dimensions,
your ï¬rst step would take you to the valley ï¬oor, the second step directly down
the long axis; but remember that the new gradient at the minimum point of any
line minimization is perpendicular to the direction just traversed. Therefore, with
the steepest descent method, you must make a right angle turn, which does not, in
general, take you to the minimum. (See Figure 10.6.1.)
Just as in the discussion that led up to equation (10.5.5), we really want a
way of proceeding not down the new gradient, but rather in a direction that is
somehow constructed to be conjugate to the old gradient, and, insofar as possible,
to all previous directions traversed. Methods that accomplish this construction are
called conjugate gradient methods.
In Â§2.7 we discussed the conjugate gradient method as a technique for solving
linear algebraic equations by minimizing a quadratic form. That formalism can also
be applied to the problem of minimizing a function approximated by the quadratic

form (10.6.1). Recall that, starting with an arbitrary initial vector g0 and letting
h0 = g0, the conjugate gradient method constructs two sequences of vectors from
the recurrence
gi+1 = gi âÎ»iA Â· hi
hi+1 = gi+1 + Î³ihi
i = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(10.6.2)
The vectors satisfy the orthogonality and conjugacy conditions
gi Â· gj = 0
hi Â· A Â· hj = 0
gi Â· hj = 0
j < i
(10.6.3)
The scalars Î»i and Î³i are given by
Î»i =
gi Â· gi
hi Â· A Â· hi
=
gi Â· hi
hi Â· A Â· hi
(10.6.4)
Î³i = gi+1 Â· gi+1
gi Â· gi
(10.6.5)
Equations (10.6.2)â(10.6.5) are simply equations (2.7.32)â(2.7.35) for a symmetric
A in a new notation. (A self-contained derivation of these results in the context of
function minimization is given by Polak [1].)
Now suppose that we knew the Hessian matrix A in equation (10.6.1). Then
we could use the construction (10.6.2) to ï¬nd successively conjugate directions hi
along which to line-minimize. After N such, we would efï¬ciently have arrived at
the minimum of the quadratic form. But we donât know A.
Here is a remarkable theorem to save the day: Suppose we happen to have
gi = ââf(Pi), for some point Pi, where f is of the form (10.6.1). Suppose that we
proceed from Pi along the direction hi to the local minimum of f located at some
point Pi+1 and then set gi+1 = ââf(Pi+1). Then, this gi+1 is the same vector
as would have been constructed by equation (10.6.2). (And we have constructed
it without knowledge of A!)
Proof: By equation (10.5.3), gi = âA Â· Pi + b, and
gi+1 = âA Â· (Pi + Î»hi) + b = gi âÎ»A Â· hi
(10.6.6)
with Î» chosen to take us to the line minimum. But at the line minimum hi Â· âf =
âhi Â· gi+1 = 0. This latter condition is easily combined with (10.6.6) to solve for
Î». The result is exactly the expression (10.6.4). But with this value of Î», (10.6.6)
is the same as (10.6.2), q.e.d.
We have, then, the basis of an algorithm that requires neither knowledge of the
Hessian matrix A, nor even the storage necessary to store such a matrix. A sequence
of directions hi is constructed, using only line minimizations, evaluations of the
gradient vector, and an auxiliary vector to store the latest in the sequence of gâs.
The algorithm described so far is the original Fletcher-Reeves version of the
conjugate gradient algorithm.
Later, Polak and Ribiere introduced one tiny, but
sometimes signiï¬cant, change. They proposed using the form
Î³i = (gi+1 âgi) Â· gi+1

instead of equation (10.6.5). âWait,â you say, âarenât they equal by the orthogonality
conditions (10.6.3)?â They are equal for exact quadratic forms. In the real world,
however, your function is not exactly a quadratic form. Arriving at the supposed
minimum of the quadratic form, you may still need to proceed for another set of
iterations. There is some evidence [2] that the Polak-Ribiere formula accomplishes
the transition to further iterations more gracefully: When it runs out of steam, it
tends to reset h to be down the local gradient, which is equivalent to beginning the
conjugate-gradient procedure anew.
The following routine implements the Polak-Ribiere variant, which we recom-
mend; but changing one program line, as shown, will give you Fletcher-Reeves. The
routine presumes the existence of a function func(p), where p[1..n] is a vector
of length n, and also presumes the existence of a function dfunc(p,df) that sets
the vector gradient df[1..n] evaluated at the input point p.
The routine calls linmin to do the line minimizations. As already discussed,
you may wish to use a modiï¬ed version of linmin that uses dbrent instead of
brent, i.e., that uses the gradient in doing the line minimizations. See note below.
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
#define ITMAX 200
#define EPS 1.0e-10
Here ITMAX is the maximum allowed number of iterations, while EPS is a small number to
rectify the special case of converging to exactly zero function value.

void frprmn(float p[], int n, float ftol, int *iter, float *fret,
float (*func)(float []), void (*dfunc)(float [], float []))
Given a starting point p[1..n], Fletcher-Reeves-Polak-Ribiere minimization is performed on a
function func, using its gradient as calculated by a routine dfunc. The convergence tolerance
on the function value is input as ftol. Returned quantities are p (the location of the minimum),
iter (the number of iterations that were performed), and fret (the minimum value of the
function). The routine linmin is called to perform line minimizations.

Note on Line Minimization Using Derivatives
Kindly reread the last part of Â§10.5. We here want to do the same thing, but
using derivative information in performing the line minimization.
The modiï¬ed version of linmin, called dlinmin, and its required companion
routine df1dim follow:
#include "nrutil.h"
#define TOL 2.0e-4
Tolerance passed to dbrent.
int ncom;
Global variables communicate with df1dim.

void (*nrdfun)(float [], float []);
void dlinmin(float p[], float xi[], int n, float *fret, float (*func)(float []),
void (*dfunc)(float [], float []))
Given an n-dimensional point p[1..n] and an n-dimensional direction xi[1..n], moves and
resets p to where the function func(p) takes on a minimum along the direction xi from p,
and replaces xi by the actual vector displacement that p was moved. Also returns as fret
the value of func at the returned location p. This is actually all accomplished by calling the
routines mnbrak and dbrent.

Multidimensions
The goal of variable metric methods, which are sometimes called quasi-Newton
methods, is not different from the goal of conjugate gradient methods: to accumulate
information from successive line minimizations so that N such line minimizations
lead to the exact minimum of a quadratic form in N dimensions. In that case, the
method will also be quadratically convergent for more general smooth functions.
Both variable metric and conjugate gradient methods require that you are able to
compute your functionâs gradient, or ï¬rst partial derivatives, at arbitrary points. The
variable metric approach differs from the conjugate gradient in the way that it stores

and updates the information that is accumulated. Instead of requiring intermediate
storage on the order of N, the number of dimensions, it requires a matrix of size
N Ã N. Generally, for any moderate N, this is an entirely trivial disadvantage.
On the other hand, there is not, as far as we know, any overwhelming advantage
that the variable metric methods hold over the conjugate gradient techniques, except
perhaps a historical one. Developed somewhat earlier, and more widely propagated,
the variable metric methods have by now developed a wider constituency of satisï¬ed
users. Likewise, some fancier implementations of variable metric methods (going
beyond the scope of this book, see below) have been developed to a greater level of
sophistication on issues like the minimization of roundoff error, handling of special
conditions, and so on. We tend to use variable metric rather than conjugate gradient,
but we have no reason to urge this habit on you.
Variablemetricmethodscomeintwomain ï¬avors. OneistheDavidon-Fletcher-
Powell (DFP) algorithm (sometimes referred to as simply Fletcher-Powell). The
other goes by the name Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS). The BFGS and
DFP schemes differ only in details of their roundoff error, convergence tolerances,
and similar âdirtyâ issues which are outside of our scope [1,2].
However, it has
become generally recognized that, empirically, the BFGS scheme is superior in these
details. We will implement BFGS in this section.
As before, we imagine that our arbitrary function f(x) can be locally approx-
imated by the quadratic form of equation (10.6.1). We donât, however, have any
information about the values of the quadratic formâs parameters A and b, except
insofar as we can glean such information from our function evaluations and line
minimizations.
The basic idea of the variable metric method is to build up, iteratively, a good
approximation to the inverse Hessian matrix Aâ1, that is, to construct a sequence
of matrices Hi with the property,
lim
iââHi = Aâ1
(10.7.1)
Even better if the limit is achieved after N iterations instead of â.
The reason that variable metric methods are sometimes called quasi-Newton
methods can now be explained. Consider ï¬nding a minimum by using Newtonâs
method to search for a zero of the gradient of the function. Near the current point
xi, we have to second order
f(x) = f(xi) + (x âxi) Â· âf(xi) + 1
2(x âxi) Â· A Â· (x âxi)
(10.7.2)
so
âf(x) = âf(xi) + A Â· (x âxi)
(10.7.3)
In Newtonâs method we set âf(x) = 0 to determine the next iteration point:
x âxi = âAâ1 Â· âf(xi)
(10.7.4)
The left-hand side is the ï¬nite step we need take to get to the exact minimum; the
right-hand side is known once we have accumulated an accurate H âAâ1.
The âquasiâ in quasi-Newton is because we donât use the actual Hessian matrix
of f, but instead use our current approximation of it.
This is often better than

using the true Hessian. We can understand this paradoxical result by considering the
descent directions of f at xi. These are the directions p along which f decreases:
âf Â·p < 0. For the Newton direction(10.7.4) to be a descent direction, we must have
âf(xi) Â· (x âxi) = â(x âxi) Â· A Â· (x âxi) < 0
(10.7.5)
that is, A must be positive deï¬nite. In general, far from a minimum, we have no
guarantee that the Hessian is positive deï¬nite. Taking the actual Newton step with
the real Hessian can move us to points where the function is increasing in value.
The idea behind quasi-Newton methods is to start with a positive deï¬nite, symmetric
approximation to A (usually the unit matrix) and build up the approximating Hiâs
in such a way that the matrix Hi remains positive deï¬nite and symmetric. Far from
the minimum, this guarantees that we always move in a downhill direction. Close to
the minimum, the updating formula approaches the true Hessian and we enjoy the
quadratic convergence of Newtonâs method.
When we are not close enough to the minimum, taking the full Newton step
p even with a positive deï¬nite A need not decrease the function; we may move
too far for the quadratic approximation to be valid. All we are guaranteed is that
initially f decreases as we move in the Newton direction. Once again we can use
the backtracking strategy described in Â§9.7 to choose a step along the direction of
the Newton step p, but not necessarily all the way.
We wonât rigorously derive the DFP algorithm for taking Hi into Hi+1; you
can consult [3] for clear derivations. Following Brodlie (in [2]), we will give the
following heuristic motivation of the procedure.
Subtracting equation (10.7.4) at xi+1 from that same equation at xi gives
xi+1 âxi = Aâ1 Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)
(10.7.6)
where âfj â¡âf(xj). Having made the step from xi to xi+1, we might reasonably
want to require that the new approximation Hi+1 satisfy (10.7.6) as if it were
actually Aâ1, that is,
xi+1 âxi = Hi+1 Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)
(10.7.7)
We might also imagine that the updating formula should be of the form Hi+1 =
Hi + correction.
What âobjectsâ are around out of which to construct a correction term? Most
notable are the two vectors xi+1 âxi and âfi+1 ââfi; and there is also Hi.
There are not inï¬nitely many natural ways of making a matrix out of these objects,
especially if (10.7.7) must hold! One such way, the DFP updating formula, is
Hi+1 = Hi +
(xi+1 âxi) â(xi+1 âxi)
(xi+1 âxi) Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)
â[Hi Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)] â[Hi Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)]
(âfi+1 ââfi) Â· Hi Â· (âfi+1 ââfi)
(10.7.8)
where âdenotes the âouterâ or âdirectâ product of two vectors, a matrix: The ij
component of uâv is uivj. (You might want to verifythat 10.7.8 does satisfy 10.7.7.)

Given a starting point p[1..n] that is a vector of length n, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-
Shanno variant of Davidon-Fletcher-Powell minimization is performed on a function func, using
its gradient as calculated by a routine dfunc. The convergence requirement on zeroing the
gradient is input as gtol. Returned quantities are p[1..n] (the location of the minimum),
iter (the number of iterations that were performed), and fret (the minimum value of the
function). The routine lnsrch is called to perform approximate line minimizations.

Quasi-Newton methods like dfpmin work well with the approximate line
minimization done by lnsrch. The routines powell (Â§10.5) and frprmn (Â§10.6),
however, need more accurate line minimization, which is carried out by the routine
linmin.
Advanced Implementations of Variable Metric Methods
Although rare, it can conceivably happen that roundoff errors cause the matrix Hi to
become nearly singular or non-positive-deï¬nite. This can be serious, because the supposed
search directions might then not lead downhill, and because nearly singular Hiâs tend to give
subsequent Hiâs that are also nearly singular.
There is a simple ï¬x for this rare problem, the same as was mentioned in Â§10.4: In case
of any doubt, you should restart the algorithm at the claimed minimum point, and see if it
goes anywhere. Simple, but not very elegant. Modern implementations of variable metric
methods deal with the problem in a more sophisticated way.
Instead ofbuilding up an approximationtoAâ1, it is possible to build up an approximation
of A itself. Then, instead of calculating the left-hand side of (10.7.4) directly, one solves
the set of linear equations
A Â· (xm âxi) = ââf(xi)
(10.7.11)
At ï¬rst glance this seems like a bad idea, since solving (10.7.11) is a process of order
N 3 â and anyway, how does this help the roundoff problem? The trick is not to store A but
rather a triangular decomposition of A, its Cholesky decomposition (cf. Â§2.9). The updating
formula used for the Cholesky decomposition of A is of order N 2 and can be arranged to
guarantee that the matrix remains positive deï¬nite and nonsingular, even in the presence of
ï¬nite roundoff. This method is due to Gill and Murray [1,2].

The various aijâs can have either sign, or be zero. The fact that the bâs must all be
nonnegative (as indicated by the ï¬nal inequality in the above three equations) is a
matter of convention only, since you can multiply any contrary inequality by â1.
There is no particular signiï¬cance in the number of constraints M being less than,
equal to, or greater than the number of unknowns N.
A set of values x1 . . .xN that satisï¬es the constraints (10.8.2)â(10.8.5) is called
a feasible vector. The function that we are trying to maximize is called the objective
function. The feasible vector that maximizes the objective function is called the
optimal feasible vector. An optimal feasible vector can fail to exist for two distinct
reasons: (i) there are no feasible vectors, i.e., the given constraints are incompatible,
or (ii) there is no maximum, i.e., there is a direction in N space where one or more
of the variables can be taken to inï¬nity while still satisfying the constraints, giving
an unbounded value for the objective function.
As you see, the subject of linear programming is surrounded by notational and
terminological thickets. Both of these thorny defenses are lovingly cultivated by a
coterie of stern acolytes who have devoted themselves to the ï¬eld. Actually, the
basic ideas of linear programming are quite simple. Avoiding the shrubbery, we
want to teach you the basics by means of a couple of speciï¬c examples; it should
then be quite obvious how to generalize.
Why is linear programming so important? (i) Because ânonnegativityâ is the
usual constraint on any variable xi that represents the tangible amount of some
physical commodity, like guns, butter, dollars, units of vitamin E, food calories,
kilowatt hours, mass, etc.
Hence equation (10.8.2).
(ii) Because one is often
interested in additive (linear) limitations or bounds imposed by man or nature:
minimum nutritional requirement, maximum affordable cost, maximum on available
labor or capital, minimum tolerable level of voter approval, etc. Hence equations
(10.8.3)â(10.8.5).
(iii) Because the function that one wants to optimize may be
linear, or else may at least be approximated by a linear function â since that is the
problem that linear programming can solve. Hence equation (10.8.1). For a short,
semipopular survey of linear programming applications, see Bland [1].
Here is a speciï¬c example of a problem in linear programming, which has
N = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = m3 = 1, hence M = 4:

Basic concepts of linear programming. The case of only two independent variables,

constraints require x1 and x2 to be positive. Additional constraints may restrict the solution to regions
(inequality constraints) or to surfaces of lower dimensionality (equality constraints). Feasible vectors
satisfy all constraints. Feasible basic vectors also lie on the boundary of the allowed region. The simplex
method steps among feasible basic vectors until the optimal feasible vector is found.

summarizes some of the terminology thus far.
Fundamental Theorem of Linear Optimization
Imagine that we start with a full N-dimensional space of candidate vectors. Then
(in mindâs eye, at least) we carve away the regions that are eliminated in turn by each
imposed constraint. Since the constraints are linear, every boundary introduced by
this process is a plane, or rather hyperplane. Equality constraints of the form (10.8.5)

force the feasible region onto hyperplanes of smaller dimension, while inequalities
simply divide the then-feasible region into allowed and nonallowed pieces.
When all the constraints are imposed, either we are left with some feasible
region or else there are no feasible vectors. Since the feasible region is bounded by
hyperplanes, it is geometrically a kind of convex polyhedron or simplex (cf. Â§10.4).
If there is a feasible region, can the optimal feasible vector be somewhere in its
interior, away from the boundaries? No, because the objective function is linear.
This means that it always has a nonzero vector gradient. This, in turn, means that
we could always increase the objective function by running up the gradient until
we hit a boundary wall.
The boundary of any geometrical region has one less dimension than its interior.
Therefore, we can now run up the gradient projected into the boundary wall until we
reach an edge of that wall. We can then run up that edge, and so on, down through
whatever number of dimensions, until we ï¬nally arrive at a point, a vertex of the
original simplex. Since this point has all N of its coordinates deï¬ned, it must be
the solution of N simultaneous equalities drawn from the original set of equalities
and inequalities (10.8.2)â(10.8.5).
Points that are feasible vectors and that satisfy N of the original constraints
as equalities, are termed feasible basic vectors. If N > M, then a feasible basic
vector has at least N âM of its components equal to zero, since at least that many
of the constraints (10.8.2) will be needed to make up the total of N. Put the other
way, at most M components of a feasible basic vector are nonzero. In the example
(10.8.6)â(10.8.7), you can check that the solution as given satisï¬es as equalities the
last three constraints of (10.8.7) and the constraint x1 â¥0, for the required total of 4.
Put together the two preceding paragraphs and you have the Fundamental
Theorem of Linear Optimization: If an optimal feasible vector exists, then there is a
feasible basic vector that is optimal. (Didnât we warn you about the terminological
thicket?)
The importance of the fundamental theorem is that it reduces the optimization
problem to a âcombinatorialâ problem, that of determining which N constraints
(out of the M + N constraints in 10.8.2â10.8.5) should be satisï¬ed by the optimal
feasible vector. We have only to keep trying different combinations, and computing
the objective function for each trial, until we ï¬nd the best.
Doing this blindly would take halfway to forever. The simplex method, ï¬rst
published by Dantzig in 1948 (see [2]), is a way of organizing the procedure so that
(i) a series of combinations is tried for which the objective function increases at each
step, and (ii) the optimal feasible vector is reached after a number of iterations that
is almost always no larger than of order M or N, whichever is larger. An interesting
mathematical sidelight is that this second property, although known empirically ever
since the simplex method was devised, was not proved to be true until the 1982 work
of Stephen Smale. (For a contemporary account, see [3].)
Simplex Method for a Restricted Normal Form
A linear programming problem is said to be in normal form if it has no
constraints in the form (10.8.3) or (10.8.4), but rather only equality constraints of the
form (10.8.5) and nonnegativity constraints of the form (10.8.2).

For our purposes it will be useful to consider an even more restricted set of
cases, with this additional property: Each equality constraint of the form (10.8.5)
must have at least one variable that has a positive coefï¬cient and that appears
uniquely in that one constraint only. We can then choose one such variable in each
constraint equation, and solve that constraint equation for it. The variables thus
chosen are called left-hand variables or basic variables, and there are exactly M
(= m3) of them. The remaining N âM variables are called right-hand variables or
nonbasic variables. Obviously this restricted normal form can be achieved only in
the case M â¤N, so that is the case that we will consider.
You may be thinking that our restricted normal form is so specialized that
it is unlikely to include the linear programming problem that you wish to solve.
Not at all! We will presently show how any linear programming problem can be
transformed into restricted normal form. Therefore bear with us and learn how to
apply the simplex method to a restricted normal form.
Here is an example of a problem in restricted normal form:
Maximize
z = 2x2 â4x3
(10.8.8)
with x1, x2, x3, and x4 all nonnegative and also with
x1 = 2 â6x2 + x3
x4 = 8 + 3x2 â4x3
(10.8.9)
This example has N = 4, M = 2; the left-hand variables are x1 and x4; the
right-hand variables are x2 and x3. The objective function (10.8.8) is written so
as to depend only on right-hand variables; note, however, that this is not an actual
restriction on objective functions in restricted normal form, since any left-hand
variables appearing in the objective function could be eliminated algebraically by
use of (10.8.9) or its analogs.
For any problem in restricted normal form, we can instantly read off a feasible
basic vector (although not necessarily the optimal feasible basic vector). Simply set
all right-hand variables equal to zero, and equation (10.8.9) then gives the values of
the left-hand variables for which the constraints are satisï¬ed. The idea of the simplex
method is to proceed by a series of exchanges.
In each exchange, a right-hand
variable and a left-hand variable change places. At each stage we maintain a problem
in restricted normal form that is equivalent to the original problem.
It is notationally convenient to record the information content of equations
(10.8.8) and (10.8.9) in a so-called tableau, as follows:
x2
x3
z
0
2
â4
x1
2
â6
1
x4
8
3
â4
(10.8.10)
You should study (10.8.10) to be sure that you understand where each entry comes
from, and how to translate back and forth between the tableau and equation formats
of a problem in restricted normal form.

The ï¬rst step in the simplex method is to examine the top row of the tableau,
which we will call the âz-row.â Look at the entries in columns labeled by right-hand
variables (we will call these âright-columnsâ). We want to imagine in turn the effect
of increasing each right-hand variable from its present value of zero, while leaving
all the other right-hand variables at zero. Will the objective function increase or
decrease? The answer is given by the sign of the entry in the z-row. Since we want
to increase the objective function, only right columns having positive z-row entries
are of interest. In (10.8.10) there is only one such column, whose z-row entry is 2.
The second step is to examine the column entries below each z-row entry
that was selected by step one.
We want to ask how much we can increase the
right-hand variable before one of the left-hand variables is driven negative, which is
not allowed. If the tableau element at the intersection of the right-hand column and
the left-hand variableâs row is positive, then it poses no restriction: the corresponding
left-hand variable will just be driven more and more positive. If all the entries in
any right-hand column are positive, then there is no bound on the objective function
and (having said so) we are done with the problem.
If one or more entries below a positive z-row entry are negative, then we have
to ï¬gure out which such entry ï¬rst limits the increase of that columnâs right-hand
variable. Evidently the limitingincrease is given by dividingthe element in the right-
hand column (which is called the pivot element) into the element in the âconstant
columnâ (leftmost column) of the pivot elementâs row. A value that is small in
magnitude is most restrictive. The increase in the objective function for this choice
of pivot element is then that value multiplied by the z-row entry of that column. We
repeat this procedure on all possible right-hand columns to ï¬nd the pivot element
with the largest such increase. That completes our âchoice of a pivot element.â
In the above example, the only positive z-row entry is 2. There is only one
negative entry below it, namely â6, so this is the pivot element. Its constant-column
entry is 2. This pivot will therefore allow x2 to be increased by 2Ã·|6|, which results
in an increase of the objective function by an amount (2 Ã 2) Ã· |6|.
The third step is to do the increase of the selected right-hand variable, thus
making it a left-hand variable; and simultaneously to modify the left-hand variables,
reducing the pivot-row element to zero and thus making it a right-hand variable. For
our above example letâs do this ï¬rst by hand: We begin by solving the pivot-row
equation for the new left-hand variable x2 in favor of the old one x1, namely
x1 = 2 â6x2 + x3
â
x2 = 1
3 â1
6x1 + 1
6x3
(10.8.11)
We then substitute this into the old z-row,
z = 2x2 â4x3 = 2  1
3 â1
6x1 + 1
6x3
 â4x3 = 2
3 â1
3x1 â11
3 x3
(10.8.12)
and into all other left-variable rows, in this case only x4,
x4 = 8 + 3  1

(10.8.14)
The fourthstep is togo back and repeat the ï¬rst step, lookingfor another possible
increase of the objective function. We do this as many times as possible, that is, until
all the right-hand entries in the z-row are negative, signaling that no further increase
is possible. In the present example, this already occurs in (10.8.14), so we are done.
The answer can now be read from the constant column of the ï¬nal tableau. In
(10.8.14) we see that the objective function is maximized to a value of 2/3 for the
solution vector x2 = 1/3, x4 = 9, x1 = x3 = 0.
Now look back over the procedure that led from (10.8.10) to (10.8.14). You will
ï¬nd that it could be summarized entirely in tableau format as a series of prescribed
elementary matrix operations:
â¢ Locate the pivot element and save it.
â¢ Save the whole pivot column.
â¢ Replace each row, except the pivot row, by that linear combination of itself
and the pivot row which makes its pivot-column entry zero.
â¢ Divide the pivot row by the negative of the pivot.
â¢ Replace the pivot element by the reciprocal of its saved value.
â¢ Replace the rest of the pivot column by its saved values divided by the
saved pivot element.
This is the sequence of operations actually performed by a linear programming
routine, such as the one that we will presently give.
You should now be able to solve almost any linear programming problem that
starts in restricted normal form.
The only special case that might stump you is
if an entry in the constant column turns out to be zero at some stage, so that a
left-hand variable is zero at the same time as all the right-hand variables are zero.
This is called a degenerate feasible vector. To proceed, you may need to exchange
the degenerate left-hand variable for one of the right-hand variables, perhaps even
making several such exchanges.
Writing the General Problem in Restricted Normal Form
Here is a pleasant surprise. There exist a couple of clever tricks that render
trivial the task of translating a general linear programming problem into restricted
normal form!
First, we need to get rid of the inequalities of the form (10.8.3) or (10.8.4), for
example, the ï¬rst three constraints in (10.8.7). We do this by adding to the problem
so-called slack variables which, when their nonnegativity is required, convert the
inequalities to equalities.
We will denote slack variables as yi.
There will be
m1 + m2 of them. Once they are introduced, you treat them on an equal footing
with the original variables xi; then, at the very end, you simply ignore them.

For example, introducing slack variables leaves (10.8.6) unchanged but turns
(10.8.7) into
x1 + 2x3 + y1 = 740
2x2 â7x4 + y2 = 0
x2 âx3 + 2x4 ây3 = 1
2
x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 9
(10.8.15)
(Notice how the sign of the coefï¬cient of the slack variable is determined by which
sense of inequality it is replacing.)
Second, we need to insure that there is a set of M left-hand vectors, so that we
can set up a starting tableau in restricted normal form. (In other words, we need to
ï¬nd a âfeasible basic starting vector.â) The trick is again to invent new variables!
There are M of these, and they are called artiï¬cial variables; we denote them by zi.
You put exactly one artiï¬cial variable into each constraint equation on the following
model for the example (10.8.15):
z1 = 740 âx1 â2x3 ây1
z2 = â2x2 + 7x4 ây2
z3 = 1
2 âx2 + x3 â2x4 + y3
z4 = 9 âx1 âx2 âx3 âx4
(10.8.16)
Our example is now in restricted normal form.
Now you may object that (10.8.16) is not the same problem as (10.8.15) or
(10.8.7) unless all the ziâs are zero. Right you are! There is some subtlety here!
We must proceed to solve our problem in two phases. First phase: We replace our
objective function (10.8.6) by a so-called auxiliary objective function
zâ² â¡âz1 âz2 âz3 âz4 = â(749 1
2 â2x1 â4x2 â2x3 + 4x4 ây1 ây2 + y3)
(10.8.17)
(where the last equality follows from using 10.8.16). We now perform the simplex
method on the auxiliary objective function (10.8.17) with the constraints (10.8.16).
Obviously the auxiliary objective function will be maximized for nonnegative ziâs if
all the ziâs are zero. We therefore expect the simplex method in this ï¬rst phase to
produce a set of left-hand variables drawn from the xiâs and yiâs only, with all the
ziâs being right-hand variables. Aha! We then cross out the ziâs, leaving a problem
involving only xiâs and yiâs in restricted normal form. In other words, the ï¬rst phase
produces an initial feasible basic vector. Second phase: Solve the problem produced
by the ï¬rst phase, using the original objective function, not the auxiliary.
And what if the ï¬rst phase doesnât produce zero values for all the ziâs? That
signals that there is no initial feasible basic vector, i.e., that the constraints given to
us are inconsistent among themselves. Report that fact, and you are done.
Here is how to translate into tableau format the information needed for both the
ï¬rst and second phases of the overall method. As before, the underlying problem

This is not as daunting as it may, at ï¬rst sight, appear.
The table entries inside
the box of double lines are no more than the coefï¬cients of the original problem
(10.8.6)â(10.8.7) organized into a tabular form. In fact, these entries, along with
the values of N, M, m1, m2, and m3, are the only input that is needed by the
simplex method routine below. The columns under the slack variables yi simply
record whether each of the M constraints is of the form â¤, â¥, or =; this is redundant
information with the values m1, m2, m3, as long as we are sure to enter the rows of
the tableau in the correct respective order. The coefï¬cients of the auxiliary objective
function (bottom row) are just the negatives of the column sums of the rows above,
so these are easily calculated automatically.
The output from a simplex routine will be (i) a ï¬ag telling whether a ï¬nite
solution,no solution,or an unbounded solutionwas found,and (ii) an updated tableau.
The output tableau that derives from (10.8.18), given to two signiï¬cant ï¬gures, is

A little counting of the xiâs and yiâs will convince you that there are M + 1
rows (including the z-row) in both the input and the output tableaux, but that only
N + 1 âm3 columns of the output tableau (including the constant column) contain
any useful information, the other columns belonging to now-discarded artiï¬cial
variables. In the output, the ï¬rst numerical column contains the solution vector,
along with the maximum value of the objective function. Where a slack variable (yi)
appears on the left, the corresponding value is the amount by which its inequality
is safely satisï¬ed. Variables that are not left-hand variables in the output tableau
have zero values. Slack variables with zero values represent constraints that are
satisï¬ed as equalities.

Routine Implementing the Simplex Method
The followingroutineis based algorithmicallyon the implementationof Kuenzi,
Tzschach, and Zehnder [4]. Aside from input values of M, N, m1, m2, m3, the
principal input to the routine is a two-dimensional array a containing the portion of
the tableau (10.8.18) that is contained between the double lines. This input occupies
the M + 1 rows and N + 1 columns of a[1..m+1][1..n+1]. Note, however, that
reference is made internally to row M + 2 of a (used for the auxiliary objective
function, just as in 10.8.18). Therefore the variable declared as float **a, must
point to allocated memory allowing references in the subrange
a[i][k],
i = 1 . . .m+2, k = 1 . . .n+1
(10.8.20)
You will suffer endless agonies if you fail to understand this simple point. Also do
not neglect to order the rows of a in the same order as equations (10.8.1), (10.8.3),
(10.8.4), and (10.8.5), that is, objective function, â¤-constraints, â¥-constraints,
=-constraints.
On output,the tableau ais indexed bytworeturned arrays of integers. iposv[j]
contains, for j= 1 . . .M, the number i whose original variable xi is now represented
by row j+1 of a. These are thus the left-hand variables in the solution. (The ï¬rst row
of a is of course the z-row.) A value i > N indicates that the variable is a yi rather
than an xi, xN+j â¡yj. Likewise, izrov[j] contains, for j= 1 . . .N, the number i
whose original variable xi is now a right-hand variable, represented by column j+1
of a. These variables are all zero in the solution. The meaning of i > N is the same
as above, except that i > N + m1 + m2 denotes an artiï¬cial or slack variable which
was used only internally and should now be entirely ignored.
The ï¬ag icase is set to zero if a ï¬nite solution is found, +1 if the objective
function is unbounded, â1 if no solution satisï¬es the given constraints.
The routine treats the case of degenerate feasible vectors, so donât worry about
them. You may also wish to admire the fact that the routine does not require storage
for the columns of the tableau (10.8.18) that are to the right of the double line; it
keeps track of slack variables by more efï¬cient bookkeeping.
Please note that, as given, the routine is only âsemi-sophisticatedâ in its tests
for convergence. While the routine properly implements tests for inequality with
zero as tests against some small parameter EPS, it does not adjust this parameter to
reï¬ect the scale of the input data. This is adequate for many problems, where the
input data do not differ from unity by too many orders of magnitude. If, however,
you encounter endless cycling, then you should modify EPS in the routines simplx
and simp2. Permuting your variables can also help. Finally, consult [5].

Other Topics Brieï¬y Mentioned
Every linear programming problem in normal form with N variables and M
constraints has a corresponding dual problem with M variables and N constraints.
The tableau of the dual problem is, in essence, the transpose of the tableau of the
original (sometimes called primal) problem. It is possible to go from a solution
of the dual to a solution of the primal. This can occasionally be computationally
useful, but generally it is no big deal.
The revised simplex method is exactly equivalent to the simplex method in its
choice of which left-hand and right-hand variables are exchanged. Its computational
effort is not signiï¬cantly less than that of the simplex method. It does differ in
the organization of its storage, requiring only a matrix of size M Ã M, rather than
M Ã N, in its intermediate stages. If you have a lot of constraints, and memory
size is one of them, then you should look into it.
The primal-dual algorithm and the composite simplex algorithm are two dif-
ferent methods for avoiding the two phases of the usual simplex method: Progress
is made simultaneously towards ï¬nding a feasible solution and ï¬nding an optimal
solution. There seems to be no clearcut evidence that these methods are superior
to the usual method by any factor substantially larger than the âtender-loving-care
factorâ (which reï¬ects the programming effort of the proponents).
Problems where the objective function and/or one or more of the constraints are
replaced by expressions nonlinear in the variables are called nonlinear programming
problems. The literature on such problems is vast, but outside our scope. The special
case of quadratic expressions is called quadratic programming. Optimization prob-
lems where the variables take on only integer values are called integer programming
problems, a special case of discrete optimization generally. The next section looks
at a particular kind of discrete optimization problem.

10.9 Simulated Annealing Methods
The method of simulated annealing [1,2] is a technique that has attracted signif-
icant attention as suitable for optimization problems of large scale, especially ones
where a desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. For
practical purposes, simulated annealing has effectively âsolvedâ the famoustraveling
salesman problem of ï¬nding the shortest cyclical itinerary for a traveling salesman
who must visit each of N cities in turn. (Other practical methods have also been
found.) The method has also been used successfully for designingcomplex integrated
circuits: The arrangement of several hundred thousand circuit elements on a tiny
silicon substrate is optimized so as to minimize interference among their connecting
wires [3,4]. Surprisingly, the implementation of the algorithm is relatively simple.
Notice that the two applications cited are both examples of combinatorial
minimization. There is an objective function to be minimized, as usual; but the space
over which that function is deï¬ned is not simply the N-dimensional space of N
continuouslyvariable parameters. Rather, it is a discrete, but very large, conï¬guration
space, like the set of possible orders of cities, or the set of possible allocations of
silicon âreal estateâ blocks to circuit elements.
The number of elements in the
conï¬guration space is factorially large, so that they cannot be explored exhaustively.
Furthermore, since the set is discrete, we are deprived of any notion of âcontinuing
downhill in a favorable direction.â The concept of âdirectionâ may not have any
meaning in the conï¬guration space.
Below, we will also discuss how to use simulated annealing methods for spaces
with continuous control parameters, like those of Â§Â§10.4â10.7. This application is
actually more complicated than the combinatorial one, since the familiar problem of
âlong, narrow valleysâ again asserts itself. Simulated annealing, as we will see, tries
ârandomâ steps; but in a long, narrow valley, almost all random steps are uphill!
Some additional ï¬nesse is therefore required.
At the heart of the method of simulated annealing is an analogy with thermody-
namics, speciï¬cally with the way that liquids freeze and crystallize, or metals cool
and anneal. At high temperatures, the molecules of a liquid move freely with respect
to one another. If the liquid is cooled slowly, thermal mobility is lost. The atoms are
often able to line themselves up and form a pure crystal that is completely ordered
over a distance up to billions of times the size of an individual atom in all directions.
This crystal is the state of minimum energy for this system. The amazing fact is that,
for slowly cooled systems, nature is able to ï¬nd this minimum energy state. In fact, if
a liquid metal is cooled quickly or âquenched,â it does not reach this state but rather
ends up in a polycrystalline or amorphous state having somewhat higher energy.
So the essence of the process is slow cooling, allowing ample time for
redistribution of the atoms as they lose mobility. This is the technical deï¬nition of
annealing, and it is essential for ensuring that a low energy state will be achieved.

Although the analogy is not perfect, there is a sense in which all of the
minimization algorithms thus far in this chapter correspond to rapid cooling or
quenching. In all cases, we have gone greedily for the quick, nearby solution: From
the starting point, go immediately downhill as far as you can go. This, as often
remarked above, leads to a local, but not necessarily a global, minimum. Natureâs
own minimization algorithm is based on quite a different procedure. The so-called
Boltzmann probability distribution,
Prob(E) â¼exp(âE/kT)
(10.9.1)
expresses the idea that a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T has its
energy probabilistically distributed among all different energy states E. Even at
low temperature, there is a chance, albeit very small, of a system being in a high
energy state. Therefore, there is a corresponding chance for the system to get out of
a local energy minimum in favor of ï¬nding a better, more global, one. The quantity
k (Boltzmannâs constant) is a constant of nature that relates temperature to energy.
In other words, the system sometimes goes uphill as well as downhill; but the lower
the temperature, the less likely is any signiï¬cant uphill excursion.
In 1953, Metropolis and coworkers [5] ï¬rst incorporated these kinds of prin-
ciples into numerical calculations.
Offered a succession of options, a simulated
thermodynamic system was assumed to change its conï¬guration from energy E1 to
energy E2 with probability p = exp[â(E2 âE1)/kT]. Notice that if E2 < E1, this
probability is greater than unity; in such cases the change is arbitrarily assigned a
probability p = 1, i.e., the system always took such an option. This general scheme,
of always taking a downhill step while sometimes taking an uphill step, has come
to be known as the Metropolis algorithm.
To make use of the Metropolisalgorithm for other than thermodynamic systems,
one must provide the following elements:
1. A description of possible system conï¬gurations.
2. A generator of random changes in the conï¬guration; these changes are the
âoptionsâ presented to the system.
3.
An objective function E (analog of energy) whose minimization is the
goal of the procedure.
4. A control parameter T (analog of temperature) and an annealing schedule
which tells how it is lowered from high to low values, e.g., after how many random
changes in conï¬guration is each downward step in T taken, and how large is that
step. The meaning of âhighâ and âlowâ in this context, and the assignment of a
schedule, may require physical insight and/or trial-and-error experiments.
Combinatorial Minimization: The Traveling Salesman
A concrete illustration is provided by the traveling salesman problem. The
proverbial seller visits N cities with given positions (xi, yi), returning ï¬nally to his
or her city of origin. Each city is to be visited onlyonce, and the route is to be made as
short as possible. This problem belongs to a class known as NP-complete problems,
whose computation time for an exact solution increases with N as exp(const. Ã N),
becoming rapidlyprohibitivein cost as N increases. The travelingsalesman problem
also belongs to a class of minimization problems for which the objective function E

has many local minima. In practical cases, it is often enough to be able to choose
from these a minimum which, even if not absolute, cannot be signiï¬cantly improved
upon. The annealing method manages to achieve this, while limiting its calculations
to scale as a small power of N.
As a problem in simulated annealing, the traveling salesman problem is handled
as follows:
1. Conï¬guration. The cities are numbered i = 1 . . .N and each has coordinates
(xi, yi). A conï¬guration is a permutation of the number 1 . . .N, interpreted as the
order in which the cities are visited.
2. Rearrangements. An efï¬cient set of moves has been suggested by Lin [6].
The moves consist of two types: (a) A section of path is removed and then replaced
with the same cities running in the opposite order; or (b) a section of path is removed
and then replaced in between two cities on another, randomly chosen, part of the path.
3. Objective Function. In the simplest form of the problem, E is taken just
as the total length of journey,
E = L â¡
N
X
i=1
p
(xi âxi+1)2 + (yi âyi+1)2
(10.9.2)
with the convention that point N + 1 is identiï¬ed with point 1. To illustrate the
ï¬exibility of the method, however, we can add the following additional wrinkle:
Suppose that the salesman has an irrational fear of ï¬ying over the Mississippi River.
In that case, we would assign each city a parameter Âµi, equal to +1 if it is east of the
Mississippi, â1 if it is west, and take the objective function to be
E =
N
X
i=1
hp
(xi âxi+1)2 + (yi âyi+1)2 + Î»(Âµi âÂµi+1)2i
(10.9.3)
A penalty 4Î» is thereby assigned to any river crossing. The algorithm now ï¬nds
the shortest path that avoids crossings. The relative importance that it assigns to
length of path versus river crossings is determined by our choice of Î». Figure 10.9.1
shows the results obtained. Clearly, this technique can be generalized to include
many conï¬icting goals in the minimization.
4. Annealing schedule. This requires experimentation. We ï¬rst generate some
random rearrangements, and use them to determine the range of values of âE that
will be encountered from move to move. Choosing a starting value for the parameter
T which is considerably larger than the largest âE normally encountered, we
proceed downward in multiplicative steps each amounting to a 10 percent decrease
in T. We hold each new value of T constant for, say, 100N reconï¬gurations, or for
10N successful reconï¬gurations, whichever comes ï¬rst. When efforts to reduce E
further become sufï¬ciently discouraging, we stop.
The following traveling salesman program, using the Metropolis algorithm,
illustrates the main aspects of the simulated annealing technique for combinatorial
problems.

Continuous Minimization by Simulated Annealing
The basic ideas of simulated annealing are also applicable to optimization
problems with continuous N-dimensional control spaces, e.g., ï¬nding the (ideally,
global) minimum of some function f(x), in the presence of many local minima,
where x is an N-dimensional vector. The four elements required by the Metropolis
procedure are now as follows: The value of f is the objective function.
The
system state is the point x. The control parameter T is, as before, something like a
temperature, with an annealing schedule by which it is gradually reduced. And there
must be a generator of random changes in the conï¬guration, that is, a procedure for
taking a random step from x to x + âx.
The last of these elements is the most problematical. The literature to date [7-10]
describes several different schemes for choosing âx, none of which, in our view,
inspire complete conï¬dence.
The problem is one of efï¬ciency: A generator of
random changes is inefï¬cient if, when local downhill moves exist, it nevertheless
almost always proposes an uphill move. A good generator, we think, should not
become inefï¬cient in narrow valleys; nor should it become more and more inefï¬cient
as convergence to a minimum is approached.
Except possibly for [7], all of the
schemes that we have seen are inefï¬cient in one or both of these situations.
Our own way of doing simulated annealing minimization on continuous control
spaces is to use a modiï¬cation of the downhill simplex method (Â§10.4). This amounts
to replacing the single point x as a description of the system state by a simplex of
N + 1 points. The âmovesâ are the same as described in Â§10.4, namely reï¬ections,
expansions, and contractions of the simplex. The implementation of the Metropolis
procedure is slightly subtle: We add a positive, logarithmically distributed random
variable, proportional to the temperature T, to the stored function value associated
with every vertex of the simplex, and we subtract a similar random variable from
the function value of every new point that is tried as a replacement point. Like the
ordinary Metropolis procedure, this method always accepts a true downhill step, but

sometimes accepts an uphill one. In the limit T â0, this algorithm reduces exactly
to the downhill simplex method and converges to a local minimum.
At a ï¬nite value of T, the simplex expands to a scale that approximates the size
of the region that can be reached at this temperature, and then executes a stochastic,
tumbling Brownian motionwithinthat region, sampling new, approximately random,
points as it does so. The efï¬ciency with which a region is explored is independent
of its narrowness (for an ellipsoidal valley, the ratio of its principal axes) and
orientation. If the temperature is reduced sufï¬ciently slowly, it becomes highly
likely that the simplex will shrink into that region containing the lowest relative
minimum encountered.
As in all applications of simulated annealing, there can be quite a lot of
problem-dependent subtlety in the phrase âsufï¬ciently slowlyâ; success or failure
is quite often determined by the choice of annealing schedule.
Here are some
possibilities worth trying:
â¢ Reduce T to (1 âÏµ)T after every m moves, where Ïµ/m is determined
by experiment.
â¢ Budget a total of K moves, and reduce T after every m moves to a value
T = T0(1 âk/K)Î±, where k is the cumulative number of moves thus far,
and Î± is a constant, say 1, 2, or 4. The optimal value for Î± depends on the
statistical distribution of relative minima of various depths. Larger values
of Î± spend more iterations at lower temperature.
â¢ Afterevery m moves, set T to Î² times f1âfb, where Î² is an experimentally
determined constant of order 1, f1 is the smallest function value currently
represented in the simplex, and fb is the best function ever encountered.
However, never reduce T by more than some fraction Î³ at a time.
Another strategic question is whether to do an occasional restart, where a vertex
of the simplex is discarded in favor of the âbest-everâ point. (You must be sure that
the best-ever point is not currently in the simplex when you do this!) We have found
problems for which restarts â every time the temperature has decreased by a factor
of 3, say â are highly beneï¬cial; we have found other problems for which restarts
have no positive, or a somewhat negative, effect.

will be. The method has several extremely attractive features, rather unique when
compared with other optimization techniques.
First, it is not âgreedy,â in the sense that it is not easily fooled by the quick
payoff achieved by falling into unfavorable local minima. Provided that sufï¬ciently
general reconï¬gurations are given, it wanders freely among local minima of depth
less than about T. As T is lowered, the number of such minima qualifying for
frequent visits is gradually reduced.
Second, conï¬guration decisions tend to proceed in a logical order. Changes
that cause the greatest energy differences are sifted over when the control parameter
T is large. These decisions become more permanent as T is lowered, and attention
then shifts more to smaller reï¬nements in the solution. For example, in the traveling
salesman problem with the Mississippi River twist, if Î» is large, a decision to cross
the Mississippi only twice is made at high T, while the speciï¬c routes on each side
of the river are determined only at later stages.
The analogies to thermodynamics may be pursued to a greater extent than we
have done here. Quantities analogous to speciï¬c heat and entropy may be deï¬ned,
and these can be useful in monitoring the progress of the algorithm towards an
acceptable solution. Information on this subject is found in [1].

Eigensystems
11.0 Introduction
An N Ã N matrix A is said to have an eigenvector x and corresponding
eigenvalue Î» if
A Â· x = Î»x
(11.0.1)
Obviously any multiple of an eigenvector x will also be an eigenvector, but we
wonât consider such multiples as being distinct eigenvectors. (The zero vector is not
considered to be an eigenvector at all.) Evidently (11.0.1) can hold only if
det |A âÎ»1| = 0
(11.0.2)
which, if expanded out, is an Nth degree polynomial in Î» whose roots are the eigen-
values. This proves that there are always N (not necessarily distinct) eigenvalues.
Equal eigenvalues coming from multiple roots are called degenerate. Root-searching
in the characteristic equation (11.0.2) is usually a very poor computational method
for ï¬nding eigenvalues. We will learn much better ways in this chapter, as well as
efï¬cient ways for ï¬nding corresponding eigenvectors.
The above two equations also prove that every one of the N eigenvalues has
a (not necessarily distinct) corresponding eigenvector: If Î» is set to an eigenvalue,
then the matrix A âÎ»1 is singular, and we know that every singular matrix has at
least one nonzero vector in its nullspace (see Â§2.6 on singular value decomposition).
If you add Ïx to both sides of (11.0.1), you will easily see that the eigenvalues
of any matrix can be changed or shifted by an additive constant Ï by adding to
the matrix that constant times the identity matrix. The eigenvectors are unchanged
by this shift.
Shifting, as we will see, is an important part of many algorithms
for computing eigenvalues. We see also that there is no special signiï¬cance to a
zero eigenvalue. Any eigenvalue can be shifted to zero, or any zero eigenvalue
can be shifted away from zero.

A matrix is called symmetric if it is equal to its transpose,
A = AT
or
aij = aji
(11.0.3)
It is called Hermitianor self-adjointif it equals the complex-conjugate of itstranspose
(its Hermitian conjugate, denoted by ââ â)
A = Aâ 
or
aij = aji*
(11.0.4)
It is termed orthogonal if its transpose equals its inverse,
AT Â· A = A Â· AT = 1
(11.0.5)
and unitary if its Hermitian conjugate equals its inverse. Finally, a matrix is called
normal if it commutes with its Hermitian conjugate,
A Â· Aâ  = Aâ  Â· A
(11.0.6)
For real matrices, Hermitian means the same as symmetric, unitary means the
same as orthogonal, and both of these distinct classes are normal.
The reason that âHermitianâ is an important concept has to do with eigenvalues.
The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are all real. In particular, the eigenvalues
of a real symmetric matrix are all real.
Contrariwise, the eigenvalues of a real
nonsymmetric matrix may include real values, but may also include pairs of complex
conjugate values; and the eigenvalues of a complex matrix that is not Hermitian
will in general be complex.
The reason that ânormalâ is an important concept has to do with the eigen-
vectors.
The eigenvectors of a normal matrix with nondegenerate (i.e., distinct)
eigenvalues are complete and orthogonal, spanning the N-dimensional vector space.
For a normal matrix with degenerate eigenvalues, we have the additional freedom of
replacing the eigenvectors corresponding to a degenerate eigenvalue by linear com-
binations of themselves. Using this freedom, we can always perform Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization (consult any linear algebra text) and ï¬nd a set of eigenvectors that
are complete and orthogonal, just as in the nondegenerate case. The matrix whose
columns are an orthonormal set of eigenvectors is evidently unitary. A special case
is that the matrix of eigenvectors of a real, symmetric matrix is orthogonal, since
the eigenvectors of that matrix are all real.
When a matrix is not normal, as typiï¬ed by any random, nonsymmetric, real
matrix, then in general we cannot ï¬nd any orthonormal set of eigenvectors, nor even
any pairs of eigenvectors that are orthogonal (except perhaps by rare chance). While
the N non-orthonormal eigenvectors will âusuallyâ span the N-dimensional vector
space, they do not always do so; that is, the eigenvectors are not always complete.
Such a matrix is said to be defective.

Left and Right Eigenvectors
While the eigenvectors of a non-normal matrix are not particularly orthogonal
among themselves, they do have an orthogonality relation with a different set of
vectors, which we must now deï¬ne. Up to now our eigenvectors have been column
vectors that are multiplied to the right of a matrix A, as in (11.0.1). These, more
explicitly, are termed right eigenvectors. We could also, however, try to ï¬nd row
vectors, which multiply A to the left and satisfy
x Â· A = Î»x
(11.0.7)
These are called left eigenvectors. By taking the transpose of equation (11.0.7), we
see that every left eigenvector is the transpose of a right eigenvector of the transpose
of A. Now by comparing to (11.0.2), and using the fact that the determinant of a
matrix equals the determinant of its transpose, we also see that the left and right
eigenvalues of A are identical.
If the matrix A is symmetric, then the left and right eigenvectors are just
transposes of each other, that is, have the same numerical values as components.
Likewise, if the matrix is self-adjoint, the left and right eigenvectors are Hermitian
conjugates of each other. For the general nonnormal case, however, we have the
following calculation: Let XR be the matrix formed by columns from the right
eigenvectors, and XL be the matrix formed by rows from the left eigenvectors. Then
(11.0.1) and (11.0.7) can be rewritten as
A Â· XR = XR Â· diag(Î»1 . . .Î»N)
XL Â· A = diag(Î»1 . . .Î»N) Â· XL
(11.0.8)
Multiplying the ï¬rst of these equations on the left by XL, the second on the right
by XR, and subtracting the two, gives
(XL Â· XR) Â· diag(Î»1 . . . Î»N) = diag(Î»1 . . . Î»N) Â· (XL Â· XR)
(11.0.9)
This says that the matrix of dot products of the left and right eigenvectors commutes
with the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. But the only matrices that commute with a
diagonal matrix of distinct elements are themselves diagonal. Thus, if the eigenvalues
are nondegenerate, each left eigenvector is orthogonal to all right eigenvectors except
its corresponding one, and vice versa. By choice of normalization, the dot products
of corresponding left and right eigenvectors can always be made unity for any matrix
with nondegenerate eigenvalues.
If some eigenvalues are degenerate, then either the left or the right eigenvec-
tors corresponding to a degenerate eigenvalue must be linearly combined among
themselves to achieve orthogonality with the right or left ones, respectively. This
can always be done by a procedure akin to Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The
normalization can then be adjusted to give unity for the nonzero dot productsbetween
corresponding left and right eigenvectors. If the dot product of correspondingleft and
right eigenvectors is zero at this stage, then you have a case where the eigenvectors
are incomplete! Note that incomplete eigenvectors can occur only where there are
degenerate eigenvalues, but do not always occur in such cases (in fact, never occur
for the class of ânormalâ matrices). See [1] for a clear discussion.

In both the degenerate and nondegenerate cases, the ï¬nal normalization to
unity of all nonzero dot products produces the result: The matrix whose rows
are left eigenvectors is the inverse matrix of the matrix whose columns are right
eigenvectors, if the inverse exists.
Diagonalization of a Matrix
Multiplying the ï¬rst equation in (11.0.8) by XL, and using the fact that XL
and XR are matrix inverses, we get
Xâ1
R Â· A Â· XR = diag(Î»1 . . .Î»N)
(11.0.10)
This is a particular case of a similarity transform of the matrix A,
A
â
Zâ1 Â· A Â· Z
(11.0.11)
for some transformation matrix Z. Similarity transformations play a crucial role
in the computation of eigenvalues, because they leave the eigenvalues of a matrix
unchanged.
This is easily seen from
det
Zâ1 Â· A Â· Z âÎ»1
 = det
Zâ1 Â· (A âÎ»1) Â· Z

= det |Z| det |A âÎ»1| det
Zâ1
= det |A âÎ»1|
(11.0.12)
Equation (11.0.10) shows that any matrix withcomplete eigenvectors (which includes
all normal matrices and âmostâ random nonnormal ones) can be diagonalized by a
similarity transformation, that the columns of the transformation matrix that effects
the diagonalization are the right eigenvectors, and that the rows of its inverse are
the left eigenvectors.
For real, symmetric matrices, the eigenvectors are real and orthonormal, so the
transformation matrix is orthogonal. The similarity transformation is then also an
orthogonal transformation of the form
A
â
ZT Â· A Â· Z
(11.0.13)
While real nonsymmetric matrices can be diagonalizedin theirusual case of complete
eigenvectors, the transformation matrix is not necessarily real. It turns out, however,
that a real similarity transformation can âalmostâ do the job.
It can reduce the
matrix down to a form with little two-by-two blocks along the diagonal, all other
elements zero. Each two-by-two block corresponds to a complex-conjugate pair
of complex eigenvalues. We will see this idea exploited in some routines given
later in the chapter.
The âgrand strategyâ of virtually all modern eigensystem routines is to nudge
the matrix A towards diagonal form by a sequence of similarity transformations,

If we get all the way to diagonal form, then the eigenvectors are the columns of
the accumulated transformation
XR = P1 Â· P2 Â· P3 Â· . . .
(11.0.15)
Sometimes we do not want to go all the way to diagonal form. For example, if
we are interested only in eigenvalues, not eigenvectors, it is enough to transform
the matrix A to be triangular, with all elements below (or above) the diagonal zero.
In this case the diagonal elements are already the eigenvalues, as you can see by
mentally evaluating (11.0.2) using expansion by minors.
There are two rather different sets of techniques for implementing the grand
strategy (11.0.14). It turns out that they work rather well in combination, so most
modern eigensystem routines use both. The ï¬rst set of techniques constructs individ-
ual Piâs as explicit âatomicâ transformations designed to perform speciï¬c tasks, for
example zeroing a particular off-diagonal element (Jacobi transformation, Â§11.1), or
a whole particular row or column (Householder transformation, Â§11.2; elimination
method, Â§11.5). In general, a ï¬nite sequence of these simple transformations cannot
completely diagonalize a matrix. There are then two choices: either use the ï¬nite
sequence of transformations to go most of the way (e.g., to some special form like
tridiagonalor Hessenberg, see Â§11.2 and Â§11.5 below) and follow up with the second
set of techniques about to be mentioned; or else iterate the ï¬nite sequence of simple
transformations over and over until the deviation of the matrix from diagonal is
negligibly small. This latter approach is conceptually simplest, so we will discuss
it in the next section; however, for N greater than â¼10, it is computationally
inefï¬cient by a roughly constant factor â¼5.
The second set of techniques, called factorization methods, is more subtle.
Suppose that the matrix A can be factored into a left factor FL and a right factor
FR.
Then
A = FL Â· FR
or equivalently
Fâ1
L Â· A = FR
(11.0.16)
If we now multiply back together the factors in the reverse order, and use the second
equation in (11.0.16) we get
FR Â· FL = Fâ1
L Â· A Â· FL
(11.0.17)
which we recognize as having effected a similarity transformation on A with the
transformation matrix being FL! In Â§11.3 and Â§11.6 we will discuss the QR method
which exploits this idea.
Factorization methods also do not converge exactly in a ï¬nite number of
transformations. But the better ones do converge rapidly and reliably, and, when
following an appropriate initial reduction by simple similarity transformations, they
are the methods of choice.

âEigenpackages of Canned Eigenroutinesâ
You have probably gathered by now that the solution of eigensystems is a fairly
complicated business. It is. It is one of the few subjects covered in this book for
which we do not recommend that you avoid canned routines. On the contrary, the
purpose of this chapter is precisely to give you some appreciation of what is going
on inside such canned routines, so that you can make intelligent choices about using
them, and intelligent diagnoses when something goes wrong.
You will ï¬nd that almost all canned routinesin use nowadays trace theirancestry
back to routines published in Wilkinson and Reinschâs Handbook for Automatic
Computation,Vol. II, Linear Algebra [2]. This excellent reference, containing papers
by a number of authors, is the Bible of the ï¬eld. A public-domain implementation
of the Handbook routines in FORTRAN is the EISPACK set of programs [3]. The
routines in this chapter are translations of either the Handbook or EISPACK routines,
so understanding these will take you a lot of the way towards understanding those
canonical packages.
IMSL [4] and NAG [5] each provide proprietary implementations, in FORTRAN,
of what are essentially the Handbook routines.
A goodâeigenpackageâ will provideseparate routines, or separate paths through
sequences of routines, for the following desired calculations:
â¢ all eigenvalues and no eigenvectors
â¢ all eigenvalues and some corresponding eigenvectors
â¢ all eigenvalues and all corresponding eigenvectors
The purpose of these distinctions is to save compute time and storage; it is wasteful
to calculate eigenvectors that you donât need.
Often one is interested only in
the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest few eigenvalues, or largest few in
magnitude, or few that are negative. The method usually used to calculate âsomeâ
eigenvectors is typically more efï¬cient than calculating all eigenvectors if you desire
fewer than about a quarter of the eigenvectors.
A good eigenpackage also provides separate paths for each of the above
calculations for each of the following special forms of the matrix:
â¢ real, symmetric, tridiagonal
â¢ real, symmetric, banded (only a small number of sub- and superdiagonals
are nonzero)
â¢ real, symmetric
â¢ real, nonsymmetric
â¢ complex, Hermitian
â¢ complex, non-Hermitian
Again, the purpose of these distinctions is to save time and storage by using the least
general routine that will serve in any particular application.
In this chapter, as a bare introduction, we give good routines for the following
paths:
â¢ all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real, symmetric, tridiagonal matrix
(Â§11.3)
â¢ all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real, symmetric, matrix(Â§11.1âÂ§11.3)
â¢ all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a complex,
Hermitian matrix
(Â§11.4)
â¢ all eigenvalues and no eigenvectors of a real, nonsymmetric matrix

(Â§11.5âÂ§11.6)
We also discuss, in Â§11.7, how to obtain some eigenvectors of nonsymmetric
matrices by the method of inverse iteration.
Generalized and Nonlinear Eigenvalue Problems
Many eigenpackages also deal with the so-called generalized eigenproblem, [6]
A Â· x = Î»B Â· x
(11.0.18)
where A and B are both matrices. Most such problems, where B is nonsingular,
can be handled by the equivalent
(Bâ1 Â· A) Â· x = Î»x
(11.0.19)
Often A and B are symmetric and B is positive deï¬nite. The matrix Bâ1 Â· A in
(11.0.19) is not symmetric, but we can recover a symmetric eigenvalue problem
by using the Cholesky decomposition B = L Â· LT of Â§2.9. Multiplying equation
(11.0.18) by Lâ1, we get
C Â· (LT Â· x) = Î»(LT Â· x)
(11.0.20)
where
C = Lâ1 Â· A Â· (Lâ1)T
(11.0.21)
The matrix C is symmetric and its eigenvalues are the same as those of the original
problem (11.0.18); its eigenfunctions are LT Â· x. The efï¬cient way to form C is
ï¬rst to solve the equation
Y Â· LT = A
(11.0.22)
for the lower triangle of the matrix Y. Then solve
L Â· C = Y
(11.0.23)
for the lower triangle of the symmetric matrix C.
Another generalization of the standard eigenvalue problem is to problems
nonlinear in the eigenvalue Î», for example,
(AÎ»2 + BÎ» + C) Â· x = 0
(11.0.24)
This can be turned into a linear problem by introducing an additional unknown
eigenvector y and solving the 2N Ã 2N eigensystem,

0

âAâ1 Â· C
âAâ1 Â· B

Â·


y

= Î»


(11.0.25)
This technique generalizes to higher-order polynomials in Î». A polynomial of degree
M produces a linear MN Ã MN eigensystem (see [7]).

11.1 Jacobi Transformations of a Symmetric
Matrix
The Jacobi method consists of a sequence of orthogonal similarity transforma-
tions of the form of equation (11.0.14). Each transformation (a Jacobi rotation) is
just a plane rotation designed to annihilate one of the off-diagonal matrix elements.
Successive transformations undo previously set zeros, but the off-diagonal elements
nevertheless get smaller and smaller, until the matrix is diagonal to machine preci-
sion. Accumulating the product of the transformations as you go gives the matrix
of eigenvectors, equation (11.0.15), while the elements of the ï¬nal diagonal matrix
are the eigenvalues.
The Jacobi method is absolutely foolproof for all real symmetric matrices. For
matrices of order greater than about 10, say, the algorithm is slower, by a signiï¬cant
constant factor, than the QR method we shall give in Â§11.3. However, the Jacobi
algorithm is much simpler than the more efï¬cient methods. We thus recommend it
for matrices of moderate order, where expense is not a major consideration.

Multiplying out equation (11.1.2) and using the symmetry of A, we get the explicit
formulas
aâ²
rp = carp âsarq
aâ²
rq = carq + sarp

qq = s2app + c2aqq + 2scapq

aâ²
pq = (c2 âs2)apq + sc(app âaqq)
(11.1.7)
The idea of the Jacobi method is to try to zero the off-diagonal elements by a
series of plane rotations. Accordingly, to set aâ²
pq = 0, equation (11.1.7) gives the
following expression for the rotation angle Ï
Î¸ â¡cot 2Ï â¡c2 âs2
2sc
= aqq âapp

(11.1.8)
If we let t â¡s/c, the deï¬nition of Î¸ can be rewritten
t2 + 2tÎ¸ â1 = 0
(11.1.9)
The smaller root of this equation corresponds to a rotation angle less than Ï/4
in magnitude; this choice at each stage gives the most stable reduction. Using the
form of the quadratic formula with the discriminant in the denominator, we can
write this smaller root as
t =
sgn(Î¸)
|Î¸| +

Î¸2 + 1

If Î¸ is so large that Î¸2 would overï¬ow on the computer, we set t = 1/(2Î¸). It
now follows that

When we actually use equations (11.1.4)â(11.1.7) numerically, we rewrite them
to minimize roundoff error. Equation (11.1.7) is replaced by
aâ²
pq = 0
(11.1.13)
The idea in the remaining equations is to set the new quantity equal to the old
quantity plus a small correction. Thus we can use (11.1.7) and (11.1.13) to eliminate
aqq from (11.1.5), giving
aâ²
pp = app âtapq
(11.1.14)
Similarly,

qq = aqq + tapq

(11.1.16)

One can see the convergence of the Jacobi method by considering the sum of
the squares of the off-diagonal elements
S =

(11.1.19)
Equations (11.1.4)â(11.1.7) imply that
Sâ² = S â2|apq|2
(11.1.20)
(Since the transformation is orthogonal, the sum of the squares of the diagonal
elements increases correspondingly by 2|apq|2.) The sequence of Sâs thus decreases
monotonically. Since the sequence is bounded below by zero, and since we can
choose apq to be whatever element we want, the sequence can be made to converge
to zero.
Eventually one obtains a matrix D that is diagonal to machine precision. The
diagonal elements give the eigenvalues of the original matrix A, since
D = VT Â· A Â· V

at each stage of calculation, where initially V is the identity matrix.

(11.1.24)
We rewrite these equations in terms of Ï as in equations (11.1.16) and (11.1.17)
to minimize roundoff.
The only remaining question is the strategy one should adopt for the order in
which the elements are to be annihilated. Jacobiâsoriginal algorithmof 1846searched
the whole upper triangle at each stage and set the largest off-diagonal element to zero.
This is a reasonable strategy for hand calculation, but it is prohibitive on a computer
since the search alone makes each Jacobi rotationa process of order N 2 instead of N.
A better strategy for our purposes is the cyclic Jacobi method, where one
annihilates elements in strict order. For example, one can simply proceed down
the rows: P12, P13, ..., P1n; then P23, P24, etc.
One can show that convergence
is generally quadratic for both the original or the cyclic Jacobi methods, for
nondegenerate eigenvalues. One such set of n(n â1)/2 Jacobi rotations is called
a sweep.
The program below, based on the implementations in [1,2], uses two further
reï¬nements:
â¢ In the ï¬rst three sweeps, we carry out the pq rotation only if |apq| > Ïµ
for some threshold value
Ïµ = 1

(11.1.26)
â¢ After four sweeps, if |apq| âª|app| and |apq| âª|aqq|, we set |apq| = 0
and skip the rotation. The criterion used in the comparison is |apq| <
10â(D+2)|app|, where D is the number of signiï¬cant decimal digits on the
machine, and similarly for |aqq|.

In the following routine the nÃn symmetric matrix a is stored as a[1..n]
[1..n]. On output, the superdiagonal elements of a are destroyed, but the diagonal
and subdiagonal are unchanged and give full information on the original symmetric
matrix a. The vector d[1..n] returns the eigenvalues of a. During the computation,
it contains the current diagonal of a.
The matrix v[1..n][1..n] outputs the
normalized eigenvector belonging to d[k] in its kth column. The parameter nrot is
the number of Jacobi rotations that were needed to achieve convergence.
Typical matrices require 6 to 10 sweeps to achieve convergence, or 3n2 to
5n2 Jacobi rotations. Each rotation requires of order 4n operations, each consisting
of a multiply and an add, so the total labor is of order 12n3 to 20n3 operations.
Calculation of the eigenvectors as well as the eigenvalues changes the operation
count from 4n to 6n per rotation, which is only a 50 percent overhead.

a. nrot returns the number of Jacobi rotations that were required.

the columns of v correspondingly. The method is straight insertion.

11.2 Reduction of a Symmetric Matrix
to Tridiagonal Form: Givens and
Householder Reductions
As already mentioned, the optimum strategy for ï¬nding eigenvalues and
eigenvectors is, ï¬rst, to reduce the matrix to a simple form, only then beginning an
iterative procedure. For symmetric matrices, the preferred simple form is tridiagonal.
The Givens reduction is a modiï¬cation of the Jacobi method. Instead of trying to
reduce the matrix all the way to diagonal form, we are content to stop when the
matrix is tridiagonal. This allows the procedure to be carried out in a ï¬nite number
of steps, unlike the Jacobi method, which requires iteration to convergence.
Givens Method
For the Givens method, we choose the rotation angle in equation (11.1.1) so
as to zero an element that is not at one of the four âcorners,â i.e., not app, apq,
or aqq in equation (11.1.3).
Speciï¬cally, we ï¬rst choose P23 to annihilate a31
(and, by symmetry, a13). Then we choose P24 to annihilate a41. In general, we
choose the sequence
P23, P24, . . ., P2n; P34, . . ., P3n; . . . ; Pnâ1,n
where Pjk annihilates ak,jâ1. The method works because elements such as aâ²
rp and
aâ²
rq, with r Ì¸= p r Ì¸= q, are linear combinations of the old quantities arp and arq, by

equation (11.1.4). Thus, if arp and arq have already been set to zero, they remain
zero as the reduction proceeds.
Evidently, of order n2/2 rotations are required,
and the number of multiplications in a straightforward implementation is of order
4n3/3, not counting those for keeping track of the product of the transformation
matrices, required for the eigenvectors.
The Householder method, to be discussed next, is just as stable as the Givens
reduction and it is a factor of 2 more efï¬cient, so the Givens method is not generally
used. Recent work (see [1]) has shown that the Givens reduction can be reformulated
to reduce the number of operations by a factor of 2, and also avoid the necessity
of taking square roots. This appears to make the algorithm competitive with the
Householder reduction. However, this âfast Givensâ reduction has to be monitored
to avoid overï¬ows, and the variables have to be periodically rescaled. There does
not seem to be any compelling reason to prefer the Givens reduction over the
Householder method.
Householder Method
The Householder algorithm reduces an nÃn symmetric matrix A to tridiagonal
form by n â2 orthogonal transformations.
Each transformation annihilates the
required part of a whole column and whole corresponding row. The basic ingredient
is a Householder matrix P, which has the form
P = 1 â2w Â· wT
(11.2.1)
where w is a real vector with |w|2 = 1. (In the present notation, the outer or matrix
product of two vectors, a and b is written a Â· bT , while the inner or scalar product of
the vectors is written as aT Â· b.) The matrix P is orthogonal, because
P2 = (1 â2w Â· wT ) Â· (1 â2w Â· wT )
= 1 â4w Â· wT + 4w Â· (wT Â· w) Â· wT
= 1
(11.2.2)
Therefore P = Pâ1. But PT = P, and so PT = Pâ1, proving orthogonality.
Rewrite P as
P =1 âu Â· uT
H
(11.2.3)
where the scalar H is
H â¡1
2 |u|2
(11.2.4)
and u can now be any vector.
Suppose x is the vector composed of the ï¬rst
column of A.
Choose
u = x â|x|e1

The identity block in the upper left corner insures that the tridiagonalizationachieved
in the ï¬rst step will not be spoiled by this one, while the (n â2)-dimensional
Householder matrix (nâ2)P2 creates one additionalrow and column of the tridiagonal
output. Clearly, a sequence of n â2 such transformations will reduce the matrix
A to tridiagonal form.
Instead of actually carrying out the matrix multiplications in P Â· A Â· P, we
compute a vector
p â¡A Â· u
H
(11.2.10)
Then
A Â· P = A Â· (1 âu Â· uT
H
) = A âp Â· uT
Aâ² = P Â· A Â· P = A âp Â· uT âu Â· pT + 2Ku Â· uT
where the scalar K is deï¬ned by
K = uT Â· p
2H
(11.2.11)
If we write
q â¡p âKu
(11.2.12)
then we have
Aâ² = A âq Â· uT âu Â· qT
(11.2.13)
This is the computationally useful formula.
Following [2], the routine for Householder reduction given below actually starts
in the nth column of A, not the ï¬rst as in the explanation above. In detail, the
equations are as follows: At stage m (m = 1, 2, . . ., nâ2) the vector u has the form
uT = [ai1, ai2, . . ., ai,iâ2, ai,iâ1 Â± âÏ, 0, . . ., 0]
(11.2.14)
Here
i â¡n âm + 1 = n, n â1, . . ., 3
(11.2.15)
and the quantity Ï (|x|2 in our earlier notation) is
Ï = (ai1)2 + Â· Â· Â· + (ai,iâ1)2
(11.2.16)
We choose the sign of Ï in (11.2.14) to be the same as the sign of ai,iâ1 to lessen
roundoff error.

Variables are thus computed in the following order: Ï, u, H, p, K, q, Aâ². At any
stage m, A is tridiagonal in its last m â1 rows and columns.
If the eigenvectors of the ï¬nal tridiagonal matrix are found (for example, by the
routine in the next section), then the eigenvectors of A can be obtained by applying
the accumulated transformation
Q = P1 Â· P2 Â· Â· Â·Pnâ2
(11.2.17)
to those eigenvectors.
We therefore form Q by recursion after all the Pâs have
been determined:
Qnâ2 = Pnâ2
Qj = Pj Â· Qj+1,
j = n â3, . . ., 1
Q = Q1
(11.2.18)
Input for the routine below is the real, symmetric matrix a[1..n][1..n]. On
output, a contains the elements of the orthogonal matrix q. The vector d[1..n] is
set to the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix Aâ², while the vector e[1..n]
is set to the off-diagonal elements in its components 2 through n, with e[1]=0.
Note that since a is overwritten, you should copy it before calling the routine, if it
is required for subsequent computations.
No extra storage arrays are needed for the intermediate results. At stage m, the
vectors p and q are nonzero only in elements 1, . . ., i (recall that i = n âm + 1),
while u is nonzero only in elements 1, . . ., i â1. The elements of the vector e are
being determined in the order n, n â1, . . ., so we can store p in the elements of e
not already determined. The vector q can overwrite p once p is no longer needed.
We store u in the ith row of a and u/H in the ith column of a. Once the reduction
is complete, we compute the matrices Qj using the quantities u and u/H that have
been stored in a. Since Qj is an identity matrix in the last n âj + 1 rows and
columns, we only need compute its elements up to row and column n âj. These
can overwrite the uâs and u/Hâs in the corresponding rows and columns of a, which
are no longer required for subsequent Qâs.
The routinetred2, given below, includes one further reï¬nement. If the quantity
Ï is zero or âsmallâ at any stage, one can skip the corresponding transformation.
A simple criterion, such as
Ï < smallest positive number representable on machine
machine precision
would be ï¬ne most of the time. A more careful criterion is actually used. Deï¬ne
the quantity
Ïµ =
iâ1
X
k=1
|aik|
(11.2.19)
If Ïµ = 0 to machine precision, we skip the transformation. Otherwise we redeï¬ne
aik
becomes
aik/Ïµ

and use the scaled variables for the transformation. (A Householder transformation
depends only on the ratios of the elements.)
Note that when dealing with a matrix whose elements vary over many orders
of magnitude, it is important that the matrix be permuted, insofar as possible, so that
the smaller elements are in the top left-hand corner. This is because the reduction
is performed starting from the bottom right-hand corner, and a mixture of small and
large elements there can lead to considerable rounding errors.
The routine tred2 is designed for use with the routine tqli of the next section.
tqli ï¬nds the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric, tridiagonal matrix.
The combination of tred2 and tqli is the most efï¬cient known technique for
ï¬nding all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (or just all the eigenvalues) of a real,
symmetric matrix.
In the listing below, the statements indicated by comments are required only for
subsequent computation of eigenvectors. If only eigenvalues are required, omission
of the commented statements speeds up the execution time of tred2 by a factor of 2
for large n. In the limit of large n, the operation count of the Householder reduction
is 2n3/3 for eigenvalues only, and 4n3/3 for both eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

case a contains no useful information on output. Otherwise they are to be included.

Sturmian sequence that can be used to localize the eigenvalues to intervals on the
real axis. A root-ï¬nding method such as bisection or Newtonâs method can then
be employed to reï¬ne the intervals. The corresponding eigenvectors can then be
found by inverse iteration (see Â§11.7).
Procedures based on these ideas can be found in [2,3].
If, however, more
than a small fraction of all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are required, then the
factorization method next considered is much more efï¬cient.
The QR and QL Algorithms
The basic idea behind the QR algorithm is that any real matrix can be
decomposed in the form
A = Q Â· R
(11.3.1)
where Q is orthogonal and R is upper triangular.
For a general matrix, the
decomposition is constructed by applying Householder transformations to annihilate
successive columns of A below the diagonal (see Â§2.10).
Now consider the matrix formed by writing the factors in (11.3.1) in the
opposite order:
Aâ² = R Â· Q
(11.3.2)
Since Q is orthogonal, equation (11.3.1) gives R = QT Â· A. Thus equation (11.3.2)
becomes
Aâ² = QT Â· A Â· Q
(11.3.3)
We see that Aâ² is an orthogonal transformation of A.
You can verify that a QR transformation preserves the following properties of
a matrix: symmetry, tridiagonal form, and Hessenberg form (to be deï¬ned in Â§11.5).
There is nothing special about choosing one of the factors of A to be upper
triangular; one could equally well make it lower triangular. This is called the QL
algorithm, since
A = Q Â· L
(11.3.4)
where L is lower triangular. (The standard, but confusing, nomenclature R and L
stands for whether the right or left of the matrix is nonzero.)
Recall that in the Householder reduction to tridiagonal form in Â§11.2, we started
in the nth (last) column of the original matrix. To minimize roundoff, we then
exhorted you to put the biggest elements of the matrix in the lower right-hand
corner, if you can. If we now wish to diagonalize the resulting tridiagonal matrix,
the QL algorithm will have smaller roundoff than the QR algorithm, so we shall
use QL henceforth.

The QL algorithm consists of a sequence of orthogonal transformations:
As = Qs Â· Ls
As+1 = Ls Â· Qs
(= QT
s Â· As Â· Qs)
(11.3.5)
The following (nonobvious!) theorem is the basis of the algorithm for a general
matrix A: (i) If A has eigenvalues of different absolute value |Î»i|, then As â[lower
triangular form]
as s ââ. The eigenvalues appear on the diagonal in increasing
order of absolute magnitude.
(ii) If A has an eigenvalue |Î»i| of multiplicity p,
As â[lower triangular form]
as s ââ, except for a diagonal block matrix
of order p, whose eigenvalues âÎ»i. The proof of this theorem is fairly lengthy;
see, for example, [4].
The workload in the QL algorithm is O(n3) per iteration for a general matrix,
which is prohibitive.
However, the workload is only O(n) per iteration for a
tridiagonal matrix and O(n2) for a Hessenberg matrix, which makes it highly
efï¬cient on these forms.
In this section we are concerned only with the case where A is a real, symmetric,
tridiagonal matrix. All the eigenvalues Î»i are thus real. According to the theorem,
if any Î»i has a multiplicity p, then there must be at least p â1 zeros on the
sub- and superdiagonal. Thus the matrix can be split into submatrices that can be
diagonalized separately, and the complication of diagonal blocks that can arise in
the general case is irrelevant.
In the proof of the theorem quoted above, one ï¬nds that in general a super-
diagonal element converges to zero like
a(s)
ij â¼
 Î»i
Î»j
s
(11.3.6)
Although Î»i < Î»j, convergence can be slow if Î»i is close to Î»j. Convergence can
be accelerated by the technique of shifting: If k is any constant, then A âk1 has
eigenvalues Î»i âk.
If we decompose
As âks1 = Qs Â· Ls
(11.3.7)
so that
As+1 = Ls Â· Qs + ks1
= QT
s Â· As Â· Qs
(11.3.8)
then the convergence is determined by the ratio
Î»i âks
Î»j âks
(11.3.9)
The idea is to choose the shift ks at each stage to maximize the rate of
convergence.
A good choice for the shift initially would be ks close to Î»1, the
smallest eigenvalue. Then the ï¬rst row of off-diagonal elements would tend rapidly
to zero. However, Î»1 is not usually known a priori. A very effective strategy in
practice (although there is no proof that it is optimal) is to compute the eigenvalues

of the leading 2 Ã 2 diagonal submatrix of A. Then set ks equal to the eigenvalue
closer to a11.
More generally, suppose you have already found r â1 eigenvalues of A. Then
you can deï¬ate the matrix by crossing out the ï¬rst r â1 rows and columns, leaving
A =

(11.3.10)
Choose ks equal to the eigenvalue of the leading 2 Ã 2 submatrix that is closer to dr.
One can show that the convergence of the algorithm with this strategy is generally
cubic (and at worst quadratic for degenerate eigenvalues). This rapid convergence
is what makes the algorithm so attractive.
Note that with shifting, the eigenvalues no longer necessarily appear on the
diagonal in order of increasing absolute magnitude. The routine eigsrt (Â§11.1)
can be used if required.
As we mentioned earlier, the QL decomposition of a general matrix is effected
by a sequence of Householder transformations. For a tridiagonal matrix,however, it is
more efï¬cient touse plane rotationsPpq. One uses the sequence P12, P23, . . ., Pnâ1,n
to annihilate the elements a12, a23, . . ., anâ1,n.
By symmetry, the subdiagonal
elements a21, a32, . . ., an,nâ1 will be annihilated too. Thus each Qs is a product
of plane rotations:
QT
s = P(s)
1
Â· P(s)
2
Â· Â· Â·P(s)
nâ1
(11.3.11)
where Pi annihilates ai,i+1. Note that it is QT in equation (11.3.11), not Q, because
we deï¬ned L = QT Â· A.
QL Algorithm with Implicit Shifts
The algorithm as described so far can be very successful.
However, when
the elements of A differ widely in order of magnitude, subtracting a large ks
from the diagonal elements can lead to loss of accuracy for the small eigenvalues.
This difï¬culty is avoided by the QL algorithm with implicit shifts. The implicit
QL algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the original QL algorithm, but the
computation does not require ks1 to be actually subtracted from A.
The algorithm is based on the following lemma: If A is a symmetric nonsingular matrix
and B = QT Â· A Â· Q, where Q is orthogonal and B is tridiagonal with positive off-diagonal
elements, then Q and B are fully determined when the last row of QT is speciï¬ed. Proof:

Since Q is orthogonal,

Then Qs = Qs and As+1 = As+1.
Now, in the original algorithm, from equation (11.3.11) we see that the last row of QT
s
is the same as the last row of P(s)
nâ1. But recall that P(s)
nâ1 is a plane rotation designed to
annihilate the (n â1, n) element of As âks1. A simple calculation using the expression

(11.3.23), Givens is better. We rotate in the plane (n â2, n â1) to annihilate the (n â2, n)
element. [By symmetry, the (n, n â2) element will also be zeroed.] This leaves us with
tridiagonal form except for extra elements (n â3, n â1) and (n â1, n â3). We annihilate
these with a rotation in the (n â3, n â2) plane, and so on. Thus a sequence of n â2
Givens rotations is required. The result is that

algorithm. Then equation (11.3.21) gives the next iterate of A. Note that the shift ks enters
implicitly through the parameters (11.3.22).
The followingroutine tqli (âTridiagonal QL Implicitâ), based algorithmically
on the implementations in [2,3], works extremely well in practice.
The number
of iterations for the ï¬rst few eigenvalues might be 4 or 5, say, but meanwhile
the off-diagonal elements in the lower right-hand corner have been reduced too.
The later eigenvalues are liberated with very little work. The average number of
iterations per eigenvalue is typically 1.3 â1.6. The operation count per iteration is
O(n), with a fairly large effective coefï¬cient, say, â¼20n. The total operation count
for the diagonalization is then â¼20n Ã (1.3 â1.6)n â¼30n2. If the eigenvectors
are required, the statements indicated by comments are included and there is an
additional, much larger, workload of about 3n3 operations.

QL algorithm with implicit shifts, to determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real, sym-

input, d[1..n] contains the diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix. On output, it returns
the eigenvalues. The vector e[1..n] inputs the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix,
with e[1] arbitrary. On output e is destroyed. When ï¬nding only the eigenvalues, several lines
may be omitted, as noted in the comments. If the eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix are de-
sired, the matrix z[1..n][1..n] is input as the identity matrix. If the eigenvectors of a matrix
that has been reduced by tred2 are required, then z is input as the matrix output by tred2.
In either case, the kth column of z returns the normalized eigenvector corresponding to d[k].

11.5 Reduction of a General Matrix to
Hessenberg Form
The algorithms for symmetric matrices, given in the preceding sections, are
highly satisfactory in practice.
By contrast, it is impossible to design equally
satisfactory algorithms for the nonsymmetric case. There are two reasons for this.
First, the eigenvalues ofa nonsymmetricmatrixcan be very sensitivetosmall changes
in the matrix elements. Second, the matrix itself can be defective, so that there is
no complete set of eigenvectors. We emphasize that these difï¬culties are intrinsic
properties of certain nonsymmetric matrices, and no numerical procedure can âcureâ
them. The best we can hope for are procedures that donât exacerbate such problems.
The presence of rounding error can only make the situation worse. With ï¬nite-
precision arithmetic, one cannot even design a foolproof algorithm to determine
whether a given matrix is defective or not. Thus current algorithms generally try to
ï¬nd a complete set of eigenvectors, and rely on the user to inspect the results. If any
eigenvectors are almost parallel, the matrix is probably defective.

Apart fromreferringyou tothe literature, and tothe collectedroutinesin [1,2], we
are going to sidestep the problem of eigenvectors, giving algorithms for eigenvalues
only. If you require just a few eigenvectors, you can read Â§11.7 and consider ï¬nding
them by inverse iteration. We consider the problem of ï¬nding all eigenvectors of a
nonsymmetric matrix as lying beyond the scope of this book.
Balancing
The sensitivity of eigenvalues to rounding errors during the execution of
some algorithms can be reduced by the procedure of balancing.
The errors in
the eigensystem found by a numerical procedure are generally proportional to the
Euclidean norm of the matrix, that is, to the square root of the sum of the squares
of the elements.
The idea of balancing is to use similarity transformations to
make corresponding rows and columns of the matrix have comparable norms, thus
reducing the overall norm of the matrix while leaving the eigenvalues unchanged.
A symmetric matrix is already balanced.
Balancing is a procedure with of order N 2 operations. Thus, the time taken
by the procedure balanc, given below, should never be more than a few percent
of the total time required to ï¬nd the eigenvalues. It is therefore recommended that
you always balance nonsymmetric matrices. It never hurts, and it can substantially
improve the accuracy of the eigenvalues computed for a badly balanced matrix.
The actual algorithm used is due to Osborne, as discussed in [1]. It consists of a
sequence of similarity transformations by diagonal matrices D. To avoid introducing
rounding errors during the balancing process, the elements of D are restricted to be
exact powers of the radix base employed for ï¬oating-point arithmetic (i.e., 2 for
most machines, but 16 for IBM mainframe architectures). The output is a matrix
that is balanced in the norm given by summing the absolute magnitudes of the
matrix elements. This is more efï¬cient than using the Euclidean norm, and equally
effective: A large reduction in one norm implies a large reduction in the other.
Note that if the off-diagonal elements of any row or column of a matrix are
all zero, then the diagonal element is an eigenvalue. If the eigenvalue happens to
be ill-conditioned (sensitive to small changes in the matrix elements), it will have
relatively large errors when determined by the routine hqr (Â§11.6). Had we merely
inspected the matrix beforehand, we could have determined the isolated eigenvalue
exactly and then deleted the corresponding row and column from the matrix. You
should consider whether such a pre-inspection might be useful in your application.
(For symmetric matrices, the routines we gave will determine isolated eigenvalues
accurately in all cases.)
The routine balanc does not keep track of the accumulated similarity trans-
formation of the original matrix, since we will only be concerned with ï¬nding
eigenvalues of nonsymmetric matrices, not eigenvectors. Consult [1-3] if you want
to keep track of the transformation.
#include <math.h>
#define RADIX 2.0
void balanc(float **a, int n)
Given a matrix a[1..n][1..n], this routine replaces it by a balanced matrix with identical
eigenvalues. A symmetric matrix is already balanced and is unaï¬ected by this procedure. The
parameter RADIX should be the machineâs ï¬oating-point radix.

Reduction to Hessenberg Form
The strategy for ï¬nding the eigensystem of a general matrix parallels that of the
symmetric case. First we reduce the matrix to a simpler form, and then we perform
an iterative procedure on the simpliï¬ed matrix. The simpler structure we use here is
called Hessenberg form. An upper Hessenberg matrix has zeros everywhere below
the diagonal except for the ï¬rst subdiagonal row. For example, in the 6 Ã 6 case,
the nonzero elements are:

required elements in a column of the matrix. Householder reduction to Hessenberg
form is in fact an accepted technique.
An alternative, however, is a procedure
analogous to Gaussian elimination with pivoting.
We will use this elimination
procedure since it is about a factor of 2 more efï¬cient than the Householder method,
and also since we want to teach you the method. It is possible to construct matrices
for which the Householder reduction, being orthogonal, is stable and elimination is
not, but such matrices are extremely rare in practice.
Straight Gaussian elimination is not a similarity transformation of the matrix.
Accordingly, the actual elimination procedure used is slightly different. Before the
rth stage, the original matrix A â¡A1 has become Ar, which is upper Hessenberg
in its ï¬rst r â1 rows and columns. The rth stage then consists of the following
sequence of operations:
â¢ Find the element of maximum magnitude in the rth column below the
diagonal. If it is zero, skip the next two âbulletsâ and the stage is done.
Otherwise, suppose the maximum element was in row râ².
â¢ Interchange rows râ² and r + 1. This is the pivoting procedure. To make
the permutation a similarity transformation, also interchange columns râ²
and r + 1.
â¢ For i = r + 2, r + 3, . . ., N, compute the multiplier
ni,r+1 â¡
air
ar+1,r
Subtract ni,r+1 times row r + 1 from row i. To make the elimination a
similarity transformation, also add ni,r+1 times column i to column r + 1.
A total of N â2 such stages are required.
When the magnitudes of the matrix elements vary over many orders, you should
try to rearrange the matrix so that the largest elements are in the top left-hand corner.
This reduces the roundoff error, since the reduction proceeds from left to right.
Since we are concerned only with eigenvalues, the routine elmhes does not
keep track of the accumulated similarity transformation. The operation count is
about 5N 3/6 for large N.

ommended, but not required, is that this routine be preceded by balanc. On output, the

As s ââ, As converges to a form where
the eigenvalues are either isolated on the diagonal or are eigenvalues of a 2 Ã 2

As we pointed out in Â§11.3, shifting is essential for rapid convergence. A key

This means that good choices for the shifts ks may be complex, apparently
necessitating complex arithmetic.
Complex arithmetic can be avoided, however, by a clever trick.
The trick
depends on a result analogous to the lemma we used for implicit shifts in Â§11.3. The
lemma we need here states that if B is a nonsingular matrix such that
B Â· Q = Q Â· H
(11.6.3)
where Q is orthogonal and H is upper Hessenberg, then Q and H are fully determined
by the ï¬rst column of Q. (The determination is unique if H has positive subdiagonal
elements.) The lemma can be proved by induction analogously to the proof given
for tridiagonal matrices in Â§11.3.
The lemma is used in practice by taking two steps of the QR algorithm,
either with two real shifts ks and ks+1, or with complex conjugate values ks and
ks+1 = ks*. This gives a real matrix As+2, where
As+2 = Qs+1 Â· Qs Â· As Â· QT
s Â· QT
s+1Â·
(11.6.4)
The Qâs are determined by
As âks1 = QT
s Â· Rs
(11.6.5)
As+1 = Qs Â· As Â· QT
s
(11.6.6)
As+1 âks+11 = QT
s+1 Â· Rs+1
(11.6.7)
Using (11.6.6), equation (11.6.7) can be rewritten
As âks+11 = QT
s Â· QT
s+1 Â· Rs+1 Â· Qs
(11.6.8)
Hence, if we deï¬ne
M = (As âks+11) Â· (As âks1)
(11.6.9)
equations (11.6.5) and (11.6.8) give
R = Q Â· M
(11.6.10)
where
Q = Qs+1 Â· Qs
(11.6.11)
R = Rs+1 Â· Rs
(11.6.12)
Equation (11.6.4) can be rewritten
As Â· QT = QT Â· As+2
(11.6.13)
Thus suppose we can somehow ï¬nd an upper Hessenberg matrix H such that
As Â· Q
T = Q
T Â· H
(11.6.14)
where Q is orthogonal. If Q
T has the same ï¬rst column as QT (i.e., Q has the same
ï¬rst row as Q), then Q = Q and As+2 = H.

The ï¬rst row of Q is found as follows. Equation (11.6.10) shows that Q is
the orthogonal matrix that triangularizes the real matrix M. Any real matrix can
be triangularized by premultiplying it by a sequence of Householder matrices P1
(acting on the ï¬rst column), P2 (acting on the second column), . . ., Pnâ1. Thus
Q = Pnâ1 Â· Â· Â· P2 Â· P1, and the ï¬rst row of Q is the ï¬rst row of P1 since Pi is an
(i â1) Ã (i â1) identity matrix in the top left-hand corner. We now must ï¬nd Q
satisfying (11.6.14) whose ï¬rst row is that of P1.
The Householder matrix P1 is determined by the ï¬rst column of M. Since As
is upper Hessenberg, equation (11.6.9) shows that the ï¬rst column of M has the
form [p1, q1, r1, 0, ..., 0]T, where
p1 = a2
11 âa11(ks + ks+1) + ksks+1 + a12a21
q1 = a21(a11 + a22 âks âks+1)
r1 = a21a32
(11.6.15)
Hence
P1 = 1 â2w1 Â· wT
1
(11.6.16)
where w1 has only its ï¬rst 3 elements nonzero (cf. equation 11.2.5). The matrix
P1 Â· As Â· PT
1 is therefore upper Hessenberg with 3 extra elements:

This matrix can be restored to upper Hessenberg form without affecting the ï¬rst row
by a sequence of Householder similaritytransformations. The ï¬rst such Householder
matrix, P2, acts on elements 2, 3, and 4 in the ï¬rst column, annihilating elements
3 and 4. This produces a matrix of the same form as (11.6.17), with the 3 extra
elements appearing one column over:

Thus
Q = Q = Pnâ1 Â· Â· Â·P2 Â· P1
(11.6.20)
and
As+2 = H
(11.6.21)
The shifts of origin at each stage are taken to be the eigenvalues of the 2 Ã 2
matrix in the bottom right-hand corner of the current As. This gives
ks + ks+2 = anâ1,nâ1 + ann
ksks+1 = anâ1,nâ1ann âanâ1,nan,nâ1
(11.6.22)
Substituting (11.6.22) in (11.6.15), we get
p1 = a21 {[(ann âa11)(anâ1,nâ1 âa11) âanâ1,nan,nâ1]/a21 + a12}
q1 = a21[a22 âa11 â(ann âa11) â(anâ1,nâ1 âa11)]
r1 = a21a32
(11.6.23)
We have judiciously grouped terms to reduce possible roundoff when there are
small off-diagonal elements. Since only the ratios of elements are relevant for a
Householder transformation, we can omit the factor a21 from (11.6.23).
In summary, to carry out a double QR step we construct the Householder
matrices Pr, r = 1, . . ., nâ1. For P1 we use p1, q1, and r1 given by (11.6.23). For
the remaining matrices, pr, qr, and rr are determined by the (r, râ1), (r +1, r â1),
and (r + 2, r â1) elements of the current matrix.
The number of arithmetic
operations can be reduced by writing the nonzero elements of the 2w Â· wT part of
the Householder matrix in the form
2w Â· wT =

(We have simply divided each element by a piece of the normalizing factor; cf.
the equations in Â§11.2.)
If we proceed in this way, convergence is usually very fast. There are two
possible ways of terminating the iterationfor an eigenvalue. First, if an,nâ1 becomes
ânegligible,â then ann is an eigenvalue. We can then delete the nth row and column

of the matrix and look for the next eigenvalue. Alternatively, anâ1,nâ2 may become
negligible. In this case the eigenvalues of the 2 Ã 2 matrix in the lower right-hand
corner may be taken to be eigenvalues. We delete the nth and (n â1)st rows and
columns of the matrix and continue.
The test for convergence to an eigenvalue is combined with a test for negligible
subdiagonal elements that allows splitting of the matrix into submatrices. We ï¬nd
the largest i such that ai,iâ1 is negligible.
If i = n, we have found a single
eigenvalue. If i = n â1, we have found two eigenvalues. Otherwise we continue
the iteration on the submatrix in rows i to n (i being set to unity if there is no
small subdiagonal element).
After determining i, the submatrix in rows i to n is examined to see if the
product of any two consecutive subdiagonal elements is small enough that we
can work with an even smaller submatrix, starting say in row m. We start with
m = n â2 and decrement it down to i + 1, computing p, q, and r according to
equations (11.6.23) with 1 replaced by m and 2 by m + 1. If these were indeed the
elements of the special âï¬rstâ Householder matrix in a doubleQR step, then applying
the Householder matrix would lead to nonzero elements in positions(m+1, mâ1),
(m + 2, m â1), and (m + 2, m). We require that the ï¬rst two of these elements be
small compared with the local diagonal elements amâ1,mâ1, amm and am+1,m+1.
A satisfactory approximate criterion is
|am,mâ1|(|q| + |r|) âª|p|(|am+1,m+1| + |amm| + |amâ1,mâ1|)
(11.6.26)
Very rarely, the procedure described so far will fail to converge.
On such
matrices, experience shows that if one double step is performed with any shifts
that are of order the norm of the matrix, convergence is subsequently very rapid.
Accordingly, if ten iterations occur without determining an eigenvalue, the usual
shifts are replaced for the next iteration by shifts deï¬ned by
ks + ks+1 = 1.5 Ã (|an,nâ1| + |anâ1,nâ2|)
ksks+1 = (|an,nâ1| + |anâ1,nâ2|)2
(11.6.27)
The factor 1.5 was arbitrarily chosen to lessen the likelihood of an âunfortunateâ
choice of shifts. This strategy is repeated after 20 unsuccessful iterations. After 30
unsuccessful iterations, the routine reports failure.
The operation count for the QR algorithm described here is â¼5k2 per iteration,
where k is the current size of the matrix. The typical average number of iterations per
eigenvalue is â¼1.8, so the total operationcount for all the eigenvalues isâ¼3n3. This
estimate neglects any possible efï¬ciency due to splitting or sparseness of the matrix.
The following routine hqr is based algorithmically on the above description,
in turn following the implementations in [1,2].

11.7 Improving Eigenvalues and/or Finding
Eigenvectors by Inverse Iteration
The basic idea behind inverse iteration is quite simple. Let y be the solution
of the linear system
(A âÏ1) Â· y = b
(11.7.1)
where b is a random vector and Ï is close to some eigenvalue Î» of A. Then the
solution y will be close to the eigenvector corresponding to Î». The procedure can
be iterated: Replace b by y and solve for a new y, which will be even closer to
the true eigenvector.
We can see why this works by expanding both y and b as linear combinations
of the eigenvectors xj of A:
y =
X
j
Î±jxj
b =
X
j
Î²jxj
(11.7.2)
Then (11.7.1) gives
X
j
Î±j(Î»j âÏ)xj =
X
j
Î²jxj
(11.7.3)
so that
Î±j =
Î²j
Î»j âÏ
(11.7.4)
and
y =
X
j
Î²jxj
Î»j âÏ
(11.7.5)
If Ï is close to Î»n, say, then provided Î²n is not accidentally too small, y will be
approximately xn, up to a normalization. Moreover, each iteration of this procedure
gives another power of Î»j âÏ in the denominator of (11.7.5). Thus the convergence
is rapid for well-separated eigenvalues.
Suppose at the kth stage of iteration we are solving the equation
(A âÏk1) Â· y = bk
(11.7.6)

where bk and Ïk are our current guesses for some eigenvector and eigenvalue of
interest (letâs say, xn and Î»n).
Normalize bk so that bk Â· bk = 1.
The exact
eigenvector and eigenvalue satisfy
A Â· xn = Î»nxn
(11.7.7)
so
(A âÏk1) Â· xn = (Î»n âÏk)xn
(11.7.8)
Since y of (11.7.6) is an improved approximation to xn, we normalize it and set
bk+1 = y
|y|
(11.7.9)
We get an improved estimate of the eigenvalue by substituting our improved guess
y for xn in (11.7.8). By (11.7.6), the left-hand side is bk, so calling Î»n our new
value Ïk+1, we ï¬nd
Ïk+1 = Ïk +
1
bk Â· y
(11.7.10)
While the above formulas look simple enough, in practice the implementation
can be quite tricky. The ï¬rst question to be resolved is when to use inverse iteration.
Most of the computational load occurs in solving the linear system (11.7.6). Thus
a possible strategy is ï¬rst to reduce the matrix A to a special form that allows easy
solution of (11.7.6). Tridiagonal form for symmetric matrices or Hessenberg for
nonsymmetric are the obvious choices.
Then apply inverse iteration to generate
all the eigenvectors. While this is an O(N 3) method for symmetric matrices, it
is many times less efï¬cient than the QL method given earlier. In fact, even the
best inverse iteration packages are less efï¬cient than the QL method as soon as
more than about 25 percent of the eigenvectors are required. Accordingly, inverse
iteration is generally used when one already has good eigenvalues and wants only
a few selected eigenvectors.
You can write a simple inverse iteration routine yourself using LU decompo-
sition to solve (11.7.6). You can decide whether to use the general LU algorithm
we gave in Chapter 2 or whether to take advantage of tridiagonal or Hessenberg
form. Note that, since the linear system (11.7.6) is nearly singular, you must be
careful to use a version of LU decomposition like that in Â§2.3 which replaces a zero
pivot with a very small number.
We have chosen not to give a general inverse iteration routine in this book,
because it is quite cumbersome to take account of all the cases that can arise.
Routines are given, for example, in [1,2]. If you use these, or write your own routine,
you may appreciate the following pointers.
One starts by supplying an initial value Ï0 for the eigenvalue Î»n of interest.
Choose a random normalized vector b0 as the initial guess for the eigenvector xn,
and solve (11.7.6). The new vector y is bigger than b0 by a âgrowth factorâ |y|,
which ideally should be large. Equivalently, the change in the eigenvalue, which by
(11.7.10) is essentially 1/ |y|, should be small. The following cases can arise:
â¢ If the growth factor is too small initially, then we assume we have made
a âbadâ choice of random vector. This can happen not just because of
a small Î²n in (11.7.5), but also in the case of a defective matrix, when
(11.7.5) does not even apply (see, e.g., [1] or [3] for details). We go back
to the beginning and choose a new initial vector.

â¢ The change |b1 âb0| might be less than some tolerance Ïµ. We can use this
as a criterion for stopping, iterating until it is satisï¬ed, with a maximum
of 5 â 10 iterations, say.
â¢ After a few iterations, if |bk+1 âbk| is not decreasing rapidly enough,
we can try updating the eigenvalue according to (11.7.10). If Ïk+1 = Ïk
to machine accuracy, we are not going to improve the eigenvector much
more and can quit. Otherwise start another cycle of iterations with the
new eigenvalue.
The reason we do not update the eigenvalue at every step is that when we solve
the linear system (11.7.6) by LU decomposition, we can save the decomposition
if Ïk is ï¬xed. We only need do the backsubstitution step each time we update bk.
The number of iterations we decide to do with a ï¬xed Ïk is a trade-off between the
quadratic convergence but O(N 3) workload for updating Ïk at each step and the
linear convergence but O(N 2) load for keeping Ïk ï¬xed. If you have determined the
eigenvalue by one of the routines given earlier in the chapter, it is probably correct
to machine accuracy anyway, and you can omit updating it.
There are two different pathologies that can arise during inverse iteration. The
ï¬rst is multiple or closely spaced roots. This is more often a problem with symmetric
matrices. Inverse iteration will ï¬nd only one eigenvector for a given initial guess Ï0.
A good strategy is to perturb the last few signiï¬cant digits in Ï0 and then repeat the
iteration. Usually this provides an independent eigenvector. Special steps generally
have to be taken to ensure orthogonality of the linearly independent eigenvectors,
whereas the Jacobi and QL algorithms automatically yield orthogonal eigenvectors
even in the case of multiple eigenvalues.
The second problem, peculiar to nonsymmetric matrices, is the defective case.
Unless one makes a âgoodâ initial guess, the growth factor is small. Moreover,
iteration does not improve matters. In this case, the remedy is to choose random
initial vectors, solve (11.7.6) once, and quit as soon as any vector gives an acceptably
large growth factor. Typically only a few trials are necessary.
One further complication in the nonsymmetric case is that a real matrix can
have complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues. You will then have to use complex
arithmetic to solve (11.7.6) for the complex eigenvectors. For any moderate-sized
(or larger) nonsymmetric matrix, our recommendation is to avoid inverse iteration
in favor of a QR method that includes the eigenvector computation in complex
arithmetic. You will ï¬nd routines for this in [1,2] and other places.

Chapter 12.
Fast Fourier Transform
12.0 Introduction
A very large class of important computational problems falls under the general
rubric of âFourier transform methodsâ or âspectral methods.â For some of these
problems, the Fourier transform is simply an efï¬cient computational tool for
accomplishing certain common manipulations of data.
In other cases, we have
problems for which the Fourier transform (or the related âpower spectrumâ) is itself
of intrinsic interest. These two kinds of problems share a common methodology.
Largely for historical reasons the literature on Fourier and spectral methods has
been disjointfrom the literature on âclassicalâ numerical analysis. Nowadays there is
no justiï¬cationfor such a split. Fourier methods are commonplace in research and we
shall not treat them as specialized or arcane. At the same time, we realize that many
computer users have had relatively less experience with this ï¬eld than with, say,
differential equations or numerical integration. Therefore our summary of analytical
results will be more complete. Numerical algorithms, per se, begin in Â§12.2. Various
applications of Fourier transform methods are discussed in Chapter 13.
A physical process can be described either in the time domain, by the values of
some quantity h as a function of time t, e.g., h(t), or else in the frequency domain,
where the process is speciï¬ed by giving its amplitude H (generally a complex
number indicating phase also) as a function of frequency f, that is H(f), with
ââ< f < â. For many purposes it is useful to think of h(t) and H(f) as being
two different representations of the same function. One goes back and forth between
these two representations by means of the Fourier transform equations,
H(f) =
Z â
ââ
h(t)e2Ïiftdt
h(t) =
Z â
ââ
H(f)eâ2Ïiftdf
(12.0.1)
If t is measured in seconds, then f in equation (12.0.1) is in cycles per second,
or Hertz (the unit of frequency). However, the equations work with other units too.
If h is a functionof position x (in meters), H will be a functionof inverse wavelength
(cycles per meter), and so on. If you are trained as a physicist or mathematician, you
are probably more used to using angular frequency Ï, which is given in radians per
sec. The relation between Ï and f, H(Ï) and H(f) is
Ï â¡2Ïf
H(Ï) â¡[H(f)]f=Ï/2Ï

H(Ï) =
Z â

h(t) = 1

(12.0.3)
We were raised on the Ï-convention, but we changed! There are fewer factors of
2Ï to remember if you use the f-convention, especially when we get to discretely
sampled data in Â§12.1.
From equation (12.0.1) it is evident at once that Fourier transformation is a
linear operation. The transform of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of
the transforms. The transform of a constant times a function is that same constant
times the transform of the function.
In the time domain, function h(t) may happen to have one or more special
symmetries It might be purely real or purely imaginary or it might be even,
h(t) = h(ât), or odd, h(t) = âh(ât). In the frequency domain, these symmetries
lead to relationships between H(f) and H(âf).
The following table gives the
correspondence between symmetries in the two domains:
If . . .
then . . .
h(t) is real
H(âf) = [H(f)]*
h(t) is imaginary
H(âf) = â[H(f)]*
h(t) is even
H(âf) = H(f)
[i.e., H(f) is even]
h(t) is odd
H(âf) = âH(f)
[i.e., H(f) is odd]
h(t) is real and even
H(f) is real and even
h(t) is real and odd
H(f) is imaginary and odd
h(t) is imaginary and even
H(f) is imaginary and even
h(t) is imaginary and odd
H(f) is real and odd
In subsequent sections we shall see how to use these symmetries to increase
computational efï¬ciency.
Here are some other elementary properties of the Fourier transform. (Weâll use
the ââââ symbol to indicate transform pairs.) If
h(t) ââH(f)
is such a pair, then other transform pairs are

With two functions h(t) and g(t), and their corresponding Fourier transforms
H(f) and G(f), we can form two combinations of special interest. The convolution
of the two functions, denoted g âh, is deï¬ned by
g âh â¡
Z â
ââ
g(Ï)h(t âÏ) dÏ
(12.0.8)
Note that g âh is a function in the time domain and that g âh = h âg. It turns out
that the function g âh is one member of a simple transform pair
g âh ââG(f)H(f)
âConvolution Theoremâ
(12.0.9)
In other words, the Fourier transform of the convolution is just the product of the
individual Fourier transforms.
The correlation of two functions, denoted Corr(g, h), is deï¬ned by
Corr(g, h) â¡
Z â
ââ
g(Ï + t)h(Ï) dÏ
(12.0.10)
The correlation is a function of t, which is called the lag. It therefore lies in the time
domain, and it turns out to be one member of the transform pair:

(12.0.11)
[More generally, the second member of the pair is G(f)H(âf), but we are restricting
ourselves to the usual case in whichg and h are real functions,so we take the libertyof
setting H(âf) = H*(f).] This result shows that multiplying the Fourier transform
of one function by the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform of the other gives
the Fourier transform of their correlation. The correlation of a function with itself is
called its autocorrelation. In this case (12.0.11) becomes the transform pair

âWiener-Khinchin Theoremâ
(12.0.12)
The total power in a signal is the same whether we compute it in the time
domain or in the frequency domain. This result is known as Parsevalâs theorem:
Total Power â¡
Z â
ââ
|h(t)|2 dt =
Z â
ââ
|H(f)|2 df
(12.0.13)
Frequently one wants to know âhow much powerâ is contained in the frequency
interval between f and f + df.
In such circumstances one does not usually
distinguish between positive and negative f, but rather regards f as varying from 0
(âzero frequencyâ or D.C.) to +â. In such cases, one deï¬nes the one-sided power
spectral density (PSD) of the function h as
Ph(f) â¡|H(f)|2 + |H(âf)|2
0 â¤f < â
(12.0.14)
so that the total power is just the integral of Ph(f) from f = 0 to f = â. When the
function h(t) is real, then the twoterms in (12.0.14) are equal, so Ph(f) = 2 |H(f)|2.

equals the area under its two-sided power spectrum at positive and negative frequencies, (c).
Be warned that one occasionally sees PSDs deï¬ned without this factor two. These,
strictly speaking, are called two-sided power spectral densities, but some books
are not careful about stating whether one- or two-sided is to be assumed.
We
will always use the one-sided density given by equation (12.0.14). Figure 12.0.1
contrasts the two conventions.
If the function h(t) goes endlessly from ââ< t < â, then its total power
and power spectral density will, in general, be inï¬nite. Of interest then is the (one-
or two-sided) power spectral density per unit time. This is computed by taking a
long, but ï¬nite, stretch of the function h(t), computing its PSD [that is, the PSD
of a function that equals h(t) in the ï¬nite stretch but is zero everywhere else], and
then dividing the resulting PSD by the length of the stretch used. Parsevalâs theorem
in this case states that the integral of the one-sided PSD-per-unit-time over positive
frequency is equal to the mean square amplitude of the signal h(t).
You might well worry about how the PSD-per-unit-time, which is a function
of frequency f, converges as one evaluates it using longer and longer stretches of
data. This interesting question is the content of the subject of âpower spectrum
estimation,â and will be considered below in Â§13.4âÂ§13.7.

In the most common situations, function h(t) is sampled (i.e., its value is
recorded) at evenly spaced intervals in time. Let âdenote the time interval between

in seconds, for example, then the sampling rate is the number of samples recorded
per second.

sine wave is two sample points per cycle. One frequently chooses to measure time
in units of the sampling interval â. In this case the Nyquist critical frequency is
just the constant 1/2.

fact known as the sampling theorem: If a continuous function h(t), sampled at an
interval â, happens to be bandwidthlimited to frequencies smaller in magnitude than
fc, i.e., if H(f) = 0 for all |f| â¥fc, then the function h(t) is completely determined
by its samples hn. In fact, h(t) is given explicitly by the formula
h(t) = â
+â
X
n=ââ
hn
sin[2Ïfc(t ânâ)]
Ï(t ânâ)
(12.1.3)
This is a remarkable theorem for many reasons, among them that it shows that the
âinformation contentâ of a bandwidth limited function is, in some sense, inï¬nitely
smaller than that of a general continuous function.
Fairly often, one is dealing
with a signal that is known on physical grounds to be bandwidth limited (or at
least approximately bandwidth limited). For example, the signal may have passed
through an ampliï¬er with a known, ï¬nite frequency response.
In this case, the
sampling theorem tells us that the entire information content of the signal can be
recorded by sampling it at a rate ââ1 equal to twice the maximum frequency passed
by the ampliï¬er (cf. 12.1.2).
Now the bad news. The bad news concerns the effect of sampling a continuous
function that is not bandwidth limited to less than the Nyquist critical frequency.
In that case, it turns out that all of the power spectral density that lies outside of
the frequency range âfc < f < fc is spuriously moved into that range.
This
phenomenon is called aliasing. Any frequency component outside of the frequency
range (âfc, fc) is aliased (falsely translated) into that range by the very act of
discrete sampling. You can readily convince yourself that two waves exp(2Ïif1t)
and exp(2Ïif2t) give the same samples at an interval âif and only if f1 and
f2 differ by a multiple of 1/â, which is just the width in frequency of the range
(âfc, fc). There is little that you can do to remove aliased power once you have
discretely sampled a signal. The way to overcome aliasing is to (i) know the natural
bandwidth limit of the signal â or else enforce a known limit by analog ï¬ltering
of the continuous signal, and then (ii) sample at a rate sufï¬ciently rapid to give at
least two points per cycle of the highest frequency present. Figure 12.1.1 illustrates
these considerations.
To put the best face on this, we can take the alternative point of view: If a
continuous function has been competently sampled, then, when we come to estimate
its Fourier transform from the discrete samples, we can assume (or rather we might
as well assume) that its Fourier transform is equal to zero outside of the frequency
range in between âfc and fc. Then we look to the Fourier transform to tell whether
the continuous function has been competently sampled (aliasing effects minimized).
We do this by looking to see whether the Fourier transform is already approaching
zero as the frequency approaches fc from below, or âfc from above. If, on the
contrary, the transform is going towards some ï¬nite value, then chances are that
components outside of the range have been folded back over onto the critical range.
Discrete Fourier Transform
We now estimate the Fourier transform of a function from a ï¬nite number of its
sampled points. Suppose that we have N consecutive sampled values

tk â¡kâ,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . ., N â1

The continuous function shown in (a) is nonzero only for a ï¬nite interval of time T .
It follows that its Fourier transform, whose modulus is shown schematically in (b), is not bandwidth
limited but has ï¬nite amplitude for all frequencies. If the original function is sampled with a sampling
interval â, as in (a), then the Fourier transform (c) is deï¬ned only between plus and minus the Nyquist
critical frequency. Power outside that range is folded over or âaliasedâ into the range. The effect can be
eliminated only by low-pass ï¬ltering the original function before sampling.
so that the sampling interval is â. To make things simpler, let us also suppose that
N is even. If the function h(t) is nonzero only in a ï¬nite interval of time, then
that whole interval of time is supposed to be contained in the range of the N points
given. Alternatively, if the function h(t) goes on forever, then the sampled points
are supposed to be at least âtypicalâ of what h(t) looks like at all other times.
With N numbers of input, we will evidently be able to produce no more than
N independent numbers of output. So, instead of trying to estimate the Fourier
transform H(f) at all values of f in the range âfc to fc, let us seek estimates
only at the discrete values

The extreme values of n in (12.1.5) correspond exactly to the lower and upper limits
of the Nyquist critical frequency range. If you are really on the ball, you will have
noticed that there are N + 1, not N, values of n in (12.1.5); it will turn out that
the two extreme values of n are not independent (in fact they are equal), but all the
others are.
This reduces the count to N.

The remaining step is to approximate the integral in (12.0.1) by a discrete sum:
H(fn) =
Z â
ââ
h(t)e2Ïifntdt â
Nâ1
X
k=0
hk e2Ïifntkâ= â
Nâ1
X
k=0
hk e2Ïikn/N
(12.1.6)
Here equations (12.1.4) and (12.1.5) have been used in the ï¬nal equality. The ï¬nal
summation in equation (12.1.6) is called the discrete Fourier transform of the N
points hk.
Let us denote it by Hn,
Hn â¡
Nâ1
X
k=0
hk e2Ïikn/N
(12.1.7)
The discrete Fourier transform maps N complex numbers (the hkâs) into N complex
numbers (the Hnâs). It does not depend on any dimensional parameter, such as the
time scale â. The relation (12.1.6) between the discrete Fourier transform of a set
of numbers and their continuous Fourier transform when they are viewed as samples
of a continuous function sampled at an interval âcan be rewritten as
H(fn) ââHn
(12.1.8)
where fn is given by (12.1.5).
Up to now we have taken the view that the index n in (12.1.7) varies from
âN/2 to N/2 (cf. 12.1.5). You can easily see, however, that (12.1.7) is periodic in
n, with period N. Therefore, Hân = HNân
n = 1, 2, . . .. With this conversion
in mind, one generally lets the n in Hn vary from 0 to N â1 (one complete
period). Then n and k (in hk) vary exactly over the same range, so the mapping
of N numbers into N numbers is manifest.
When this convention is followed,
you must remember that zero frequency corresponds to n = 0, positive frequencies
0 < f < fc correspond to values 1 â¤n â¤N/2 â1, while negative frequencies
âfc < f < 0 correspond to N/2 + 1 â¤n â¤N â1.
The value n = N/2
corresponds to both f = fc and f = âfc.
The discrete Fourier transform has symmetry properties almost exactly the same
as the continuous Fourier transform. For example, all the symmetries in the table
following equation (12.0.3) hold if we read hk for h(t), Hn for H(f), and HNân
for H(âf). (Likewise, âevenâ and âoddâ in time refer to whether the values hk at k
and N âk are identical or the negative of each other.)
The formula for the discrete inverse Fourier transform, which recovers the set
of hkâs exactly from the Hnâs is:
hk = 1
N
Nâ1
X
n=0
Hn eâ2Ïikn/N
(12.1.9)
Notice that the only differences between (12.1.9) and (12.1.7) are (i) changing the
sign in the exponential, and (ii) dividing the answer by N.
This means that a
routine for calculating discrete Fourier transforms can also, with slight modiï¬cation,
calculate the inverse transforms.

How much computation is involved in computing the discrete Fourier transform

In other words, the vector of hkâs is multiplied by a matrix whose (n, k)th element
is the constant W to the power n Ã k. The matrix multiplication produces a vector
result whose components are the Hnâs. This matrix multiplicationevidently requires
N 2 complex multiplications, plus a smaller number of operations to generate the
required powers of W. So, the discrete Fourier transform appears to be an O(N 2)
process.
These appearances are deceiving!
The discrete Fourier transform can,
in fact, be computed in O(N log2 N) operations with an algorithm called the fast
Fourier transform, or FFT. The difference between N log2 N and N 2 is immense.
With N = 106, for example, it is the difference between, roughly, 30 seconds of CPU
time and 2 weeks of CPU time on a microsecond cycle time computer. The existence
of an FFT algorithm became generally known only in the mid-1960s, from the work
of J.W. Cooley and J.W. Tukey. Retrospectively, we now know (see [1]) that efï¬cient
methods for computing the DFT had been independently discovered, and in some
cases implemented, by as many as a dozen individuals, starting with Gauss in 1805!
One ârediscoveryâ of the FFT, that of Danielson and Lanczos in 1942, provides
one of the clearest derivations of the algorithm. Danielson and Lanczos showed
that a discrete Fourier transform of length N can be rewritten as the sum of two

The proof is simply this:

k + W k F o
k
(12.2.3)
In the last line, W is the same complex constant as in (12.2.1), F e
k denotes the kth
component of the Fourier transform of length N/2 formed from the even components
of the original fjâs, while F o
k is the corresponding transform of length N/2 formed
from the odd components. Notice also that k in the last line of (12.2.3) varies from
0 to N, not just to N/2. Nevertheless, the transforms F e
k and F o
k are periodic in k
with length N/2. So each is repeated through two cycles to obtain Fk.
The wonderful thing about the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma is that it can be used
recursively. Having reduced the problem of computing Fk to that of computing
F e
k and F o
k , we can do the same reduction of F e
k to the problem of computing
the transform of its N/4 even-numbered input data and N/4 odd-numbered data.
In other words, we can deï¬ne F ee
k
and F eo
k
to be the discrete Fourier transforms
of the points which are respectively even-even and even-odd on the successive
subdivisions of the data.
Although there are ways of treating other cases, by far the easiest case is the
one in which the original N is an integer power of 2. In fact, we categorically
recommend that you only use FFTs with N a power of two. If the length of your data
set is not a power of two, pad it with zeros up to the next power of two. (We will give
more sophisticated suggestions in subsequent sections below.) With this restriction
on N, it is evident that we can continue applying the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma
until we have subdivided the data all the way down to transforms of length 1. What
is the Fourier transform of length one? It is just the identity operation that copies its
one input number into its one output slot! In other words, for every pattern of log2 N
eâs and oâs, there is a one-point transform that is just one of the input numbers fn
F eoeeoeoÂ·Â·Â·oee
k
= fn
for some n
(12.2.4)
(Of course this one-point transform actually does not depend on k, since it is periodic
in k with period 1.)
The next trick is to ï¬gure out which value of n corresponds to which pattern of
eâs and oâs in equation (12.2.4). The answer is: Reverse the pattern of eâs and oâs,
then let e = 0 and o = 1, and you will have, in binary the value of n. Do you see
why it works? It is because the successive subdivisions of the data into even and odd
are tests of successive low-order (least signiï¬cant) bits of n. This idea of bit reversal
can be exploited in a very clever way which, along with the Danielson-Lanczos

Figure 12.2.1. Reordering an array (here of length 8) by bit reversal, (a) between two arrays, versus (b)
in place. Bit reversal reordering is a necessary part of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.
Lemma, makes FFTs practical: Suppose we take the original vector of data fj
and rearrange it into bit-reversed order (see Figure 12.2.1), so that the individual
numbers are in the order not of j, but of the number obtained by bit-reversing j.
Then the bookkeepingon the recursive applicationof the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma
becomes extraordinarily simple. The points as given are the one-point transforms.
We combine adjacent pairs to get two-point transforms, then combine adjacent pairs
of pairs to get 4-point transforms, and so on, until the ï¬rst and second halves of
the whole data set are combined into the ï¬nal transform. Each combination takes
of order N operations, and there are evidently log2 N combinations, so the whole
algorithm is of order N log2 N (assuming, as is the case, that the process of sorting
into bit-reversed order is no greater in order than N log2 N).
This, then, is the structure of an FFT algorithm: It has two sections. The ï¬rst
section sorts the data into bit-reversed order. Luckily this takes no additional storage,
since it involves only swapping pairs of elements. (If k1 is the bit reverse of k2, then
k2 is the bit reverse of k1.) The second section has an outer loop that is executed
log2 N times and calculates, in turn, transforms of length 2, 4, 8, . . ., N. For each
stage of this process, two nested inner loops range over the subtransforms already
computed and the elements of each transform, implementing the Danielson-Lanczos
Lemma.
The operation is made more efï¬cient by restricting external calls for
trigonometric sines and cosines to the outer loop, where they are made only log2 N
times. Computation of the sines and cosines of multiple angles is through simple
recurrence relations in the inner loops (cf. 5.5.6).
The FFT routine given below is based on one originally written by N. M.
Brenner. The input quantities are the number of complex data points (nn), the data
array (data[1..2*nn]), and isign, which should be set to either Â±1 and is the sign
of i in the exponential of equation (12.1.7). When isign is set to â1, the routine
thus calculates the inverse transform (12.1.9) â except that it does not multiply by
the normalizing factor 1/N that appears in that equation. You can do that yourself.
Notice that the argument nn is the number of complex data points. The actual

length of the real array (data[1..2*nn]) is 2 times nn, with each complex value
occupying two consecutive locations. In other words, data[1] is the real part of
f0, data[2] is the imaginary part of f0, and so on up to data[2*nn-1], which
is the real part of fNâ1, and data[2*nn], which is the imaginary part of fNâ1.
The FFT routine gives back the Fnâs packed in exactly the same fashion, as nn
complex numbers.
The real and imaginary parts of the zero frequency component F0 are in data[1]
and data[2]; the smallest nonzero positivefrequency has real and imaginary parts in
data[3] and data[4]; the smallest (in magnitude) nonzero negative frequency has
real and imaginary parts in data[2*nn-1] and data[2*nn]. Positive frequencies
increasing in magnitude are stored in the real-imaginary pairs data[5], data[6]
up to data[nn-1], data[nn]. Negative frequencies of increasing magnitude are
stored in data[2*nn-3], data[2*nn-2] down to data[nn+3], data[nn+4].
Finally, the pair data[nn+1], data[nn+2] contain the real and imaginary parts of
the one aliased point that contains the most positive and the most negative frequency.
You should try to develop a familiarity with this storage arrangement of complex
spectra, also shown in Figure 12.2.2, since it is the practical standard.
This is a good place to remind you that you can also use a routine like four1
without modiï¬cation even if your input data array is zero-offset, that is has the range
data[0..2*nn-1]. In this case, simply decrement the pointer to data by one when
four1 is invoked, e.g., four1(data-1,1024,1);. The real part of f0 will now be
returned in data[0], the imaginary part in data[1], and so on. See Â§1.2.

Other FFT Algorithms
We should mention that there are a number of variants on the basic FFT algorithm
given above. As we have seen, that algorithm ï¬rst rearranges the input elements
into bit-reverse order, then builds up the output transform in log2 N iterations. In
the literature, this sequence is called a decimation-in-time or Cooley-Tukey FFT
algorithm. It is also possible to derive FFT algorithms that ï¬rst go through a set of
log2 N iterations on the input data, and rearrange the output values into bit-reverse
order. These are called decimation-in-frequencyor Sande-Tukey FFT algorithms. For
some applications, such as convolution (Â§13.1), one takes a data set into the Fourier
domain and then, after some manipulation,back out again. In these cases it is possible
to avoid all bit reversing. You use a decimation-in-frequency algorithm (without its
bit reversing) to get into the âscrambledâ Fourier domain, do your operations there,
and then use an inverse algorithm (without its bit reversing) to get back to the time
domain. While elegant in principle, this procedure does not in practice save much
computation time, since the bit reversals represent only a small fraction of an FFTâs
operations count, and since most useful operations in the frequency domain require
a knowledge of which points correspond to which frequencies.
Another class of FFTs subdivides the initial data set of length N not all the
way down to the trivial transform of length 1, but rather only down to some other
small power of 2, for example N = 4, base-4 FFTs, or N = 8, base-8 FFTs. These
small transforms are then done by small sections of highly optimized coding which
take advantage of special symmetries of that particular small N. For example, for
N = 4, the trigonometric sines and cosines that enter are all Â±1 or 0, so many
multiplications are eliminated, leaving largely additions and subtractions. These
can be faster than simpler FFTs by some signiï¬cant, but not overwhelming, factor,
e.g., 20 or 30 percent.
There are also FFT algorithms for data sets of length N not a power of
two. They work by using relations analogous to the Danielson-Lanczos Lemma to
subdivide the initial problem into successively smaller problems, not by factors of
2, but by whatever small prime factors happen to divide N. The larger that the
largest prime factor of N is, the worse this method works. If N is prime, then no
subdivision is possible, and the user (whether he knows it or not) is taking a slow
Fourier transform, of order N 2 instead of order N log2 N. Our advice is to stay clear
of such FFT implementations, with perhaps one class of exceptions, the Winograd
Fourier transform algorithms. Winograd algorithms are in some ways analogous to
the base-4 and base-8 FFTs. Winograd has derived highly optimized codings for
taking small-N discrete Fourier transforms, e.g., for N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 16.
The algorithms also use a new and clever way of combining the subfactors. The
method involves a reordering of the data both before the hierarchical processing and
after it, but it allows a signiï¬cant reduction in the number of multiplications in the
algorithm. For some especially favorable values of N, the Winograd algorithms can
be signiï¬cantly (e.g., up to a factor of 2) faster than the simpler FFT algorithms
of the nearest integer power of 2.
This advantage in speed, however, must be
weighed against the considerably more complicated data indexing involved in these
transforms, and the fact that the Winograd transform cannot be done âin place.â
Finally, an interesting class of transforms for doing convolutions quickly are
number theoretic transforms. These schemes replace ï¬oating-point arithmetic with

superior.
On the other hand, their use is somewhat restricted to quantities like

Transforms
It happens frequently that the data whose FFT is desired consist of real-valued

with all imaginary parts set to zero. The resulting transform Fn, n = 0 . . .N â1
satisï¬es FNân* = Fn.
Since this complex-valued array has real values for F0
and FN/2, and (N/2) â1 other independent values F1 . . . FN/2â1, it has the same
2(N/2 â1) + 2 = N âdegrees of freedomâ as the original, real data set. However,
the use of the full complex FFT algorithmfor real data is inefï¬cient, bothin execution
time and in storage required. You would think that there is a better way.
There are two better ways. The ï¬rst is âmass productionâ: Pack two separate
real functions into the input array in such a way that their individual transforms can
be separated from the result. This is implemented in the program twofft below.
This may remind you of a one-cent sale, at which you are coerced to purchase two
of an item when you only need one. However, remember that for correlations and
convolutions the Fourier transforms of two functions are involved, and this is a
handy way to do them both at once. The second method is to pack the real input
array cleverly, without extra zeros, into a complex array of half its length. One then
performs a complex FFT on this shorter length; the trick is then to get the required
answer out of the result. This is done in the program realft below.

Transform of Two Real Functions Simultaneously
First we show how to exploit the symmetry of the transform Fn to handle
two real functions at once: Since the input data fj are real, the components of the
discrete Fourier transform satisfy
FNân = (Fn)*
(12.3.1)
where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. By the same token, the discrete
Fourier transform of a purely imaginary set of gjâs has the opposite symmetry.
GNân = â(Gn)*
(12.3.2)
Therefore we can take the discrete Fourier transform of two real functions each of
length N simultaneously by packing the two data arrays as the real and imaginary
parts, respectively, of the complex input array of four1. Then the resultingtransform
array can be unpacked into two complex arrays with the aid of the two symmetries.
Routine twofft works out these ideas.
void twofft(float data1[], float data2[], float fft1[], float fft2[],
unsigned long n)
Given two real input arrays data1[1..n] and data2[1..n], this routine calls four1 and
returns two complex output arrays, fft1[1..2n] and fft2[1..2n], each of complex length
n (i.e., real length 2*n), which contain the discrete Fourier transforms of the respective data
arrays. n MUST be an integer power of 2.

What about the reverse process? Suppose you have two complex transform
arrays, each of which has the symmetry (12.3.1), so that you know that the inverses
of both transforms are real functions. Can you invert both in a single FFT? This is
even easier than the other direction. Use the fact that the FFT is linear and form
the sum of the ï¬rst transform plus i times the second. Invert using four1 with
isign = â1. The real and imaginary parts of the resulting complex array are the
two desired real functions.
FFT of Single Real Function
To implement the second method, which allows us to perform the FFT of
a single real function without redundancy, we split the data set in half, thereby
forming two real arrays of half the size. We can apply the program above to these
two, but of course the result will not be the transform of the original data. It will
be a schizophrenic combination of two transforms, each of which has half of the
information we need. Fortunately, this schizophrenia is treatable. It works like this:
The right way to split the original data is to take the even-numbered fj as
one data set, and the odd-numbered fj as the other.
The beauty of this is that
we can take the original real array and treat it as a complex array hj of half the
length.
The ï¬rst data set is the real part of this array, and the second is the
imaginary part, as prescribed for twofft. No repacking is required. In other words
hj = f2j + if2j+1,
j = 0, . . ., N/2 â1. We submit this to four1, and it will give
back a complex array Hn = F e
n + iF o
n,
n = 0, . . ., N/2 â1 with
F e
n =
N/2â1
X
k=0
f2k e2Ïikn/(N/2)
F o
n =
N/2â1
X
k=0
f2k+1 e2Ïikn/(N/2)
(12.3.3)
The discussion of program twofft tells you how to separate the two transforms
F e
n and F o
n out of Hn. How do you work them into the transform Fn of the original
data set fj? Simply glance back at equation (12.2.3):
Fn = F e
n + e2Ïin/NF o
n
n = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.4)
Expressed directly in terms of the transform Hn of our real (masquerading as
complex) data set, the result is
Fn = 1
2(Hn + HN/2ân*) âi
2(Hn âHN/2ân*)e2Ïin/N
n = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.5)
A few remarks:
â¢ Since FNân* = Fn there is no point in saving the entire spectrum. The
positive frequency half is sufï¬cient and can be stored in the same array as
the original data. The operation can, in fact, be done in place.
â¢ Even so, we need values Hn, n = 0, . . ., N/2 whereas four1 gives only
the values n = 0, . . ., N/2 â1. Symmetry to the rescue, HN/2 = H0.

â¢ The values F0 and FN/2 are real and independent. In order to actually
get the entire Fn in the original array space, it is convenient to put FN/2
into the imaginary part of F0.
â¢ Despite its complicated form, the process above is invertible. First peel

Calculates the Fourier transform of a set of n real-valued data points. Replaces this data (which
is stored in array data[1..n]) by the positive frequency half of its complex Fourier transform.
The real-valued ï¬rst and last components of the complex transform are returned as elements
data[1] and data[2], respectively. n must be a power of 2. This routine also calculates the
inverse transform of a complex data array if it is the transform of real data. (Result in this case
must be multiplied by 2/n.)

Fast Sine and Cosine Transforms
Among their other uses, the Fourier transforms of functions can be used to solve
differential equations (see Â§19.4). The most common boundary conditions for the
solutions are 1) they have the value zero at the boundaries, or 2) their derivatives
are zero at the boundaries. In the ï¬rst instance, the natural transform to use is the
sine transform, given by
Fk =
Nâ1
X
j=1
fj sin(Ïjk/N)
sine transform
(12.3.7)
where fj, j = 0, . . ., N â1 is the data array, and f0 â¡0.
At ï¬rst blush this appears to be simply the imaginary part of the discrete Fourier
transform. However, the argument of the sine differs by a factor of two from the
value that would make this so. The sine transform uses sines only as a complete set
of functions in the interval from 0 to 2Ï, and, as we shall see, the cosine transform
uses cosines only. By contrast, the normal FFT uses both sines and cosines, but only
half as many of each.
(See Figure 12.3.1.)
The expression (12.3.7) can be âforce-ï¬tâ into a form that allows its calculation
via the FFT. The idea is to extend the given function rightward past its last tabulated
value. We extend the data to twice their length in such a way as to make them an
odd function about j = N, with fN = 0,
f2Nâj â¡âfj
j = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.8)
Consider the FFT of this extended function:
Fk =
2Nâ1
X
j=0
fje2Ïijk/(2N)
(12.3.9)
The half of this sum from j = N to j = 2N â1 can be rewritten with the

Figure 12.3.1. Basis functions used by the Fourier transform (a), sine transform (b), and cosine transform
(c), are plotted. The ï¬rst ï¬ve basis functions are shown in each case. (For the Fourier transform, the real
and imaginary parts of the basis functions are both shown.) While some basis functions occur in more
than one transform, the basis sets are distinct. For example, the sine transform functions labeled (1), (3),
(5) are not present in the Fourier basis. Any of the three sets can expand any function in the interval
shown; however, the sine or cosine transform best expands functions matching the boundary conditions
of the respective basis functions, namely zero function values for sine, zero derivatives for cosine.

Thus, up to a factor 2i we get the sine transform from the FFT of the extended
function.
This method introduces a factor of two inefï¬ciency into the computation by
extending the data.
This inefï¬ciency shows up in the FFT output, which has
zeros for the real part of every element of the transform. For a one-dimensional
problem, the factor of two may be bearable, especially in view of the simplicity
of the method. When we work with partial differential equations in two or three
dimensions, though, the factor becomes four or eight, so efforts to eliminate the
inefï¬ciency are well rewarded.

From the original real data array fj we will construct an auxiliary array yj and
apply to it the routine realft. The output will then be used to construct the desired
transform. For the sine transform of data fj, j = 1, . . ., N â1, the auxiliary array is
y0 = 0
yj = sin(jÏ/N)(fj + fNâj) + 1
2(fj âfNâj)
j = 1, . . ., N â1
(12.3.12)
This array is of the same dimension as the original. Notice that the ï¬rst term is
symmetric about j = N/2 and the second is antisymmetric. Consequently, when
realft is applied to yj, the result has real parts Rk and imaginary parts Ik given by

(12.3.15)

a recursion, the starting point of which follows from setting k = 0 in equation

The sine transform, curiously, is its own inverse. If you apply it twice, you get the
original data, but multiplied by a factor of N/2.
The other common boundary condition for differential equations is that the
derivative of the function is zero at the boundary. In this case the natural transform
is the cosine transform. There are several possible ways of deï¬ning the transform.
Each can be thought of as resulting from a different way of extending a given array
to create an even array of double the length, and/or from whether the extended array
contains 2N â1, 2N, or some other number of points. In practice, only two of the
numerous possibilities are useful so we will restrict ourselves to just these two.
The ï¬rst form of the cosine transform uses N + 1 data points:
Fk = 1
2[f0 + (â1)kfN] +

It results from extending the given array to an even array about j = N, with
f2Nâj = fj,
j = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.18)
If you substitute this extended array into equation (12.3.9),and follow steps analogous
to those leading up to equation (12.3.11), you will ï¬nd that the Fourier transform is

just twice the cosine transform (12.3.17). Another way of thinking about the formula
(12.3.17) is to notice that it is the Chebyshev Gauss-Lobatto quadrature formula (see
Â§4.5), often used in Clenshaw-Curtis adaptive quadrature (see Â§5.9, equation 5.9.4).
Once again the transform can be computed withoutthe factor of two inefï¬ciency.
In this case the auxiliary function is
yj = 1
2(fj + fNâj) âsin(jÏ/N)(fj âfNâj)
j = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.19)
Instead of equation (12.3.15), realft now gives
F2k = Rk
F2k+1 = F2kâ1 + Ik
k = 0, . . ., (N/2 â1)

This sum does not appear naturally among the Rk and Ik, and so we accumulate it
during the generation of the array yj.
Once again this transform is its own inverse, and so the following routine
works for both directions of the transformation. Note that although this form of
the cosine transform has N + 1 input and output values, it passes an array only
of length N to realft.

be multiplied by 2/n.

Here the prime on the summation symbol means that the term for k = 0 has a
coefï¬cient of 1
2 in front. This form arises by extending the given data, deï¬ned for
j = 0, . . ., N â1, to j = N, . . . , 2N â1 in such a way that it is even about the point
N â1
2 and periodic. (It is therefore also even about j = â1
2.) The form (12.3.23)
is related to Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature (see equation 4.5.19), to Chebyshev
approximation (Â§5.8, equation 5.8.7), and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature (Â§5.9).
This form of the cosine transform is useful when solving differential equations
on âstaggeredâ grids, where the variables are centered midway between mesh points.
It is also the standard form in the ï¬eld of data compression and image processing.
The auxiliary function used in this case is similar to equation (12.3.19):
yj = 1
2(fj + fNâjâ1) âsin Ï(j + 1
2)
N
(fj âfNâjâ1)
j = 0, . . ., N â1
(12.3.24)
Carrying out the steps similar to those used to get from (12.3.12) to (12.3.15), we ï¬nd
F2k = cos Ïk
N Rk âsin Ïk
N Ik
(12.3.25)
F2kâ1 = sin Ïk
N Rk + cos Ïk
N Ik + F2k+1
(12.3.26)
Note that equation (12.3.26) gives
FNâ1 = 1
2RN/2
(12.3.27)
Thus the even components are found directly from (12.3.25), while the odd com-
ponents are found by recursing (12.3.26) down from k = N/2 â1, using (12.3.27)
to start.
Since the transform is not self-inverting, we have to reverse the above steps
to ï¬nd the inverse.
Here is the routine:

An alternative way of implementing this algorithm is to form an auxiliary
function by copying the even elements of fj into the ï¬rst N/2 locations, and the
odd elements into the next N/2 elements in reverse order. However, it is not easy
to implement the alternative algorithm without a temporary storage array and we
prefer the above in-place algorithm.
Finally, we mention that there exist fast cosine transforms for small N that do
not rely on an auxiliary function or use an FFT routine. Instead, they carry out the
transform directly, often coded in hardware for ï¬xed N of small dimension [1].

For this to be practical, of course, both N1 and N2 should be some efï¬cient length
for an FFT, usually a power of 2.
Programming a two-dimensional FFT, using
(12.4.2) with a one-dimensional FFT routine, is a bit clumsier than it seems at ï¬rst.
Because the one-dimensional routine requires that its input be in consecutive order
as a one-dimensional complex array, you ï¬nd that you are endlessly copying things
out of the multidimensional input array and then copying things back into it. This
is not recommended technique. Rather, you should use a multidimensional FFT
routine, such as the one we give below.
The generalization of (12.4.1) to more than two dimensions, say to L-
dimensions, is evidently
H(n1, . . ., nL) â¡
NLâ1
X
kL=0
Â· Â· Â·
N1â1
X
k1=0
exp(2ÏikLnL/NL) Ã Â· Â· Â·
Ã exp(2Ïik1n1/N1) h(k1, . . ., kL)
(12.4.3)
where n1 and k1 range from 0 to N1 â1, . . . , nL and kL range from 0 to NL â1.
How many calls to a one-dimensional FFT are in (12.4.3)? Quite a few! For each
value of k1, k2, . . ., kLâ1 you FFT to transform the L index. Then for each value of
k1, k2, . . ., kLâ2 and nL you FFT to transform the L â1 index. And so on. It is
best to rely on someone else having done the bookkeeping for once and for all.
The inverse transforms of (12.4.1) or (12.4.3) are just what you would expect
them to be:
Change the iâs in the exponentials to âiâs, and put an overall
factor of 1/(N1 Ã Â· Â· Â· Ã NL) in front of the whole thing.
Most other features
of multidimensional FFTs are also analogous to features already discussed in the
one-dimensional case:
â¢ Frequencies are arranged in wrap-around order in the transform, but now
for each separate dimension.
â¢ The input data are also treated as if they were wrapped around. If they are
discontinuous across this periodic identiï¬cation (in any dimension) then
the spectrum will have some excess power at high frequencies because
of the discontinuity. The ï¬x, if you care, is to remove multidimensional
linear trends.
â¢ If you are doingspatial ï¬ltering and are worried about wrap-around effects,
then you need to zero-pad all around the border of the multidimensional
array. However, be sure to notice how costly zero-padding is in multidi-
mensional transforms. If you use too thick a zero-pad, you are going to
waste a lot of storage, especially in 3 or more dimensions!
â¢ Aliasing occurs as always if sufï¬cient bandwidth limiting does not exist
along one or more of the dimensions of the transform.
The routine fourn that we furnish herewith is a descendant of one written by N.
M. Brenner. It requires as input (i) a scalar, telling the number of dimensions, e.g.,
2; (ii) a vector, telling the length of the array in each dimension, e.g., (32,64). Note
that these lengths must all be powers of 2, and are the numbers of complex values
in each direction; (iii) the usual scalar equal to Â±1 indicating whether you want the
transform or its inverse; and, ï¬nally (iv) the array of data.
A few words about the data array: fourn accesses it as a one-dimensional
array of real numbers, that is, data[1..(2N1N2 . . .NL)], of length equal to twice

an L-dimensional complex array, with individual components ordered as follows:
(i) each complex value occupies two sequential locations, real part followed by
imaginary; (ii) the ï¬rst subscript changes least rapidly as one goes through the array;
the last subscript changes most rapidly (that is, âstore by rows,â the C norm); (iii)
subscripts range from 1 to their maximum values (N1, N2, . . ., NL, respectively),
rather than from 0 to N1 â1, N2 â1, . . ., NL â1. Almost all failures to get fourn
to work result from improper understanding of the above ordering of the data array,
so take care! (Figure 12.4.1 illustrates the format of the output array.)

nn[1..ndim] is an integer array containing the lengths of each dimension (number of complex
values), which MUST all be powers of 2. data is a real array of length twice the product of
these lengths, in which the data are stored as in a multidimensional complex array: real and
imaginary parts of each element are in consecutive locations, and the rightmost index of the
array increases most rapidly as one proceeds along data. For a two-dimensional array, this is
equivalent to storing the array by rows. If isign is input as â1, data is replaced by its inverse
transform times the product of the lengths of all dimensions.

12.5 Fourier Transforms of Real Data in Two
and Three Dimensions
Two-dimensional FFTs are particularly important in the ï¬eld of image process-
ing. An image is usually represented as a two-dimensional array of pixel intensities,
real (and usually positive) numbers. One commonly desires to ï¬lter high, or low,
frequency spatial components from an image; or to convolve or deconvolve the
image with some instrumental point spread function. Use of the FFT is by far the
most efï¬cient technique.
In three dimensions, a common use of the FFT is to solve Poissonâs equation
for a potential (e.g., electromagnetic or gravitational) on a three-dimensional lattice
that represents the discretization of three-dimensional space. Here the source terms
(mass or charge distribution) and the desired potentials are also real. In two and
three dimensions, with large arrays, memory is often at a premium. It is therefore
important to perform the FFTs, insofar as possible, on the data âin place.â
We
want a routine with functionalitysimilar to the multidimensional FFT routine fourn
(Â§12.4), but which operates on real, not complex, input data.
We give such a
routine in this section. The development is analogous to that of Â§12.3 leading to
the one-dimensional routine realft. (You might wish to review that material at
this point, particularly equation 12.3.5.)
It is convenient to think of the independent variables n1, . . ., nL in equation

12.5 Fourier Transforms of Real Data in Two
and Three Dimensions
Two-dimensional FFTs are particularly important in the ï¬eld of image process-
ing. An image is usually represented as a two-dimensional array of pixel intensities,
real (and usually positive) numbers. One commonly desires to ï¬lter high, or low,
frequency spatial components from an image; or to convolve or deconvolve the
image with some instrumental point spread function. Use of the FFT is by far the
most efï¬cient technique.
In three dimensions, a common use of the FFT is to solve Poissonâs equation
for a potential (e.g., electromagnetic or gravitational) on a three-dimensional lattice
that represents the discretization of three-dimensional space. Here the source terms
(mass or charge distribution) and the desired potentials are also real. In two and
three dimensions, with large arrays, memory is often at a premium. It is therefore
important to perform the FFTs, insofar as possible, on the data âin place.â
We
want a routine with functionalitysimilar to the multidimensional FFT routine fourn
(Â§12.4), but which operates on real, not complex, input data.
We give such a
routine in this section. The development is analogous to that of Â§12.3 leading to
the one-dimensional routine realft. (You might wish to review that material at
this point, particularly equation 12.3.5.)
It is convenient to think of the independent variables n1, . . ., nL in equation
(12.4.3) as representing an L-dimensional vector ân in wave-number space, with
values on the lattice of integers.
The transform H(n1, . . ., nL) is then denoted
H(ân).
It is easy to see that the transform H(ân) is periodic in each of its L dimensions.
Speciï¬cally, if âP1, âP2, âP3, . . . denote the vectors (N1, 0, 0, . . .), (0, N2, 0, . . .),
(0, 0, N3, . . .), and so forth, then
H(ân Â± âPj) = H(ân)
j = 1, . . ., L
(12.5.1)
Equation (12.5.1) holds for any input data, real or complex. When the data is real,
we have the additional symmetry
H(âân) = H(ân)*
(12.5.2)
Equations (12.5.1) and (12.5.2) imply that the full transform can be triviallyobtained
from the subset of lattice values ân that have
0 â¤n1 â¤N1 â1

In fact, this set of values is overcomplete, because there are additional symmetry
relations among the transform values that have nL = 0 and nL = NL/2. However
these symmetries are complicated and their use becomes extremely confusing.
Therefore, we will compute our FFT on the lattice subset of equation (12.5.3),
even though this requires a small amount of extra storage for the answer, i.e., the
transform is not quite âin place.â (Although an in-place transform is in fact possible,
we have found it virtually impossible to explain to any user how to unscramble its
output, i.e., where to ï¬nd the real and imaginary components of the transform at
some particular frequency!)
We will implement the multidimensional real Fourier transform for the three
dimensional case L = 3, with the input data stored as a real, three-dimensional array
data[1..nn1][1..nn2][1..nn3]. This scheme will allow two-dimensional data
to be processed with effectively no loss of efï¬ciency simply by choosing nn1 = 1.
(Note that it must be the ï¬rst dimension that is set to 1.) The output spectrum comes
back packaged, logically at least, as a complex, three-dimensional array that we can
call SPEC[1..nn1][1..nn2][1..nn3/2+1] (cf. equation 12.5.3). In the ï¬rst two
of its three dimensions, the respective frequency values f1 or f2 are stored in wrap-
around order, that is with zero frequency in the ï¬rst index value, the smallest positive
frequency in the second index value, the smallest negative frequency in the last
index value, and so on (cf. the discussion leading up to routines four1 and fourn).
The third of the three dimensions returns only the positive half of the frequency
spectrum. Figure 12.5.1 shows the logical storage scheme. The returned portion of
the complex output spectrum is shown as the unshaded part of the lower ï¬gure.
The physical, as opposed to logical, packaging of the output spectrum is neces-
sarily a bit different from the logical packaging, because C does not have a convenient,
portable mechanism for equivalencing real and complex arrays. The subscript range
SPEC[1..nn1][1..nn2][1..nn3/2]is returned in the input array data[1..nn1]
[1..nn2][1..nn3], with the correspondence
Re(SPEC[i1][i2][i3]) = data[i1][i2][2*i3-1]
Im(SPEC[i1][i2][i3]) = data[i1][i2][2*i3]
(12.5.4)
The remaining âplaneâ of values, SPEC[1..nn1][1..nn2][nn3/2+1], is returned
in the two-dimensional float array speq[1..nn1][1..2*nn2],with the corre-
spondence
Re(SPEC[i1][i2][nn3/2+1]) = speq[i1][2*i2-1]
Im(SPEC[i1][i2][nn3/2+1]) = speq[i1][2*i2]
(12.5.5)
Note that speq contains frequency components whose third component f3 is at
the Nyquist critical frequency Â±fc. In some applications these values will in fact
be ignored or set to zero, since they are intrinsically aliased between positive and
negative frequencies.
With this much introduction, the implementing procedure, called rlft3, is
something of an anticlimax. Look in the innermost loop in the procedure, and you
will see equation (12.3.5) implemented on the last transform index. The case of
i3=1 is coded separately, to account for the fact that speq is to be ï¬lled instead of

f1 and f2 being stored in wrap-around order, but only positive f3 values being stored (others being
obtainable by symmetry). The output data is actually returned mostly in the input array data, but partly
stored in the real array speq[1..nn1][1..2*nn2]. See text for details.

overwriting the input array of data. The three enclosing for loops (indices i2, i3,
and i1, from inside to outside) could in fact be done in any order â their actions all
commute. We chose the order shown because of the following considerations: (i) i3
should not be the inner loop, because if it is, then the recurrence relations on wr and
wi become burdensome. (ii) On virtual-memory machines, i1 should be the outer
loop, because (with C order of array storage) this results in the array data, which
might be very large, being accessed in block sequential order.
Note that the work done in rlft3 is quite (logarithmically) small, compared to
the associated complex FFT, fourn. Since C does not have a convenient complex
type, the operations are carried out explicitly below in terms of real and imaginary
parts. The routine rlft3 is based on an earlier routine by G.B. Rybicki.
#include <math.h>
void rlft3(float ***data, float **speq, unsigned long nn1, unsigned long nn2,
unsigned long nn3, int isign)
Given a three-dimensional real array data[1..nn1][1..nn2][1..nn3] (where nn1 = 1 for
the case of a logically two-dimensional array), this routine returns (for isign=1) the complex
fast Fourier transform as two complex arrays: On output, data contains the zero and positive
frequency values of the third frequency component, while speq[1..nn1][1..2*nn2] contains
the Nyquist critical frequency values of the third frequency component. First (and second)
frequency components are stored for zero, positive, and negative frequencies, in standard wrap-
around order. See text for description of how complex values are arranged. For isign=-1, the
inverse transform (times nn1*nn2*nn3/2 as a constant multiplicative factor) is performed,
with output data (viewed as a real array) deriving from input data (viewed as complex) and
speq. For inverse transforms on data not generated ï¬rst by a forward transform, make sure
the complex input data array satisï¬es property (12.5.2). The dimensions nn1, nn2, nn3 must
always be integer powers of 2.

use of rlft3 for two- and three-dimensional data. Note again that the routine does
not actually distinguish between two and three dimensions; two is treated like three,
but with the ï¬rst dimension having length 1. Since the ï¬rst dimension is the outer
loop, virtually no inefï¬ciency is introduced.

12.6 External Storage or Memory-Local FFTs
Sometime in your life, you might have to compute the Fourier transform of a really
large data set, larger than the size of your computerâs physical memory. In such a case,
the data will be stored on some external medium, such as magnetic or optical tape or disk.
Needed is an algorithm that makes some manageable number of sequential passes through
the external data, processing it on the ï¬y and outputting intermediate results to other external
media, which can be read on subsequent passes.
In fact, an algorithm of just this description was developed by Singleton [1] very soon
after the discovery of the FFT. The algorithm requires four sequential storage devices, each
capable of holding half of the input data. The ï¬rst half of the input data is initially on one
device, the second half on another.
Singletonâs algorithm is based on the observation that it is possible to bit-reverse 2M
values by the following sequence of operations: On the ï¬rst pass, values are read alternately
from the two input devices, and written to a single output device (until it holds half the data),
and then to the other output device. On the second pass, the output devices become input
devices, and vice versa. Now, we copy two values from the ï¬rst device, then two values
from the second, writing them (as before) ï¬rst to ï¬ll one output device, then to ï¬ll a second.
Subsequent passes read 4, 8, etc., input values at a time. After completion of pass M â1,
the data are in bit-reverse order.
Singletonâs next observation is that it is possible to alternate the passes of essentially
this bit-reversal technique with passes that implement one stage of the Danielson-Lanczos
combination formula (12.2.3). The scheme, roughly, is this: One starts as before with half
the input data on one device, half on another. In the ï¬rst pass, one complex value is read
from each input device. Two combinations are formed, and one is written to each of two
output devices. After this âcomputingâ pass, the devices are rewound, and a âpermutationâ
pass is performed, where groups of values are read from the ï¬rst input device and alternately
written to the ï¬rst and second output devices; when the ï¬rst input device is exhausted, the
second is similarly processed. This sequenceof computing and permutation passesis repeated
M âK â1 times, where 2K is the size of internal buffer available to the program. The
second phase of the computation consists of a ï¬nal K computation passes. What distinguishes
the second phase from the ï¬rst is that, now, the permutations are local enough to do in place
during the computation. There are thus no separate permutation passes in the second phase.
In all, there are 2M âK â2 passes through the data.

12.6 External Storage or Memory-Local FFTs
Sometime in your life, you might have to compute the Fourier transform of a really
large data set, larger than the size of your computerâs physical memory. In such a case,
the data will be stored on some external medium, such as magnetic or optical tape or disk.
Needed is an algorithm that makes some manageable number of sequential passes through
the external data, processing it on the ï¬y and outputting intermediate results to other external
media, which can be read on subsequent passes.
In fact, an algorithm of just this description was developed by Singleton [1] very soon
after the discovery of the FFT. The algorithm requires four sequential storage devices, each
capable of holding half of the input data. The ï¬rst half of the input data is initially on one
device, the second half on another.
Singletonâs algorithm is based on the observation that it is possible to bit-reverse 2M
values by the following sequence of operations: On the ï¬rst pass, values are read alternately
from the two input devices, and written to a single output device (until it holds half the data),
and then to the other output device. On the second pass, the output devices become input
devices, and vice versa. Now, we copy two values from the ï¬rst device, then two values
from the second, writing them (as before) ï¬rst to ï¬ll one output device, then to ï¬ll a second.
Subsequent passes read 4, 8, etc., input values at a time. After completion of pass M â1,
the data are in bit-reverse order.
Singletonâs next observation is that it is possible to alternate the passes of essentially
this bit-reversal technique with passes that implement one stage of the Danielson-Lanczos
combination formula (12.2.3). The scheme, roughly, is this: One starts as before with half
the input data on one device, half on another. In the ï¬rst pass, one complex value is read
from each input device. Two combinations are formed, and one is written to each of two
output devices. After this âcomputingâ pass, the devices are rewound, and a âpermutationâ
pass is performed, where groups of values are read from the ï¬rst input device and alternately
written to the ï¬rst and second output devices; when the ï¬rst input device is exhausted, the
second is similarly processed. This sequenceof computing and permutation passesis repeated
M âK â1 times, where 2K is the size of internal buffer available to the program. The
second phase of the computation consists of a ï¬nal K computation passes. What distinguishes
the second phase from the ï¬rst is that, now, the permutations are local enough to do in place
during the computation. There are thus no separate permutation passes in the second phase.

For one-dimensional data, Singletonâs algorithm produces output in exactly the same
order as a standardFFT (e.g., four1). Formultidimensional data, the outputis the transposeof
the conventionalarrangement(e.g., the output of fourn). This peculiarity, which is intrinsic to
the method, is generally only a minor inconvenience. For convolutions, one simply computes
the component-by-component product of two transforms in their nonstandard arrangement,
and then does an inverse transform on the result. Note that, if the lengths of the different
dimensions are not all the same, then you must reverse the order of the valuesin nn[1..ndim]
(thus giving the transpose dimensions) before performing the inverse transform. Note also
that, just like fourn, performing a transform and then an inverse results in multiplying the
original data by the product of the lengths of all dimensions.
We leave it as an exercise for the reader to ï¬gure out how to reorder fourfsâs output
into normal order, taking additional passes through the externally stored data. We doubt that
such reordering is ever really needed.
You will likely want to modify fourfs to ï¬t your particular application. For example,
as written, KBF â¡2K plays the dual role of being the size of the internal buffers, and the
record size of the unformatted reads and writes. The latter role limits its size to that allowed
by your machineâs I/O facility. It is a simple matter to perform multiple reads for a much
larger KBF, thus reducing the number of passes by a few.
Another modiï¬cation of fourfs would be for the case where your virtual memory
machine has sufï¬cient address space, but not sufï¬cient physical memory, to do an efï¬cient
FFT by the conventional algorithm (whose memory references are extremely nonlocal). In
that case, you will need to replace the reads, writes, and rewinds by mappings of the arrays

references to a single data array, with offsets that get modiï¬ed wherever fourfs performs an
I/O operation. The resulting algorithm will have its memory references local within blocks
of size KBF. Execution speed is thereby sometimes increased enormously, albeit at the cost
of requiring twice as much virtual memory as an in-place FFT.

Fourier and Spectral
Applications
13.0 Introduction
Fourier methods have revolutionized ï¬elds of science and engineering, from
radio astronomy to medical imaging, from seismology to spectroscopy.
In this
chapter, we present some of the basic applications of Fourier and spectral methods
that have made these revolutions possible.
Say the word âFourierâ to a numericist, and the response, as if by Pavlovian
conditioning, will likely be âFFT.â Indeed, the wide application of Fourier methods
must be credited principally to the existence of the fast Fourier transform. Better
mousetraps stand aside: If you speed up any nontrivial algorithm by a factor of a
million or so, the world will beat a path towards ï¬nding useful applications for it.
The most direct applications of the FFT are to the convolution or deconvolution of
data (Â§13.1), correlation and autocorrelation (Â§13.2), optimal ï¬ltering (Â§13.3), power
spectrum estimation (Â§13.4), and the computation of Fourier integrals (Â§13.9).
As important as they are, however, FFT methods are not the be-all and end-all
of spectral analysis. Section 13.5 is a brief introduction to the ï¬eld of time-domain
digital ï¬lters. In the spectral domain, one limitation of the FFT is that it always
represents a functionâs Fourier transform as a polynomial in z = exp(2Ïifâ)
(cf. equation 12.1.7).
Sometimes, processes have spectra whose shapes are not
well represented by this form. An alternative form, which allows the spectrum to
have poles in z, is used in the techniques of linear prediction (Â§13.6) and maximum
entropy spectral estimation (Â§13.7).
Another signiï¬cant limitation of all FFT methods is that they require the input
data to be sampled at evenly spaced intervals.
For irregularly or incompletely
sampled data, other (albeit slower) methods are available, as discussed in Â§13.8.
So-called wavelet methods inhabit a representation of function space that is
neither in the temporal, nor in the spectral, domain, but rather something in-between.
Section 13.10 is an introduction to this subject. Finally Â§13.11 is an excursion into
numerical use of the Fourier sampling theorem.

13.1 Convolution and Deconvolution Using
the FFT
We have deï¬ned the convolution of two functions for the continuous case in
equation (12.0.8), and have given the convolution theorem as equation (12.0.9). The
theorem says that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is equal
to the product of their individual Fourier transforms. Now, we want to deal with
the discrete case. We will mention ï¬rst the context in which convolution is a useful
procedure, and then discuss how to compute it efï¬ciently using the FFT.
The convolutionof two functions r(t) and s(t), denoted r âs, is mathematically
equal to their convolution in the opposite order, s âr.
Nevertheless, in most
applications the two functions have quite different meanings and characters. One of
the functions, say s, is typically a signal or data stream, which goes on indeï¬nitely
in time (or in whatever the appropriate independent variable may be). The other
function r is a âresponse function,â typically a peaked function that falls to zero in
both directions from its maximum. The effect of convolution is to smear the signal
s(t) in time according to the recipe provided by the response function r(t), as shown
in Figure 13.1.1. In particular, a spike or delta-function of unit area in s which occurs
at some time t0 is supposed to be smeared into the shape of the response function
itself, but translated from time 0 to time t0 as r(t ât0).
In the discrete case, the signal s(t) is represented by its sampled values at equal
time intervals sj. The response function is also a discrete set of numbers rk, with the
followinginterpretation: r0 tells what multipleof the input signal in one channel (one
particular value of j) is copied into the identical output channel (same value of j);
r1 tells what multiple of input signal in channel j is additionally copied into output
channel j + 1; râ1 tells the multiple that is copied into channel j â1; and so on for
both positive and negative values of k in rk. Figure 13.1.2 illustrates the situation.
Example: a response function with r0 = 1 and all other rkâs equal to zero
is just the identity ï¬lter: convolution of a signal with this response function gives
identically the signal. Another example is the response function with r14 = 1.5 and
all other rkâs equal to zero. This produces convolved output that is the input signal
multiplied by 1.5 and delayed by 14 sample intervals.
Evidently, we have just described in words the following deï¬nition of discrete
convolution with a response function of ï¬nite duration M:
(r âs)j â¡
M/2
X
k=âM/2+1
sjâk rk
(13.1.1)
If a discrete response function is nonzero only in some range âM/2 < k â¤M/2,
where M is a sufï¬ciently large even integer, then the response function is called a
ï¬nite impulse response (FIR), and its duration is M. (Notice that we are deï¬ning M
as the number of nonzero values of rk; these values span a time interval of M â1
sampling times.) In most practical circumstances the case of ï¬nite M is the case of
interest, either because the response really has a ï¬nite duration, or because we choose
to truncate it at some point and approximate it by a ï¬nite-durationresponse function.
The discrete convolution theorem is this: If a signal sj is periodic with period
N, so that it is completely determined by the N values s0, . . ., sNâ1, then its

both directions from its maximum. The effect of convolution is to smear the signal
s(t) in time according to the recipe provided by the response function r(t), as shown
in Figure 13.1.1. In particular, a spike or delta-function of unit area in s which occurs
at some time t0 is supposed to be smeared into the shape of the response function
itself, but translated from time 0 to time t0 as r(t ât0).
In the discrete case, the signal s(t) is represented by its sampled values at equal
time intervals sj. The response function is also a discrete set of numbers rk, with the
followinginterpretation: r0 tells what multipleof the input signal in one channel (one
particular value of j) is copied into the identical output channel (same value of j);
r1 tells what multiple of input signal in channel j is additionally copied into output
channel j + 1; râ1 tells the multiple that is copied into channel j â1; and so on for
both positive and negative values of k in rk. Figure 13.1.2 illustrates the situation.
Example: a response function with r0 = 1 and all other rkâs equal to zero
is just the identity ï¬lter: convolution of a signal with this response function gives
identically the signal. Another example is the response function with r14 = 1.5 and
all other rkâs equal to zero. This produces convolved output that is the input signal
multiplied by 1.5 and delayed by 14 sample intervals.
Evidently, we have just described in words the following deï¬nition of discrete
convolution with a response function of ï¬nite duration M:
(r âs)j â¡
M/2
X
k=âM/2+1
sjâk rk
(13.1.1)
If a discrete response function is nonzero only in some range âM/2 < k â¤M/2,
where M is a sufï¬ciently large even integer, then the response function is called a
ï¬nite impulse response (FIR), and its duration is M. (Notice that we are deï¬ning M
as the number of nonzero values of rk; these values span a time interval of M â1
sampling times.) In most practical circumstances the case of ï¬nite M is the case of
interest, either because the response really has a ï¬nite duration, or because we choose
to truncate it at some point and approximate it by a ï¬nite-durationresponse function.
The discrete convolution theorem is this: If a signal sj is periodic with period
N, so that it is completely determined by the N values s0, . . ., sNâ1, then its

Here Sn, (n = 0, . . ., N â1) is the discrete Fourier transform of the values
sj, (j = 0, . . ., N â1), while Rn, (n = 0, . . ., N â1) is the discrete Fourier
transform of the values rk, (k = 0, . . ., N â1). These values of rk are the same
ones as for the range k = âN/2 + 1, . . ., N/2, but in wrap-around order, exactly
as was described at the end of Â§12.2.
Treatment of End Effects by Zero Padding
The discrete convolution theorem presumes a set of two circumstances that
are not universal. First, it assumes that the input signal is periodic, whereas real
data often either go forever without repetition or else consist of one nonperiodic
stretch of ï¬nite length. Second, the convolution theorem takes the duration of the
response to be the same as the period of the data; they are both N. We need to
work around these two constraints.
The second is very straightforward.
Almost always, one is interested in a
response function whose duration M is much shorter than the length of the data
set N.
In this case, you simply extend the response function to length N by
padding it with zeros, i.e., deï¬ne rk = 0 for M/2 â¤k â¤N/2 and also for
âN/2 + 1 â¤k â¤âM/2 + 1. Dealing with the ï¬rst constraint is more challenging.
Since the convolution theorem rashly assumes that the data are periodic, it will
falsely âpolluteâ the ï¬rst output channel (r âs)0 with some wrapped-around data
from the far end of the data stream sNâ1, sNâ2, etc.
(See Figure 13.1.3.)
So,
we need to set up a buffer zone of zero-padded values at the end of the sj vector,
in order to make this pollution zero. How many zero values do we need in this
buffer? Exactly as many as the most negative index for which the response function
is nonzero. For example, if râ3 is nonzero, while râ4, râ5, . . . are all zero, then we
need three zero pads at the end of the data: sNâ3 = sNâ2 = sNâ1 = 0. These
zeros will protect the ï¬rst output channel (r âs)0 from wrap-around pollution. It
should be obvious that the second output channel (r âs)1 and subsequent ones will
also be protected by these same zeros. Let K denote the number of padding zeros,
so that the last actual input data point is sNâKâ1.
What now about pollution of the very last output channel?
Since the data
now end with sNâKâ1, the last output channel of interest is (r âs)NâKâ1. This
channel can be polluted by wrap-around from input channel s0 unless the number
K is also large enough to take care of the most positive index k for which the
response function rk is nonzero. For example, if r0 through r6 are nonzero, while
r7, r8 . . . are all zero, then we need at least K = 6 padding zeros at the end of the
data: sNâ6 = . . . = sNâ1 = 0.
To summarize â we need to pad the data with a number of zeros on one
end equal to the maximum positive duration or maximum negative duration of
the response function, whichever is larger. (For a symmetric response function of
duration M, you will need only M/2 zero pads.) Combining this operation with the

padding of the response rk described above, we effectively insulate the data from
artifacts of undesired periodicity. Figure 13.1.4 illustrates matters.
Use of FFT for Convolution
The data, complete with zero padding, are now a set of real numbers sj, j =
0, . . ., N â1, and the response function is zero padded out to duration N and
arranged in wrap-around order. (Generally this means that a large contiguous section
of the rkâs, in the middle of that array, is zero, with nonzero values clustered at
the two extreme ends of the array.) You now compute the discrete convolution as
follows: Use the FFT algorithm to compute the discrete Fourier transform of s and
of r. Multiply the two transforms together component by component, remembering
that the transforms consist of complex numbers. Then use the FFT algorithm to
take the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the products.
The answer is the
convolution r âs.
What about deconvolution?
Deconvolution is the process of undoing the
smearing in a data set that has occurred under the inï¬uence of a known response
function, for example, because of the known effect of a less-than-perfect measuring
apparatus. The deï¬ningequationof deconvolutionisthe same as that forconvolution,
namely (13.1.1), except now the left-hand side is taken to be known, and (13.1.1) is
to be considered as a set of N linear equations for the unknown quantitiessj. Solving
these simultaneous linear equations in the time domain of (13.1.1) is unrealistic in
most cases, but the FFT renders the problem almost trivial. Instead of multiplying
the transform of the signal and response to get the transform of the convolution, we
just divide the transform of the (known) convolutionby the transform of the response
to get the transform of the deconvolved signal.
This procedure can go wrong mathematically if the transform of the response
function is exactly zero for some value Rn, so that we canât divide by it. This
indicates that the original convolution has truly lost all information at that one
frequency, so that a reconstruction of that frequency component is not possible.
You should be aware, however, that apart from mathematical problems, the process
of deconvolution has other practical shortcomings. The process is generally quite
sensitive to noise in the input data, and to the accuracy to which the response function
rk is known. Perfectly reasonable attempts at deconvolution can sometimes produce
nonsense for these reasons. In such cases you may want to make use of the additional
process of optimal ï¬ltering, which is discussed in Â§13.3.
Here is our routine for convolution and deconvolution, using the FFT as
implemented in four1 of Â§12.2. Since the data and response functions are real,
not complex, both of their transforms can be taken simultaneously using twofft.
Note, however, that two calls to realft should be substituted if data and respns
have very different magnitudes, to minimize roundoff. The data are assumed to be
stored in a float array data[1..n], with n an integer power of two. The response
function is assumed to be stored in wrap-around order in a sub-array respns[1..m]
of the array respns[1..n]. The value of m can be any odd integer less than or equal
to n, since the ï¬rst thing the program does is to recopy the response function into the
appropriate wrap-around order in respns[1..n]. The answer is provided in ans.

Convolving or Deconvolving Very Large Data Sets
If your data set is so long that you do not want to ï¬t it into memory all at
once, then you must break it up into sections and convolve each section separately.
Now, however, the treatment of end effects is a bit different. You have to worry
not only about spurious wrap-around effects, but also about the fact that the ends of
each section of data should have been inï¬uenced by data at the nearby ends of the
immediately preceding and following sections of data, but were not so inï¬uenced
since only one section of data is in the machine at a time.
There are two, related, standard solutions to this problem.
Both are fairly
obvious, so with a few words of description here, you ought to be able to implement
them for yourself.
The ï¬rst solution is called the overlap-save method.
In this
technique you pad only the very beginning of the data with enough zeros to avoid
wrap-around pollution. After this initial padding, you forget about zero padding

altogether. Bring in a section of data and convolve or deconvolve it. Then throw
out the points at each end that are polluted by wrap-around end effects. Output only
the remaining good points in the middle. Now bring in the next section of data, but
not all new data. The ï¬rst points in each new section overlap the last points from
the preceding section of data. The sections must be overlapped sufï¬ciently so that
the polluted output points at the end of one section are recomputed as the ï¬rst of the
unpolluted output points from the subsequent section. With a bit of thought you can
easily determine how many points to overlap and save.
The second solution, called the overlap-add method, is illustrated in Figure
13.1.5.
Here you donât overlap the input data.
Each section of data is disjoint
from the others and is used exactly once. However, you carefully zero-pad it at
both ends so that there is no wrap-around ambiguity in the output convolution or
deconvolution. Now you overlap and add these sections of output. Thus, an output
point near the end of one section will have the response due to the input points at
the beginning of the next section of data properly added in to it, and likewise for an
output point near the beginning of a section, mutatis mutandis.
Even when computer memory is available,there is some slight gain incomputing
speed in segmenting a long data set, since the FFTsâ N log2 N is slightly slower than
linear in N. However, the log term is so slowly varying that you will often be much
happier to avoid the bookkeeping complexities of the overlap-add or overlap-save
methods: If it is practical to do so, just cram the whole data set into memory and
FFT away. Then you will have more time for the ï¬ner things in life, some of which
are described in succeeding sections of this chapter.

13.2 Correlation and Autocorrelation Using
the FFT
Correlation is the close mathematical cousin of convolution. It is in some
ways simpler, however, because the two functions that go into a correlation are not
as conceptually distinct as were the data and response functions that entered into
convolution. Rather, in correlation, the functions are represented by different, but
generally similar, data sets. We investigate their âcorrelation,â by comparing them
both directly superposed, and with one of them shifted left or right.
We have already deï¬ned in equation (12.0.10) the correlation between two
continuous functions g(t) and h(t), which is denoted Corr(g, h), and is a function
of lag t. We will occasionally show this time dependence explicitly, with the rather
awkward notation Corr(g, h)(t).
The correlation will be large at some value of
t if the ï¬rst function (g) is a close copy of the second (h) but lags it in time by
t, i.e., if the ï¬rst function is shifted to the right of the second.
Likewise, the
correlation will be large for some negative value of t if the ï¬rst function leads the
second, i.e., is shifted to the left of the second. The relation that holds when the
two functions are interchanged is

large as Â±K, then you must append a buffer zone of K zeros at the end of both
input data sets. If you want all possible lags from N data points (not a usual thing),
then you will need to pad the data with an equal number of zeros; this is the extreme
case.
So here is the program:
#include "nrutil.h"
void correl(float data1[], float data2[], unsigned long n, float ans[])
Computes the correlation of two real data sets data1[1..n] and data2[1..n] (including any
user-supplied zero padding). n MUST be an integer power of two. The answer is returned as
the ï¬rst n points in ans[1..2*n] stored in wrap-around order, i.e., correlations at increasingly
negative lags are in ans[n] on down to ans[n/2+1], while correlations at increasingly positive
lags are in ans[1] (zero lag) on up to ans[n/2]. Note that ans must be supplied in the calling
program with length at least 2*n, since it is also used as working space. Sign convention of
this routine: if data1 lags data2, i.e., is shifted to the right of it, then ans will show a peak
at positive lags.

void realft(float data[], unsigned long n, int isign);

}
ans[2]=ans[n+1];

realft(ans,n,-1);

free_vector(fft,1,n<<1);
}
As in convlv, it would be better to substitute two calls to realft for the one
call to twofft, if data1 and data2 have very different magnitudes, to minimize
roundoff error.
The discrete autocorrelation of a sampled function gj is just the discrete
correlation of the function with itself. Obviously this is always symmetric with
respect to positive and negative lags. Feel free to use the above routine correl
to obtain autocorrelations, simply calling it with the same data vector in both
arguments. If the inefï¬ciency bothers you, routine realft can, of course, be used
to transform the data vector instead.

13.3 Optimal (Wiener) Filtering with the FFT
There are a number of other tasks in numerical processing that are routinely
handled with Fourier techniques. One of these is ï¬ltering for the removal of noise
from a âcorruptedâ signal. The particular situationwe consider is this: There is some
underlying, uncorrupted signal u(t) that we want to measure. The measurement
process is imperfect, however, and what comes out of our measurement device is a
corrupted signal c(t). The signal c(t) may be less than perfect in either or both of
two respects. First, the apparatus may not have a perfect âdelta-functionâ response,
so that the true signal u(t) is convolved with (smeared out by) some known response
function r(t) to give a smeared signal s(t),
s(t) =

Second, the
measured signal c(t) may contain an additional component of noise n(t),
c(t) = s(t) + n(t)
(13.3.2)
We already know how to deconvolve the effects of the response function r in
the absence of any noise (Â§13.1); we just divide C(f) by R(f) to get a deconvolved
signal. We now want to treat the analogous problem when noise is present. Our
task is to ï¬nd the optimal ï¬lter, Ï(t) or Î¦(f), which, when applied to the measured
signal c(t) or C(f), and then deconvolved by r(t) or R(f), produces a signal eu(t)
or eU(f) that is as close as possible to the uncorrupted signal u(t) or U(f). In other
words we will estimate the true signal U by

is minimized with respect to Î¦(f) at every value of f. Let us search for such a
solution where Î¦(f) is a real function. Differentiating with respect to Î¦, and setting
the result equal to zero gives
Î¦(f) =
|S(f)|2
|S(f)|2 + |N(f)|2
(13.3.6)
This is the formula for the optimal ï¬lter Î¦(f).
Notice that equation (13.3.6) involves S, the smeared signal, and N, the noise.
The two of these add up to be C, the measured signal. Equation (13.3.6) does not
contain U, the âtrueâ signal. This makes for an important simpliï¬cation: The optimal
ï¬lter can be determined independently of the determination of the deconvolution
function that relates S and U.
To determine the optimal ï¬lter from equation (13.3.6) we need some way
of separately estimating |S|2 and |N|2.
There is no way to do this from the
measured signal C alone without some other information, or some assumption or
guess.
Luckily, the extra information is often easy to obtain. For example, we
can sample a long stretch of data c(t) and plot its power spectral density using
equations (12.0.14), (12.1.8), and (12.1.5). This quantity is proportional to the sum
|S|2 + |N|2, so we have
|S(f)|2 + |N(f)|2 âPc(f) = |C(f)|2
0 â¤f < fc
(13.3.7)
(More sophisticated methods of estimating the power spectral density will be
discussed in Â§13.4 and Â§13.7, but the estimation above is almost always good enough
for the optimal ï¬lter problem.) The resulting plot (see Figure 13.3.1) will often
immediately show the spectral signature of a signal sticking up above a continuous
noise spectrum. The noise spectrum may be ï¬at, or tilted, or smoothly varying; it
doesnât matter, as long as we can guess a reasonable hypothesis as to what it is.
Draw a smooth curve through the noise spectrum, extrapolating it into the region
dominated by the signal as well. Now draw a smooth curve through the signal plus
noise power. The difference between these two curves is your smooth âmodelâ of
the signal power. The quotient of your model of signal power to your model of
signal plus noise power is the optimal ï¬lter Î¦(f). [Extend it to negative values of f
by the formula Î¦(âf) = Î¦(f).] Notice that Î¦(f) will be close to unity where the
noise is negligible, and close to zero where the noise is dominant. That is how it
does its job! The intermediate dependence given by equation (13.3.6) just turns out
to be the optimal way of going in between these two extremes.
Because the optimal ï¬lter results from a minimization problem, the quality of
the results obtained by optimal ï¬ltering differs from the true optimum by an amount
that is second order in the precision to which the optimal ï¬lter is determined. In other
words, even a fairly crudely determined optimal ï¬lter (sloppy, say, at the 10 percent
level) can give excellent results when it is applied to data. That is why the separation
of the measured signal C into signal and noise components S and N can usefully be
done âby eyeâ from a crude plot of power spectral density. All of this may give you
thoughts about iterating the procedure we have just described. For example, after
designing a ï¬lter with response Î¦(f) and using it to make a respectable guess at the
signal eU(f) = Î¦(f)C(f)/R(f), you might turn about and regard eU(f) as a fresh

ï¬nite, sampled stretch of it. In this section weâll do roughly the same thing, but with
considerably greater attention to details. Our attention will uncover some surprises.
The ï¬rst detail is power spectrum (also called a power spectral density or
PSD) normalization. In general there is some relation of proportionality between a
measure of the squared amplitude of the function and a measure of the amplitude
of the PSD. Unfortunately there are several different conventions for describing
the normalization in each domain, and many opportunities for getting wrong the
relationship between the two domains. Suppose that our function c(t) is sampled at
N points to produce values c0 . . . cNâ1, and that these points span a range of time
T, that is T = (N â1)â, where âis the sampling interval. Then here are several
different descriptions of the total power:
Nâ1
X
j=0
|cj|2 â¡âsum squared amplitudeâ

Z T
0
|c(t)|2 dt ââ
Nâ1
X
j=0
|cj|2 â¡âtime-integral squared amplitudeâ
(13.4.3)
PSD estimators, as we shall see, have an even greater variety. In this section,
we consider a class of them that give estimates at discrete values of frequency fi,
where i will range over integer values. In the next section, we will learn about
a different class of estimators that produce estimates that are continuous functions
of frequency f. Even if it is agreed always to relate the PSD normalization to a
particular description of the function normalization (e.g., 13.4.2), there are at least
the following possibilities: The PSD is
â¢ deï¬ned for discrete positive, zero, and negative frequencies, and its sum
over these is the function mean squared amplitude
â¢ deï¬ned for zero and discrete positive frequencies only, and its sum over
these is the function mean squared amplitude
â¢ deï¬ned in the Nyquist interval from âfc to fc, and its integral over this
range is the function mean squared amplitude
â¢ deï¬ned from 0 to fc, and its integral over this range is the function mean
squared amplitude
It never makes sense to integrate the PSD of a sampled function outside of the
Nyquist interval âfc and fc since, according to the sampling theorem, power there
will have been aliased into the Nyquist interval.
It is hopeless to deï¬ne enough notation to distinguish all possible combinations
of normalizations. In what follows, we use the notation P (f) to mean any of the
above PSDs, stating in each instance how the particular P (f) is normalized. Beware
the inconsistent notation in the literature.
The method of power spectrum estimation used in the previous section is a
simple version of an estimator called, historically, the periodogram. If we take an
N-point sample of the function c(t) at equal intervals and use the FFT to compute

By Parsevalâs theorem, equation(12.1.10), we see immediately that equation (13.4.5)
is normalized so that the sum of the N/2 + 1 values of P is equal to the mean
squared amplitude of the function cj.
We must now ask this question. In what sense is the periodogram estimate
(13.4.5) a âtrueâ estimator of the power spectrum of the underlying function c(t)?
You can ï¬nd the answer treated in considerable detail in the literature cited (see,
e.g., [1] for an introduction). Here is a summary.
First, is the expectation value of the periodogram estimate equal to the power
spectrum, i.e., is the estimator correct on average? Well, yes and no. We wouldnât
really expect one of the P (fk)âs to equal the continuous P (f) at exactly fk, since fk
is supposed to be representative of a whole frequency âbinâ extending from halfway
from the preceding discrete frequency to halfway to the next one. We should be
expecting the P (fk) to be some kind of average of P (f) over a narrow window
function centered on its fk.
For the periodogram estimate (13.4.6) that window
function, as a function of s the frequency offset in bins, is
W(s) =
1
N 2
 sin(Ïs)
sin(Ïs/N)
2
(13.4.7)
Notice that W(s) has oscillatory lobes but, apart from these, falls off only about as
W(s) â(Ïs)â2. This is not a very rapid fall-off, and it results in signiï¬cant leakage
(that is the technical term) from one frequency to anotherin the periodogramestimate.
Notice also that W(s) happens to be zero for s equal to a nonzero integer. This means
that if the function c(t) is a pure sine wave of frequency exactly equal to one of the
fkâs, then there will be no leakage to adjacent fkâs. But this is not the characteristic
case! If the frequency is, say, one-third of the way between two adjacent fkâs, then
the leakage will extend well beyond those two adjacent bins. The solution to the
problem of leakage is called data windowing, and we will discuss it below.

Turn now to another question about the periodogram estimate. What is the
variance of that estimate as N goes to inï¬nity? In other words, as we take more
sampled points from the original function (either sampling a longer stretch of data at
the same sampling rate, or else by resampling the same stretch of data with a faster
sampling rate), then how much more accurate do the estimates Pk become? The
unpleasant answer is that the periodogram estimates do not become more accurate
at all! In fact, the variance of the periodogram estimate at a frequency fk is always
equal to the square of its expectation value at that frequency. In other words, the
standard deviation is always 100 percent of the value, independent of N! How can
this be? Where did all the information go as we added points? It all went into
producing estimates at a greater number of discrete frequencies fk. If we sample a
longer run of data using the same sampling rate, then the Nyquist critical frequency
fc is unchanged, but we now have ï¬ner frequency resolution (more fkâs) within the
Nyquist frequency interval; alternatively, if we sample the same length of data with a
ï¬ner sampling interval, then our frequency resolution is unchanged, but the Nyquist
range now extends up to a higher frequency. In neither case do the additional samples
reduce the variance of any one particular frequencyâs estimated PSD.
You donât have to live with PSD estimates with 100 percent standard deviations,
however. You simply have to know some techniques for reducing the variance of
the estimates. Here are two techniques that are very nearly identical mathematically,
though different in implementation. The ï¬rst is to compute a periodogram estimate
with ï¬ner discrete frequency spacing than you really need, and then to sum the
periodogram estimates at K consecutive discrete frequencies to get one âsmootherâ
estimate at the mid frequency of those K. The variance of that summed estimate
will be smaller than the estimate itself by a factor of exactly 1/K, i.e., the standard
deviation will be smaller than 100 percent by a factor 1/
â
K. Thus, to estimate the
power spectrum at M +1 discrete frequencies between 0 and fc inclusive, you begin
by taking the FFT of 2MK points (which number had better be an integer power of
two!). You then take the modulus square of the resulting coefï¬cients, add positive
and negative frequency pairs, and divide by (2MK)2, all according to equation
(13.4.5) with N = 2MK. Finally, you âbinâ the results into summed (not averaged)
groups of K. This procedure is very easy to program, so we will not bother to give
a routine for it. The reason that you sum, rather than average, K consecutive points
is so that your ï¬nal PSD estimate will preserve the normalization property that the
sum of its M + 1 values equals the mean square value of the function.
A second technique for estimating the PSD at M + 1 discrete frequencies in
the range 0 to fc is to partition the original sampled data into K segments each of
2M consecutive sampled points. Each segment is separately FFTâd to produce a
periodogram estimate (equation 13.4.5 with N â¡2M). Finally, the K periodogram
estimates are averaged at each frequency. It is this ï¬nal averaging that reduces the
variance of the estimate by a factor K (standard deviation by
â
K). This second
technique is computationallymore efï¬cient than the ï¬rst technique above by a modest
factor, since it is logarithmically more efï¬cient to take many shorter FFTs than one
longer one. The principal advantage of the second technique, however, is that only
2M data points are manipulated at a single time, not 2KM as in the ï¬rst technique.
This means that the second technique is the natural choice for processing long runs
of data, as from a magnetic tape or other data record. We will give a routine later
for implementing this second technique, but we need ï¬rst to return to the matters of

leakage and data windowing which were brought up after equation (13.4.7) above.
Data Windowing
The purpose of data windowing is to modify equation (13.4.7), which expresses
the relation between the spectral estimate Pk at a discrete frequency and the actual
underlying continuous spectrum P (f) at nearby frequencies. In general, the spectral
power in one âbinâ k contains leakage from frequency components that are actually
s bins away, where s is the independent variable in equation (13.4.7). There is, as
we pointed out, quite substantial leakage even from moderately large values of s.
When we select a run of N sampled points for periodogram spectral estimation,
we are in effect multiplying an inï¬nite run of sampled data cj by a window function
in time, one that is zero except duringthe total sampling time Nâ, and is unityduring
that time. In other words, the data are windowed by a square window function. By
the convolution theorem (12.0.9; but interchanging the roles of f and t), the Fourier
transform of the product of the data with this square window function is equal to the
convolution of the dataâs Fourier transform with the windowâs Fourier transform. In
fact, we determined equation (13.4.7) as nothing more than the square of the discrete
Fourier transform of the unity window function.

(13.4.8)
The reason for the leakage at large values of s, is that the square window function
turns on and off so rapidly.
Its Fourier transform has substantial components
at high frequencies.
To remedy this situation, we can multiply the input data
cj, j = 0, . . ., N â1 by a window function wj that changes more gradually from
zero to a maximum and then back to zero as j ranges from 0 to N. In this case, the

We are inclined to follow Welch in recommending that you use either (13.4.13)
or (13.4.15) in practical work.
However, at the level of this book, there is
effectively no difference between any of these (or similar) window functions. Their
difference lies in subtle trade-offs among the various ï¬gures of merit that can be
used to describe the narrowness or peakedness of the spectral leakage functions
computed by (13.4.12). These ï¬gures of merit have such names as: highest sidelobe
level (dB), sidelobe fall-off (dB per octave), equivalent noise bandwidth (bins), 3-dB
bandwidth (bins), scallop loss (dB), worst case process loss (dB). Roughly speaking,
the principal trade-off is between making the central peak as narrow as possible
versus making the tails of the distribution fall off as rapidly as possible.
For
details, see (e.g.) [2]. Figure 13.4.2 plots the leakage amplitudes for several windows
already discussed.
There is particularly a lore about window functions that rise smoothly from
zero to unity in the ï¬rst small fraction (say 10 percent) of the data, then stay at
unity until the last small fraction (again say 10 percent) of the data, during which
the window function falls smoothly back to zero. These windows will squeeze a
little bit of extra narrowness out of the main lobe of the leakage function (never as

much as a factor of two, however), but trade this off by widening the leakage tail
by a signiï¬cant factor (e.g., the reciprocal of 10 percent, a factor of ten). If we
distinguish between the width of a window (number of samples for which it is at
its maximum value) and its rise/fall time (number of samples during which it rises
and falls); and if we distinguish between the FWHM (full width to half maximum
value) of the leakage functionâs main lobe and the leakage width (full width that
contains half of the spectral power that is not contained in the main lobe); then
these quantities are related roughly by

(leakage width in bins) â

(window rise/fall time)
(13.4.17)
For the windows given above in (13.4.13)â(13.4.15), the effective window
widths and the effective window rise/fall times are both of order 1
2N. Generally
speaking, we feel that the advantages of windows whose rise and fall times are
only small fractions of the data length are minor or nonexistent, and we avoid using
them. One sometimes hears it said that ï¬at-topped windows âthrow away less of
the data,â but we will now show you a better way of dealing with that problem by
use of overlapping data segments.
Let us now suppose that we have chosen a window function, and that we are
ready to segment the data into K segments of N = 2M points. Each segment will
be FFTâd, and the resulting K periodograms will be averaged together to obtain a

Leakage functions for the window functions of Figure 13.4.1.
A signal whose
frequency is actually located at zero offset âleaksâ into neighboring bins with the amplitude shown. The
purpose of windowing is to reduce the leakage at large offsets, where square (no) windowing has large
sidelobes. Offset can have a fractional value, since the actual signal frequency can be located between
two frequency bins of the FFT.
PSD estimate at M + 1 frequency values from 0 to fc. We must now distinguish
between two possible situations. We might want to obtain the smallest variance
from a ï¬xed amount of computation, without regard to the number of data points
used. This will generally be the goal when the data are being gathered in real time,
with the data-reduction being computer-limited. Alternatively, we might want to
obtain the smallest variance from a ï¬xed number of available sampled data points.
This will generally be the goal in cases where the data are already recorded and
we are analyzing it after the fact.
In the ï¬rst situation (smallest spectral variance per computer operation), it is
best to segment the data without any overlapping. The ï¬rst 2M data points constitute
segment number 1; the next 2M data points constitute segment number 2; and so
on, up to segment number K, for a total of 2KM sampled points. The variance in
this case, relative to a single segment, is reduced by a factor K.
In the second situation (smallest spectral variance per data point), it turns out
to be optimal, or very nearly optimal, to overlap the segments by one half of their
length. The ï¬rst and second sets of M points are segment number 1; the second
and third sets of M points are segment number 2; and so on, up to segment number
K, which is made of the Kth and K + 1st sets of M points. The total number of
sampled points is therefore(K +1)M, just over half as many as with nonoverlapping
segments. The reduction in the variance is not a full factor of K, since the segments
are not statistically independent. It can be shown that the variance is instead reduced
by a factor of about 9K/11 (see the paper by Welch in [3]).

signiï¬cantly better than the reduction of about K/2 that would have resulted if the
same number of data points were segmented without overlapping.
We can now codify these ideas into a routine for spectral estimation. While
we generally avoid input/output coding, we make an exception here to show how
data are read sequentially in one pass through a data ï¬le (referenced through the
parameter FILE *fp). Only a small fraction of the data is in memory at any one time.

13.5 Digital Filtering in the Time Domain
Suppose that you have a signal that you want to ï¬lter digitally. For example, perhaps
you want to apply high-pass or low-pass ï¬ltering, to eliminate noise at low or high frequencies
respectively; or perhaps the interesting part of your signal lies only in a certain frequency
band, so that you need a bandpass ï¬lter. Or, if your measurements are contaminated by 60
Hz power-line interference, you may need a notch ï¬lter to remove only a narrow band around
that frequency. This section speaks particularly about the case in which you have chosen to
do such ï¬ltering in the time domain.
Before continuing, we hope you will reconsider this choice. Remember how convenient
it is to ï¬lter in the Fourier domain. You just take your whole data record, FFT it, multiply
the FFT output by a ï¬lter function H(f), and then do an inverse FFT to get back a ï¬ltered
data set in time domain. Here is some additional background on the Fourier technique that
you will want to take into account.
â¢ Remember that you must deï¬ne your ï¬lter function H(f) for both positive and
negative frequencies, and that the magnitude of the frequency extremes is always
the Nyquist frequency 1/(2â), where âis the sampling interval. The magnitude
of the smallest nonzero frequencies in the FFT is Â±1/(Nâ), where N is the
number of (complex) points in the FFT. The positive and negative frequencies to
which this ï¬lter are applied are arranged in wrap-around order.
â¢ If the measured data are real, and you want the ï¬ltered output also to be real, then
your arbitrary ï¬lter function should obey H(âf) = H(f)*. You can arrange this
most easily by picking an H that is real and even in f.

the FFT output by a ï¬lter function H(f), and then do an inverse FFT to get back a ï¬ltered
data set in time domain. Here is some additional background on the Fourier technique that
you will want to take into account.
â¢ Remember that you must deï¬ne your ï¬lter function H(f) for both positive and
negative frequencies, and that the magnitude of the frequency extremes is always
the Nyquist frequency 1/(2â), where âis the sampling interval. The magnitude
of the smallest nonzero frequencies in the FFT is Â±1/(Nâ), where N is the
number of (complex) points in the FFT. The positive and negative frequencies to
which this ï¬lter are applied are arranged in wrap-around order.
â¢ If the measured data are real, and you want the ï¬ltered output also to be real, then
your arbitrary ï¬lter function should obey H(âf) = H(f)*. You can arrange this
most easily by picking an H that is real and even in f.

â¢ If your chosen H(f) has sharp vertical edges in it, then the impulse response of
your ï¬lter (the output arising from a short impulse as input) will have damped
âringingâ at frequencies corresponding to these edges. There is nothing wrong
with this, but if you donât like it, then pick a smoother H(f). To get a ï¬rst-hand
look at the impulse response of your ï¬lter, just take the inverse FFT of your H(f).
If you smooth all edges of the ï¬lter function over some number k of points, then
the impulse response function of your ï¬lter will have a span on the order of a
fraction 1/k of the whole data record.
â¢ If your data set is too long to FFT all at once, then break it up into segments of
any convenient size, as long as they are much longer than the impulse response
function of the ï¬lter. Use zero-padding, if necessary.
â¢ You should probably remove any trend from the data, by subtracting from it a
straight line through the ï¬rst and last points (i.e., make the ï¬rst and last points equal
to zero). If you are segmenting the data, then you can pick overlapping segments
and use only the middle section of each, comfortably distant from edge effects.
â¢ A digital ï¬lter is said to be causal or physically realizable if its output for a
particular time-step depends only on inputs at that particular time-step or earlier.
It is said to be acausal if its output can depend on both earlier and later inputs.
Filtering in the Fourier domain is, in general, acausal, since the data are processed
âin a batch,â without regard to time ordering. Donât let this bother you! Acausal
ï¬lters can generally give superior performance (e.g., less dispersion of phases,
sharper edges, less asymmetric impulse response functions). People use causal
ï¬lters not because they are better, but because some situations just donât allow
access to out-of-time-order data. Time domain ï¬lters can, in principle, be either
causal or acausal, but they are most often used in applications where physical
realizability is a constraint. For this reason we will restrict ourselves to the causal
case in what follows.
If you are still favoring time-domain ï¬ltering after all we have said, it is probably because
you have a real-time application, for which you must process a continuous data stream and
wish to output ï¬ltered values at the same rate as you receive raw data. Otherwise, it may
be that the quantity of data to be processed is so large that you can afford only a very small
number of ï¬oating operations on each data point and cannot afford even a modest-sized FFT
(with a number of ï¬oating operations per data point several times the logarithm of the number
of points in the data set or segment).
Linear Filters
The most general linear ï¬lter takes a sequence xk of input points and produces a
sequence yn of output points by the formula
yn =
M
X
k=0
ck xnâk +
N
X
j=1
dj ynâj
(13.5.1)
Here the M + 1 coefï¬cients ck and the N coefï¬cients dj are ï¬xed and deï¬ne the ï¬lter
response. The ï¬lter (13.5.1) produces each new output value from the current and M previous
input values, and from its own N previous output values. If N = 0, so that there is no
secondsum in (13.5.1), then the ï¬lter is callednonrecursiveor ï¬nite impulse response(FIR). If
N Ì¸= 0, then it is called recursive or inï¬nite impulse response (IIR). (The term âIIRâ connotes
only that such ï¬lters are capable of having inï¬nitely long impulse responses, not that their
impulse response is necessarily long in a particular application. Typically the response of an
IIR ï¬lter will drop off exponentially at late times, rapidly becoming negligible.)
The relation between the ckâs and djâs and the ï¬lter response function H(f) is

where âis, as usual, the sampling interval. The Nyquist interval corresponds to fâbetween
â1/2 and 1/2. For FIR ï¬lters the denominator of (13.5.2) is just unity.
Equation (13.5.2) tells how to determine H(f) from the câs and dâs. To design a ï¬lter,
though, we need a way of doing the inverse, getting a suitable set of câs and dâs â as small
a set as possible, to minimize the computational burden â from a desired H(f). Entire
books are devoted to this issue. Like many other âinverse problems,â it has no all-purpose
solution. One clearly has to make compromises, since H(f) is a full continuous function,
while the short list of câs and dâs represents only a few adjustable parameters. The subject of
digital ï¬lter design concerns itself with the various ways of making these compromises. We
cannot hope to give any sort of complete treatment of the subject. We can, however, sketch
a couple of basic techniques to get you started. For further details, you will have to consult
some specialized books (see references).
FIR (Nonrecursive) Filters
When the denominator in (13.5.2) is unity, the right-hand side is just a discrete Fourier
transform. The transform is easilyinvertible, givingthe desiredsmall numberofck coefï¬cients
in terms of the same small number of values of H(fi) at some discrete frequencies fi. This
fact, however, is not very useful. The reason is that, for values of ck computed in this way,
H(f) will tend to oscillate wildly in between the discrete frequencies where it is pinned
down to speciï¬c values.
A better strategy, and one which is the basis of several formal methods in the literature,
is this: Start by pretending that you are willing to have a relatively large number of ï¬lter
coefï¬cients, that is, a relatively large value of M. Then H(f) can be ï¬xed to desired values
on a relatively ï¬ne mesh, and the M coefï¬cients ck, k = 0, . . . , M â1 can be found by
an FFT. Next, truncate (set to zero) most of the ckâs, leaving nonzero only the ï¬rst, say,
K, (c0, c1, . . . , cKâ1) and last K â1, (cMâK+1, . . . , cMâ1). The last few ckâs are ï¬lter
coefï¬cients at negative lag, because of the wrap-around property of the FFT. But we donât
want coefï¬cients at negative lag. Therefore we cyclically shift the array of ckâs, to bring
everything to positive lag. (This corresponds to introducing a time-delay into the ï¬lter.) Do
this by copying the ckâs into a new array of length M in the following order:
(cMâK+1, . . . , cMâ1, c0, c1, . . . , cKâ1, 0, 0, . . . , 0)
(13.5.3)
To see if your truncation is acceptable, take the FFT of the array (13.5.3), giving an
approximation to your original H(f).
You will generally want to compare the modulus
|H(f)| to your original function, since the time-delay will have introduced complex phases
into the ï¬lter response.
If the new ï¬lter function is acceptable, then you are done and have a set of 2K â1
ï¬lter coefï¬cients. If it is not acceptable, then you can either (i) increase K and try again,
or (ii) do something fancier to improve the acceptability for the same K. An example of
something fancier is to modify the magnitudes (but not the phases) of the unacceptableH(f)
to bring it more in line with your ideal, and then to FFT to get new ckâs. Once again set
to zero all but the ï¬rst 2K â1 values of these (no need to cyclically shift since you have
preserved the time-delaying phases), then inverse transform to get a new H(f), which will
often be more acceptable. You can iterate this procedure. Note, however, that the procedure
will not converge if your requirements for acceptability are more stringent than your 2K â1
coefï¬cients can handle.
The key idea, in other words, is to iterate between the space of coefï¬cients and the space
of functions H(f), until a Fourier conjugate pair that satisï¬es the imposed constraints in both
spaces is found. A more formal technique for this kind of iteration is the Remes Exchange
Algorithm which produces the best Chebyshev approximation to a given desired frequency
response with a ï¬xed number of ï¬lter coefï¬cients (cf. Â§5.13).

IIR (Recursive) Filters
Recursive ï¬lters, whose output at a given time depends both on the current and previous
inputs and on previousoutputs, can generallyhave performancethat is superiorto nonrecursive
ï¬lters with the same total number of coefï¬cients (or same number of ï¬oating operations per
input point). The reason is fairly clear by inspection of (13.5.2): A nonrecursive ï¬lter has a
frequency response that is a polynomial in the variable 1/z, where
z â¡e2Ïi(fâ)
(13.5.4)
By contrast, a recursive ï¬lterâs frequency response is a rational function in 1/z. The class of
rational functions is especially good at ï¬tting functions with sharp edges or narrow features,
and most desired ï¬lter functions are in this category.
Nonrecursive ï¬lters are always stable. If you turn off the sequence of incoming xiâs,
then after no more than M steps the sequence of yjâs produced by (13.5.1) will also turn off.
Recursive ï¬lters, feeding as they do on their own output, are not necessarily stable. If the
coefï¬cients dj are badly chosen, a recursive ï¬lter can have exponentially growing, so-called
homogeneous, modes, which become huge even after the input sequence has been turned off.
This is not good. The problem of designing recursive ï¬lters, therefore, is not just an inverse
problem; it is an inverse problem with an additional stability constraint.
How do you tell if the ï¬lter (13.5.1) is stable for a given set of ck and dj coefï¬cients?
Stability depends only on the djâs. The ï¬lter is stable if and only if all N complex roots
of the characteristic polynomial equation
zN â
N
X
j=1
djzNâj = 0
(13.5.5)
are inside the unit circle, i.e., satisfy
|z| â¤1
(13.5.6)
The various methods for constructing stable recursive ï¬lters again form a subject area
for which you will need more specialized books. One very useful technique, however, is the
bilinear transformation method. For this topic we deï¬ne a new variable w that reparametrizes
the frequency f,
w â¡tan[Ï(fâ)] = i
1 âe2Ïi(fâ)
1 + e2Ïi(fâ)

= i
1 âz
1 + z

(13.5.7)
Donât be fooled by the iâs in (13.5.7). This equation maps real frequenciesf into real values of
w. In fact, it maps the Nyquist interval â1
2 < fâ< 1
2 onto the real w axis ââ< w < +â.
The inverse equation to (13.5.7) is
z = e2Ïi(fâ) = 1 + iw
1 âiw
(13.5.8)
In reparametrizing f, w also reparametrizes z, of course. Therefore, the condition for
stability (13.5.5)â(13.5.6) can be rephrased in terms of w: If the ï¬lter response H(f) is
written as a function of w, then the ï¬lter is stable if and only if the poles of the ï¬lter function
(zeros of its denominator) are all in the upper half complex plane,
Im(w) â¥0
(13.5.9)
The idea of the bilinear transformation method is that instead of specifyingyour desired
H(f), you specify only its desired modulus square, |H(f)|2 = H(f)H(f)* = H(f)H(âf).
Pick this to be approximated by some rational function in w2. Then ï¬nd all the poles of this
function in the w complex plane. Every pole in the lower half-plane will have a corresponding
pole in the upper half-plane, by symmetry. The idea is to form a product only of the factors
with good poles, ones in the upper half-plane. This product is your stably realizable H(f).
Now substitute equation (13.5.7) to write the function as a rational function in z, and compare
with equation (13.5.2) to read off the câs and dâs.

The procedure becomes clearer when we go through an example. Suppose we want to
design a simple bandpass ï¬lter, whose lower cutoff frequency corresponds to a value w = a,
and whose upper cutoff frequency corresponds to a value w = b, with a and b both positive
numbers. A simple rational function that accomplishes this is
|H(f)|2 =

w2
w2 + a2
 
b2
w2 + b2

(13.5.10)
This function does not have a very sharp cutoff, but it is illustrative of the more general
case. To obtain sharper edges, one could take the function (13.5.10) to some positive integer
power, or, equivalently, run the data sequentially through some number of copies of the ï¬lter
that we will obtain from (13.5.10).
The poles of (13.5.10) are evidently at w = Â±ia and w = Â±ib. Therefore the stably
realizable H(f) is
H(f) =

w
w âia
 

âb

(13.5.11)
We put the i in the numerator of the second factor in order to end up with real-valued
coefï¬cients. If we multiply out all the denominators, (13.5.11) can be rewritten in the form
H(f) =
â
b
(1+a)(1+b) +
b
(1+a)(1+b)zâ2
1 â(1+a)(1âb)+(1âa)(1+b)
(1+a)(1+b)
zâ1 + (1âa)(1âb)
(1+a)(1+b)zâ2
(13.5.12)
from which one reads off the ï¬lter coefï¬cients for equation (13.5.1),
c0 = â
b
(1 + a)(1 + b)
c1 = 0
c2 =
b
(1 + a)(1 + b)
d1 = (1 + a)(1 âb) + (1 âa)(1 + b)
(1 + a)(1 + b)
d2 = â(1 âa)(1 âb)
(1 + a)(1 + b)
(13.5.13)
This completes the design of the bandpass ï¬lter.
Sometimes you can ï¬gure out how to construct directly a rational function in w for
H(f), rather than having to start with its modulus square. The function that you construct
has to have its poles only in the upper half-plane, for stability.
It should also have the
property of going into its own complex conjugate if you substitute âw for w, so that the
ï¬lter coefï¬cients will be real.
For example, here is a function for a notch ï¬lter, designed to remove only a narrow
frequency band around some ï¬ducial frequency w = w0, where w0 is a positive number,
H(f) =

w âw0

signal, one that glides upwards in frequency, crossing the notch frequency along the way.
While the bilinear transformation may seem very general, its applications are limited
by some features of the resulting ï¬lters. The method is good at getting the general shape
of the desired ï¬lter, and good where âï¬atnessâ is a desired goal. However, the nonlinear
mapping between w and f makes it difï¬cult to design to a desired shape for a cutoff, and
may move cutoff frequencies (deï¬ned by a certain number of dB) from their desired places.
Consequently, practitioners of the art of digital ï¬lter design reserve the bilinear transformation

13.6 Linear Prediction and Linear Predictive
Coding
We begin witha very general formulationthat will allow us to make connections
to various special cases. Let {yâ²
Î±} be a set of measured values for some underlying
set of true values of a quantity y, denoted {yÎ±}, related to these true values by
the addition of random noise,
yâ²
Î± = yÎ± + nÎ±
(13.6.1)
(compare equation 13.3.2, with a somewhat different notation). Our use of a Greek
subscript to index the members of the set is meant to indicate that the data points
are not necessarily equally spaced along a line, or even ordered: they might be
ârandomâ points in three-dimensional space, for example. Now, suppose we want to
construct the âbestâ estimate of the true value of some particular point yâas a linear
combination of the known, noisy, values. Writing
yâ=
X
Î±
dâÎ±yâ²
Î± + xâ
(13.6.2)
we want to ï¬nd coefï¬cients dâÎ± that minimize, in some way, thediscrepancy xâ. The
coefï¬cients dâÎ± have a âstarâ subscript to indicate that they depend on the choice of
point yâ. Later, we might want to let yâbe one of the existing yÎ±âs. In that case,
our problem becomes one of optimal ï¬ltering or estimation, closely related to the
discussion in Â§13.3. On the other hand, we might want yâto be a completely new
point. In that case, our problem will be one of linear prediction.
A natural way to minimize the discrepancy xâis in the statistical mean square
sense. If angle brackets denote statistical averages, then we seek dâÎ±âs that minimize

13.6 Linear Prediction and Linear Predictive
Coding
We begin witha very general formulationthat will allow us to make connections
to various special cases. Let {yâ²
Î±} be a set of measured values for some underlying
set of true values of a quantity y, denoted {yÎ±}, related to these true values by
the addition of random noise,
yâ²
Î± = yÎ± + nÎ±
(13.6.1)
(compare equation 13.3.2, with a somewhat different notation). Our use of a Greek
subscript to index the members of the set is meant to indicate that the data points
are not necessarily equally spaced along a line, or even ordered: they might be
ârandomâ points in three-dimensional space, for example. Now, suppose we want to
construct the âbestâ estimate of the true value of some particular point yâas a linear
combination of the known, noisy, values. Writing
yâ=
X
Î±
dâÎ±yâ²
Î± + xâ
(13.6.2)
we want to ï¬nd coefï¬cients dâÎ± that minimize, in some way, thediscrepancy xâ. The
coefï¬cients dâÎ± have a âstarâ subscript to indicate that they depend on the choice of
point yâ. Later, we might want to let yâbe one of the existing yÎ±âs. In that case,
our problem becomes one of optimal ï¬ltering or estimation, closely related to the
discussion in Â§13.3. On the other hand, we might want yâto be a completely new
point. In that case, our problem will be one of linear prediction.
A natural way to minimize the discrepancy xâis in the statistical mean square
sense. If angle brackets denote statistical averages, then we seek dâÎ±âs that minimize

Here we have used the fact that noise is uncorrelated with signal, e.g., â¨nÎ±yÎ²â©= 0.
The quantities â¨yÎ±yÎ²â©and â¨yâyÎ±â©describe the autocorrelation structure of the
underlying data. We have already seen an analogous expression, (13.2.2), for the
case of equally spaced data points on a line; we will meet correlation several times
again in its statistical sense in Chapters 14 and 15. The quantitiesâ¨nÎ±nÎ²â©describe the
autocorrelation properties of the noise. Often, for point-to-point uncorrelated noise,
we have â¨nÎ±nÎ²â©=

quantities as comprising matrices and vectors,

Since the second term is a pure quadratic form, we see that the increase in the
discrepancy is only second order in any error made in estimating the dâÎ²âs.
Connection to Optimal Filtering
If we change âstarâ to a Greek index, say Î³, then the above formulas describe
optimal ï¬ltering, generalizing the discussion of Â§13.3. One sees, for example, that
if the noise amplitudes nÎ± go to zero, so likewise do the noise autocorrelations
Î·Î±Î², and, canceling a matrix times its inverse, equation (13.6.6) simply becomes
yÎ³ = yâ²
Î³. Another special case occurs if the matrices ÏÎ±Î² and Î·Î±Î² are diagonal.
In that case, equation (13.6.6) becomes

which is readily recognizable as equation (13.3.6) withS2 âÏÎ³Î³, N 2 âÎ·Î³Î³. What
is going on is this: For the case of equally spaced data points, and in the Fourier
domain, autocorrelations become simply squares of Fourier amplitudes (Wiener-
Khinchin theorem, equation 12.0.12), and the optimal ï¬lter can be constructed
algebraically, as equation (13.6.9), without inverting any matrix.
More generally, in the time domain, or any other domain, an optimal ï¬lter (one
that minimizes the square of the discrepancy from the underlying true value in the
presence of measurement noise) can be constructed by estimating the autocorrelation
matrices ÏÎ±Î² and Î·Î±Î², and applying equation (13.6.6) with ââÎ³.
(Equation
13.6.8 is in fact the basis for the Â§13.3âs statement that even crude optimal ï¬ltering
can be quite effective.)
Linear Prediction
Classical linear prediction specializes to the case where the data points yÎ²
are equally spaced along a line, yi, i = 1, 2, . . ., N, and we want to use M
consecutive values of yi to predict an M + 1st. Stationarity is assumed. That is, the
autocorrelation â¨yjykâ©is assumed to depend only on the difference |j âk|, and not
on j or k individually, so that the autocorrelation Ï has only a single index,
Ïj â¡â¨yiyi+jâ©â

i=1

(13.6.10)
Here, the approximate equality shows one way to use the actual data set values to
estimate the autocorrelation components. (In fact, there is a better way to make these
estimates; see below.) In the situation described, the estimation equation (13.6.2) is
yn =
M
X
j=1
djynâj + xn
(13.6.11)
(compare equation 13.5.1) and equation (13.6.5) becomes the set of M equations for
the M unknown djâs, now called the linear prediction (LP) coefï¬cients,

(k = 1, . . ., M)
(13.6.12)
Notice that while noise is not explicitly included in the equations, it is properly
accounted for, if it is point-to-point uncorrelated: Ï0, as estimated by equation
(13.6.10)using measured values yâ²
i, actually estimates the diagonal part of ÏÎ±Î±+Î·Î±Î±,
above. The mean square discrepancy

(13.6.13)
To use linear prediction, we ï¬rst compute the djâs, using equations (13.6.10)
and (13.6.12).
We then calculate equation (13.6.13) or, more concretely, apply
(13.6.11) to the known record to get an idea of how large are the discrepancies xi.
If the discrepancies are small, then we can continue applying (13.6.11) right on into

the future, imagining the unknown âfutureâ discrepancies xi to be zero.
In this
application, (13.6.11) is a kind of extrapolation formula. In many situations, this
extrapolationturns out tobe vastlymore powerful than any kindof simple polynomial
extrapolation. (By the way, you should not confuse the terms âlinear predictionâ and
âlinear extrapolationâ; the general functional form used by linear prediction is much
more complex than a straight line, or even a low-order polynomial!)
However, to achieve its full usefulness, linear prediction must be constrained in
one additional respect: One must take additional measures to guarantee its stability.
Equation (13.6.11) is a special case of the general linear ï¬lter (13.5.1). The condition
that (13.6.11) be stable as a linear predictor is precisely that given in equations
(13.5.5) and (13.5.6), namely that the characteristic polynomial
zN â
N
X
j=1
djzNâj = 0
(13.6.14)
have all N of its roots inside the unit circle,
|z| â¤1
(13.6.15)
There is no guarantee that the coefï¬cients produced by equation (13.6.12) will have
this property.
If the data contain many oscillations without any particular trend
towards increasing or decreasing amplitude, then the complex roots of (13.6.14)
will generally all be rather close to the unit circle. The ï¬nite length of the data
set will cause some of these roots to be inside the unit circle, others outside. In
some applications, where the resulting instabilitiesare slowly growing and the linear
prediction is not pushed too far, it is best to use the âunmassagedâ LP coefï¬cients
that come directly out of (13.6.12). For example, one might be extrapolating to ï¬ll a
short gap in a data set; then one might extrapolate both forwards across the gap and
backwards from the data beyond the gap. If the two extrapolations agree tolerably
well, then instability is not a problem.
When instability is a problem, you have to âmassageâ the LP coefï¬cients. You
do this by (i) solving (numerically) equation (13.6.14) for its N complex roots; (ii)
moving the roots to where you think they ought to be inside or on the unit circle; (iii)
reconstituting the now-modiï¬ed LP coefï¬cients. You may think that step (ii) sounds
a little vague. It is. There is no âbestâ procedure. If you think that your signal
is truly a sum of undamped sine and cosine waves (perhaps with incommensurate
periods), then you will want simply to move each root zi onto the unit circle,
zi âzi/ |zi|
(13.6.16)
In other circumstances it may seem appropriate to reï¬ect a bad root across the
unit circle
zi â1/zi*
(13.6.17)
This alternative has the property that it preserves the amplitude of the output of
(13.6.11) when it is driven by a sinusoidal set of xiâs. It assumes that (13.6.12)
has correctly identiï¬ed the spectral width of a resonance, but only slipped up on

identifying its time sense so that signals that should be damped as time proceeds end
up growing in amplitude. The choice between (13.6.16) and (13.6.17) sometimes
might as well be based on voodoo. We prefer (13.6.17).
Also magical is the choice of M, the number of LP coefï¬cients to use. You
should choose M to be as small as works for you, that is, you should choose it by
experimenting with your data. Try M = 5, 10, 20, 40. If you need larger Mâs than
this, be aware that the procedure of âmassagingâ all those complex roots is quite
sensitive to roundoff error. Use double precision.
Linear predictionis especially successful at extrapolatingsignalsthat are smooth
and oscillatory, though not necessarily periodic. In such cases, linear predictionoften
extrapolates accurately through many cycles of the signal. By contrast, polynomial
extrapolation in general becomes seriously inaccurate after at most a cycle or two.
A prototypical example of a signal that can successfully be linearly predicted is the
height of ocean tides, for which the fundamental 12-hour period is modulated in
phase and amplitude over the course of the month and year, and for which local
hydrodynamic effects may make even one cycle of the curve look rather different
in shape from a sine wave.
We already remarked that equation (13.6.10) is not necessarily the best way
to estimate the covariances Ïk from the data set.
In fact, results obtained from
linear prediction are remarkably sensitive to exactly how the Ïkâs are estimated.
One particularly good method is due to Burg [1], and involves a recursive procedure
for increasing the order M by one unit at a time, at each stage re-estimating the
coefï¬cients dj, j = 1, . . ., M so as to minimize the residual in equation (13.6.13).
Althoughfurther discussionof the Burg method is beyond our scope here, the method
is implemented in the following routine [1,2] for estimating the LP coefï¬cients dj
of a data set.
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void memcof(float data[], int n, int m, float *xms, float d[])
Given a real vector of data[1..n], and given m, this routine returns m linear prediction coef-
ï¬cients as d[1..m], and returns the mean square discrepancy as xms.

Here are procedures for rendering the LP coefï¬cients stable (if you choose to
do so), and for extrapolating a data set by linear prediction, using the original or

Given the LP coeï¬cients d[1..m], this routine ï¬nds all roots of the characteristic polynomial
(13.6.14), reï¬ects any roots that are outside the unit circle back inside, and then returns a
modiï¬ed set of coeï¬cients d[1..m].

Now reconstruct the polynomial coeï¬cients,

a[0]=Csub(ZERO,Cmul(roots[j],a[0]));
}
for (j=0;j<=m-1;j++)
The polynomial coeï¬cients are guaranteed to be
real, so we need only return the real part as
new LP coeï¬cients.

Removing the Bias in Linear Prediction
You might expect that the sum of the djâs in equation (13.6.11) (or, more
generally, in equation 13.6.2) should be 1, so that (e.g.) adding a constant to all the
data points yi yields a prediction that is increased by the same constant. However,
the djâs do not sum to 1 but, in general, to a value slightly less than one. This fact
reveals a subtle point, that the estimator of classical linear prediction is not unbiased,
even though it does minimize the mean square discrepancy. At any place where the
measured autocorrelation does not imply a better estimate, the equations of linear
prediction tend to predict a value that tends towards zero.
Sometimes, that is just what you want. If the process that generates the yiâs
in fact has zero mean, then zero is the best guess absent other information. At
other times, however, this behavior is unwarranted. If you have data that show
only small variations around a positive value, you donât want linear predictions
that droop towards zero.
Often it is a workable approximation to subtract the mean off your data set,
perform the linear prediction, and then add the mean back. This procedure contains
the germ of the correct solution; but the simple arithmetic mean is not quite the
correct constant to subtract. In fact, an unbiased estimator is obtained by subtracting
from every data point an autocorrelation-weighted mean deï¬ned by [3,4]

(13.6.18)
With this subtraction, the sum of the LP coefï¬cients should be unity, up to roundoff
and differences in how the Ïkâs are estimated.

Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)
A different, though related, method to which the formalism above can be
applied is the âcompressionâ of a sampled signal so that it can be stored more
compactly. The original form should be exactly recoverable from the compressed
version. Obviously, compression can be accomplished only if there is redundancy
in the signal. Equation (13.6.11) describes one kind of redundancy: It says that
the signal, except for a small discrepancy, is predictable from its previous values
and from a small number of LP coefï¬cients. Compression of a signal by the use of
(13.6.11) is thus called linear predictive coding, or LPC.
The basic idea of LPC (in its simplest form) is to record as a compressed ï¬le (i)
the number of LP coefï¬cients M, (ii) their M values, e.g., as obtained by memcof,
(iii) the ï¬rst M data points, and then (iv) for each subsequent data point only its
residual discrepancy xi (equation 13.6.1). When you are creating the compressed
ï¬le, you ï¬nd the residual by applying (13.6.1) to the previous M points, subtracting
the sum from the actual value of the current point. When you are reconstructing the
original ï¬le, you add the residual back in, at the point indicated in the routine predic.
It may not be obvious why there is any compression at all in this scheme. After
all, we are storingone value of residual per data point! Why not just store the original
data point? The answer depends on the relative sizes of the numbers involved. The
residual is obtained by subtracting two very nearly equal numbers (the data and the
linear prediction). Therefore, the discrepancy typically has only a very small number
of nonzero bits. These can be stored in a compressed ï¬le. How do you do it in a
high-level language? Here is one way: Scale your data to have integer values, say
between +1000000 and â1000000 (supposing that you need six signiï¬cant ï¬gures).
Modify equation (13.6.1) by enclosing the sum term in an âinteger part ofâ operator.
The discrepancy will now, by deï¬nition, be an integer. Experiment with different
values of M, to ï¬nd LP coefï¬cients that make the range of the discrepancy as small
as you can. If you can get to within a range of Â±127 (and in our experience this is not
at all difï¬cult) then you can write it to a ï¬le as a single byte. This is a compression
factor of 4, compared to 4-byte integer or ï¬oating formats.
Notice that the LP coefï¬cients are computed using the quantized data, and that
the discrepancy is also quantized, i.e., quantization is done both outside and inside
the LPC loop. If you are careful in following this prescription, then, apart from the
initial quantization of the data, you will not introduce even a single bit of roundoff
error into the compression-reconstruction process: While the evaluation of the sum
in (13.6.11) may have roundoff errors, the residual that you store is the value which,
when added back to the sum, gives exactly the original (quantized) data value. Notice
also that you do not need to massage the LP coefï¬cients for stability; by adding the
residual back in to each point, you never depart from the original data, so instabilities
cannot grow. There is therefore no need for fixrts, above.
Look at Â§20.4 to learn about Huffman coding, which will further compress the
residuals by taking advantage of the fact that smaller values of discrepancy will occur
more often than larger values. A very primitive version of Huffman coding would
be this: If most of the discrepancies are in the range Â±127, but an occasional one is
outside, then reserve the value 127 to mean âout of range,â and then record on the ï¬le
(immediately following the 127) a full-word value of the out-of-range discrepancy.
Â§20.4 explains how to do much better.

13.7 Power Spectrum Estimation by the
Maximum Entropy (All Poles) Method
The FFT is not the only way to estimate the power spectrum of a process, nor is it
necessarily the best way for all purposes. To see how one might devise another method,
let us enlarge our view for a moment, so that it includes not only real frequencies in the
Nyquist interval âfc < f < fc, but also the entire complex frequency plane. From that
vantage point, let us transform the complex f-plane to a new plane, called the z-transform
plane or z-plane, by the relation
z â¡e2Ïifâ
(13.7.1)
where âis, as usual, the sampling interval in the time domain. Notice that the Nyquist interval
on the real axis of the f-plane maps one-to-one onto the unit circle in the complex z-plane.

If we now compare (13.7.1) to equations (13.4.4) and (13.4.6), we see that the FFT
power spectrum estimate (13.4.5) for any real sampled function ck â¡c(tk) can be written,
except for normalization convention, as
P(f) =

N/2â1
X
k=âN/2
ckzk

2
(13.7.2)
Of course, (13.7.2) is not the true power spectrum of the underlying function c(t), but only an
estimate. We can see in two related ways why the estimate is not likely to be exact. First, in the
time domain, the estimate is based on only a ï¬nite range of the function c(t) which may, for all
we know, have continued from t = ââto â. Second, in the z-plane of equation (13.7.2), the
ï¬nite Laurent series offers, in general, only an approximation to a general analytic function of
z. In fact, a formal expression for representing âtrueâ power spectra (up to normalization) is
P(f) =

â
X
k=ââ
ckzk

2
(13.7.3)
This is an inï¬nite Laurent series which depends on an inï¬nite number of values ck. Equation
(13.7.2) is just one kind of analytic approximation to the analytic function of z represented
by (13.7.3); the kind, in fact, that is implicit in the use of FFTs to estimate power spectra by
periodogram methods. It goes under several names, including direct method, all-zero model,
and moving average (MA) model. The term âall-zeroâ in particular refers to the fact that the
model spectrum can have zeros in the z-plane, but not poles.
If we look at the problem of approximating (13.7.3) more generally it seems clear that
we could do a better job with a rational function, one with a series of type (13.7.2) in both the
numerator and the denominator. Less obviously, it turns out that there are some advantages in
an approximation whose free parameters all lie in the denominator, namely,
P(f) â
1

M/2
P
k=âM/2
bkzk

2 =
a0
1 +
M
P
k=1
akzk

2
(13.7.4)
Here the second equality brings in a new set of coefï¬cients akâs, which can be determined
from the bkâs using the fact that z lies on the unit circle. The bkâs can be thought of as
being determined by the condition that power series expansion of (13.7.4) agree with the
ï¬rst M + 1 terms of (13.7.3).
In practice, as we shall see, one determines the bkâs or
akâs by another method.
The differences between the approximations (13.7.2) and (13.7.4) are not just cosmetic.
They are approximations with very different character. Most notable is the fact that (13.7.4)
can have poles, corresponding to inï¬nite power spectral density, on the unit z-circle, i.e., at
real frequencies in the Nyquist interval. Such poles can provide an accurate representation
for underlying power spectra that have sharp, discrete âlinesâ or delta-functions. By contrast,
(13.7.2) can have only zeros, not poles, at real frequencies in the Nyquist interval, and must
thus attempt to ï¬t sharp spectral features with, essentially, a polynomial. The approximation
(13.7.4) goes under several names:
all-poles model, maximum entropy method (MEM),
autoregressivemodel (AR). We need only ï¬nd out how to compute the coefï¬cients a0 and the
akâs from a data set, so that we can actually use (13.7.4) to obtain spectral estimates.
A pleasant surprise is that we already know how! Look at equation (13.6.11) for linear
prediction. Compare it with linear ï¬lter equations (13.5.1) and (13.5.2), and you will see that,
viewed as a ï¬lter that takes input xâs into output yâs, linear prediction has a ï¬lter function
H(f) =
1
1 â
N
P
j=1
djzj
(13.7.5)
Thus, the power spectrum of the yâs should be equal to the power spectrum of the xâs
multiplied by |H(f)|2. Now let us think about what the spectrum of the input xâs is, when

they are residual discrepanciesfrom linear prediction. Although we will not prove it formally,
it is intuitively believable that the xâs are independently random and therefore have a ï¬at
(white noise) spectrum. (Roughly speaking, any residual correlations left in the xâs would
have allowed a more accurate linear prediction, and would have been removed.) The overall
normalization of this ï¬at spectrum is just the mean square amplitude of the xâs. But this is
exactly the quantity computed in equation (13.6.13) and returned by the routine memcof as
xms. Thus, the coefï¬cients a0 and ak in equation (13.7.4) are related to the LP coefï¬cients
returned by memcof simply by
a0 = xms
ak = âd(k),
k = 1, . . . , M
(13.7.6)
There is also anotherway to describethe relation betweenthe akâs andthe autocorrelation
components Ïk. The Wiener-Khinchin theorem (12.0.12) says that the Fourier transform of
the autocorrelation is equal to the power spectrum. In z-transform language, this Fourier
transform is just a Laurent series in z. The equation that is to be satisï¬ed by the coefï¬cients
in equation (13.7.4) is thus

(13.7.7)
The approximately equal sign in (13.7.7) has a somewhat special interpretation. It means
that the series expansion of the left-hand side is supposed to agree with the right-hand side
term by term from zâM to zM. Outside this range of terms, the right-hand side is obviously
zero, while the left-hand side will still have nonzero terms. Notice that M, the number of
coefï¬cients in the approximation on the left-hand side, can be any integer up to N, the total
number of autocorrelations available. (In practice, one often chooses M much smaller than
N.) M is called the order or number of poles of the approximation.
Whatever the chosen value of M, the series expansion of the left-hand side of (13.7.7)
deï¬nes a certain sort of extrapolation of the autocorrelation function to lags larger than M, in
fact even to lags larger than N, i.e., larger than the run of data can actually measure. It turns
out that this particular extrapolation can be shown to have, among all possible extrapolations,
the maximum entropy in a deï¬nable information-theoretic sense. Hence the name maximum
entropy method, or MEM. The maximum entropy property has caused MEM to acquire a
certain âcultâ popularity; one sometimes hears that it gives an intrinsically âbetterâ estimate
than is given by other methods.
Donât believe it.
MEM has the very cute property of
being able to ï¬t sharp spectral features, but there is nothing else magical about its power
spectrum estimates.
The operations count in memcof scales as the product of N (the number of data points)
and M (the desired order of the MEM approximation). If M were chosen to be as large as
N, then the method would be much slower than the N log N FFT methods of the previous
section. In practice, however, one usually wants to limit the order (or number of poles) of the
MEM approximation to a few times the number of sharp spectral features that one desires it
to ï¬t. With this restricted number of poles, the method will smooth the spectrum somewhat,
but this is often a desirable property. While exact values depend on the application, one
might take M = 10 or 20 or 50 for N = 1000 or 10000. In that case MEM estimation is
not much slower than FFT estimation.
We feel obliged to warn you that memcof can be a bit quirky at times. If the number of
poles or number of data points is too large, roundoff error can be a problem, even in double
precision. With âpeakyâ data (i.e., data with extremely sharp spectral features), the algorithm
may suggest split peaks even at modest orders, and the peaks may shift with the phase of the
sine wave. Also, with noisy input functions, if you choose too high an order, you will ï¬nd
spurious peaks galore! Some experts recommend the use of this algorithm in conjunction with
more conservative methods, like periodograms, to help choose the correct model order, and to
avoid getting too fooled by spurious spectral features. MEM can be ï¬nicky, but it can also do
remarkable things. We recommend that you try it out, cautiously, on your own problems. We
now turn to the evaluation of the MEM spectral estimate from its coefï¬cients.
The MEM estimation (13.7.4) is a function of continuously varying frequency f. There
is no special signiï¬cance to speciï¬c equally spaced frequencies as there was in the FFT case.

In fact, since the MEM estimate may have very sharp spectral features, one wants to be able to
evaluate it on a very ï¬ne mesh near to those features, but perhaps only more coarsely farther
away from them. Here is a function which, given the coefï¬cients already computed, evaluates

Sample output of maximum entropy spectral estimation. The input signal consists of
512 samples of the sum of two sinusoids of very nearly the same frequency, plus white noise with about
equal power. Shown is an expanded portion of the full Nyquist frequency interval (which would extend
from zero to 0.5). The dashed spectral estimate uses 20 poles; the dotted, 40; the solid, 150. With the
larger number of poles, the method can resolve the distinct sinusoids; but the ï¬at noise background is
beginning to show spurious peaks. (Note logarithmic scale.)
as codiï¬ed by the sampling theorem: A sampled data set like equation (13.8.1) contains
complete information about all spectral components in a signal h(t) up to the Nyquist
frequency, and scrambled or aliased information about any signal components at frequencies
larger than the Nyquist frequency. The sampling theorem thus deï¬nes both the attractiveness,
and the limitation, of any analysis of an evenly spaced data set.
There are situations, however, where evenly spaced data cannot be obtained. A common
case is where instrumental drop-outs occur, so that data is obtained only on a (not consecutive
integer) subset of equation (13.8.1), the so-called missing data problem.
Another case,
common in observational sciences like astronomy, is that the observer cannot completely
control the time of the observations, but must simply accept a certain dictated set of tiâs.
There are some obvious ways to get from unevenly spacedtiâs to evenly spaced ones, as
in equation (13.8.1). Interpolation is one way: lay down a grid of evenly spaced times on your
data and interpolate values onto that grid; then use FFT methods. In the missing data problem,
you only have to interpolate on missing data points. If a lot of consecutive points are missing,
you might as well just set them to zero, or perhapsâclampâ the value at the last measured point.
However, the experience of practitioners of such interpolation techniques is not reassuring.
Generally speaking, such techniques perform poorly. Long gaps in the data, for example,
often produce a spurious bulge of power at low frequencies (wavelengths comparable to gaps).
A completely different method of spectral analysis for unevenly sampled data, one that
mitigates these difï¬culties and has some other very desirable properties, was developed by
Lomb [1], based in part on earlier work by Barning [2] and VanÂ´Ä±Ëcek [3], and additionally
elaborated by Scargle [4]. The Lomb method (as we will call it) evaluates data, and sines

The constant Ï is a kind of offset that makes PN(Ï) completely independent of shifting
all the tiâs by any constant. Lomb shows that this particular choice of offset has another,
deeper, effect: It makes equation (13.8.4) identical to the equation that one would obtain if one
estimated the harmonic content of a data set, at a given frequency Ï, by linear least-squares
ï¬tting to the model
h(t) = A cos Ït + B sin Ït
(13.8.6)
This fact gives some insight into why the method can give results superior to FFT methods: It
weights the data on a âper pointâ basis instead of on a âper time intervalâ basis, when uneven
sampling can render the latter seriously in error.
A very common occurrence is that the measured data points hi are the sum of a periodic
signal and independent (white) Gaussian noise. If we are trying to determine the presence
or absence of such a periodic signal, we want to be able to give a quantitative answer to
the question, âHow signiï¬cant is a peak in the spectrum PN(Ï)?â In this question, the null
hypothesis is that the data values are independent Gaussian random values. A very nice
property of the Lomb normalized periodogram is that the viability of the null hypothesis can
be tested fairly rigorously, as we now discuss.
The word ânormalizedâ refers to the factor Ï2 in the denominator of equation (13.8.4).
Scargle [4] shows that with this normalization, at any particular Ï and in the case of the null
hypothesis, PN(Ï) has an exponential probability distribution with unit mean. In other words,
the probability that PN(Ï) will be between some positive z and z + dz is exp(âz)dz. It
readily follows that, if we scan some M independent frequencies, the probability that none
give values larger than z is (1 âeâz)M. So
P(> z) â¡1 â(1 âeâz)M
(13.8.7)
is the false-alarm probability of the null hypothesis, that is, the signiï¬cance level of any peak
in PN(Ï) that we do see. A small value for the false-alarm probability indicates a highly
signiï¬cant periodic signal.
To evaluate this signiï¬cance, we need to know M. After all, the more frequencies we
look at, the less signiï¬cant is some one modest bump in the spectrum. (Look long enough,
ï¬nd anything!) A typical procedure will be to plot PN(Ï) as a function of many closely
spaced frequencies in some large frequency range. How many of these are independent?
Before answering, let us ï¬rst see how accurately we need to know M. The interesting
region is where the signiï¬cance is a small (signiï¬cant) number, âª1. There, equation (13.8.7)
can be series expanded to give

Example of the Lomb algorithm in action. The 100 data points (upper ï¬gure) are at
random times between 0 and 100. Their sinusoidal component is readily uncovered (lower ï¬gure) by
the algorithm, at a signiï¬cance level better than 0.001. If the 100 data points had been evenly spaced at
unit interval, the Nyquist critical frequency would have been 0.5. Note that, for these unevenly spaced
points, there is no visible aliasing into the Nyquist range.
We see that the signiï¬cance scales linearly with M. Practical signiï¬cance levels are numbers
like 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, etc. An error of even Â±50% in the estimated signiï¬cance is often
tolerable, since quoted signiï¬cance levels are typically spaced apart by factors of 5 or 10. So
our estimate of M need not be very accurate.
Horne and Baliunas [5] give results from extensive Monte Carlo experiments for
determining M in various cases.
In general M depends on the number of frequencies
sampled, the number of data points N, and their detailed spacing. It turns out that M is
very nearly equal to N when the data points are approximately equally spaced, and when the
sampled frequencies âï¬llâ (oversample) the frequency range from 0 to the Nyquist frequency
fc (equation 13.8.2).
Further, the value of M is not importantly different for random
spacing of the data points than for equal spacing. When a larger frequency range than the
Nyquist range is sampled, M increases proportionally. About the only case where M differs
signiï¬cantly from the case of evenly spaced points is when the points are closely clumped,
say into groups of 3; then (as one would expect) the number of independent frequencies is
reduced by a factor of about 3.
The program period, below, calculates an effective value for M based on the above
rough-and-ready rules and assumesthat there is no important clumping. This will be adequate
for most purposes. In any particular case, if it really matters, it is not too difï¬cult to compute
a better value of M by simple Monte Carlo: Holding ï¬xed the number of data points and their
locations ti, generate synthetic data sets of Gaussian (normal) deviates, ï¬nd the largest values
of PN(Ï) for each such data set (using the accompanying program), and ï¬t the resulting
distribution for M in equation (13.8.7).

Figure 13.8.1 shows the results of applying the method as discussed so far.
In the
upper ï¬gure, the data points are plotted against time. Their number is N = 100, and their
distribution in t is Poisson random. There is certainly no sinusoidal signal evident to the eye.
The lower ï¬gure plots PN(Ï) against frequency f = Ï/2Ï. The Nyquist critical frequency
that would obtain if the points were evenly spaced is at f = fc = 0.5. Since we have searched
up to about twice that frequency, and oversampled the fâs to the point where successivevalues
of PN(Ï) vary smoothly, we take M = 2N. The horizontal dashed and dotted lines are
(respectively from bottom to top) signiï¬cance levels 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, and 0.001.
One sees a highly signiï¬cant peak at a frequency of 0.81. That is in fact the frequency of the
sine wave that is present in the data. (You will have to take our word for this!)
Note that two other peaks approach, but do not exceed the 50% signiï¬cance level; that
is about what one might expect by chance. It is also worth commenting on the fact that the
signiï¬cant peak was found (correctly) above the Nyquist frequencyand without any signiï¬cant
aliasing down into the Nyquist interval! That would not be possible for evenly spaced data. It
is possible here because the randomly spaced data has some points spaced much closer than
the âaverageâ sampling rate, and these remove ambiguity from any aliasing.
Implementation ofthe normalized periodogram in code is straightforward,with, however,
a few points to be kept in mind. We are dealing with a slow algorithm. Typically, for N data
points, we may wish to examine on the order of 2N or 4N frequencies. Each combination
of frequency and data point has, in equations (13.8.4) and (13.8.5), not just a few adds or
multiplies, but four calls to trigonometric functions; the operations count can easily reach
several hundred times N 2. It is highly desirable â in fact results in a factor 4 speedup â
to replace these trigonometric calls by recurrences. That is possible only if the sequence of
frequencies examined is a linear sequence. Since such a sequenceis probably what most users
would want anyway, we have built this into the implementation.
At the end of this section we describe a way to evaluate equations (13.8.4) and (13.8.5)
â approximately, but to any desired degree of approximation â by a fast method [6] whose
operation count goes only as N log N. This faster method should be used for long data sets.
The lowest independent frequency f to be examined is the inverse of the span of the
input data, maxi(ti)âmini(ti) â¡T. This is the frequency such that the data can include one
complete cycle. In subtracting off the dataâs mean, equation (13.8.4) already assumed that you
are not interested in the dataâs zero-frequency piece â which is just that mean value. In an
FFT method, higher independent frequencies would be integer multiples of 1/T. Because we
are interested in the statistical signiï¬cance of any peak that may occur, however, we had better
(over-) sample more ï¬nely than at interval 1/T, so that sample points lie close to the top of
any peak. Thus, the accompanyingprogram includes an oversampling parameter, called ofac;
a value ofac >â¼4 might be typical in use. We also want to specify how high in frequency
to go, say fhi. One guide to choosing fhi is to compare it with the Nyquist frequency fc
which would obtain if the N data points were evenly spaced over the same span T, that is
fc = N/(2T). The accompanying program includes an input parameter hifac, deï¬ned as
fhi/fc. The number of different frequencies NP returned by the program is then given by
NP = ofac Ã hifac

N
(13.8.9)
(You have to remember to dimension the output arrays to at least this size.)
The code does the trigonometric recurrences in double precision and embodies a few
tricks with trigonometric identities, to decrease roundoff errors. If you are an aï¬cionado of
such things you can puzzle it out. A ï¬nal detail is that equation (13.8.7) will fail because of
roundoff error if z is too large; but equation (13.8.8) is ï¬ne in this regime.

Fast Computation of the Lomb Periodogram
We here show how equations (13.8.4) and (13.8.5) can be calculated â approximately,
but to any desired precision â with an operation count only of order NP log NP .
The
method uses the FFT, but it is in no sense an FFT periodogram of the data. It is an actual
evaluation of equations (13.8.4) and (13.8.5), the Lomb normalized periodogram, with exactly
that methodâs strengths and weaknesses. This fast algorithm, due to Press and Rybicki [6],
makes feasible the application of the Lomb method to data sets at least as large as 106 points;
it is already faster than straightforward evaluation of equations (13.8.4) and (13.8.5) for data
sets as small as 60 or 100 points.
Notice that the trigonometric sums that occur in equations (13.8.5) and (13.8.4) can be
reduced to four simpler sums. If we deï¬ne

Now notice that if the tjs wereevenly spaced,then the four quantities Sh, Ch, S2, andC2 could
be evaluated by two complex FFTs, and the results could then be substituted back through
equation (13.8.12) to evaluate equations (13.8.5) and (13.8.4). The problem is therefore only
to evaluate equations (13.8.10) and (13.8.11) for unevenly spaced data.
Interpolation, or rather reverse interpolation â we will here call it extirpolation â
provides the key. Interpolation, as classically understood, uses several function values on a
regular mesh to construct an accurate approximation at an arbitrary point. Extirpolation, just
the opposite, replaces a function value at an arbitrary point by several function values on a
regular mesh, doing this in such a way that sums over the mesh are an accurate approximation
to sums over the original arbitrary point.
It is not hard to see that the weight functions for extirpolation are identical to those for
interpolation. Suppose that the function h(t) to be extirpolated is known only at the discrete

ï¬nenessof the mesh with respect to the function g and has nothing to do with the spacing of the
points tj or the function h; therefore the accuracy of equation (13.8.14) also has this property.
The general outline of the fast evaluation method is therefore this: (i) Choose a mesh
size large enough to accommodate some desired oversampling factor, and large enough to
have several extirpolation points per half-wavelength of the highest frequency of interest. (ii)
Extirpolate the values hi onto the mesh and take the FFT; this gives Sh and Ch in equation
(13.8.10). (iii) Extirpolate the constant values 1 onto another mesh, and take its FFT; this,
with some manipulation, gives S2 and C2 in equation (13.8.11). (iv) Evaluate equations
(13.8.12), (13.8.5), and (13.8.4), in that order.
There are several other tricks involved in implementing this algorithm efï¬ciently. You
can ï¬gure most out from the code, but we will mention the following points: (a) A nice way
to get transform values at frequencies 2Ï instead of Ï is to stretch the time-domain data by a
factor 2, and then wrap it to double-cover the original length. (This trick goes back to Tukey.)
In the program, this appears as a modulo function. (b) Trigonometric identities are used to
get from the left-hand side of equation (13.8.5) to the various needed trigonometric functions
of ÏÏ. C identiï¬ers like (e.g.) cwt and hs2wt represent quantities like (e.g.) cos ÏÏ and
1
2 sin(2ÏÏ). (c) The function spread does extirpolation onto the M most nearly centered
mesh points around an arbitrary point; its turgid code evaluates coefï¬cients of the Lagrange
interpolating polynomials, in an efï¬cient manner.

unsigned long *jmax, float *prob)
Given n data points with abscissas x[1..n] (which need not be equally spaced) and ordinates
y[1..n], and given a desired oversampling factor ofac (a typical value being 4 or larger), this
routine ï¬lls array wk1[1..nwk] with a sequence of nout increasing frequencies (not angular
frequencies) up to hifac times the âaverageâ Nyquist frequency, and ï¬lls array wk2[1..nwk]
with the values of the Lomb normalized periodogram at those frequencies. The arrays x and
y are not altered. nwk, the dimension of wk1 and wk2, must be large enough for intermediate
work space, or an error results. The routine also returns jmax such that wk2[jmax] is the
maximum element in wk2, and prob, an estimate of the signiï¬cance of that maximum against
the hypothesis of random noise. A small value of prob indicates that a signiï¬cant periodic
signal is present.

which is at any rate ï¬rst-order accurate. (If we centered the hjâs and the tjâs in the intervals,
we could be accurate to second order.) Now for certain values of Ï and M, the sum in
equation (13.9.4) can be made into a discrete Fourier transform, or DFT, and evaluated by
the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. In particular, we can choose M to be an integer
power of 2, and deï¬ne a set of special Ïâs by
Ïmââ¡2Ïm
M
(13.9.5)
where m has the values m = 0, 1, . . . , M/2 â1. Then equation (13.9.4) becomes

j=0
hje2Ïimj/M = âeiÏma[DFT(h0 . . . hMâ1)]m
(13.9.6)
Equation (13.9.6), while simple and clear, is emphatically not recommended for use: It is
likely to give wrong answers!
The problem lies in the oscillatory nature of the integral (13.9.1). If h(t) is at all smooth,
and if Ï is large enough to imply several cycles in the interval [a, b] â in fact, Ïm in equation
(13.9.5) gives exactly m cycles â then the value of I is typically very small, so small that
it is easily swamped by ï¬rst-order, or even (with centered values) second-order, truncation
error. Furthermore, the characteristic âsmall parameterâ that occurs in the error term is not
â/(b âa) = 1/M, as it would be if the integrand were not oscillatory, but Ïâ, which can be
as large as Ï for Ïâs within the Nyquist interval of the DFT (cf. equation 13.9.5). The result
is that equation (13.9.6) becomes systematically inaccurate as Ï increases.
It is a sobering exercise to implement equation (13.9.6) for an integral that can be done
analytically, and to see just how bad it is. We recommend that you try it.
Let us therefore turn to a more sophisticated treatment. Given the sampled points hj, we
can approximate the function h(t) everywhere in the interval [a, b] by interpolation on nearby
hjâs. The simplest case is linear interpolation, using the two nearest hjâs, one to the left and
one to the right. A higher-order interpolation, e.g., would be cubic interpolation, using two
points to the left and two to the right â except in the ï¬rst and last subintervals, where we
must interpolate with three hjâs on one side, one on the other.
The formulas for such interpolation schemes are (piecewise) polynomial in the inde-
pendent variable t, but with coefï¬cients that are of course linear in the function values
hj. Although one does not usually think of it in this way, interpolation can be viewed as
approximating a function by a sum of kernel functions (which dependonly on the interpolation
scheme) times sample values (which depend only on the function). Let us write
h(t) â
M

j=0
hj Ï
t âtj
â

+
X
j=endpoints
hj Ïj
t âtj
â

(13.9.7)
Here Ï(s) is the kernel function of an interior point: It is zero for s sufï¬ciently negative
or sufï¬ciently positive, and becomes nonzero only when s is in the range where the
hj multiplying it is actually used in the interpolation.
We always have Ï(0) = 1 and
Ï(m) = 0, m = Â±1, Â±2, . . . , since interpolation right on a sample point should give the
sampled function value. For linear interpolation Ï(s) is piecewise linear, rises from 0 to 1
for s in (â1, 0), and falls back to 0 for s in (0, 1). For higher-order interpolation, Ï(s) is
made up piecewise of segments of Lagrange interpolation polynomials. It has discontinuous
derivatives at integer values of s, where the pieces join, because the set of points used in
the interpolation changes discretely.
As already remarked, the subintervals closest to a and b require different (noncentered)
interpolation formulas. This is reï¬ected in equation (13.9.7) by the second sum, with the
special endpoint kernels Ïj(s). Actually, for reasons that will become clearer below, we have
included all the points in the ï¬rst sum (with kernel Ï), so the Ïjâs are actually differences
between true endpoint kernels and the interior kernel Ï. It is a tedious, but straightforward,
exercise to write down all the Ïj(s)âs for any particular order of interpolation, each one
consisting of differences of Lagrange interpolating polynomials spliced together piecewise.
Now apply the integral operator
R b
a dt exp(iÏt) to both sides of equation (13.9.7),
interchange the sums and integral, and make the changes of variable s = (t âtj)/âin the

The key point is that equations (13.9.9) and (13.9.10) can be evaluated, analytically,
once and for all, for any given interpolation scheme. Then equation (13.9.8) is an algorithm
for applying âendpoint correctionsâ to a sum which (as we will see) can be done using the
FFT, giving a result with high-order accuracy.
We will consider only interpolations that are left-right symmetric.

j(Î¸) = eiÏ(bâa)Î±*
j(Î¸)

where * denotes complex conjugation. Also, Ï(s) = Ï(âs) implies that W(Î¸) is real.
Turn now to the ï¬rst sum in equation (13.9.8), which we want to do by FFT methods.
To do so, choose some N that is an integer power of 2 with N â¥M + 1.
(Note that
M need not be a power of two, so M = N â1 is allowed.)
If N > M + 1, deï¬ne
hj â¡0, M + 1 < j â¤N â1, i.e., âzero padâ the array of hjâs so that j takes on the range

For ï¬xed M, the larger N is chosen, the ï¬ner the sampling in frequency space. The
value M, on the other hand, determines the highest frequency sampled, since âdecreases
with increasing M (equation 13.9.3), and the largest value of Ïâis always just under Ï
(equation 13.9.12). In general it is advantageous to oversample by at least a factor of 4, i.e.,
N > 4M (see below). We can now rewrite equation (13.9.8) in its ï¬nal form as
I(Ïn) = âeiÏna

The program dftcor, below, implements the endpoint corrections for the cubic case.
Given input values ofÏ,â, a, b, and an array with the eight valuesh0, . . . , h3, hMâ3, . . . , hM,
it returns the real and imaginary parts of the endpoint corrections in equation (13.9.13), and the
factor W(Î¸). The code is turgid, but only because the formulas above are complicated. The
formulas have cancellationsto high powers of Î¸. It is therefore necessaryto compute the right-
hand sides in double precision, even when the corrections are desired only to single precision.
It is also necessary to use the series expansion for small values of Î¸. The optimal cross-over
value of Î¸ depends on your machineâs wordlength, but you can always ï¬nd it experimentally
as the largest value where the two methods give identical results to machine precision.
#include <math.h>
void dftcor(float w, float delta, float a, float b, float endpts[],
float *corre, float *corim, float *corfac)
For an integral approximated by a discrete Fourier transform, this routine computes the cor-
rection factor that multiplies the DFT and the endpoint correction to be added. Input is the
angular frequency w, stepsize delta, lower and upper limits of the integral a and b, while the
array endpts contains the ï¬rst 4 and last 4 function values. The correction factor W(Î¸) is
returned as corfac, while the real and imaginary parts of the endpoint correction are returned
as corre and corim.

Since the use of dftcor can be confusing, we also give an illustrative program dftint
which uses dftcor to compute equation (13.9.1) for general a, b, Ï, and h(t). Several points
within this program bear mentioning: The parameters M and NDFT correspond to M and N
in the above discussion. On successive calls, we recompute the Fourier transform only if
a or b or h(t) has changed.
Since dftint is designed to work for any value of Ï satisfying Ïâ< Ï, not just the
special values returned by the DFT (equation 13.9.12), we do polynomial interpolation of
degree MPOL on the DFT spectrum. You should be warned that a large factor of oversampling
(N â«M) is required for this interpolation to be accurate. After interpolation, we add the
endpoint corrections from dftcor, which can be evaluated for any Ï.
While dftcor is good at what it does, dftint is illustrative only. It is not a general
purpose program, because it does not adapt its parameters M, NDFT, MPOL, or its interpolation
scheme, to any particular function h(t).
You will have to experiment with your own
application.

The values of M, NDFT, and MPOL are merely illustrative and should be optimized for your
particular application. M is the number of subintervals, NDFT is the length of the FFT (a power
of 2), and MPOL is the degree of polynomial interpolation used to obtain the desired frequency
from the FFT.
void dftint(float (*func)(float), float a, float b, float w, float *cosint,
float *sinint)
Example program illustrating how to use the routine dftcor. The user supplies an external
function func that returns the quantity h(t). The routine then returns R b
a cos(Ït)h(t) dt as
cosint and
R b
a sin(Ït)h(t) dt as sinint.
{
void dftcor(float w, float delta, float a, float b, float endpts[],
float *corre, float *corim, float *corfac);
void polint(float xa[], float ya[], int n, float x, float *y, float *dy);
void realft(float data[], unsigned long n, int isign);
static int init=0;
int j,nn;
static float aold = -1.e30,bold = -1.e30,delta,(*funcold)(float);
static float data[NDFT+1],endpts[9];
float c,cdft,cerr,corfac,corim,corre,en,s;
float sdft,serr,*cpol,*spol,*xpol;
cpol=vector(1,MPOL);
spol=vector(1,MPOL);
xpol=vector(1,MPOL);
if (init != 1 || a != aold || b != bold || func != funcold) {
Do we need to initialize, or is only Ï changed?
init=1;
aold=a;
bold=b;
funcold=func;
delta=(b-a)/M;
Load the function values into the data array.
for (j=1;j<=M+1;j++)
data[j]=(*func)(a+(j-1)*delta);
for (j=M+2;j<=NDFT;j++)
Zero pad the rest of the data array.
data[j]=0.0;
for (j=1;j<=4;j++) {
Load the endpoints.
endpts[j]=data[j];
endpts[j+4]=data[M-3+j];
}
realft(data,NDFT,1);
realft returns the unused value corresponding to ÏN/2 in data[2]. We actually want
this element to contain the imaginary part corresponding to Ï0, which is zero.
data[2]=0.0;
}
Now interpolate on the DFT result for the desired frequency. If the frequency is an Ïn,
i.e., the quantity en is an integer, then cdft=data[2*en-1], sdft=data[2*en], and you
could omit the interpolation.
en=w*delta*NDFT/TWOPI+1.0;
nn=IMIN(IMAX((int)(en-0.5*MPOL+1.0),1),NDFT/2-MPOL+1); Leftmost point for the
interpolation.
for (j=1;j<=MPOL;j++,nn++) {
cpol[j]=data[2*nn-1];
spol[j]=data[2*nn];
xpol[j]=nn;
}
polint(xpol,cpol,MPOL,en,&cdft,&cerr);
polint(xpol,spol,MPOL,en,&sdft,&serr);
dftcor(w,delta,a,b,endpts,&corre,&corim,&corfac);
Now get the endpoint cor-
rection and the mul-
tiplicative factor W(Î¸).
cdft *= corfac;
sdft *= corfac;
cdft += corre;
sdft += corim;

Sometimes one is interested only in the discrete frequencies Ïm of equation (13.9.5),
the ones that have integral numbers of periods in the interval [a, b]. For smooth h(t), the
value of I tends to be much smaller in magnitude at these Ïâs than at values in between,
since the integral half-periods tend to cancel precisely. (That is why one must oversample for
interpolation to be accurate: I(Ï) is oscillatory with small magnitude near the Ïmâs.) If you
want these Ïmâs without messy (and possibly inaccurate) interpolation, you have to set N to
a multiple of M (compare equations 13.9.5 and 13.9.12). In the method implemented above,
however, N must be at least M + 1, so the smallest such multiple is 2M, resulting in a factor
â¼2 unnecessary computing. Alternatively, one can derive a formula like equation (13.9.13),
but with the last sample function hM = h(b) omitted from the DFT, but included entirely in
the endpoint correction for hM. Then one can set M = N (an integer power of 2) and get the
special frequencies of equation (13.9.5) with no additional overhead. The modiï¬ed formula is
I(Ïm) = âeiÏma

Factors like W(Î¸) arise naturally wheneverone calculates Fourier coefï¬cients of smooth
functions, and they are sometimes called attenuation factors [1].
However, the endpoint
corrections are equally important in obtaining accurate values of integrals.
Narasimhan
and Karthikeyan [2] have given a formula that is algebraically equivalent to our trapezoidal
formula. However, their formula requires the evaluation of two FFTs, which is unnecessary.
The basic idea used here goes back at least to Filon [3] in 1928 (before the FFT!). He used
Simpsonâs rule (quadratic interpolation). Since this interpolation is not left-right symmetric,
two Fourier transforms are required. An alternative algorithm for equation (13.9.14) has been
given by Lyness in [4]; for related references, see [5]. To our knowledge, the cubic-order
formulas derived here have not previously appeared in the literature.
Calculating Fourier transforms when the range of integration is (ââ, â) can be tricky.
If the function falls off reasonably quickly at inï¬nity, you can split the integral at a large
enough value of t. For example, the integration to + âcan be written

13.10 Wavelet Transforms
Like the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is
a fast, linear operation that operates on a data vector whose length is an integer power
of two, transforming it into a numerically different vector of the same length. Also
like the FFT, the wavelet transform is invertible and in fact orthogonal â the inverse
transform, when viewed as a big matrix, is simply the transpose of the transform.
Both FFT and DWT, therefore, can be viewed as a rotation in function space, from
the input space (or time) domain, where the basis functions are the unit vectors ei,
or Dirac delta functions in the continuum limit, to a different domain. For the FFT,
this new domain has basis functions that are the familiar sines and cosines. In the
wavelet domain, the basis functions are somewhat more complicated and have the
fanciful names âmother functionsâ and âwavelets.â
Of course there are an inï¬nity of possible bases for function space, almost all of
them uninteresting! What makes the wavelet basis interesting is that, unlike sines and
cosines, individual wavelet functions are quite localized in space; simultaneously,
like sines and cosines, individual wavelet functions are quite localized in frequency
or (more precisely) characteristic scale. As we will see below, the particular kind
of dual localization achieved by wavelets renders large classes of functions and
operators sparse, or sparse to some high accuracy, when transformed into the wavelet
domain. Analogously with the Fourier domain, where a class of computations, like
convolutions, become computationally fast, there is a large class of computations

â those that can take advantage of sparsity â that become computationally fast
in the wavelet domain [1].
Unlike sines and cosines, which deï¬ne a unique Fourier transform, there is
not one single unique set of wavelets; in fact, there are inï¬nitely many possible
sets.
Roughly, the different sets of wavelets make different trade-offs between
how compactly they are localized in space and how smooth they are. (There are
further ï¬ne distinctions.)
Daubechies Wavelet Filter Coefï¬cients
A particular set of wavelets is speciï¬ed by a particular set of numbers, called
wavelet ï¬lter coefï¬cients. Here, we will largely restrict ourselves to wavelet ï¬lters
in a class discovered by Daubechies [2]. This class includes members ranging from
highly localized to highly smooth. The simplest (and most localized) member, often
called DAUB4, has only four coefï¬cients, c0, . . ., c3. For the moment we specialize
to this case for ease of notation.
Consider the following transformation matrix acting on a column vector of
data to its right:

(13.10.1)
Here blank entries signifyzeroes. Note the structure of this matrix. The ï¬rst row
generates one component of the data convolved with the ï¬lter coefï¬cients c0 . . ., c3.
Likewise the third, ï¬fth, and other odd rows. If the even rows followed this pattern,
offset by one, then the matrix would be a circulant, that is, an ordinary convolution
that could be done by FFT methods. (Note how the last two rows wrap around
like convolutions with periodic boundary conditions.) Instead of convolving with
c0, . . ., c3, however, the even rows perform a different convolution, with coefï¬cients
c3, âc2, c1, âc0. The action of the matrix, overall, is thus to perform two related
convolutions, then to decimate each of them by half (throw away half the values),
and interleave the remaining halves.
It is useful to think of the ï¬lter c0, . . ., c3 as being a smoothing ï¬lter, call it H,
something like a moving average of four points. Then, because of the minus signs,
the ï¬lter c3, âc2, c1, âc0, call it G, is not a smoothing ï¬lter. (In signal processing
contexts, H and G are called quadrature mirror ï¬lters [3].) In fact, the câs are chosen
so as to make G yield, insofar as possible, a zero response to a sufï¬ciently smooth
data vector. This is done by requiring the sequence c3, âc2, c1, âc0 to have a certain
number of vanishing moments. When this is the case for p moments (starting with
the zeroth), a set of wavelets is said to satisfy an âapproximation condition of order

p.â This results in the output of H, decimated by half, accurately representing the
dataâs âsmoothâ information. The output of G, also decimated, is referred to as
the dataâs âdetailâ information [4].
For such a characterization to be useful, it must be possible to reconstruct the
original data vector of length N from its N/2 smooth or s-components and its N/2
detail or d-components. That is effected by requiring the matrix (13.10.1) to be
orthogonal, so that its inverse is just the transposed matrix

For higher p, up to 10, Daubechies [2] has tabulated the coefï¬cients numerically. The
number of coefï¬cients increases by two each time p is increased by one.
Discrete Wavelet Transform
We have not yet deï¬ned the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), but we are
almost there:
The DWT consists of applying a wavelet coefï¬cient matrix like
(13.10.1) hierarchically, ï¬rst to the full data vector of length N, then to the âsmoothâ
vector of length N/2, then to the âsmooth-smoothâ vector of length N/4, and
so on until only a trivial number of âsmooth-. . .-smoothâ components (usually 2)
remain. The procedure is sometimes called a pyramidal algorithm [4], for obvious
reasons. The output of the DWT consists of these remaining components and all
the âdetailâ components that were accumulated along the way. A diagram should
make the procedure clear:

(13.10.7)
If the length of the data vector were a higher power of two, there would be
more stages of applying (13.10.1) (or any other wavelet coefï¬cients) and permuting.
The endpoint will always be a vector with two Sâs and a hierarchy of Dâs, Dâs,
dâs, etc. Notice that once dâs are generated, they simply propagate through to all
subsequent stages.
A value di of any level is termed a âwavelet coefï¬cientâ of the original data
vector; the ï¬nal values S1, S2 shouldstrictlybe called âmother-functioncoefï¬cients,â
although the term âwavelet coefï¬cientsâ is often used loosely for both dâs and ï¬nal
Sâs. Since the full procedure is a composition of orthogonal linear operations, the
whole DWT is itself an orthogonal linear operator.
To invert the DWT, one simply reverses the procedure, starting with the smallest
level of the hierarchy and working (in equation 13.10.7) from right to left. The
inverse matrix (13.10.2) is of course used instead of the matrix (13.10.1).
As already noted, the matrices (13.10.1) and (13.10.2) embody periodic (âwrap-
aroundâ) boundary conditions on the data vector. One normally accepts this as a
minor inconvenience: the last few wavelet coefï¬cients at each level of the hierarchy
are affected by data from both ends of the data vector. By circularly shifting the
matrix (13.10.1) N/2 columns to the left, one can symmetrize the wrap-around;
but this does not eliminate it. It is in fact possible to eliminate the wrap-around

completely by altering the coefï¬cients in the ï¬rst and last N rows of (13.10.1),
giving an orthogonal matrix that is purely band-diagonal [5]. This variant, beyond
our scope here, is useful when, e.g., the data varies by many orders of magnitude
from one end of the data vector to the other.
Here is a routine, wt1, that performs the pyramidal algorithm (or its inverse
if isign is negative) on some data vector a[1..n]. Successive applications of
the wavelet ï¬lter, and accompanying permutations, are done by an assumed routine
wtstep, which must be provided. (We give examples of several different wtstep
routines just below.)
void wt1(float a[], unsigned long n, int isign,
void (*wtstep)(float [], unsigned long, int))
One-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. This routine implements the pyramid algorithm,
replacing a[1..n] by its wavelet transform (for isign=1), or performing the inverse operation
(for isign=-1). Note that n MUST be an integer power of 2. The routine wtstep, whose
actual name must be supplied in calling this routine, is the underlying wavelet ï¬lter. Examples
of wtstep are daub4 and (preceded by pwtset) pwt.

} else {

for (nn=4;nn<=n;nn<<=1) (*wtstep)(a,nn,isign);

For larger sets of wavelet coefï¬cients, the wrap-around of the last rows or
columns is a programming inconvenience.
An efï¬cient implementation would
handle the wrap-arounds as special cases, outside of the main loop. Here, we will
content ourselves with a more general scheme involving some extra arithmetic at
run time. The following routine sets up any particular wavelet coefï¬cients whose

obvious manner. This routine must be called (once) before the ï¬rst use of pwt. (For the case
n=4, the speciï¬c routine daub4 is considerably faster than pwt.)

Figure 13.10.1.
Wavelet functions, that is, single basis functions from the wavelet families DAUB4
and DAUB20. A complete, orthonormal wavelet basis consists of scalings and translations of either one
of these functions. DAUB4 has an inï¬nite number of cusps; DAUB20 would show similar behavior
in a higher derivative.
What Do Wavelets Look Like?
We are now in a position actually to see some wavelets. To do so, we simply
run unit vectors through any of the above discrete wavelet transforms, with isign
negative so that the inverse transform is performed.
Figure 13.10.1 shows the
DAUB4 wavelet that is the inverse DWT of a unit vector in the 5th component of a
vector of length 1024, and also the DAUB20 wavelet that is the inverse of the 22nd
component. (One needs to go to a later hierarchical level for DAUB20, to avoid a
wavelet with a wrapped-around tail.) Other unit vectors would give wavelets with
the same shapes, but different positions and scales.
One sees that both DAUB4 and DAUB20 have wavelets that are continuous.
DAUB20 wavelets also have higher continuousderivatives. DAUB4 has the peculiar
property that its derivative exists only almost everywhere. Examples of where it
fails to exist are the points p/2n, where p and n are integers; at such points, DAUB4
is left differentiable, but not right differentiable! This kind of discontinuity â at
least in some derivative â is a necessary feature of wavelets with compact support,
like the Daubechies series. For every increase in the number of wavelet coefï¬cients
by two, the Daubechies wavelets gain about half a derivative of continuity. (But not
exactly half; the actual orders of regularity are irrational numbers!)
Note that the fact that wavelets are not smooth does not prevent their having
exact representations for some smooth functions,as demanded by their approximation
order p. The continuity of a wavelet is not the same as the continuity of functions

More wavelets, here generated from the sum of two unit vectors, e10 + e58, which
are in different hierarchical levels of scale, and also at different spatial positions. DAUB4 wavelets (a)
are deï¬ned by a ï¬lter in coordinate space (equation 13.10.5), while Lemarie wavelets (b) are deï¬ned by
a ï¬lter most easily written in Fourier space (equation 13.10.14).
that a set of wavelets can represent. For example, DAUB4 can represent (piecewise)
linear functions of arbitrary slope: in the correct linear combinations, the cusps all
cancel out. Every increase of two in the number of coefï¬cients allows one higher
order of polynomial to be exactly represented.
Figure 13.10.2 shows the result of performing the inverse DWT on the input
vector e10 + e58, again for the two different particular wavelets. Since 10 lies early
in the hierarchical range of 9 â16, that wavelet lies on the left side of the picture.
Since 58 lies in a later (smaller-scale) hierarchy, it is a narrower wavelet; in the range
of 33â64 it is towards the end, so it lies on the right side of the picture. Note that
smaller-scale wavelets are taller, so as to have the same squared integral.
Wavelet Filters in the Fourier Domain
The Fourier transform of a set of ï¬lter coefï¬cients cj is given by
H(Ï) =
X
j
cjeijÏ
(13.10.8)
Here H is a function periodic in 2Ï, and it has the same meaning as before: It is
the wavelet ï¬lter, now written in the Fourier domain. A very useful fact is that the
orthogonality conditions for the câs (e.g., equation 13.10.3 above) collapse to two
simple relations in the Fourier domain,

(13.10.10)
Likewise the approximation condition of order p (e.g., equation 13.10.4 above)
has a simple formulation, requiring that H(Ï) have a pth order zero at Ï = Ï,
or (equivalently)
H(m)(Ï) = 0
m = 0, 1, . . ., p â1
(13.10.11)
It is thus relatively straightforward to invent wavelet sets in the Fourier domain.
You simply invent a function H(Ï) satisfying equations (13.10.9)â(13.10.11). To
ï¬nd the actual cjâs applicable to a data (or s-component) vector of length N, and
with periodic wrap-around as in matrices (13.10.1) and (13.10.2), you invert equation
(13.10.8) by the discrete Fourier transform
cj = 1

k=0
H(2Ïk
N )eâ2Ïijk/N
(13.10.12)
The quadrature mirror ï¬lter G (reversed cjâs with alternating signs), incidentally,
has the Fourier representation
G(Ï) = eâiÏH*(Ï + Ï)
(13.10.13)
where asterisk denotes complex conjugation.
In general the above procedure will not produce wavelet ï¬lters with compact
support. In other words, all N of the cjâs, j = 0, . . ., N â1 will in general be
nonzero (though they may be rapidly decreasing in magnitude). The Daubechies
wavelets, or other wavelets with compact support, are specially chosen so that H(Ï)
is a trigonometric polynomial with only a small number of Fourier components,
guaranteeing that there will be only a small number of nonzero cjâs.
On the other hand, there is sometimes no particular reason to demand compact
support. Giving it up in fact allows the ready construction of relatively smoother
wavelets (higher values of p).
Even without compact support, the convolutions
implicit in the matrix (13.10.1) can be done efï¬ciently by FFT methods.
Lemarieâs wavelet (see [4]) has p = 4, does not have compact support, and is
deï¬ned by the choice of H(Ï),
H(Ï) =

1/2
(13.10.14)
where
u â¡sin2 Ï
2
v â¡sin2 Ï
(13.10.15)
It is beyond our scope to explain where equation (13.10.14) comes from.
An
informal description is that the quadrature mirror ï¬lter G(Ï) deriving from equation
(13.10.14) has the property that it gives identically zero when applied to any function
whose odd-numbered samples are equal to the cubic spline interpolation of its
even-numbered samples. Since this class of functions includes many very smooth
members, it follows that H(Ï) does a good job of truly selecting a functionâs smooth
information content. Sample Lemarie wavelets are shown in Figure 13.10.2.

only 130 out of 1024 coefï¬cients are larger than 10â4 (or larger than about 10â5 times the largest
coefï¬cient, whose value is â¼10).
Truncated Wavelet Approximations
Most of the usefulness of wavelets rests on the fact that wavelet transforms
can usefully be severely truncated, that is, turned into sparse expansions.
The
case of Fourier transforms is different: FFTs are ordinarily used without truncation,
to compute fast convolutions, for example. This works because the convolution
operator is particularly simple in the Fourier basis. There are not, however, any
standard mathematical operations that are especially simple in the wavelet basis.
To see how truncation works, consider the simple example shown in Figure
13.10.3. The upper panel shows an arbitrarily chosen test function, smooth except
for a square-root cusp, sampled onto a vector of length 210.
The bottom panel
(solid curve) shows, on a log scale, the absolute value of the vectorâs components
after it has been run through the DAUB4 discrete wavelet transform. One notes,
from right to left, the different levels of hierarchy, 513â1024, 257â512, 129â256,
etc. Within each level, the wavelet coefï¬cients are non-negligible only very near the
location of the cusp, or very near the left and right boundaries of the hierarchical
range (edge effects).
The dotted curve in the lower panel of Figure 13.10.3 plots the same amplitudes
as the solid curve, but sorted into decreasing order of size. One can read off, for
example, that the 130th largest wavelet coefï¬cient has an amplitude less than 10â5
of the largest coefï¬cient, whose magnitude is â¼10 (power or square integral ratio
less than 10â10). Thus, the example function can be represented quite accurately
by only 130, rather than 1024, coefï¬cients â the remaining ones being set to zero.
Note that this kind of truncation makes the vector sparse, but not shorter than 1024.
It is very important that vectors in wavelet space be truncated according to the
amplitude of the components, not their position in the vector. Keeping the ï¬rst 256

components of the vector (all levels of the hierarchy except the last two) would give
an extremely poor, and jagged, approximation to the function. When you compress
a function with wavelets, you have to record both the values and the positions of
the nonzero coefï¬cients.
Generally, compact (and therefore unsmooth) wavelets are better for lower
accuracy approximation and for functions with discontinuities (like edges), while
smooth (and therefore noncompact) wavelets are better for achieving high numerical
accuracy. This makes compact wavelets a good choice for image compression, for
example, while it makes smooth wavelets best for fast solution of integral equations.
Wavelet Transform in Multidimensions
A wavelet transform of a d-dimensional array is most easily obtained by
transforming the array sequentiallyon its ï¬rst index (forall values of its other indices),
then on its second, and so on. Each transformation corresponds to multiplication
by an orthogonal matrix. By matrix associativity, the result is independent of the
order in which the indices were transformed. The situation is exactly like that for
multidimensional FFTs. A routine for effecting the multidimensional DWT can thus
be modeled on a multidimensional FFT routine like fourn:
#include "nrutil.h"
void wtn(float a[], unsigned long nn[], int ndim, int isign,
void (*wtstep)(float [], unsigned long, int))
Replaces a by its ndim-dimensional discrete wavelet transform, if isign is input as 1. Here
nn[1..ndim] is an integer array containing the lengths of each dimension (number of real
values), which MUST all be powers of 2. a is a real array of length equal to the product of
these lengths, in which the data are stored as in a multidimensional real array. If isign is input
as â1, a is replaced by its inverse wavelet transform. The routine wtstep, whose actual name
must be supplied in calling this routine, is the underlying wavelet ï¬lter. Examples of wtstep
are daub4 and (preceded by pwtset) pwt.

Here, as before, wtstep is an individual wavelet step, either daub4 or pwt.
Compression of Images
An immediate application of the multidimensional transform wtn is to image
compression. The overall procedure is to take the wavelet transform of a digitized
image, and then to âallocate bitsâ among the wavelet coefï¬cients in some highly
nonuniform, optimized, manner. In general, large wavelet coefï¬cients get quantized
accurately, while small coefï¬cients are quantized coarsely with only a bit or two
â or else are truncated completely.
If the resulting quantization levels are still
statistically nonuniform, they may then be further compressed by a technique like
Huffman coding (Â§20.4).
While a more detailed description of the âback endâ of this process, namely the
quantization and coding of the image, is beyond our scope, it is quite straightforward
to demonstrate the âfront-endâ wavelet encoding with a simple truncation: We keep
(with full accuracy) all wavelet coefï¬cients larger than some threshold, and we delete
(set to zero) all smaller wavelet coefï¬cients. We can then adjust the threshold to
vary the fraction of preserved coefï¬cients.
Figure 13.10.4 shows a sequence of images that differ in the number of wavelet
coefï¬cients that have been kept. The original picture (a), which is an ofï¬cial IEEE
test image, has 256 by 256 pixels with an 8-bit grayscale. The two reproductions
following are reconstructed with 23% (b) and 5.5% (c) of the 65536 wavelet
coefï¬cients.
The latter image illustrates the kind of compromises made by the
truncated wavelet representation. High-contrast edges (the modelâs right cheek and
hair highlights,e.g.) are maintained at a relativelyhighresolution, whilelow-contrast
areas (the modelâs left eye and cheek, e.g.) are washed out into what amounts to
large constant pixels. Figure 13.10.4 (d) is the result of performing the identical
procedure with Fourier, instead of wavelet, transforms: The ï¬gure is reconstructed
from the 5.5% of 65536 real Fourier components having the largest magnitudes.
One sees that, since sines and cosines are nonlocal, the resolution is uniformly poor
across the picture; also, the deletion of any components produces a mottled âringingâ
everywhere. (Practical Fourier image compression schemes therefore break up an
image into small blocks of pixels, 16 Ã 16, say, and do rather elaborate smoothing
across block boundaries when the image is reconstructed.)
Fast Solution of Linear Systems
One of the most interesting, and promising, wavelet applications is linear
algebra. The basic idea [1] is to thinkof an integral operator (that is, a large matrix) as
a digital image. Suppose that the operator compresses well under a two-dimensional
wavelet transform, i.e., that a large fraction of its wavelet coefï¬cients are so small
as to be negligible. Then any linear system involving the operator becomes a sparse

(Note that the routine wtn does the complete transformation of A into eA.)

even nearly singular) elements near to its main diagonal, but becomes smooth away
from the diagonal. An example might be

matrix, where i and j range over 1 . . .256, using the DAUB12 wavelets. Elements
larger in magnitude than 10â3 times the maximum element are shown as black

In the ï¬gure, one sees the hierarchical decomposition into power-of-two sized
blocks. At the edges or corners of the various blocks, one sees edge effects caused
by the wrap-around wavelet boundary conditions. Apart from edge effects, within
each block, the nonnegligible elements are concentrated along the block diagonals.
This is a statement that, for this type of linear operator, a wavelet is coupled mainly

13.11 Numerical Use of the Sampling Theorem
In Â§6.10 we implemented an approximating formula for Dawsonâs integral due to
Rybicki. Now that we have become Fourier sophisticates, we can learn that the formula
derives from numerical application of the sampling theorem (Â§12.1), normally considered to
be a purely analytic tool. Our discussion is identical to Rybicki [1].
For present purposes, the sampling theorem is most conveniently stated as follows:
Consider an arbitrary function g(t) and the grid of sampling points tn = Î± + nh, where n
ranges over the integers and Î± is a constant that allows an arbitrary shift of the sampling
grid.
We then write
g(t) =
â
X
n=ââ
g(tn) sinc Ï
h (t âtn) + e(t)
(13.11.1)
where sinc x â¡sin x/x. The summation over the sampling points is called the sampling
representation of g(t), and e(t) is its error term.
The sampling theorem asserts that the
sampling representation is exact, that is, e(t) â¡0, if the Fourier transform of g(t),
G(Ï) =
Z â

vanishes identically for |Ï| â¥Ï/h.
When can sampling representations be used to advantage for the approximate numerical
computation of functions? In order that the error term be small, the Fourier transform G(Ï)
must be sufï¬ciently small for |Ï| â¥Ï/h. On the other hand, in order for the summation
in (13.11.1) to be approximated by a reasonably small number of terms, the function g(t)
itself should be very small outside of a fairly limited range of values of t. Thus we are
led to two conditions to be satisï¬ed in order that (13.11.1) be useful numerically: Both the
function g(t) and its Fourier transform G(Ï) must rapidly approach zero for large values
of their respective arguments.
Unfortunately, these two conditions are mutually antagonistic â the Uncertainty Princi-
ple in quantum mechanics. There exist strict limits on how rapidly the simultaneous approach
to zero can be in both arguments. According to a theorem of Hardy [2], if g(t) = O(eât2)
as |t| ââand G(Ï) = O(eâÏ2/4) as |Ï| ââ, then g(t) â¡Ceât2, where C is a
constant. This can be interpreted as saying that of all functions the Gaussian is the most
rapidly decaying in both t and Ï, and in this sense is the âbestâ function to be expressed
numerically as a sampling representation.
Let us then write for the Gaussian g(t) = eât2,
eât2 =
â
X
n=ââ
eât2
n sinc Ï
h (t âtn) + e(t)
(13.11.3)
The error e(t) depends on the parameters h and Î± as well as on t, but it is sufï¬cient for
the present purposes to state the bound,
|e(t)| < eâ(Ï/2h)2
(13.11.4)
which can be understood simply as the order of magnitude of the Fourier transform of the
Gaussian at the point where it âspills overâ into the region |Ï| > Ï/h.
When the summation in (13.11.3) is approximated by one with ï¬nite limits, say from
N0 âN to N0 + N, where N0 is the integer nearest to âÎ±/h, there is a further truncation
error. However, if N is chosen so that N > Ï/(2h2), the truncation error in the summation
is less than the bound given by (13.11.4), and, since this bound is an overestimate, we
shall continue to use it for (13.11.3) as well. The truncated summation gives a remarkably
accurate representation for the Gaussian even for moderate values of N.
For example,
|e(t)| < 5 Ã 10â5 for h = 1/2 and N = 7; |e(t)| < 2 Ã 10â10 for h = 1/3 and N = 15;
and |e(t)| < 7 Ã 10â18 for h = 1/4 and N = 25.
One may ask, what is the point of such a numerical representation for the Gaussian,
which can be computed so easily and quickly as an exponential? The answer is that many
transcendental functions can be expressed as an integral involving the Gaussian, and by
substituting (13.11.3) one can often ï¬nd excellent approximations to the integrals as a sum
over elementary functions.
Let us consider as an example the function w(z) of the complex variable z = x + iy,
related to the complex error function by
w(z) = eâz2 erfc(âiz)
(13.11.5)
having the integral representation
w(z) = 1
Ïi
Z
C
eât2 dt
t âz
(13.11.6)
where the contour C extends from ââto â, passing below z (see, e.g., [3]). Many methods
exist for the evaluation of this function (e.g., [4]). Substituting the sampling representation
(13.11.3) into (13.11.6) and performing the resulting elementary contour integrals, we obtain

where we now omit the error term. One should note that there is no singularity as z âtm
for some n = m, but a special treatment of the mth term will be required in this case (for
example, by power series expansion).
An alternative form of equation (13.11.7) can be found by expressing the complex expo-
nential in (13.11.7) in terms of trigonometric functions and using the sampling representation
(13.11.3) with z replacing t.

This form is particularly useful in obtaining Re w(z) when |y| âª1. Note that in evaluating
(13.11.7) the exponential inside the summation is a constant and needs to be evaluated only
once; a similar comment holds for the cosine in (13.11.8).
There are a variety of formulas that can now be derived from either equation (13.11.7)
or (13.11.8) by choosing particular values of Î±. Eight interesting choices are: Î± = 0, x, iy,
or z, plus the values obtained by adding h/2 to each of these. Since the error bound (13.11.3)
assumed a real value of Î±, the choices involving a complex Î± are useful only if the imaginary
part of z is not too large. This is not the place to catalog all sixteen possible formulas, and we
give only two particular cases that show some of the important features.
First of all let Î± = 0 in equation (13.11.8), which yields,
w(z) âeâz2 + 1
Ïi
â
X
n=ââ
heâ(nh)2 1 â(â1)n cos(Ïz/h)
nh âz
(13.11.9)
This approximation is good over the entire z-plane. As stated previously, one has to treat the
case where one denominator becomes small by expansion in a power series. Formulas for
the case Î± = 0 were discussed brieï¬y in [5]. They are similar, but not identical, to formulas
derived by Chiarella and Reichel [6], using the method of Goodwin [7].
Next, let Î± = z in (13.11.7), which yields
w(z) âeâz2 â2
Ïi
X
n odd
eâ(zânh)2
n
(13.11.10)
the sum being over all odd integers (positive and negative). Note that we have made the
substitution n âân in the summation. This formula is simpler than (13.11.9) and contains
half the number of terms, but its error is worse if y is large. Equation (13.11.10) is the source
of the approximation formula (6.10.3) for Dawsonâs integral, used in Â§6.10.

Chapter 14.
Statistical Description
of Data
14.0 Introduction
In this chapter and the next, the concept of data enters the discussion more
prominently than before.
Data consist of numbers, of course. But these numbers are fed intothe computer,
not produced by it. These are numbers to be treated with considerable respect, neither
to be tampered with, nor subjected to a numerical process whose character you do
not completely understand. You are well advised to acquire a reverence for data that
is rather different from the âsportyâ attitude that is sometimes allowable, or even
commendable, in other numerical tasks.
The analysis of data inevitably involves some trafï¬cking with the ï¬eld of
statistics, that gray area which is not quite a branch of mathematics â and just as
surely not quite a branch of science. In the following sections, you will repeatedly
encounter the following paradigm:
â¢ apply some formula to the data to compute âa statisticâ
â¢ compute where the value of that statistic falls in a probability distribution
that is computed on the basis of some ânull hypothesisâ
â¢ if it falls in a very unlikely spot, way out on a tail of the distribution,
conclude that the null hypothesis is false for your data set
If a statistic falls in a reasonable part of the distribution, you must not make
the mistake of concluding that the null hypothesis is âveriï¬edâ or âproved.â That is
the curse of statistics, that it can never prove things, only disprove them! At best,
you can substantiate a hypothesis by ruling out, statistically, a whole long list of
competing hypotheses, every one that has ever been proposed. After a while your
adversaries and competitors will give up trying to think of alternative hypotheses,
or else they will grow old and die, and then your hypothesis will become accepted.
Sounds crazy, we know, but thatâs how science works!
In this book we make a somewhat arbitrary distinction between data analysis
procedures that are model-independent and those that are model-dependent. In the
former category, we include so-called descriptive statistics that characterize a data
set in general terms: its mean, variance, and so on. We also include statistical tests
that seek to establish the âsamenessâ or âdifferentnessâ of two or more data sets, or
that seek to establish and measure a degree of correlation between two data sets.
These subjects are discussed in this chapter.

In the other category, model-dependent statistics, we lump the whole subject of
ï¬tting data to a theory, parameter estimation, least-squares ï¬ts, and so on. Those
subjects are introduced in Chapter 15.
Section 14.1 deals with so-called measures of central tendency, the moments of
a distribution, the median and mode. In Â§14.2 we learn to test whether different data
sets are drawn from distributions with different values of these measures of central
tendency. This leads naturally, in Â§14.3, to the more general question of whether two
distributions can be shown to be (signiï¬cantly) different.
In Â§14.4âÂ§14.7, we deal with measures of association for two distributions.
We want to determine whether two variables are âcorrelatedâ or âdependentâ on
one another.
If they are, we want to characterize the degree of correlation in
some simple ways. The distinction between parametric and nonparametric (rank)
methods is emphasized.
Section 14.8 introduces the concept of data smoothing, and discusses the
particular case of Savitzky-Golay smoothing ï¬lters.
This chapter draws mathematically on the material on special functions that
was presented in Chapter 6, especially Â§6.1âÂ§6.4.

distribution with very broad âtails,â the mean may converge poorly, or not at all, as
the number of sampled points is increased. Alternative estimators, the median and
the mode, are mentioned at the end of this section.
Having characterized a distributionâs central value, one conventionally next
characterizes its âwidthâ or âvariabilityâ around that value. Here again, more than

Equation (14.1.2) estimates the mean squared deviation of x from its mean value.
There is a long story about why the denominator of (14.1.2) is N â1 instead of
N. If you have never heard that story, you may consult any good statistics text.
Here we will be content to note that the N â1 should be changed to N if you
are ever in the situation of measuring the variance of a distribution whose mean
x is known a priori rather than being estimated from the data.
(We might also
comment that if the difference between N and N â1 ever matters to you, then you
are probably up to no good anyway â e.g., trying to substantiate a questionable
hypothesis with marginal data.)
As the mean depends on the ï¬rst moment of the data, so do the variance and
standard deviation depend on the second moment.
It is not uncommon, in real
life, to be dealing with a distribution whose second moment does not exist (i.e., is
inï¬nite). In this case, the variance or standard deviation is useless as a measure
of the dataâs width around its central value: The values obtained from equations
(14.1.2) or (14.1.3) will not converge with increased numbers of points, nor show
any consistency from data set to data set drawn from the same distribution. This can
occur even when the width of the peak looks, by eye, perfectly ï¬nite. A more robust
estimator of the widthis the average deviationor mean absolutedeviation, deï¬ned by
ADev(x1 . . . xN) = 1

|xj âx|
(14.1.4)
One often substitutes the sample median xmed for x in equation (14.1.4). For any
ï¬xed sample, the median in fact minimizes the mean absolute deviation.
Statisticians have historically sniffed at the use of (14.1.4) instead of (14.1.2),
since the absolute value brackets in (14.1.4) are ânonanalyticâ and make theorem-
proving difï¬cult. In recent years, however, the fashion has changed, and the subject
of robust estimation (meaning, estimation for broad distributions with signiï¬cant
numbers of âoutlierâ points) has become a popular and important one.
Higher
moments, or statistics involving higher powers of the input data, are almost always
less robust than lower moments or statistics that involve only linear sums or (the
lowest moment of all) counting.

Distributions whose third and fourth moments are signiï¬cantly different from a normal
(Gaussian) distribution. (a) Skewness or third moment. (b) Kurtosis or fourth moment.
That being the case, the skewness or third moment, and the kurtosis or fourth
moment should be used with caution or, better yet, not at all.
The skewness characterizes the degree of asymmetry of a distributionaround its
mean. While the mean, standard deviation, and average deviation are dimensional
quantities, that is, have the same units as the measured quantities xj, the skewness
is conventionally deï¬ned in such a way as to make it nondimensional. It is a pure
number that characterizes only the shape of the distribution. The usual deï¬nition is
Skew(x1 . . . xN) = 1
N

xj âx
Ï
3
(14.1.5)
where Ï = Ï(x1 . . . xN) is the distributionâs standard deviation (14.1.3). A positive
value of skewness signiï¬es a distribution with an asymmetric tail extending out
towards more positive x; a negative value signiï¬es a distribution whose tail extends
out towards more negative x (see Figure 14.1.1).
Of course, any set of N measured values is likely to give a nonzero value
for (14.1.5), even if the underlying distribution is in fact symmetrical (has zero
skewness).
For (14.1.5) to be meaningful, we need to have some idea of its
standard deviation as an estimator of the skewness of the underlying distribution.
Unfortunately, that depends on the shape of the underlying distribution, and rather
critically on its tails! For the idealized case of a normal (Gaussian) distribution, the
standard deviationof (14.1.5) isapproximately
p
15/N. In real lifeit is goodpractice
to believe in skewnesses only when they are several or many times as large as this.
The kurtosis is also a nondimensional quantity.
It measures the relative
peakedness or ï¬atness of a distribution. Relative to what? A normal distribution,
what else! A distribution with positive kurtosis is termed leptokurtic; the outline
of the Matterhorn is an example. A distribution with negative kurtosis is termed
platykurtic; the outline of a loaf of bread is an example. (See Figure 14.1.1.) And,
as you no doubt expect, an in-between distribution is termed mesokurtic.

The standard deviation of (14.1.6) as an estimator of the kurtosis of an
underlying normal distribution is
p
96/N. However, the kurtosis depends on such
a high moment that there are many real-life distributions for which the standard
deviation of (14.1.6) as an estimator is effectively inï¬nite.
Calculation of the quantities deï¬ned in this section is perfectly straightforward.
Many textbooks use the binomial theorem to expand out the deï¬nitions into sums
of various powers of the data, e.g., the familiar

but this can magnify the roundoff error by a large factor and is generally unjustiï¬able
in terms of computing speed. A clever way to minimize roundoff error, especially
for large samples, is to use the corrected two-pass algorithm [1]: First calculate x,
then calculate Var(x1 . . .xN) by
Var(x1 . . .xN) =

Semi-Invariants
The mean and variance of independent random variables are additive: If x and y are
drawn independently from two, possibly different, probability distributions, then
(x + y) = x + y
Var(x + y) = Var(x) + Var(x)
(14.1.9)
Higher moments are not, in general, additive. However, certain combinations of them,
called semi-invariants, are in fact additive. If the centered moments of a distribution are
denoted Mk,
Mk â¡
D
(xi âx)kE
(14.1.10)
so that, e.g., M2 = Var(x), then the ï¬rst few semi-invariants, denoted Ik are given by
I2 = M2
I3 = M3
I4 = M4 â3M 2
2
I5 = M5 â10M2M3
I6 = M6 â15M2M4 â10M 2
3 + 30M 3
2
(14.1.11)
Notice that the skewness and kurtosis, equations (14.1.5) and (14.1.6) are simple powers
of the semi-invariants,
Skew(x) = I3/I3/2
2
Kurt(x) = I4/I2
2
(14.1.12)
A Gaussian distribution has all its semi-invariants higher than I2 equal to zero. A Poisson
distribution has all of its semi-invariants equal to its mean. For more details, see [2].
Median and Mode
The median of a probability distribution function p(x) is the value xmed for
which larger and smaller values of x are equally probable:
Z xmed
ââ
p(x) dx = 1
2 =
Z â
xmed
p(x) dx
(14.1.13)
The median of a distribution is estimated from a sample of values x1, . . .,
xN by ï¬nding that value xi which has equal numbers of values above it and below
it. Of course, this is not possible when N is even. In that case it is conventional
to estimate the median as the mean of the unique two central values. If the values
xj j = 1, . . ., N are sorted into ascending (or, for that matter, descending) order,
then the formula for the median is
xmed =
 x(N+1)/2,
N odd
1
2(xN/2 + x(N/2)+1),
N even
(14.1.14)
If a distribution has a strong central tendency, so that most of its area is under
a single peak, then the median is an estimator of the central value. It is a more
robust estimator than the mean is: The median fails as an estimator only if the area
in the tails is large, while the mean fails if the ï¬rst moment of the tails is large;
it is easy to construct examples where the ï¬rst moment of the tails is large even
though their area is negligible.
To ï¬nd the median of a set of values, one can proceed by sorting the set and
then applying (14.1.14). This is a process of order N log N. You might rightly think

modes individually. Note that, in such cases, the mean and median are not very
useful, since they will give only a âcompromiseâ value between the two peaks.

14.2 Do Two Distributions Have the Same
Means or Variances?
Not uncommonly we want to know whether two distributions have the same
mean. For example, a ï¬rst set of measured values may have been gathered before
some event, a second set after it. We want to know whether the event, a âtreatmentâ
or a âchange in a control parameter,â made a difference.
Our ï¬rst thought is to ask âhow many standard deviationsâ one sample mean is
from the other. That number may in fact be a useful thing to know. It does relate to
the strength or âimportanceâ of a difference of means if that difference is genuine.
However, by itself, it says nothing about whether the difference is genuine, that is,
statistically signiï¬cant. A difference of means can be very small compared to the
standard deviation, and yet very signiï¬cant, if the number of data points is large.
Conversely, a difference may be moderately large but not signiï¬cant, if the data
are sparse. We will be meeting these distinct concepts of strength and signiï¬cance
several times in the next few sections.
A quantity that measures the signiï¬cance of a difference of means is not the
number of standard deviations that they are apart, but the number of so-called
standard errors that they are apart. The standard error of a set of values measures
the accuracy with which the sample mean estimates the population (or âtrueâ) mean.
Typically the standard error is equal to the sampleâs standard deviation divided by
the square root of the number of points in the sample.

Studentâs t-test for Signiï¬cantly Different Means
Applying the concept of standard error, the conventional statistic for measuring
the signiï¬cance of a difference of means is termed Studentâs t.
When the two
distributions are thought to have the same variance, but possibly different means,
then Studentâs t is computed as follows: First, estimate the standard error of the
difference of the means, sD, from the âpooled varianceâ by the formula
sD =
sP
iâA(xi âxA)2 + P
iâB(xi âxB)2
NA + NB â2
 1
NA
+
1
NB

(14.2.1)
where each sum is over the points in one sample, the ï¬rst or second, each mean
likewise refers to one sample or the other, and NA and NB are the numbers of points
in the ï¬rst and second samples, respectively. Second, compute t by
t = xA âxB
sD
(14.2.2)
Third, evaluate the signiï¬cance of this value of t for Studentâs distribution with
NA + NB â2 degrees of freedom, by equations (6.4.7) and (6.4.9), and by the
routine betai (incomplete beta function) of Â§6.4.
The signiï¬cance is a number between zero and one, and is the probability that
|t| could be this large or larger just by chance, for distributions with equal means.
Therefore, a small numerical value of the signiï¬cance (0.05 or 0.01) means that the
observed difference is âvery signiï¬cant.â The function A(t|Î½) in equation (6.4.7)
is one minus the signiï¬cance.
As a routine, we have
#include <math.h>
void ttest(float data1[], unsigned long n1, float data2[], unsigned long n2,
float *t, float *prob)
Given the arrays data1[1..n1] and data2[1..n2], this routine returns Studentâs t as t,
and its signiï¬cance as prob, small values of prob indicating that the arrays have signiï¬cantly
diï¬erent means. The data arrays are assumed to be drawn from populations with the same
true variance.

void avevar(float data[], unsigned long n, float *ave, float *var);
float betai(float a, float b, float x);

Degrees of freedom.

which makes use of the following routine for computing the mean and variance
of a set of numbers,

}
The next case to consider is where the two distributions have signiï¬cantly
different variances, but we nevertheless want to know if their means are the same or
different. (A treatment for baldness has caused some patients to lose all their hair
and turned others into werewolves, but we want to know if it helps cure baldness on
the average!) Be suspicious of the unequal-variance t-test: If two distributions have
very different variances, then they may also be substantially different in shape; in
that case, the difference of the means may not be a particularly useful thing to know.
To ï¬nd out whether the two data sets have variances that are signiï¬cantly
different, you use the F-test, described later on in this section.
The relevant statistic for the unequal variance t-test is
t =
xA âxB
[Var(xA)/NA + Var(xB)/NB]1/2
(14.2.3)
This statistic is distributed approximately as Studentâs t with a number of degrees

Our ï¬nal example of a Studentâs t test is the case of paired samples. Here
we imagine that much of the variance in both samples is due to effects that are
point-by-point identical in the two samples. For example, we might have two job
candidates who have each been rated by the same ten members of a hiringcommittee.
We want to know if the means of the ten scores differ signiï¬cantly. We ï¬rst try
ttest above, and obtain a value of prob that is not especially signiï¬cant (e.g.,
> 0.05). But perhaps the signiï¬cance is being washed out by the tendency of some
committee members always to give high scores, others always to give low scores,
which increases the apparent variance and thus decreases the signiï¬cance of any
difference in the means. We thus try the paired-sample formulas,
Cov(xA, xB) â¡

(14.2.5)

1/2
(14.2.6)
t = xA âxB
sD
(14.2.7)
where N is the number in each sample (number of pairs). Notice that it is important
that a particular value of i label the corresponding points in each sample, that is,
the ones that are paired. The signiï¬cance of the t statistic in (14.2.7) is evaluated
for N â1 degrees of freedom.
The routine is
#include <math.h>
void tptest(float data1[], float data2[], unsigned long n, float *t,
float *prob)
Given the paired arrays data1[1..n] and data2[1..n], this routine returns Studentâs t for
paired data as t, and its signiï¬cance as prob, small values of prob indicating a signiï¬cant
diï¬erence of means.

F-Test for Signiï¬cantly Different Variances
The F-test tests the hypothesis that two samples have different variances by
trying to reject the null hypothesis that their variances are actually consistent. The
statistic F is the ratio of one variance to the other, so values either â«1 or âª1
will indicate very signiï¬cant differences. The distribution of F in the null case is
given in equation (6.4.11), which is evaluated using the routine betai. In the most
common case, we are willing to disprove the null hypothesis (of equal variances) by
either very large or very small values of F , so the correct signiï¬cance is two-tailed,
the sum of two incomplete beta functions. It turns out, by equation (6.4.3), that the
two tails are always equal; we need compute only one, and double it. Occasionally,
when the null hypothesis is strongly viable, the identity of the two tails can become
confused, giving an indicated probability greater than one. Changing the probability
to two minus itself correctly exchanges the tails. These considerations and equation
(6.4.3) give the routine
void ftest(float data1[], unsigned long n1, float data2[], unsigned long n2,
float *f, float *prob)
Given the arrays data1[1..n1] and data2[1..n2], this routine returns the value of f, and
its signiï¬cance as prob. Small values of prob indicate that the two arrays have signiï¬cantly
diï¬erent variances.

14.3 Are Two Distributions Different?
Given two sets of data, we can generalize the questions asked in the previous
section and ask the single question: Are the twosets drawn from the same distribution
function, or from different distribution functions? Equivalently, in proper statistical
language, âCan we disprove, to a certain required level of signiï¬cance, the null
hypothesis that two data sets are drawn from the same population distribution
function?â Disproving the null hypothesis in effect proves that the data sets are from
different distributions. Failing to disprove the null hypothesis, on the other hand,
only shows that the data sets can be consistent with a single distribution function.
One can never prove that two data sets come from a single distribution, since (e.g.)
no practical amount of data can distinguish between two distributions which differ
only by one part in 1010.
Proving that two distributions are different, or showing that they are consistent,
is a task that comes up all the time in many areas of research: Are the visible stars
distributed uniformly in the sky? (That is, is the distribution of stars as a function
of declination â position in the sky â the same as the distribution of sky area as
a function of declination?) Are educational patterns the same in Brooklyn as in the
Bronx? (That is, are the distributions of people as a function of last-grade-attended
the same?)
Do two brands of ï¬uorescent lights have the same distribution of
burn-out times? Is the incidence of chicken pox the same for ï¬rst-born, second-born,
third-born children, etc.?
These four examples illustrate the four combinations arising from two different
dichotomies: (1) The data are either continuous or binned. (2) Either we wish to
compare one data set to a known distribution, or we wish to compare two equally
unknown data sets. The data sets on ï¬uorescent lights and on stars are continuous,
since we can be given lists of individual burnout times or of stellar positions. The
data sets on chicken pox and educational level are binned, since we are given
tables of numbers of events in discrete categories: ï¬rst-born, second-born, etc.; or
6th Grade, 7th Grade, etc.
Stars and chicken pox, on the other hand, share the
property that the null hypothesis is a known distribution (distribution of area in the
sky, or incidence of chicken pox in the general population). Fluorescent lights and
educational level involve the comparison of two equally unknown data sets (the two
brands, or Brooklyn and the Bronx).
One can always turn continuous data into binned data, by grouping the events
into speciï¬ed ranges of the continuous variable(s): declinations between 0 and 10
degrees, 10 and 20, 20 and 30, etc. Binning involves a loss of information, however.
Also, there is often considerable arbitrariness as to how the bins should be chosen.
Along with many other investigators, we prefer to avoid unnecessary binningof data.
The accepted test for differences between binned distributions is the chi-square
test.
For continuous data as a function of a single variable, the most generally
accepted test is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We consider each in turn.

the number expected according to some known distribution. Note that the Niâs are

integers, while the niâs may not be. Then the chi-square statistic is
Ï2 =
X
i
(Ni âni)2
ni
(14.3.1)
where the sum is over all bins. A large value of Ï2 indicates that the null hypothesis
(that the Niâs are drawn from thepopulationrepresented by theniâs) israther unlikely.
Any term j in (14.3.1) with 0 = nj = Nj should be omitted from the sum. A
term with nj = 0, Nj Ì¸= 0 gives an inï¬nite Ï2, as it should, since in this case the
Niâs cannot possibly be drawn from the niâs!
The chi-square probability function Q(Ï2|Î½) is an incomplete gamma function,
and was already discussed in Â§6.2 (see equation 6.2.18). Strictly speaking Q(Ï2|Î½)
is the probability that the sum of the squares of Î½ random normal variables of unit
variance (and zero mean) will be greater than Ï2. The terms in the sum (14.3.1)
are not individually normal. However, if either the number of bins is large (â«1),
or the number of events in each bin is large (â«1), then the chi-square probability
function is a good approximation to the distributionof (14.3.1) in the case of the null
hypothesis. Its use to estimate the signiï¬cance of the chi-square test is standard.
The appropriate value of Î½, the number of degrees of freedom, bears some
additional discussion. If the data are collected with the model niâs ï¬xed â that
is, not later renormalized to ï¬t the total observed number of events Î£Ni â then Î½
equals the number of bins NB. (Note that this is not the total number of events!)
Much more commonly, the niâs are normalized after the fact so that their sum equals
the sum of the Niâs. In this case the correct value for Î½ is NB â1, and the model
is said to have one constraint (knstrn=1 in the program below). If the model that
gives the niâs has additional free parameters that were adjusted after the fact to agree
with the data, then each of these additional âï¬ttedâ parameters decreases Î½ (and
increases knstrn) by one additional unit.
We have, then, the following program:
void chsone(float bins[], float ebins[], int nbins, int knstrn, float *df,
float *chsq, float *prob)
Given the array bins[1..nbins] containing the observed numbers of events, and an array
ebins[1..nbins] containing the expected numbers of events, and given the number of con-
straints knstrn (normally one), this routine returns (trivially) the number of degrees of freedom
df, and (nontrivially) the chi-square chsq and the signiï¬cance prob. A small value of prob
indicates a signiï¬cant diï¬erence between the distributions bins and ebins. Note that bins
and ebins are both float arrays, although bins will normally contain integer values.

Next we consider the case of comparing two binned data sets. Let Ri be the
number of events in bin i for the ï¬rst data set, Si the number of events in the same
bin i for the second data set. Then the chi-square statistic is
Ï2 =
X
i
(Ri âSi)2
Ri + Si
(14.3.2)
Comparing (14.3.2) to (14.3.1), you should note that the denominator of (14.3.2) is
not just the average of Ri and Si (which would be an estimator of ni in 14.3.1).
Rather, it is twice the average, the sum. The reason is that each term in a chi-square
sum is supposed to approximate the square of a normally distributed quantity with
unit variance. The variance of the difference of two normal quantities is the sum
of their individual variances, not the average.
If the data were collected in such a way that the sum of the Riâs is necessarily
equal to the sum of Siâs, then the number of degrees of freedom is equal to one
less than the number of bins, NB â1 (that is, knstrn = 1), the usual case.
If
this requirement were absent, then the number of degrees of freedom would be NB.
Example: A birdwatcher wants to know whether the distribution of sighted birds
as a function of species is the same this year as last. Each bin corresponds to one
species. If the birdwatcher takes his data to be the ï¬rst 1000 birds that he saw in
each year, then the number of degrees of freedom is NB â1. If he takes his data to
be all the birds he saw on a random sample of days, the same days in each year, then
the number of degrees of freedom is NB (knstrn = 0). In this latter case, note that
he is also testing whether the birds were more numerous overall in one year or the
other: That is the extra degree of freedom. Of course, any additional constraints on
the data set lower the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., increase knstrn to more
positive values) in accordance with their number.
The program is
void chstwo(float bins1[], float bins2[], int nbins, int knstrn, float *df,
float *chsq, float *prob)
Given the arrays bins1[1..nbins] and bins2[1..nbins], containing two sets of binned
data, and given the number of constraints knstrn (normally 1 or 0), this routine returns the
number of degrees of freedom df, the chi-square chsq, and the signiï¬cance prob. A small value
of prob indicates a signiï¬cant diï¬erence between the distributions bins1 and bins2. Note that
bins1 and bins2 are both float arrays, although they will normally contain integer values.

Equation (14.3.2) and the routine chstwo both apply to the case where the total
number of data points is the same in the two binned sets. For unequal numbers of
data points, the formula analogous to (14.3.2) is
Ï2 =

where

(14.3.4)
are the respective numbers of data points.
It is straightforward to make the
corresponding change in chstwo.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (or KâS) test is applicable to unbinned distributions
that are functions of a single independent variable, that is, to data sets where each
data point can be associated with a single number (lifetime of each lightbulb when
it burns out, or declination of each star). In such cases, the list of data points can
be easily converted to an unbiased estimator SN(x) of the cumulative distribution
function of the probability distributionfrom which it was drawn: If the N events are
located at values xi, i = 1, . . ., N, then SN(x) is the function giving the fraction
of data points to the left of a given value x. This function is obviously constant
between consecutive (i.e., sorted into ascending order) xiâs, and jumps by the same
constant 1/N at each xi. (See Figure 14.3.1.)
Different distribution functions, or sets of data, give different cumulative
distribution function estimates by the above procedure. However, all cumulative
distribution functions agree at the smallest allowable value of x (where they are
zero), and at the largest allowable value of x (where they are unity). (The smallest
and largest values might of course be Â±â.) So it is the behavior between the largest
and smallest values that distinguishes distributions.
One can think of any number of statistics to measure the overall difference
between two cumulative distributionfunctions: the absolute value of the area between
them, for example. Or their integrated mean square difference. The Kolmogorov-
Smirnov D is a particularly simple measure: It is deï¬ned as the maximum value
of the absolute difference between two cumulative distribution functions. Thus,
for comparing one data setâs SN(x) to a known cumulative distribution function
P (x), the KâS statistic is
D =
max
ââ<x<â|SN(x) âP (x)|
(14.3.5)
while for comparing two different cumulative distribution functions SN1(x) and
SN2(x), the KâS statistic is
D =
max
ââ<x<â|SN1(x) âSN2(x)|

Figure 14.3.1.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic D.
A measured distribution of values in x (shown
as N dots on the lower abscissa) is to be compared with a theoretical distribution whose cumulative
probability distribution is plotted as P(x). A step-function cumulative probability distribution SN(x) is
constructed, one that rises an equal amount at each measured point. D is the greatest distance between
the two cumulative distributions.
What makes the KâS statistic useful is that its distributionin the case of the null
hypothesis (data sets drawn from the same distribution) can be calculated, at least to
useful approximation, thus giving the signiï¬cance of any observed nonzero value of
D. A central feature of the KâS test is that it is invariant under reparametrization
of x; in other words, you can locally slide or stretch the x axis in Figure 14.3.1,
and the maximum distance D remains unchanged. For example, you will get the
same signiï¬cance using x as using log x.
The function that enters into the calculation of the signiï¬cance can be written
as the following sum:
QKS(Î») = 2

(14.3.7)
which is a monotonic function with the limiting values
QKS(0) = 1
QKS(â) = 0
(14.3.8)
In terms of this function, the signiï¬cance level of an observed value of D (as
a disproof of the null hypothesis that the distributions are the same) is given
approximately [1] by the formula

where Ne is the effective number of data points, Ne = N for the case (14.3.5)
of one distribution, and
Ne =
N1N2
N1 + N2
(14.3.10)
for the case (14.3.6) of two distributions, where N1 is the number of data points in
the ï¬rst distribution, N2 the number in the second.
The nature of the approximation involved in (14.3.9) is that it becomes
asymptotically accurate as the Ne becomes large, but is already quite good for
Ne â¥4, as small a number as one might ever actually use. (See [1].)
So, we have the following routines for the cases of one and two distributions:
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void ksone(float data[], unsigned long n, float (*func)(float), float *d,
float *prob)
Given an array data[1..n], and given a user-supplied function of a single variable func which
is a cumulative distribution function ranging from 0 (for smallest values of its argument) to 1
(for largest values of its argument), this routine returns the KâS statistic d, and the signiï¬cance
level prob. Small values of prob show that the cumulative distribution function of data is
signiï¬cantly diï¬erent from func. The array data is modiï¬ed by being sorted into ascending
order.

void kstwo(float data1[], unsigned long n1, float data2[], unsigned long n2,

Given an array data1[1..n1], and an array data2[1..n2], this routine returns the Kâ
S statistic d, and the signiï¬cance level prob for the null hypothesis that the data sets are
drawn from the same distribution. Small values of prob show that the cumulative distribution
function of data1 is signiï¬cantly diï¬erent from that of data2. The arrays data1 and data2
are modiï¬ed by being sorted into ascending order.

Variants on the KâS Test
The sensitivity of the KâS test to deviations from a cumulative distribution function
P(x) is not independent of x. In fact, the KâS test tends to be most sensitive around the
median value, where P(x) = 0.5, and less sensitive at the extreme ends of the distribution,
where P(x) is near 0 or 1. The reason is that the difference |SN(x) âP(x)| does not, in the
null hypothesis, have a probability distribution that is independentof x. Rather, its variance is
proportional to P(x)[1 âP(x)], which is largest at P = 0.5. Since the KâS statistic (14.3.5)
is the maximum difference over all x of two cumulative distribution functions, a deviation that
might be statistically signiï¬cant at its own value of x gets compared to the expected chance
deviation at P = 0.5, and is thus discounted. A result is that, while the KâS test is good at
ï¬nding shifts in a probability distribution, especially changes in the median value, it is not
always so good at ï¬nding spreads, which more affect the tails of the probability distribution,
and which may leave the median unchanged.
One way of increasing the power of the KâS statistic out on the tails is to replace
D (equation 14.3.5) by a so-called stabilized or weighted statistic [2-4], for example the
Anderson-Darling statistic,
D* =
max
ââ<x<â
|SN(x) âP(x)|
p
P(x)[1 âP(x)]
(14.3.11)

Unfortunately, there is no simple formula analogous to equations (14.3.7) and (14.3.9) for this
statistic, althoughNoÂ´e [5] givesa computationalmethodusinga recursion relation andprovides
a graph of numerical results. There are many other possible similar statistics, for example
D** =
Z 1
P=0
|SN (x) âP(x)|
p
P(x)[1 âP(x)]
dP(x)
(14.3.12)
which is also discussed by Anderson and Darling (see [3]).
Another approach, which we prefer as simpler and more direct, is due to Kuiper [6,7].
We already mentioned that the standard KâS test is invariant under reparametrizations of the
variable x. An even more general symmetry, which guarantees equal sensitivities at all values
of x, is to wrap the x axis around into a circle (identifying the points at Â±â), and to look for
a statistic that is now invariant under all shifts and parametrizations on the circle. This allows,
for example, a probability distribution to be âcutâ at some central value of x, and the left and
right halves to be interchanged, without altering the statistic or its signiï¬cance.
Kuiperâs statistic, deï¬ned as
V = D+ + Dâ=
max
ââ<x<â[SN (x) âP(x)] +
max
ââ<x<â[P(x) âSN(x)]
(14.3.13)
is the sum of the maximum distance of SN(x) above and below P(x). You should be able
to convince yourself that this statistic has the desired invariance on the circle: Sketch the
indeï¬nite integral of two probability distributions deï¬ned on the circle as a function of angle
around the circle, as the angle goes through several times 360â¦. If you change the starting
point of the integration, D+ and Dâchange individually, but their sum is constant.
Furthermore, there is a simple formula for the asymptotic distribution of the statistic V ,
directly analogous to equations (14.3.7)â(14.3.10). Let
QKP(Î») = 2
â
X
j=1
(4j2Î»2 â1)eâ2j2Î»2
(14.3.14)
which is monotonic and satisï¬es
QKP(0) = 1
QKP(â) = 0
(14.3.15)
In terms of this function the signiï¬cance level is [1]
Probability (V > observed ) = QKP
hâ
Ne + 0.155 + 0.24/
â
Ne
i
D

(14.3.16)
Here Ne is N in the one-sample case, or is given by equation (14.3.10) in the case of
two samples.
Of course, Kuiperâs test is ideal for any problem originally deï¬ned on a circle, for
example, to test whether the distribution in longitude of something agrees with some theory,
or whether two somethings have different distributions in longitude. (See also [8].)
We will leave to you the coding of routines analogous to ksone, kstwo, and probks,
above. (For Î» < 0.4, donât try to do the sum 14.3.14. Its value is 1, to 7 ï¬gures, but the series
can require many terms to converge, and loses accuracy to roundoff.)
Two ï¬nal cautionary notes: First, we should mention that all varieties of KâS test lack
the ability to discriminate some kinds of distributions. A simple example is a probability
distribution with a narrow ânotchâ within which the probability falls to zero.
Such a
distribution is of course ruled out by the existence of even one data point within the notch,
but, because of its cumulative nature, a KâS test would require many data points in the notch
before signaling a discrepancy.
Second, we should note that, if you estimate any parameters from a data set (e.g., a mean
and variance), then the distribution of the KâS statistic D for a cumulative distribution function
P(x) that uses the estimated parameters is no longer given by equation (14.3.9). In general,
you will have to determine the new distribution yourself, e.g., by Monte Carlo methods.

14.4 Contingency Table Analysis of Two
Distributions
In this section, and the next two sections, we deal with measures of association
for two distributions.
The situation is this: Each data point has two or more
different quantities associated with it, and we want to know whether knowledge of
one quantity gives us any demonstrable advantage in predicting the value of another
quantity. In many cases, one variable will be an âindependentâ or âcontrolâ variable,
and another will be a âdependentâ or âmeasuredâ variable. Then, we want to know if
the latter variable is in fact dependent on or associated with the former variable. If it
is, we want to have some quantitative measure of the strength of the association. One
often hears this loosely stated as the question of whether two variables are correlated
or uncorrelated, but we will reserve those terms for a particular kind of association
(linear, or at least monotonic), as discussed in Â§14.5 and Â§14.6.
Notice that, as in previous sections, the different concepts of signiï¬cance and
strength appear: The association between two distributions may be very signiï¬cant
even if that association is weak â if the quantity of data is large enough.
It is useful to distinguish among some different kinds of variables, with
different categories forming a loose hierarchy.
â¢ A variable is called nominal if its values are the members of some
unordered set. For example, âstate of residenceâ is a nominal variable
that (in the U.S.) takes on one of 50 values; in astrophysics, âtype of
galaxyâ is a nominal variable with the three values âspiral,â âelliptical,â
and âirregular.â
â¢ A variable is termed ordinal if its values are the members of a discrete, but
ordered, set. Examples are: grade in school, planetary order from the Sun
(Mercury = 1, Venus = 2, . . .), number of offspring. There need not be
any concept of âequal metric distanceâ between the values of an ordinal
variable, only that they be intrinsically ordered.
â¢ We will call a variable continuous if its values are real numbers, as
are times, distances, temperatures, etc.
(Social scientists sometimes
distinguish between interval and ratio continuous variables, but we do not
ï¬nd that distinction very compelling.)

Example of a contingency table for two nominal variables, here sex and color. The
row and column marginals (totals) are shown. The variables are ânominal,â i.e., the order in which
their values are listed is arbitrary and does not affect the result of the contingency table analysis. If
the ordering of values has some intrinsic meaning, then the variables are âordinalâ or âcontinuous,â and
correlation techniques (Â§14.5-Â§14.6) can be utilized.
A continuous variable can always be made into an ordinal one by binning it
into ranges. If we choose to ignore the ordering of the bins, then we can turn it into
a nominal variable. Nominal variables constitute the lowest type of the hierarchy,
and therefore the most general. For example, a set of several continuous or ordinal
variables can be turned, if crudely, into a single nominal variable, by coarsely
binning each variable and then taking each distinct combination of bin assignments
as a single nominal value. When multidimensional data are sparse, this is often
the only sensible way to proceed.
The remainder of this section will deal with measures of association between
nominal variables. For any pair of nominal variables, the data can be displayed as
a contingency table, a table whose rows are labeled by the values of one nominal
variable, whose columns are labeled by the values of the other nominal variable,
and whose entries are nonnegative integers giving the number of observed events
for each combination of row and column (see Figure 14.4.1).
The analysis of
association between nominal variables is thus called contingency table analysis or
crosstabulation analysis.
We will introduce two different approaches. The ï¬rst approach, based on the
chi-square statistic, does a good job of characterizing the signiï¬cance of association,
but is only so-so as a measure of the strength (principally because its numerical
values have no very direct interpretations). The second approach, based on the
information-theoreticconcept of entropy, says nothing at all about the signiï¬cance of
association (use chi-square for that!), but is capable of very elegantly characterizing
the strength of an association already known to be signiï¬cant.

Measures of Association Based on Chi-Square
Some notation ï¬rst: Let Nij denote the number of events that occur with the
ï¬rst variable x taking on its ith value, and the second variable y taking on its jth
value. Let N denote the total number of events, the sum of all the Nijâs. Let NiÂ·
denote the number of events for which the ï¬rst variable x takes on its ith value
regardless of the value of y; NÂ·j is the number of events with the jth value of y
regardless of x.
So we have
NiÂ· =
X
j
Nij
NÂ·j =
X
i
Nij
N =
X
i
NiÂ· =
X
j
NÂ·j
(14.4.1)
NÂ·j and NiÂ· are sometimes called the row and column totals or marginals, but we
will use these terms cautiously since we can never keep straight which are the rows
and which are the columns!
The null hypothesis is that the two variables x and y have no association. In this
case, the probability of a particular value of x given a particular value of y should
be the same as the probability of that value of x regardless of y. Therefore, in the
null hypothesis, the expected number for any Nij, which we will denote nij, can be
calculated from only the row and column totals,
nij
NÂ·j
= NiÂ·
N
which implies
nij = NiÂ·NÂ·j
N
(14.4.2)
Notice that if a column or row total is zero, then the expected number for all the
entries in that column or row is also zero; in that case, the never-occurring bin of
x or y should simply be removed from the analysis.
The chi-square statistic is now given by equation (14.3.1), which, in the present
case, is summed over all entries in the table,
Ï2 =
X
i,j
(Nij ânij)2
nij
(14.4.3)
The number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of entries in the table
(product of its row size and column size) minus the number of constraints that have
arisen from our use of the data themselves to determine the nij. Each row total and
column total is a constraint, except that this overcounts by one, since the total of the
column totals and the total of the row totals both equal N, the total number of data
points. Therefore, if the table is of size I by J, the number of degrees of freedom is
IJ âI âJ + 1. Equation (14.4.3), along with the chi-square probability function
(Â§6.2), now give the signiï¬cance of an association between the variables x and y.
Suppose there is a signiï¬cant association. How do we quantify its strength, so
that (e.g.) we can compare the strength of one association with another? The idea
here is to ï¬nd some reparametrization of Ï2 which maps it into some convenient
interval, like 0 to 1, where the result is not dependent on the quantity of data that we
happen to sample, but rather depends only on the underlying population from which

the data were drawn. There are several different ways of doing this. Two of the
more common are called Cramerâs V and the contingency coefï¬cient C.
The formula for Cramerâs V is
V =
s
Ï2
N min (I â1, J â1)
(14.4.4)
where I and J are again the numbers of rows and columns, and N is the total
number of events. Cramerâs V has the pleasant property that it lies between zero
and one inclusive, equals zero when there is no association, and equals one only
when the association is perfect: All the events in any row lie in one unique column,
and vice versa. (In chess parlance, no two rooks, placed on a nonzero table entry,
can capture each other.)
In the case of I = J = 2, Cramerâs V is also referred to as the phi statistic.
The contingency coefï¬cient C is deï¬ned as
C =
s
Ï2
Ï2 + N
(14.4.5)
It also lies between zero and one, but (as is apparent from the formula) it can never
achieve the upper limit. While it can be used to compare the strength of association
of two tables with the same I and J, its upper limit depends on I and J. Therefore
it can never be used to compare tables of different sizes.
The trouble with both Cramerâs V and the contingency coefï¬cient C is that,
when they take on values in between their extremes, there is no very direct
interpretation of what that value means. For example, you are in Las Vegas, and a
friend tells you that there is a small, but signiï¬cant, association between the color of
a croupierâs eyes and the occurrence of red and black on his roulette wheel. Cramerâs
V is about 0.028, your friend tells you. You know what the usual odds against you
are (because of the green zero and double zero on the wheel). Is this association
sufï¬cient for you to make money? Donât ask us!

Measures of Association Based on Entropy
Consider the game of âtwenty questions,â where by repeated yes/no questions
you try to eliminate all except one correct possibility for an unknown object. Better
yet, consider a generalization of the game, where you are allowed to ask multiple
choice questions as well as binary (yes/no) ones. The categories in your multiple
choice questions are supposed to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive (as are
âyesâ and ânoâ).
The value to you of an answer increases with the number of possibilities that
it eliminates. More speciï¬cally, an answer that eliminates all except a fraction p of
the remaining possibilities can be assigned a value âlnp (a positive number, since
p < 1). The purpose of the logarithm is to make the value additive, since (e.g.) one
question that eliminates all but 1/6 of the possibilities is considered as good as two
questions that, in sequence, reduce the number by factors 1/2 and 1/3.
So that is the value of an answer; but what is the value of a question? If there
are I possible answers to the question (i = 1, . . ., I) and the fraction of possibilities
consistent with the ith answer is pi (with the sum of the piâs equal to one), then the
value of the question is the expectation value of the value of the answer, denoted H,
H = â

The value H lies between 0 and lnI. It is zero only when one of the piâs is one, all
the others zero: In this case, the question is valueless, since its answer is preordained.
H takes on its maximum value when all the piâs are equal, in which case the question
is sure to eliminate all but a fraction 1/I of the remaining possibilities.
The value H is conventionally termed the entropy of the distribution given by
the piâs, a terminology borrowed from statistical physics.
So far we have said nothing about the association of two variables; but suppose
we are deciding what question to ask next in the game and have to choose between
two candidates, or possibly want to ask both in one order or another. Suppose that
one question, x, has I possible answers, labeled by i, and that the other question,
y, as J possible answers, labeled by j. Then the possible outcomes of asking both
questions form a contingency table whose entries Nij, when normalized by dividing
by the total number of remaining possibilities N, give all the information about the
pâs. In particular, we can make contact with the notation (14.4.1) by identifying
pij = Nij
N
piÂ· = NiÂ·
N
(outcomes of question x alone)
pÂ·j = NÂ·j
N
(outcomes of question y alone)
(14.4.8)
The entropies of the questions x and y are, respectively,
H(x) = â
X
i
piÂ· ln piÂ·
H(y) = â
X
j
pÂ·j lnpÂ·j
(14.4.9)
The entropy of the two questions together is
H(x, y) = â
X
i,j
pij lnpij
(14.4.10)
Now what is the entropy of the question y given x (that is, if x is asked ï¬rst)?
It is the expectation value over the answers to x of the entropy of the restricted
y distribution that lies in a single column of the contingency table (corresponding
to the x answer):
H(y|x) = â
X
i
piÂ·
X
j
pij
piÂ·
ln pij
piÂ·
= â
X
i,j
pij ln pij

(14.4.11)
Correspondingly, the entropy of x given y is
H(x|y) = â
X

X
i
pij
pÂ·j
ln pij
pÂ·j
= â

We can readily prove that the entropy of y given x is never more than the
entropy of y alone, i.e., that asking x ï¬rst can only reduce the usefulness of asking

(14.4.14)
We now have everything we need to deï¬ne a measure of the âdependencyâ of y
on x, that is to say a measure of association. This measure is sometimes called the
uncertainty coefï¬cient of y. We will denote it as U(y|x),
U(y|x) â¡H(y) âH(y|x)
H(y)
(14.4.15)
This measure lies between zero and one, with the value 0 indicating that x and y
have no association, the value 1 indicating that knowledge of x completely predicts
y. For in-between values, U(y|x) gives the fraction of yâs entropy H(y) that is
lost if x is already known (i.e., that is redundant with the information in x). In our
game of âtwenty questions,â U(y|x) is the fractional loss in the utility of question
y if question x is to be asked ï¬rst.
If we wish to view x as the dependent variable, y as the independent one, then
interchanging x and y we can of course deï¬ne the dependency of x on y,
U(x|y) â¡H(x) âH(x|y)
H(x)
(14.4.16)
If we want to treat x and y symmetrically, then the useful combination turns
out to be
U(x, y) â¡2
H(y) + H(x) âH(x, y)
H(x) + H(y)

(14.4.17)
If the two variables are completely independent, then H(x, y) = H(x) + H(y), so
(14.4.17) vanishes. If the two variables are completely dependent, then H(x) =
H(y) = H(x, y), so (14.4.16) equals unity. In fact, you can use the identities (easily
proved from equations 14.4.9â14.4.12)
H(x, y) = H(x) + H(y|x) = H(y) + H(x|y)
(14.4.18)
to show that
U(x, y) = H(x)U(x|y) + H(y)U(y|x)
H(x) + H(y)
(14.4.19)
i.e., that the symmetrical measure is just a weighted average of the two asymmetrical
measures (14.4.15) and (14.4.16), weighted by the entropyof each variable separately.
Here is a program for computing all the quantities discussed, H(x), H(y),
H(x|y), H(y|x), H(x, y), U(x|y), U(y|x), and U(x, y):

14.5 Linear Correlation
We next turn to measures of association between variables that are ordinal
or continuous, rather than nominal.
Most widely used is the linear correlation
coefï¬cient.
For pairs of quantities (xi, yi), i = 1, . . ., N, the linear correlation
coefï¬cient r (also called the product-moment correlation coefï¬cient, or Pearsonâs
r) is given by the formula
r =
P
i
(xi âx)(yi ây)
rP
i
(xi âx)2rP
i
(yi ây)2
(14.5.1)
where, as usual, x is the mean of the xiâs, y is the mean of the yiâs.
The value of r lies between â1 and 1, inclusive. It takes on a value of 1, termed
âcomplete positive correlation,â when the data points lie on a perfect straight line
with positive slope, with x and y increasing together. The value 1 holds independent
of the magnitude of the slope. If the data points lie on a perfect straight line with
negative slope, y decreasing as x increases, then r has the value â1; this is called
âcomplete negative correlation.â A value of r near zero indicates that the variables
x and y are uncorrelated.
When a correlation is known to be signiï¬cant, r is one conventional way of
summarizing its strength. In fact, the value of r can be translated into a statement
about what residuals (root mean square deviations) are to be expected if the data are
ï¬tted to a straight line by the least-squares method (see Â§15.2, especially equations
15.2.13 â 15.2.14). Unfortunately, r is a rather poor statistic for deciding whether
an observed correlation is statistically signiï¬cant, and/or whether one observed
correlation is signiï¬cantly stronger than another. The reason is that r is ignorant of
the individual distributions of x and y, so there is no universal way to compute its
distribution in the case of the null hypothesis.
About the only general statement that can be made is this: If the null hypothesis
is that x and y are uncorrelated, and if the distributions for x and y each have
enough convergent moments (âtailsâ die off sufï¬ciently rapidly), and if N is large
(typically > 500), then r is distributed approximately normally, with a mean of zero
and a standard deviation of 1/

N. In that case, the (double-sided) signiï¬cance of
the correlation, that is, the probability that |r| should be larger than its observed

two distributions are signiï¬cantly correlated. (See expression 14.5.9 below for a
more accurate test.)
Most statistics books try to go beyond (14.5.2) and give additional statistical
tests that can be made using r. In almost all cases, however, these tests are valid
only for a very special class of hypotheses, namely that the distributions of x and y
jointly form a binormal or two-dimensional Gaussian distributionaround their mean
values, with joint probability density
p(x, y) dxdy = const. Ã exp

where a11, a12, and a22 are arbitrary constants. For this distribution r has the value
r = â
a12
âa11a22
(14.5.4)
There are occasions when (14.5.3) may be known to be a good model of the
data. There may be other occasions when we are willing to take (14.5.3) as at least
a rough and ready guess, since many two-dimensional distributions do resemble a
binormal distribution, at least not too far out on their tails. In either situation, we can
use (14.5.3) to go beyond (14.5.2) in any of several directions:
First, we can allow for the possibility that the number N of data points is not
large.
Here, it turns out that the statistic
t = r
r
N â2
1 âr2
(14.5.5)
is distributed in the null case (of no correlation) like Studentâs t-distribution with
Î½ = N â2 degrees of freedom, whose two-sided signiï¬cance level is given by
1 âA(t|Î½) (equation 6.4.7). As N becomes large, this signiï¬cance and (14.5.2)
become asymptotically the same, so that one never does worse by using (14.5.5),
even if the binormal assumption is not well substantiated.
Second, when N is only moderately large (â¥10), we can compare whether
the difference of two signiï¬cantly nonzero râs, e.g., from different experiments, is
itself signiï¬cant. In other words, we can quantify whether a change in some control
variable signiï¬cantly alters an existing correlation between two other variables. This
is done by using Fisherâs z-transformation to associate each measured r with a
corresponding z,

Equations (14.5.7) and (14.5.8), when they are valid, give several useful

indicating a signiï¬cant difference. (Setting z = 0 makes expression 14.5.9 a more
accurate replacement for expression 14.5.2 above.) Similarly, the signiï¬cance of a

are, respectively, the number of data points in the measurement of r1 and r2.
All of the signiï¬cances above are two-sided. If you wish to disprove the null
hypothesis in favor of a one-sided hypothesis, such as that r1 > r2 (where the sense
of the inequality was decided a priori), then (i) if your measured r1 and r2 have
the wrong sense, you have failed to demonstrate your one-sided hypothesis, but (ii)
if they have the right ordering, you can multiply the signiï¬cances given above by
0.5, which makes them more signiï¬cant.
But keep in mind: These interpretations of the r statistic can be completely
meaningless if the joint probability distribution of your variables x and y is too
different from a binormal distribution.

14.6 Nonparametric or Rank Correlation
It is precisely the uncertainty in interpreting the signiï¬cance of the linear
correlation coefï¬cient r that leads us to the important concepts of nonparametric or
rank correlation. As before, we are given N pairs of measurements (xi, yi). Before,
difï¬culties arose because we did not necessarily know the probability distribution
function from which the xiâs or yiâs were drawn.
The key concept of nonparametric correlation is this: If we replace the value
of each xi by the value of its rank among all the other xiâs in the sample, that
is, 1, 2, 3, . . ., N, then the resulting list of numbers will be drawn from a perfectly
known distribution function, namely uniformly from the integers between 1 and N,
inclusive. Better than uniformly, in fact, since if the xiâs are all distinct, then each
integer will occur precisely once. If some of the xiâs have identical values, it is
conventional to assign to all these âtiesâ the mean of the ranks that they would have
had if their values had been slightly different. This midrank will sometimes be an
integer, sometimes a half-integer. In all cases the sum of all assigned ranks will be
the same as the sum of the integers from 1 to N, namely 1
2N(N + 1).
Of course we do exactly the same procedure for the yiâs, replacing each value
by its rank among the other yiâs in the sample.
Now we are free to invent statistics for detecting correlation between uniform
sets of integers between 1 and N, keeping in mind the possibility of ties in the ranks.
There is, of course, some loss of information in replacing the original numbers by
ranks. We could construct some rather artiï¬cial examples where a correlation could
be detected parametrically (e.g., in the linear correlation coefï¬cient r), but could not

be detected nonparametrically. Such examples are very rare in real life, however,
and the slight loss of information in ranking is a small price to pay for a very major
advantage: When a correlation is demonstrated to be present nonparametrically,
then it is really there! (That is, to a certainty level that depends on the signiï¬cance
chosen.)
Nonparametric correlation is more robust than linear correlation, more
resistant to unplanned defects in the data, in the same sort of sense that the median
is more robust than the mean. For more on the concept of robustness, see Â§15.7.
As always in statistics, some particular choices of a statistic have already been
invented for us and consecrated, if not beatiï¬ed, by popular use. We will discuss
two, the Spearman rank-order correlation coefï¬cient (rs), and Kendallâs tau (Ï).
Spearman Rank-Order Correlation Coefï¬cient
Let Ri be the rank of xi among the other xâs, Si be the rank of yi among the
other yâs, ties being assigned the appropriate midrank as described above. Then the
rank-order correlation coefï¬cient is deï¬ned to be the linear correlation coefï¬cient
of the ranks, namely,
rs =
P
i(Ri âR)(Si âS)
qP
i(Ri âR)2
qP
i(Si âS)2
(14.6.1)
The signiï¬cance of a nonzero value of rs is tested by computing
t = rs
s
N â2
1 âr2s
(14.6.2)
which is distributed approximately as Studentâs distribution with N â2 degrees of
freedom. A key point is that this approximation does not depend on the original
distribution of the xâs and yâs; it is always the same approximation, and always
pretty good.
It turns out that rs is closely related to another conventional measure of
nonparametric correlation, the so-called sum squared difference of ranks, deï¬ned as
D =
N
X
i=1
(Ri âSi)2
(14.6.3)
(This D is sometimes denoted D**, where the asterisks are used to indicate that
ties are treated by midranking.)
When there are no ties in the data, then the exact relation between D and rs is
rs = 1 â
6D
N 3 âN
(14.6.4)
When there are ties, then the exact relation is slightly more complicated: Let fk be
the number of ties in the kth group of ties among the Riâs, and let gm be the number
of ties in the mth group of ties among the Siâs. Then it turns out that
rs =

holds exactly. Notice that if all the fkâs and all the gmâs are equal to one, meaning
that there are no ties, then equation (14.6.5) reduces to equation (14.6.4).
In (14.6.2) we gave a t-statistic that tests the signiï¬cance of a nonzero rs. It is
also possible to test the signiï¬cance of D directly. The expectation value of D in

complementary error function (cf. equation 14.5.2). Of course, (14.6.2) and (14.6.7)
are not independent tests, but simply variants of the same test. In the program that
follows, we calculate both the signiï¬cance level obtained by using (14.6.2) and the
signiï¬cance level obtained by using (14.6.7); their discrepancy will give you an idea
of how good the approximations are. You will also notice that we break off the task
of assigning ranks (including tied midranks) into a separate function, crank.

Kendallâs Tau
Kendallâs Ï is even more nonparametric than Spearmanâs rs or D. Instead of
using the numerical difference of ranks, it uses only the relative ordering of ranks:
higher in rank, lower in rank, or the same in rank. But in that case we donât even
have to rank the data!
Ranks will be higher, lower, or the same if and only if
the values are larger, smaller, or equal, respectively. On balance, we prefer rs as
being the more straightforward nonparametric test, but both statistics are in general
use. In fact, Ï and rs are very strongly correlated and, in most applications, are
effectively the same test.
To deï¬ne Ï, we start with the N data points (xi, yi).
Now consider all
1
2N(N â1) pairs of data points, where a data point cannot be paired with itself,
and where the points in either order count as one pair. We call a pair concordant

if the relative ordering of the ranks of the two xâs (or for that matter the two xâs
themselves) is the same as the relative ordering of the ranks of the two yâs (or for
that matter the two yâs themselves). We call a pair discordant if the relative ordering
of the ranks of the two xâs is opposite from the relative ordering of the ranks of the
two yâs. If there is a tie in either the ranks of the two xâs or the ranks of the two
yâs, then we donât call the pair either concordant or discordant. If the tie is in the
xâs, we will call the pair an âextra y pair.â If the tie is in the yâs, we will call the
pair an âextra x pair.â If the tie is in both the xâs and the yâs, we donât call the pair
anything at all.
Are you still with us?
Kendallâs Ï is now the following simple combination of these various counts:
Ï =
concordant âdiscordant
âconcordant + discordant + extra-y âconcordant + discordant + extra-x
(14.6.8)
You can easily convince yourself that this must lie between 1 and â1, and that it
takes on the extreme values only for complete rank agreement or complete rank
reversal, respectively.
More important, Kendall has worked out, from the combinatorics, the approx-
imate distribution of Ï in the null hypothesis of no association between x and y.
In this case Ï is approximately normally distributed, with zero expectation value
and a variance of
Var(Ï) =
4N + 10
9N(N â1)
(14.6.9)
The following program proceeds according to the above description, and
therefore loops over all pairs of data points. Beware: This is an O(N 2) algorithm,
unlike the algorithm for rs, whose dominant sort operations are of order N log N. If
you are routinely computing Kendallâs Ï for data sets of more than a few thousand
points, you may be in for some serious computing. If, however, you are willing to
bin your data into a moderate number of bins, then read on.

Sometimes it happens that there are only a few possible values each for x and
y. In that case, the data can be recorded as a contingency table (see Â§14.4) that gives
the number of data points for each contingency of x and y.
Spearmanâs rank-order correlation coefï¬cient is not a very natural statistic
under these circumstances, since it assigns to each x and y bin a not-very-meaningful
midrank value and then totals upvast numbers ofidentical rank differences. Kendallâs
tau, on the other hand, with its simple counting, remains quite natural. Furthermore,
its O(N 2) algorithm is no longer a problem, since we can arrange for it to loop over
pairs of contingency table entries (each containing many data points) instead of over
pairs of data points. This is implemented in the program that follows.
Note that Kendallâs tau can be applied only to contingency tables where both
variables are ordinal, i.e., well-ordered, and that it looks speciï¬cally for monotonic
correlations, not for arbitrary associations. These two properties make it less general
than the methods of Â§14.4, which applied to nominal, i.e., unordered, variables and
arbitrary associations.
Comparing kendl1 above with kendl2 below, you will see that we have
âï¬oatedâ a number of variables.
This is because the number of events in a
contingency table might be sufï¬ciently large as to cause overï¬ows in some of the
integer arithmetic, while the number of individual data points in a list could not
possibly be that large [for an O(N 2) routine!].
#include <math.h>
void kendl2(float **tab, int i, int j, float *tau, float *z, float *prob)
Given a two-dimensional table tab[1..i][1..j], such that tab[k][l] contains the number
of events falling in bin k of one variable and bin l of another, this program returns Kendallâs Ï
as tau, its number of standard deviations from zero as z, and its two-sided signiï¬cance level as
prob. Small values of prob indicate a signiï¬cant correlation (tau positive) or anticorrelation
(tau negative) between the two variables. Although tab is a float array, it will normally
contain integral values.

14.7 Do Two-Dimensional Distributions Differ?
We here discuss a useful generalization of the KâS test (Â§14.3) to two-dimensional
distributions.
This generalization is due to Fasano and Franceschini [1], a variant on an
earlier idea due to Peacock [2].
In a two-dimensional distribution, each data point is characterized by an (x, y) pair of
values. An example near to our hearts is that each of the 19 neutrinos that were detected
from Supernova 1987A is characterized by a time ti and by an energy Ei (see [3]).
We
might wish to know whether these measured pairs (ti, Ei), i = 1 . . . 19 are consistent with a
theoretical model that predicts neutrino ï¬ux as a function of both time and energy â that is,
a two-dimensional probability distribution in the (x, y) [here, (t, E)] plane. That would be a
one-sample test. Or, given two sets of neutrino detections, from two comparable detectors,
we might want to know whether they are compatible with each other, a two-sample test.
In the spirit of the tried-and-true, one-dimensional KâS test, we want to range over
the (x, y) plane in search of some kind of maximum cumulative difference between two
two-dimensional distributions.
Unfortunately, cumulative probability distribution is not
well-deï¬ned in more than one dimension! Peacockâs insight was that a good surrogate is
the integrated probability in each of four natural quadrants around a given point (xi, yi),
namely the total probabilities (or fraction of data) in (x > xi, y > yi), (x < xi, y > yi),
(x < xi, y < yi), (x > xi, y < yi). The two-dimensional KâS statistic D is now taken
to be the maximum difference (ranging both over data points and over quadrants) of the
corresponding integrated probabilities. When comparing two data sets, the value of D may
depend on which data set is ranged over. In that case, deï¬ne an effective D as the average

Figure 14.7.1. Two-dimensional distributions of 65 triangles and 35 squares. The two-dimensional KâS
test ï¬nds that point one of whose quadrants (shown by dotted lines) maximizes the difference between
fraction of triangles and fraction of squares. Then, equation (14.7.1) indicates whether the difference is
statistically signiï¬cant, i.e., whetherthe triangles and squaresmusthave differentunderlyingdistributions.
of the two values obtained. If you are confused at this point about the exact deï¬nition of D,
donât fret; the accompanying computer routines amount to a precise algorithmic deï¬nition.
Figure 14.7.1 gives a feeling for what is going on. The 65 triangles and 35 squares seem
to have somewhat different distributions in the plane. The dotted lines are centered on the
triangle that maximizes the D statistic; the maximum occurs in the upper-left quadrant. That
quadrant contains only 0.12 of all the triangles, but it contains 0.56 of all the squares. The
value of D is thus 0.44. Is this statistically signiï¬cant?
Even for ï¬xed sample sizes, it is unfortunately not rigorously true that the distribution
of D in the null hypothesis is independent of the shape of the two-dimensional distribution.
In this respect the two-dimensional KâS test is not as natural as its one-dimensional parent.
However, extensive Monte Carlo integrations have shown that the distribution of the two-
dimensional D is very nearly identical for even quite different distributions, as long as they
have the same coefï¬cient of correlation r, deï¬ned in the usual way by equation (14.5.1). In
their paper, Fasano and Franceschini tabulate Monte Carlo results for (what amounts to) the
distribution of D as a function of (of course) D, sample size N, and coefï¬cient of correlation
r. Analyzing their results, one ï¬nds that the signiï¬cance levels for the two-dimensional KâS
test can be summarized by the simple, though approximate, formulas,

for the one-sample case, and the same for the two-sample case, but with
N =
N1N2
N1 + N2 .
(14.7.2)
The above formulas are accurate enough when N >â¼20, and when the indicated
probability (signiï¬cance level) is less than (more signiï¬cant than) 0.20 or so. When the
indicated probability is > 0.20, its value may not be accurate, but the implication that the
data and model (or two data sets) are not signiï¬cantly different is certainly correct. Notice
that in the limit of r â1 (perfect correlation), equations (14.7.1) and (14.7.2) reduce to
equations (14.3.9) and (14.3.10): The two-dimensional data lie on a perfect straight line, and
the two-dimensional KâS test becomes a one-dimensional KâS test.
The signiï¬cance level for the data in Figure 14.7.1, by the way, is about 0.001. This
establishes to a near-certainty that the triangles and squares were drawn from different
distributions.
(As in fact they were.)
Of course, if you do not want to rely on the Monte Carlo experiments embodied in
equation (14.7.1), you can do your own: Generate a lot of synthetic data sets from your
model, each one with the same number of points as the real data set. Compute D for each
synthetic data set, using the accompanying computer routines (but ignoring their calculated
probabilities), and count what fraction of the time these synthetic Dâs exceed the D from the
real data. That fraction is your signiï¬cance.
One disadvantage of the two-dimensional tests, by comparison with their one-
dimensional progenitors, is that the two-dimensional tests require of order N 2 operations:
Two nested loops of order N take the place of an N log N sort. For small computers, this
restricts the usefulness of the tests to N less than several thousand.
We now give computer implementations.
The one-sample case is embodied in the
routine ks2d1s (that is, 2-dimensions, 1-sample). This routine calls a straightforward utility
routine quadct to count points in the four quadrants, and it calls a user-supplied routine
quadvl that must be capable of returning the integrated probability of an analytic model in
each of four quadrants around an arbitrary (x, y) point. A trivial sample quadvl is shown;
realistic quadvls can be quite complicated, often incorporating numerical quadratures over
analytic two-dimensional distributions.

is signiï¬cantly diï¬erent from the model. Note that the test is slightly distribution-dependent,

14.8 Savitzky-Golay Smoothing Filters
In Â§13.5 we learned something about the construction and application of digital ï¬lters,
but little guidance was given on which particular ï¬lter to use. That, of course, depends
on what you want to accomplish by ï¬ltering.
One obvious use for low-pass ï¬lters is to
smooth noisy data.
The premise of data smoothing is that one is measuring a variable that is both slowly
varying and also corrupted by random noise. Then it can sometimes be useful to replace
each data point by some kind of local average of surrounding data points. Since nearby
points measure very nearly the same underlying value, averaging can reduce the level of noise
without (much) biasing the value obtained.
We must comment editorially that the smoothing of data lies in a murky area, beyond
the fringe of some better posed, and therefore more highly recommended, techniques that
are discussed elsewhere in this book.
If you are ï¬tting data to a parametric model, for
example (see Chapter 15), it is almost always better to use raw data than to use data that
has been pre-processed by a smoothing procedure. Another alternative to blind smoothing is
so-called âoptimalâ or Wiener ï¬ltering, as discussed in Â§13.3 and more generally in Â§13.6.
Data smoothing is probably most justiï¬ed when it is used simply as a graphical technique, to
guide the eye through a forest of data points all with large error bars; or as a means of making
initial rough estimates of simple parameters from a graph.
In this section we discuss a particular type of low-pass ï¬lter, well-adapted for data
smoothing, and termed variously Savitzky-Golay [1], least-squares [2], or DISPO (Digital
Smoothing Polynomial) [3] ï¬lters. Rather than having their properties deï¬ned in the Fourier
domain, and then translated to the time domain, Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters derive directly from
a particular formulation of the data smoothing problem in the time domain, as we will now
see. Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters were initially (and are still often) used to render visible the relative
widths and heights of spectral lines in noisy spectrometric data.
Recall that a digital ï¬lter is applied to a series of equally spaced data values fi â¡f(ti),
where ti â¡t0 + iâfor some constant sample spacing âand i = . . . â2, â1, 0, 1, 2, . . . .
We have seen (Â§13.5) that the simplest type of digital ï¬lter (the nonrecursive or ï¬nite impulse
response ï¬lter) replaces each data value fi by a linear combination gi of itself and some
number of nearby neighbors,
gi =
nR
X
n=ânL
cnfi+n
(14.8.1)
Here nL is the number of points used âto the leftâ of a data point i, i.e., earlier than it, while
nR is the number used to the right, i.e., later. A so-called causal ï¬lter would have nR = 0.
As a starting point for understanding Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters, consider the simplest
possible averaging procedure: For some ï¬xed nL = nR, compute each gi as the average of
the data points from fiânL to fi+nR. This is sometimes called moving window averaging
and corresponds to equation (14.8.1) with constant cn = 1/(nL + nR + 1). If the underlying
function is constant, or is changing linearly with time (increasing or decreasing), then no
bias is introduced into the result. Higher points at one end of the averaging interval are on
the average balanced by lower points at the other end. A bias is introduced, however, if
the underlying function has a nonzero second derivative. At a local maximum, for example,
moving window averagingalwaysreducesthe function value. In the spectrometric application,
a narrow spectral line has its height reduced and its width increased. Since these parameters
are themselves of physical interest, the bias introduced is distinctly undesirable.
Note, however, that moving window averaging does preserve the area under a spectral
line, which is its zeroth moment, and also (if the window is symmetric with nL = nR) its
mean position in time, which is its ï¬rst moment. What is violated is the second moment,
equivalent to the line width.
The idea of Savitzky-Golay ï¬ltering is to ï¬nd ï¬lter coefï¬cients cn that preserve higher
moments. Equivalently, the idea is to approximate the underlying function within the moving
window not by a constant (whose estimate is the average), but by a polynomial of higher
order, typically quadratic or quartic: For each point fi, we least-squares ï¬t a polynomial to all

nL + nR + 1 points in the moving window, and then set gi to be the value of that polynomial
at position i. (If you are not familiar with least-squares ï¬tting, you might want to look ahead
to Chapter 15.) We make no use of the value of the polynomial at any other point. When we
move on to the next point fi+1, we do a whole new least-squares ï¬t using a shifted window.
All these least-squares ï¬ts would be laborious if done as described. Luckily, since the
process of least-squares ï¬tting involves only a linear matrix inversion, the coefï¬cients of a
ï¬tted polynomial are themselves linear in the values of the data. That means that we can do
all the ï¬tting in advance, for ï¬ctitious data consisting of all zeros except for a single 1, and
then do the ï¬ts on the real data just by taking linear combinations. This is the key point, then:
There are particular sets of ï¬lter coefï¬cients cn for which equation (14.8.1) âautomaticallyâ
accomplishes the process of polynomial least-squares ï¬tting inside a moving window.
To derive such coefï¬cients, consider how g0 might be obtained: We want to ï¬t a
polynomial of degree M in i, namely a0 + a1i + Â· Â· Â· + aMiM to the values fânL, . . . , fnR.
Then g0 will be the value of that polynomial at i = 0, namely a0. The design matrix for
this problem (Â§15.4) is
Aij = ij
i = ânL, . . . , nR,
j = 0, . . . , M
(14.8.2)
and the normal equationsfor the vectorof ajâs in terms of the vectoroffiâs is in matrix notation
(AT Â· A) Â· a = AT Â· f
or
a = (AT Â· A)â1 Â· (AT Â· f)
(14.8.3)
We also have the speciï¬c forms

ânL â¤n < nR, we have

Note that equation (14.8.6) says that we need only one row of the inverse matrix. (Numerically
we can get this by LU decomposition with only a single backsubstitution.)
The function savgol, below, implements equation (14.8.6).
As input, it takes the
parameters nl = nL, nr = nR, and m = M (the desired order).
Also input is np, the
physical length of the output array c, and a parameter ld which for data ï¬tting should be
zero. In fact, ld speciï¬es which coefï¬cient among the aiâs should be returned, and we are
here interested in a0. For another purpose, namely the computation of numerical derivatives
(already mentioned in Â§5.7) the useful choice is ld â¥1. With ld = 1, for example, the
ï¬ltered ï¬rst derivative is the convolution (14.8.1) divided by the stepsize â. For derivatives,
one usually wants m = 4 or larger.

As output, savgol returns the coefï¬cients cn, for ânL â¤n â¤nR. These are stored in
c in âwrap-around orderâ; that is, c0 is in c[1], câ1 is in c[2], and so on for further negative
indices. The value c1 is stored in c[np], c2 in c[np-1], and so on for positive indices. This
order may seem arcane, but it is the natural one where causal ï¬lters have nonzero coefï¬cients
in low array elements of c. It is also the order required by the function convlv in Â§13.1,
which can be used to apply the digital ï¬lter to a data set.
The accompanying table shows some typical output from savgol. For orders 2 and
4, the coefï¬cients of Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters with several choices of nL and nR are shown.
The central column is the coefï¬cient applied to the data fi in obtaining the smoothed gi.
Coefï¬cients to the left are applied to earlier data; to the right, to later.
The coefï¬cients
always add (within roundoff error) to unity. One sees that, as beï¬ts a smoothing operator,
the coefï¬cients always have a central positive lobe, but with smaller, outlying corrections
of both positive and negative sign. In practice, the Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters are most useful
for much larger values of nL and nR, since these few-point formulas can accomplish only
a relatively small amount of smoothing.
Figure 14.8.1 shows a numerical experiment using a 33 point smoothing ï¬lter, that is,

Figure 14.8.1.
Top: Synthetic noisy data consisting of a sequence of progressively narrower bumps,
and additive Gaussian white noise. Center: Result of smoothing the data by a simple moving window
average. The window extends 16 points leftward and rightward, for a total of 33 points. Note that narrow
features are broadened and suffer corresponding loss of amplitude. The dotted curve is the underlying
function used to generate the synthetic data. Bottom: Result of smoothing the data by a Savitzky-Golay
smoothing ï¬lter (of degree 4) using the same 33 points. While there is less smoothing of the broadest
feature, narrower features have their heights and widths preserved.
nL = nR = 16. The upper panel shows a test function, constructed to have six âbumpsâ of
varying widths, all of height 8 units. To this function Gaussian white noise of unit variance
has been added. (The test function without noise is shown as the dotted curves in the center
and lower panels.) The widths of the bumps (full width at half of maximum, or FWHM) are
140, 43, 24, 17, 13, and 10, respectively.
The middle panel of Figure 14.8.1 shows the result of smoothing by a moving window
average. One sees that the window of width 33 does quite a nice job of smoothing the broadest
bump, but that the narrower bumps suffer considerable loss of height and increase of width.
The underlying signal (dotted) is very badly represented.
The lower panel shows the result of smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay ï¬lter of the
identical width, and degree M = 4. One sees that the heights and widths of the bumps are
quite extraordinarily preserved. A trade-off is that the broadest bump is less smoothed. That
is becausethe central positive lobe of the Savitzky-Golay ï¬lter coefï¬cients ï¬lls only a fraction
of the full 33 point width. As a rough guideline, best results are obtained when the full width
of the degree 4 Savitzky-Golay ï¬lter is between 1 and 2 times the FWHM of desired features
in the data. (References [3] and [4] give additional practical hints.)
Figure 14.8.2 shows the result of smoothing the same noisy âdataâ with broader
Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters of 3 different orders. Here we have nL = nR = 32 (65 point ï¬lter)
and M = 2, 4, 6. One sees that, when the bumps are too narrow with respect to the ï¬lter
size, then even the Savitzky-Golay ï¬lter must at some point give out. The higher order ï¬lter
manages to track narrower features, but at the cost of less smoothing on broad features.
To summarize: Within limits, Savitzky-Golay ï¬ltering does manageto providesmoothing

Figure 14.8.2. Result of applying wider 65 point Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters to the same data set as in Figure
14.8.1. Top: degree 2. Center: degree 4. Bottom: degree 6. All of these ï¬lters are inoptimally broad
for the resolution of the narrow features. Higher-order ï¬lters do best at preserving feature heights and
widths, but do less smoothing on broader features.
without loss of resolution. It does this by assuming that relatively distant data points have
some signiï¬cant redundancy that can be used to reduce the level of noise. The speciï¬c nature
of the assumed redundancy is that the underlying function should be locally well-ï¬tted by a
polynomial. When this is true, as it is for smooth line proï¬les not too much narrower than
the ï¬lter width, then the performance of Savitzky-Golay ï¬lters can be spectacular. When it
is not true, then these ï¬lters have no compelling advantage over other classes of smoothing
ï¬lter coefï¬cients.
A last remark concerns irregularly sampled data, where the values fi are not uniformly
spaced in time. The obvious generalization of Savitzky-Golay ï¬ltering would be to do a
least-squares ï¬t within a moving window around each data point, one containing a ï¬xed
number of data points to the left (nL) and right (nR).
Because of the irregular spacing,
however, there is no way to obtain universal ï¬lter coefï¬cients applicable to more than one
data point. One must instead do the actual least-squares ï¬ts for each data point. This becomes
computationally burdensome for larger nL, nR, and M.
As a cheap alternative, one can simply pretend that the data points are equally spaced.
This amounts to virtually shifting, within each moving window, the data points to equally
spaced positions. Such a shift introduces the equivalent of an additional source of noise
into the function values. In those cases where smoothing is useful, this noise will often be
much smaller than the noise already present. Speciï¬cally, if the location of the points is
approximately random within the window, then a rough criterion is this: If the change in f
across the full width of the N = nL + nR + 1 point window is less than
p
N/2 times the
measurement noise on a single point, then the cheap method can be used.

Chapter 15.
Modeling of Data
15.0 Introduction
Given a set of observations, one often wants to condense and summarize the
data by ï¬tting it to a âmodelâ that depends on adjustable parameters. Sometimes the
model is simply a convenient class of functions, such as polynomials or Gaussians,
and the ï¬t supplies the appropriate coefï¬cients. Other times, the modelâs parameters
come from some underlying theory that the data are supposed to satisfy; examples
are coefï¬cients of rate equations in a complex network of chemical reactions, or
orbital elements of a binary star. Modeling can also be used as a kind of constrained
interpolation, where you want to extend a few data points into a continuous function,
but with some underlying idea of what that function should look like.
The basic approach in all cases is usually the same: You choose or design a
ï¬gure-of-merit function (âmerit function,â for short) that measures the agreement
between the data and the model with a particular choice of parameters. The merit
function is conventionally arranged so that small values represent close agreement.
The parameters of the model are then adjusted to achieve a minimum in the merit
function, yielding best-ï¬t parameters. The adjustment process is thus a problem in
minimization in many dimensions. This optimization was the subject of Chapter 10;
however, there exist special, more efï¬cient, methods that are speciï¬c to modeling,
and we will discuss these in this chapter.
There are important issues that go beyondthe mere ï¬ndingof best-ï¬t parameters.
Data are generally not exact. They are subject to measurement errors (called noise
in the context of signal-processing). Thus, typical data never exactly ï¬t the model
that is being used, even when that model is correct. We need the means to assess
whether or not the model is appropriate, that is, we need to test the goodness-of-ï¬t
against some useful statistical standard.
We usually also need to know the accuracy with which parameters are de-
termined by the data set.
In other words, we need to know the likely errors of
the best-ï¬t parameters.
Finally, it is not uncommon in ï¬tting data to discover that the merit function
is not unimodal, with a single minimum. In some cases, we may be interested in
global rather than local questions. Not, âhow good is this ï¬t?â but rather, âhow
sure am I that there is not a very much better ï¬t in some corner of parameter space?â
As we have seen in Chapter 10, especially Â§10.9, this kind of problem is generally
quite difï¬cult to solve.
The important message we want to deliver is that ï¬tting of parameters is not
the end-all of parameter estimation. To be genuinely useful, a ï¬tting procedure

15.1 Least Squares as a Maximum Likelihood
Estimator
Suppose that we are ï¬tting N data points (xi, yi) i = 1, . . ., N, to a model that
has M adjustable parameters aj, j = 1, . . ., M. The model predicts a functional
relationship between the measured independent and dependent variables,
y(x) = y(x; a1 . . .aM)
(15.1.1)
where the dependence on the parameters is indicated explicitlyon the right-handside.
What, exactly, do we want to minimize to get ï¬tted values for the ajâs? The
ï¬rst thing that comes to mind is the familiar least-squares ï¬t,
minimize over a1 . . .aM :

[yi ây(xi; a1 . . .aM)]2
(15.1.2)
But where does this come from? What general principles is it based on? The answer
to these questions takes us into the subject of maximum likelihood estimators.
Given a particular data set of xiâs and yiâs, we have the intuitive feeling that
some parameter sets a1 . . . aM are very unlikely â those for which the model
function y(x) looks nothing like the data â while others may be very likely â those
that closely resemble the data. How can we quantify this intuitive feeling? How can
we select ï¬tted parameters that are âmost likelyâ to be correct? It is not meaningful
to ask the question, âWhat is the probability that a particular set of ï¬tted parameters
a1 . . . aM is correct?â The reason is that there is no statistical universe of models
from which the parameters are drawn. There is just one model, the correct one, and
a statistical universe of data sets that are drawn from it!

That being the case, we can, however, turn the question around, and ask, âGiven
a particular set of parameters, what is the probability that this data set could have
occurred?â If the yiâs take on continuous values, the probability will always be
zero unless we add the phrase, â...plus or minus some ï¬xed ây on each data point.â
So letâs always take this phrase as understood. If the probability of obtaining the
data set is inï¬nitesimally small, then we can conclude that the parameters under
consideration are âunlikelyâ to be right. Conversely, our intuition tells us that the
data set should not be too improbable for the correct choice of parameters.
In other words, we identify the probability of the data given the parameters
(which is a mathematically computable number), as the likelihood of the parameters
given the data. This identiï¬cation is entirely based on intuition. It has no formal
mathematical basis in and of itself; as we already remarked, statistics is not a
branch of mathematics!
Once we make this intuitive identiï¬cation, however, it is only a small further
step to decide to ï¬t for the parameters a1 . . .aM precisely by ï¬nding those values
that maximize the likelihood deï¬ned in the above way.
This form of parameter
estimation is maximum likelihood estimation.
We are now ready to make the connection to (15.1.2). Suppose that each data
point yi has a measurement error that is independently random and distributed as a
normal (Gaussian) distribution around the âtrueâ model y(x). And suppose that the
standard deviations Ï of these normal distributions are the same for all points. Then
the probability of the data set is the product of the probabilities of each point,

N
Y
i=1
(
exp
"
â1

yi ây(xi)
Ï
2#
ây
)
(15.1.3)
Notice that there is a factor ây in each term in the product. Maximizing (15.1.3) is
equivalent to maximizing its logarithm, or minimizing the negative of its logarithm,
namely,
" N
X
i=1
[yi ây(xi)]2
2Ï2
#
âN log ây
(15.1.4)
Since N, Ï, and ây are all constants, minimizing this equation is equivalent to
minimizing (15.1.2).
What we see is that least-squares ï¬tting is a maximum likelihood estimation
of the ï¬tted parameters if the measurement errors are independent and normally
distributed with constant standard deviation. Notice that we made no assumption
about the linearity or nonlinearity of the model y(x; a1 . . .) in its parameters
a1 . . . aM. Just below, we will relax our assumption of constant standard deviations
and obtain the very similar formulas for what is called âchi-square ï¬ttingâ or
âweighted least-squares ï¬tting.â
First, however, let us discuss further our very
stringent assumption of a normal distribution.
For a hundred years or so, mathematical statisticians have been in love with
the fact that the probability distribution of the sum of a very large number of very
small random deviations almost always converges to a normal distribution. (For
precise statements of this central limit theorem, consult [1] or other standard works
on mathematical statistics.) This infatuation tended to focus interest away from the

fact that, for real data, the normal distribution is often rather poorly realized, if it is
realized at all. We are often taught, rather casually, that, on average, measurements
will fall within Â±Ï of the true value 68 percent of the time, within Â±2Ï 95 percent
of the time, and within Â±3Ï 99.7 percent of the time. Extending this, one would
expect a measurement to be off by Â±20Ï only one time out of 2 Ã 1088. We all
know that âglitchesâ are much more likely than that!
In some instances, the deviations from a normal distribution are easy to
understand and quantify.
For example, in measurements obtained by counting
events, the measurement errors are usually distributed as a Poisson distribution,
whose cumulative probability function was already discussed in Â§6.2. When the
number ofcounts goingintoone data point islarge, the Poissondistributionconverges
towards a Gaussian. However, the convergence is not uniform when measured in
fractional accuracy. The more standard deviations out on the tail of the distribution,
the larger the number of counts must be before a value close to the Gaussian is
realized. The sign of the effect is always the same: The Gaussian predicts that âtailâ
events are much less likely than they actually (by Poisson) are. This causes such
events, when they occur, to skew a least-squares ï¬t much more than they ought.
Other times, the deviations from a normal distribution are not so easy to
understand in detail. Experimental points are occasionally just way off. Perhaps
the power ï¬ickered during a pointâs measurement, or someone kicked the apparatus,
or someone wrote down a wrong number.
Points like this are called outliers.
They can easily turn a least-squares ï¬t on otherwise adequate data into nonsense.
Their probability of occurrence in the assumed Gaussian model is so small that the
maximum likelihood estimator is willing to distort the whole curve to try to bring
them, mistakenly, into line.
The subject of robust statistics deals with cases where the normal or Gaussian
model is a bad approximation, or cases where outliers are important. We will discuss
robust methods brieï¬y in Â§15.7. All the sections between this one and that one
assume, one way or the other, a Gaussian model for the measurement errors in the
data. It it quite important that you keep the limitations of that model in mind, even
as you use the very useful methods that follow from assuming it.
Finally, note that our discussion of measurement errors has been limited to
statistical errors, the kind that will average away if we only take enough data.
Measurements are also susceptible to systematic errors that will not go away with
any amount of averaging. For example, the calibration of a metal meter stick might
depend on its temperature.
If we take all our measurements at the same wrong
temperature, then no amount of averaging or numerical processing will correct for
this unrecognized systematic error.
Chi-Square Fitting
We considered the chi-square statistic once before, in Â§14.3. Here it arises
in a slightly different context.
If each data point (xi, yi) has its own, known standard deviation Ïi, then
equation (15.1.3) is modiï¬ed only by putting a subscript i on the symbol Ï. That
subscript also propagates docilely into (15.1.4), so that the maximum likelihood

called the âchi-square.â
To whatever extent the measurement errors actuallyare normallydistributed,the
quantityÏ2 is correspondinglya sum of N squares of normally distributedquantities,
each normalized to unit variance. Once we have adjusted the a1 . . .aM to minimize
the value of Ï2, the terms in the sum are not all statistically independent. For models
that are linear in the aâs, however, it turns out that the probability distribution for
different values of Ï2 at its minimum can nevertheless be derived analytically, and
is the chi-square distribution for N âM degrees of freedom. We learned how to
compute this probability function using the incomplete gamma function gammq in
Â§6.2.
In particular, equation (6.2.18) gives the probability Q that the chi-square
should exceed a particular value Ï2 by chance, where Î½ = N âM is the number of
degrees of freedom. The quantity Q, or its complement P â¡1 âQ, is frequently
tabulated in appendices to statistics books, but we generally ï¬nd it easier to use
gammq and compute our own values: Q = gammq(0.5Î½, 0.5Ï2). It is quite common,
and usually not too wrong, to assume that the chi-square distribution holds even for
models that are not strictly linear in the aâs.
This computed probability gives a quantitative measure for the goodness-of-ï¬t
of the model. If Q is a very small probability for some particular data set, then the
apparent discrepancies are unlikely to be chance ï¬uctuations. Much more probably
either (i) the model is wrong â can be statisticallyrejected, or (ii)someone has liedto
you about the size of the measurement errors Ïi â they are really larger than stated.
It is an important point that the chi-square probability Q does not directly
measure the credibility of the assumption that the measurement errors are normally
distributed. It assumes they are. In most, but not all, cases, however, the effect of
nonnormal errors is to create an abundance of outlier points. These decrease the
probability Q, so that we can add another possible, though less deï¬nitive, conclusion
to the above list: (iii) the measurement errors may not be normally distributed.
Possibility (iii) is fairly common, and also fairly benign. It is for this reason
that reasonable experimenters are often rather tolerant of low probabilities Q. It is
not uncommon to deem acceptable on equal terms any models with, say, Q > 0.001.
This is not as sloppy as it sounds: Truly wrong models will often be rejected with
vastly smaller values of Q, 10â18, say. However, if day-in and day-out you ï¬nd
yourself accepting models with Q â¼10â3, you really should track down the cause.
If you happen to know the actual distribution law of your measurement errors,
then you might wish to Monte Carlo simulate some data sets drawn from a particular
model, cf. Â§7.2âÂ§7.3. You can then subject these synthetic data sets to your actual
ï¬tting procedure, so as to determine both the probability distribution of the Ï2
statistic, and also the accuracy with which your model parameters are reproduced
by the ï¬t. We discuss this further in Â§15.6. The technique is very general, but it
can also be very expensive.
At the oppositeextreme, it sometimes happens that the probabilityQ is toolarge,
too near to 1, literally too good to be true! Nonnormal measurement errors cannot
in general produce this disease, since the normal distribution is about as âcompactâ

as a distribution can be.
Almost always, the cause of too good a chi-square ï¬t
is that the experimenter, in a âï¬tâ of conservativism, has overestimated his or her
measurement errors. Very rarely, too good a chi-square signals actual fraud, data
that has been âfudgedâ to ï¬t the model.
A rule of thumb is that a âtypicalâ value of Ï2 for a âmoderatelyâ good ï¬t is
Ï2 âÎ½. More precise is the statement that theÏ2 statistichas a mean Î½ and a standard
deviation
â
2Î½, and, asymptotically for large Î½, becomes normally distributed.
In some cases the uncertainties associated with a set of measurements are not
known in advance, and considerations related to Ï2 ï¬tting are used to derive a value
for Ï. If we assume that all measurements have the same standard deviation, Ïi = Ï,
and that the model does ï¬t well, then we can proceed by ï¬rst assigning an arbitrary
constant Ï to all points, next ï¬tting for the model parameters by minimizing Ï2,
and ï¬nally recomputing
Ï2 =

[yi ây(xi)]2/(N âM)
(15.1.6)
Obviously, this approach prohibits an independent assessment of goodness-of-ï¬t, a
fact occasionally missed by its adherents. When, however, the measurement error
is not known, this approach at least allows some kind of error bar to be assigned
to the points.

as a distribution can be.
Almost always, the cause of too good a chi-square ï¬t
is that the experimenter, in a âï¬tâ of conservativism, has overestimated his or her
measurement errors. Very rarely, too good a chi-square signals actual fraud, data
that has been âfudgedâ to ï¬t the model.
A rule of thumb is that a âtypicalâ value of Ï2 for a âmoderatelyâ good ï¬t is
Ï2 âÎ½. More precise is the statement that theÏ2 statistichas a mean Î½ and a standard
deviation
â
2Î½, and, asymptotically for large Î½, becomes normally distributed.
In some cases the uncertainties associated with a set of measurements are not
known in advance, and considerations related to Ï2 ï¬tting are used to derive a value
for Ï. If we assume that all measurements have the same standard deviation, Ïi = Ï,
and that the model does ï¬t well, then we can proceed by ï¬rst assigning an arbitrary
constant Ï to all points, next ï¬tting for the model parameters by minimizing Ï2,
and ï¬nally recomputing
Ï2 =
N
X
i=1
[yi ây(xi)]2/(N âM)
(15.1.6)
Obviously, this approach prohibits an independent assessment of goodness-of-ï¬t, a
fact occasionally missed by its adherents. When, however, the measurement error
is not known, this approach at least allows some kind of error bar to be assigned
to the points.
If we take the derivative of equation (15.1.5) with respect to the parameters ak,
we obtain equations that must hold at the chi-square minimum,

15.2 Fitting Data to a Straight Line
A concrete example will make the considerations of the previous section more
meaningful. We consider the problem of ï¬tting a set of N data points (xi, yi) to
a straight-line model
y(x) = y(x; a, b) = a + bx

This problem is often called linear regression, a terminology that originated, long
ago, in the social sciences.
We assume that the uncertainty Ïi associated with
each measurement yi is known, and that the xiâs (values of the dependent variable)
are known exactly.
To measure how well the model agrees with the data, we use the chi-square
merit function (15.1.5), which in this case is
Ï2(a, b) =
N
X
i=1
yi âa âbxi
Ïi
2
(15.2.2)
If the measurement errors are normally distributed, then this merit function will give
maximum likelihood parameter estimations of a and b; if the errors are not normally
distributed, then the estimations are not maximum likelihood, but may still be useful
in a practical sense. In Â§15.7, we will treat the case where outlier points are so
numerous as to render the Ï2 merit function useless.
Equation (15.2.2) is minimized to determine a and b.
At its minimum,
derivatives of Ï2(a, b) with respect to a, b vanish.

We are not done, however. We must estimate the probable uncertainties in
the estimates of a and b, since obviously the measurement errors in the data must
introduce some uncertainty in the determination of those parameters. If the data
are independent, then each contributes its own bit of uncertainty to the parameters.
Consideration of propagation of errors shows that the variance Ï2

any function will be

âb
âyi
= Sxi âSx
Ï2

(15.2.8)
Summing over the points as in (15.2.7), we get
Ï2
a = Sxx/â
Ï2
b = S/â
(15.2.9)
which are the variances in the estimates of a and b, respectively. We will see in
Â§15.6 that an additional number is also needed to characterize properly the probable
uncertainty of the parameter estimation. That number is the covariance of a and b,
and (as we will see below) is given by
Cov(a, b) = âSx/â
(15.2.10)
The coefï¬cient of correlation between the uncertainty in a and the uncertainty
in b, which is a number between â1 and 1, follows from (15.2.10) (compare
equation 14.5.1),
rab =
âSx
âSSxx
(15.2.11)
A positive value of rab indicates that the errors in a and b are likely to have the
same sign, while a negative value indicates the errors are anticorrelated, likely to
have opposite signs.
We are still not done. We must estimate the goodness-of-ï¬t of the data to the
model. Absent this estimate, we have not the slightest indication that the parameters
a and b in the model have any meaning at all! The probability Q that a value of
chi-square as poor as the value (15.2.2) should occur by chance is

Here gammq is our routine for the incomplete gamma function Q(a, x), Â§6.2. If
Q is larger than, say, 0.1, then the goodness-of-ï¬t is believable.
If it is larger
than, say, 0.001, then the ï¬t may be acceptable if the errors are nonnormal or have
been moderately underestimated.
If Q is less than 0.001 then the model and/or
estimation procedure can rightly be called into question. In this latter case, turn
to Â§15.7 to proceed further.
If you do not know the individual measurement errors of the points Ïi, and are
proceeding (dangerously) to use equation (15.1.6) for estimating these errors, then
here is the procedure for estimating the probable uncertainties of the parameters a
and b: Set Ïi â¡1 in all equations through (15.2.6), and multiply Ïa and Ïb, as
obtained from equation (15.2.9), by the additional factor
p
Ï2/(N â2), where Ï2
is computed by (15.2.2) using the ï¬tted parameters a and b. As discussed above,
this procedure is equivalent to assuming a good ï¬t, so you get no independent
goodness-of-ï¬t probability Q.
In Â§14.5 we promised a relation between the linear correlation coefï¬cient
r (equation 14.5.1) and a goodness-of-ï¬t measure, Ï2 (equation 15.2.2).
For
unweighted data (all Ïi = 1), that relation is
Ï2 = (1 âr2)NVar (y1 . . .yN)
(15.2.13)
where
NVar (y1 . . .yN) â¡
N
X
i=1
(yi ây)2
(15.2.14)
For data with varying weights Ïi, the above equations remain valid if the sums in
equation (14.5.1) are weighted by 1/Ï2
i .
The following function, fit, carries out exactly the operations that we have
discussed.
When the weights Ï are known in advance, the calculations exactly
correspond to the formulas above.
However, when weights Ï are unavailable,
the routine assumes equal values of Ï for each point and assumes a good ï¬t, as
discussed in Â§15.1.
The formulas (15.2.6) are susceptible to roundoff error.
Accordingly, we
rewrite them as follows: Deï¬ne

weighted sum of variances in the denominator of equation (15.3.2) can be understood both
as the variance in the direction of the smallest Ï2 between each data point and the line with
slope b, and also as the variance of the linear combination yi âa âbxi of two random

We want to minimize equation (15.3.2) with respect to a and b. Unfortunately, the
occurrence of b in the denominator of equation (15.3.2) makes the resulting equation for
the slope âÏ2/âb = 0 nonlinear. However, the corresponding condition for the intercept,
âÏ2/âa = 0, is still linear and yields

that the minimum with respect to b is also minimized with respect to a.

Standard errors for the parameters a and b. The point B can be found by varying the
slope b while simultaneously minimizing the intercept a. This gives the standard error Ïb, and also the
value s. The standard error Ïa can then be found by the geometric relation Ï2
a = s2 + r2.
Because of the ï¬nite error bars on the xiâs, the minimum Ï2 as a function of b will
be ï¬nite, though usually large, when b equals inï¬nity (line of inï¬nite slope).
The angle
Î¸ â¡arctan b is thus more suitable as a parametrization of slope than b itself. The value of Ï2
will then be periodic in Î¸ with period Ï (not 2Ï!). If any data points have very small Ïy âs
but moderate or large Ïx âs, then it is also possible to have a maximum in Ï2 near zero slope,
Î¸ â0. In that case, there can sometimes be two Ï2 minima, one at positive slope and the
other at negative. Only one of these is the correct global minimum. It is therefore important
to have a good starting guess for b (or Î¸). Our strategy, implemented below, is to scale the
yiâs so as to have variance equal to the xiâs, then to do a conventional (as in Â§15.2) linear ï¬t
with weights derived from the (scaled) sum Ï2
y i + Ï2
x i. This yields a good starting guess for
b if the data are even plausibly related to a straight-line model.
Finding the standard errors Ïa and Ïb on the parameters a and b is more complicated.
We will see in Â§15.6 that, in appropriate circumstances, the standard errors in a and b are the
respective projections onto the a and b axes of the âconï¬dence region boundaryâ where Ï2
takes on a value one greater than its minimum, âÏ2 = 1. In the linear case of Â§15.2, these
projections follow from the Taylor series expansion
âÏ2 â1

âb2 (âb)2

+ â2Ï2
âaâb âaâb
(15.3.5)
Because of the present nonlinearity in b, however, analytic formulas for the second derivatives
are quite unwieldy; more important, the lowest-order term frequently gives a poor approxima-
tion to âÏ2. Our strategy is therefore to ï¬nd the roots of âÏ2 = 1 numerically, by adjusting
the value of the slope b away from the minimum. In the program below the general root ï¬nder
zbrent is used. It may occur that there are no roots at all â for example, if all error bars are
so large that all the data points are compatible with each other. It is important, therefore, to
make some effort at bracketing a putative root before reï¬ning it (cf. Â§9.1).
Because a is minimized at each stage of varying b, successful numerical root-ï¬nding
leads to a value of âa that minimizes Ï2 for the value of âb that gives âÏ2 = 1. This (see
Figure 15.3.1) directly gives the tangent projection of the conï¬dence region onto the b axis,
and thus Ïb. It does not, however, give the tangent projection of the conï¬dence region onto
the a axis. In the ï¬gure, we have found the point labeled B; to ï¬nd Ïa we need to ï¬nd the

by an ellipse, then you can prove (see ï¬gure) that Ï2
a = r2 + s2. The value of s is known
from having found the point B. The value of r follows from equations (15.3.2) and (15.3.3)
applied at the Ï2 minimum (point O in the ï¬gure), giving

Actually, since b can go through inï¬nity, this whole procedure makes more sense in
(a, Î¸) space than in (a, b) space. That is in fact how the following program works. Since
it is conventional, however, to return standard errors for a and b, not a and Î¸, we ï¬nally
use the relation
Ïb = ÏÎ¸/ cos2 Î¸
(15.3.7)
We caution that if b and its standard error are both large, so that the conï¬denceregion actually
includes inï¬nite slope, then the standard error Ïb is not very meaningful. The function chixy
is normally called only by the routine fitexy. However, if you want, you can yourself
explore the conï¬denceregion by making repeated calls to chixy (whose argument is an angle
Î¸, not a slope b), after a single initializing call to fitexy.
A ï¬nal caution, repeated from Â§15.0, is that if the goodness-of-ï¬t is not acceptable
(returned probability is too small), the standard errors Ïa and Ïb are surely not believable. In
dire circumstances, you might try scaling all your x and y error bars by a constant factor until
the probability is acceptable (0.5, say), to get more plausible values for Ïa and Ïb.

Be aware that the literature on the seemingly straightforward subject of this section
is generally confusing and sometimes plain wrong. Demingâs [1] early treatment is sound,
but its reliance on Taylor expansions gives inaccurate error estimates. References [2-4] are
reliable, more recent, general treatments with critiques of earlier work. York [5] and Reed [6]
usefully discuss the simple case of a straight line as treated here, but the latter paper has
some errors, corrected in [7]. All this commotion has attracted the Bayesians [8-10], who
have still different points of view.

15.4 General Linear Least Squares
An immediate generalization of Â§15.2 is to ï¬t a set of data points (xi, yi) to a
model that is not just a linear combination of 1 and x (namely a + bx), but rather a
linear combination of any M speciï¬ed functions of x. For example, the functions
could be 1, x, x2, . . ., xMâ1, in which case their general linear combination,
y(x) = a1 + a2x + a3x2 + Â· Â· Â· + aMxMâ1
(15.4.1)
is a polynomial of degree M â1. Or, the functions could be sines and cosines, in
which case their general linear combination is a harmonic series.
The general form of this kind of model is
y(x) =
M
X
k=1
akXk(x)
(15.4.2)
where X1(x), . . ., XM(x) are arbitrary ï¬xed functions of x, called the basis
functions.
Note that the functions Xk(x) can be wildly nonlinear functions of x. In this
discussion âlinearâ refers only to the modelâs dependence on its parameters ak.
For these linear models we generalize the discussion of the previous section
by deï¬ning a merit function
Ï2 =
N
X
i=1
"
yi âPM
k=1 akXk(xi)
Ïi
#2
(15.4.3)
As before, Ïi is the measurement error (standard deviation) of the ith data point,
presumed to be known. If the measurement errors are not known, they may all (as
discussed at the end of Â§15.1) be set to the constant value Ï = 1.
Once again, we will pick as best parameters those that minimize Ï2. There are
several different techniques available for ï¬nding this minimum. Two are particularly
useful, and we will discuss both in this section. To introduce them and elucidate
their relationship, we need some notation.
Let A be a matrix whose N Ã M components are constructed from the M
basis functions evaluated at the N abscissas xi, and from the N measurement errors
Ïi, by the prescription
Aij = Xj(xi)
Ïi
(15.4.4)
The matrix A is called the design matrix of the ï¬tting problem. Notice that in general
A has more rows than columns, N â¥M, since there must be more data points than
model parameters to be solved for. (You can ï¬t a straight line to two points, but not a
very meaningful quintic!) The design matrixis shown schematically in Figure 15.4.1.
Also deï¬ne a vector b of length N by
bi = yi

(15.4.5)
and denote the M vector whose components are the parameters to be ï¬tted,
a1, . . ., aM, by a.

a vector of length M.
The equations (15.4.6) or (15.4.7) are called the normal equations of the least-
squares problem. They can be solved for the vector of parameters a by the standard
methods of Chapter 2, notably LU decomposition and backsubstitution, Choleksy
decomposition, or Gauss-Jordan elimination. In matrix form, the normal equations
can be written as either

The ï¬nal term in brackets is just the matrix [Î±]. Since this is the matrix inverse
of [C], (15.4.14) reduces immediately to
Ï2(aj) = Cjj
(15.4.15)
In other words, the diagonal elements of [C] are the variances (squared
uncertainties) of the ï¬tted parameters a. It should not surprise you to learn that the
off-diagonal elements Cjk are the covariances between aj and ak (cf. 15.2.10); but
we shall defer discussion of these to Â§15.6.
We will now give a routine that implements the above formulas for the general
linear least-squares problem, by the method of normal equations. Since we wish to
compute not only the solution vector a but also the covariance matrix [C], it is most
convenient to use Gauss-Jordan elimination (routine gaussj of Â§2.1) to perform the
linear algebra. The operation count, in this application, is no larger than that for LU
decomposition. If you have no need for the covariance matrix, however, you can
save a factor of 3 on the linear algebra by switching to LU decomposition, without

computation of the matrix inverse.
In theory, since AT Â· A is positive deï¬nite,
Cholesky decomposition is the most efï¬cient way to solve the normal equations.
However, in practice most of the computing time is spent in looping over the data
to form the equations, and Gauss-Jordan is quite adequate.
We need to warn you that the solution of a least-squares problem directly from
the normal equations is rather susceptible to roundoff error. An alternative, and
preferred, technique involves QR decomposition (Â§2.10, Â§11.3, and Â§11.6) of the
design matrix A. This is essentially what we did at the end of Â§15.2 for ï¬tting data to
a straight line, but without invoking all the machinery of QR to derive the necessary
formulas. Later in this section, we will discuss other difï¬culties in the least-squares
problem, for which the cure is singularvalue decomposition(SVD), of which we give
an implementation. It turns out that SVD also ï¬xes the roundoff problem, so it is our
recommended technique for all but âeasyâ least-squares problems. It is for these easy
problems that the following routine, which solves the normal equations, is intended.
The routine below introduces one bookkeeping trick that is quite useful in
practical work. Frequently it is a matter of âartâ to decide which parameters ak
in a model should be ï¬t from the data set, and which should be held constant at
ï¬xed values, for example values predicted by a theory or measured in a previous
experiment.
One wants, therefore, to have a convenient means for âfreezingâ
and âunfreezingâ the parameters ak. In the following routine the total number of
parameters ak is denoted ma (called M above). As input to the routine, you supply
an array ia[1..ma], whose components are either zero or nonzero (e.g., 1). Zeros
indicate that you want the corresponding elements of the parameter vector a[1..ma]
to be held ï¬xed at their input values. Nonzeros indicate parameters that should be
ï¬tted for. On output, any frozen parameters will have their variances, and all their
covariances, set to zero in the covariance matrix.
#include "nrutil.h"
void lfit(float x[], float y[], float sig[], int ndat, float a[], int ia[],
int ma, float **covar, float *chisq, void (*funcs)(float, float [], int))
Given a set of data points x[1..ndat], y[1..ndat] with individual standard deviations
sig[1..ndat], use Ï2 minimization to ï¬t for some or all of the coeï¬cients a[1..ma] of
a function that depends linearly on a, y = P
i ai Ã afunci(x). The input array ia[1..ma]
indicates by nonzero entries those components of a that should be ï¬tted for, and by zero entries
those components that should be held ï¬xed at their input values. The program returns values
for a[1..ma], Ï2 = chisq, and the covariance matrix covar[1..ma][1..ma]. (Parameters
held ï¬xed will return zero covariances.) The user supplies a routine funcs(x,afunc,ma) that
returns the ma basis functions evaluated at x = x in the array afunc[1..ma].

Solution by Use of Singular Value Decomposition
In some applications, the normal equations are perfectly adequate for linear
least-squares problems. However, in many cases the normal equations are very close
to singular. A zero pivot element may be encountered during the solution of the
linear equations (e.g., in gaussj), in which case you get no solution at all. Or a
very small pivot may occur, in which case you typically get ï¬tted parameters ak
with very large magnitudes that are delicately (and unstably) balanced to cancel out
almost precisely when the ï¬tted function is evaluated.
Why does this commonly occur? The reason is that, more often than experi-
menters would like to admit, data do not clearly distinguish between two or more of
the basis functions provided. If two such functions, or two different combinations
of functions, happen to ï¬t the data about equally well â or equally badly â then
the matrix [Î±], unable to distinguish between them, neatly folds up its tent and
becomes singular. There is a certain mathematical irony in the fact that least-squares
problems are both overdetermined (number of data points greater than number of
parameters) and underdetermined (ambiguous combinations of parameters exist);
but that is how it frequently is. The ambiguities can be extremely hard to notice
a priori in complicated problems.
Enter singular value decomposition (SVD). This would be a good time for you
to review the material in Â§2.6, which we will not repeat here. In the case of an
overdetermined system, SVD produces a solution that is the best approximation in
the least-squares sense, cf. equation (2.6.10). That is exactly what we want. In
the case of an underdetermined system, SVD produces a solution whose values (for
us, the akâs) are smallest in the least-squares sense, cf. equation (2.6.8). That is
also what we want: When some combination of basis functions is irrelevant to the
ï¬t, that combination will be driven down to a small, innocuous, value, rather than
pushed up to delicately canceling inï¬nities.
In terms of the design matrix A (equation 15.4.4) and the vector b (equation
15.4.5), minimization of Ï2 in (15.4.3) can be written as
ï¬nd
a
that minimizes
Ï2 = |A Â· a âb|2
(15.4.16)
Comparing to equation (2.6.9), we see that this is precisely the problem that routines
svdcmp and svbksb are designed to solve. The solution, which is given by equation
(2.6.12), can be rewritten as follows: If U and V enter the SVD decomposition
of A according to equation (2.6.1), as computed by svdcmp, then let the vectors
U(i) i = 1, . . ., M denote the columns of U (each one a vector of length N); and
let the vectors V(i); i = 1, . . ., M denote the columns of V (each one a vector
of length M). Then the solution (2.6.12) of the least-squares problem (15.4.16)
can be written as
a =
M
X
i=1
U(i) Â· b
wi

V(i)
(15.4.17)
where the wi are, as in Â§2.6, the singular values calculated by svdcmp.
Equation (15.4.17) says that the ï¬tted parameters a are linear combinations of
the columns of V, with coefï¬cients obtained by forming dot products of the columns

of U with the weighted data vector (15.4.5). Though it is beyond our scope to prove
here, it turns out that the standard (loosely, âprobableâ) errors in the ï¬tted parameters
are also linear combinations of the columns of V. In fact, equation (15.4.17) can
be written in a form displaying these errors as
a =

V(1) Â± Â· Â· Â· Â±

V(M)
(15.4.18)
Here each Â± is followed by a standard deviation.
The amazing fact is that,
decomposed in this fashion, the standard deviations are all mutually independent
(uncorrelated). Therefore they can be added together in root-mean-square fashion.
What is going on is that the vectors V(i) are the principal axes of the error ellipsoid
of the ï¬tted parameters a (see Â§15.6).
It follows that the variance in the estimate of a parameter aj is given by
Ï2(aj) =

whose result should be identical with (15.4.14).

Cov(aj, ak) =

i=1

(15.4.20)
We introduced this subsection by noting that the normal equations can fail
by encountering a zero pivot.
We have not yet, however, mentioned how SVD
overcomes this problem.
The answer is: If any singular value wi is zero, its
reciprocal in equation (15.4.18) should be set to zero, not inï¬nity. (Compare the
discussion preceding equation 2.6.7.)
This corresponds to adding to the ï¬tted
parameters a a zero multiple, rather than some random large multiple, of any linear
combination of basis functions that are degenerate in the ï¬t. It is a good thing to do!
Moreover, if a singular value wi is nonzero but very small, you should also
deï¬ne its reciprocal to be zero, since its apparent value is probably an artifact of
roundoff error, not a meaningful number. A plausible answer to the question âhow
small is small?â
is to edit in this fashion all singular values whose ratio to the
largest singular value is less than N times the machine precision Ïµ. (You might
argue for
â
N, or a constant, instead of N as the multiple; that starts getting into
hardware-dependent questions.)
There is another reason for editing even additional singular values, ones large
enough that roundoff error is not a question. Singular value decomposition allows
you to identify linear combinations of variables that just happen not to contribute
much to reducing the Ï2 of your data set. Editing these can sometimes reduce the
probable error on your coefï¬cients quite signiï¬cantly, while increasing the minimum
Ï2 only negligibly. We will learn more about identifying and treating such cases
in Â§15.6. In the following routine, the point at which this kind of editing would
occur is indicated.
Generally speaking, we recommend that youalways use SVD techniques instead
of using the normal equations. SVDâs only signiï¬cant disadvantage is that it requires

This storage
is overwritten by the matrix U. Storage is also required for the M Ã M matrix
V, but this is instead of the same-sized matrix for the coefï¬cients of the normal

SVD can be signiï¬cantly slower than solving the normal equations;
however, its great advantage, that it (theoretically) cannot fail, more than makes
up for the speed disadvantage.
In the routine that follows, the matrices u,v and the vector w are input as
working space. The logical dimensions of the problem are ndata data points by ma
basis functions (and ï¬tted parameters). If you care only about the values a of the
ï¬tted parameters, then u,v,w contain no useful information on output. If you want
probable errors for the ï¬tted parameters, read on.

singular value decomposition, and can be used to obtain the covariance matrix. The pro-

Feeding the matrix v and vector w output by the above program into the
following short routine, you easily obtain variances and covariances of the ï¬tted
parameters a.
The square roots of the variances are the standard deviations of
the ï¬tted parameters. The routine straightforwardly implements equation (15.4.20)
above, with the convention that singular values equal to zero are recognized as
having been edited out of the ï¬t.

To evaluate the covariance matrix cvm[1..ma][1..ma] of the ï¬t for ma parameters obtained

svdfit.

Examples
Be aware that some apparently nonlinear problems can be expressed so that
they are linear. For example, an exponential model with two parameters a and b,
y(x) = a exp(âbx)
(15.4.21)
can be rewritten as
log[y(x)] = c âbx
(15.4.22)
which is linear in its parameters c and b. (Of course you must be aware that such
transformations do not exactly take Gaussian errors into Gaussian errors.)
Also watch out for ânon-parameters,â as in
y(x) = a exp(âbx + d)
(15.4.23)
Here the parameters a and d are, in fact, indistinguishable. This is a good example of
where the normal equations will be exactly singular, and where SVD will ï¬nd a zero
singular value. SVD will then make a âleast-squaresâ choice for setting a balance
between a and d (or, rather, their equivalents in the linear model derived by taking the
logarithms). However â and this is true whenever SVD gives back a zero singular
value â you are better advised to ï¬gure out analytically where the degeneracy is
among your basis functions, and then make appropriate deletions in the basis set.
Here are two examples for user-supplied routines funcs. The ï¬rst one is trivial
and ï¬ts a general polynomial to a set of data:

Multidimensional Fits
If you are measuring a single variable y as a function of more than one variable
â say, a vector of variables x, then your basis functions will be functions of a vector,
X1(x), . . ., XM(x). The Ï2 merit function is now

All of the preceding discussion goes through unchanged, with x replaced by x. In
fact, if you are willing to tolerate a bit of programming hack, you can use the above
programs without any modiï¬cation: In both lfit and svdfit, the only use made
of the array elements x[i] is that each element is in turn passed to the user-supplied
routine funcs, which duly gives back the values of the basis functions at that point.
If you set x[i]=i before calling lfit or svdfit, and independently provide funcs
with the true vector values of your data points (e.g., in global variables), then funcs
can translate from the ï¬ctitious x[i]âs to the actual data points before doing its work.

15.5 Nonlinear Models
We now consider ï¬tting when the model depends nonlinearly on the set of M
unknown parameters ak, k = 1, 2, . . ., M. We use the same approach as in previous
sections, namely to deï¬ne a Ï2 merit function and determine best-ï¬t parameters
by its minimization. With nonlinear dependences, however, the minimization must
proceed iteratively. Given trial values for the parameters, we develop a procedure
that improves the trial solution. The procedure is then repeated until Ï2 stops (or
effectively stops) decreasing.
How is this problem different from the general nonlinear function minimization
problem already dealt with in Chapter 10? Superï¬cially, not at all: Sufï¬ciently
close to the minimum, we expect the Ï2 function to be well approximated by a
quadratic form, which we can write as
Ï2(a) âÎ³ âd Â· a + 1
2a Â· D Â· a
(15.5.1)
where d is an M-vector and D is an M Ã M matrix. (Compare equation 10.6.1.)
If the approximation is a good one, we know how to jump from the current trial
parameters acur to the minimizing ones amin in a single leap, namely
amin = acur + Dâ1 Â·

15.5 Nonlinear Models
We now consider ï¬tting when the model depends nonlinearly on the set of M
unknown parameters ak, k = 1, 2, . . ., M. We use the same approach as in previous
sections, namely to deï¬ne a Ï2 merit function and determine best-ï¬t parameters
by its minimization. With nonlinear dependences, however, the minimization must
proceed iteratively. Given trial values for the parameters, we develop a procedure
that improves the trial solution. The procedure is then repeated until Ï2 stops (or
effectively stops) decreasing.
How is this problem different from the general nonlinear function minimization
problem already dealt with in Chapter 10? Superï¬cially, not at all: Sufï¬ciently
close to the minimum, we expect the Ï2 function to be well approximated by a
quadratic form, which we can write as
Ï2(a) âÎ³ âd Â· a + 1
2a Â· D Â· a
(15.5.1)
where d is an M-vector and D is an M Ã M matrix. (Compare equation 10.6.1.)
If the approximation is a good one, we know how to jump from the current trial
parameters acur to the minimizing ones amin in a single leap, namely
amin = acur + Dâ1 Â·

On the other hand, (15.5.1) might be a poor local approximation to the shape

can do is take a step down the gradient, as in the steepest descent method (Â§10.6).

Here, life is much simpler. We know exactly the form of Ï2, since it is based
on a model function that we ourselves have speciï¬ed. Therefore the Hessian matrix
is known to us. Thus we are free to use (15.5.2) whenever we care to do so. The
only reason to use (15.5.3) will be failure of (15.5.2) to improve the ï¬t, signaling
failure of (15.5.1) as a good local approximation.
Calculation of the Gradient and Hessian

Note that the components Î±kl of the Hessian matrix (15.5.7) depend both on the
ï¬rst derivatives and on the second derivatives of the basis functions with respect to
their parameters. Some treatments proceed to ignore the second derivative without
comment. We will ignore it also, but only after a few comments.
Second derivativesoccur because the gradient (15.5.6) already has a dependence
on ây/âak, so the next derivative simply must contain terms involving â2y/âalâak.
The second derivative term can be dismissed when it is zero (as in the linear case
of equation 15.4.8), or small enough to be negligible when compared to the term
involving the ï¬rst derivative. It also has an additional possibility of being ignorably
small in practice: The term multiplying the second derivative in equation (15.5.7)
is [yi ây(xi; a)].
For a successful model, this term should just be the random
measurement error of each point. This error can have either sign, and should in
general be uncorrelated with the model. Therefore, the second derivative terms tend
to cancel out when summed over i.
Inclusion of the second-derivative term can in fact be destabilizing if the model
ï¬ts badly or is contaminated by outlier points that are unlikely to be offset by
compensating points of opposite sign. From this point on, we will always use as
the deï¬nition of Î±kl the formula
Î±kl =

(15.5.11)
This expression more closely resembles its linear cousin (15.4.8).
You should
understand that minor (or even major) ï¬ddling with [Î±] has no effect at all on
what ï¬nal set of parameters a is reached, but affects only the iterative route that is
taken in getting there. The condition at the Ï2 minimum, that Î²k = 0 for all k,
is independent of how [Î±] is deï¬ned.
Levenberg-Marquardt Method
Marquardt [1] has put forth an elegant method, related to an earlier suggestion
of Levenberg, for varying smoothly between the extremes of the inverse-Hessian
method (15.5.9) and the steepest descent method (15.5.10). The latter method is
used far from the minimum, switching continuously to the former as the minimum
is approached. This Levenberg-Marquardt method (also called Marquardt method)
works very well in practice and has become the standard of nonlinear least-squares
routines.
The method is based on two elementary, but important, insights. Consider the
âconstantâ in equation (15.5.10). What should it be, even in order of magnitude?
What sets its scale? There is no information about the answer in the gradient. That
tells only the slope, not how far that slope extends. Marquardtâs ï¬rst insight is that
the components of the Hessian matrix, even if they are not usable in any precise
fashion, give some information about the order-of-magnitude scale of the problem.
The quantity Ï2 is nondimensional, i.e., is a pure number; this is evident from
its deï¬nition (15.5.5). On the other hand, Î²k has the dimensions of 1/ak, which
may well be dimensional, i.e., have units like cmâ1, or kilowatt-hours, or whatever.
(In fact, each component of Î²k can have different dimensions!) The constant of
proportionality between Î²k and Î´ak must therefore have the dimensions of a2
k. Scan

the components of [Î±] and you see that there is only one obvious quantity with these
dimensions, and that is 1/Î±kk, the reciprocal of the diagonal element. So that must
set the scale of the constant. But that scale might itself be too big. So letâs divide
the constant by some (nondimensional) fudge factor Î», with the possibility of setting
Î» â«1 to cut down the step. In other words, replace equation (15.5.10) by
Î´al =
1
Î»Î±ll
Î²l
or
Î» Î±ll Î´al = Î²l
(15.5.12)
It is necessary that all be positive, but this is guaranteed by deï¬nition (15.5.11) â
another reason for adopting that equation.
Marquardtâs second insight is that equations (15.5.12) and (15.5.9) can be
combined if we deï¬ne a new matrix Î±â² by the following prescription
Î±â²
jj â¡Î±jj(1 + Î»)
Î±â²
jk â¡Î±jk
(j Ì¸= k)
(15.5.13)
and then replace both (15.5.12) and (15.5.9) by
M
X
l=1
Î±â²
kl Î´al = Î²k
(15.5.14)
When Î» is very large, the matrix Î±â² is forced into being diagonally dominant, so
equation (15.5.14) goes over to be identical to (15.5.12). On the other hand, as Î»
approaches zero, equation (15.5.14) goes over to (15.5.9).
Given an initial guess for the set of ï¬tted parameters a, the recommended
Marquardt recipe is as follows:
â¢ Compute Ï2(a).
â¢ Pick a modest value for Î», say Î» = 0.001.
â¢ (â ) Solve the linear equations (15.5.14) for Î´a and evaluate Ï2(a + Î´a).
â¢ If Ï2(a + Î´a) â¥Ï2(a), increase Î» by a factor of 10 (or any other
substantial factor) and go back to (â ).
â¢ If Ï2(a + Î´a) < Ï2(a), decrease Î» by a factor of 10, update the trial
solution a âa + Î´a, and go back to (â ).
Also necessary is a conditionfor stopping. Iterating to convergence (to machine
accuracy or to the roundoff limit) is generally wasteful and unnecessary since the
minimum is at best only a statistical estimate of the parameters a. As we will see
in Â§15.6, a change in the parameters that changes Ï2 by an amount âª1 is never
statistically meaningful.
Furthermore,
it is not uncommon
to ï¬nd the parameters
wandering
around near the minimum in a ï¬at valley of complicated topography.
The rea-
son is that Marquardtâs method generalizes the method of normal equations (Â§15.4),
hence has the same problem as that method with regard to near-degeneracy of the
minimum. Outright failure by a zero pivot is possible, but unlikely. More often,
a small pivot will generate a large correction which is then rejected, the value of
Î» being then increased. For sufï¬ciently large Î» the matrix [Î±â²] is positive deï¬nite
and can have no small pivots. Thus the method does tend to stay away from zero

pivots, but at the cost of a tendency to wander around doing steepest descent in
very un-steep degenerate valleys.
These considerations suggest that, in practice, one might as well stop iterating
on the ï¬rst or second occasion that Ï2 decreases by a negligible amount, say either
less than 0.01 absolutely or (in case roundoff prevents that being reached) some
fractional amount like 10â3. Donât stop after a step where Ï2 increases: That only
shows that Î» has not yet adjusted itself optimally.
Once the acceptable minimum has been found, one wants to set Î» = 0 and
compute the matrix
[C] â¡[Î±]â1
(15.5.15)
which, as before, is the estimated covariance matrix of the standard errors in the
ï¬tted parameters a (see next section).
The following pair of functions encodes Marquardtâs method for nonlinear
parameter estimation. Much of the organization matches that used in lfit of Â§15.4.
In particular the array ia[1..ma] must be input with components one or zero
corresponding to whether the respective parameter values a[1..ma] are to be ï¬tted
for or held ï¬xed at their input values, respectively.
The routine mrqmin performs one iteration of Marquardtâs method. It is ï¬rst
called (once) with alamda < 0, which signals the routine to initialize. alamda is set
on the ï¬rst and all subsequent calls to the suggested value of Î» for the next iteration;
a and chisq are always given back as the best parameters found so far and their Ï2.
When convergence is deemed satisfactory, set alamda to zero before a ï¬nal call.
The matrices alpha and covar (which were used as workspace in all previous calls)
will then be set to the curvature and covariance matrices for the converged parameter
values. The arguments alpha, a, and chisq must not be modiï¬ed between calls,
nor should alamda be, except to set it to zero for the ï¬nal call. When an uphill
step is taken, chisq and a are given back with their input (best) values, but alamda
is set to an increased value.
The routine mrqmin calls the routine mrqcof for the computation of the matrix
[Î±] (equation 15.5.11) and vector Î² (equations 15.5.6 and 15.5.8). In turn mrqcof
calls the user-supplied routine funcs(x,a,y,dyda), which for input values x â¡xi
and a â¡a calculates the model function y â¡y(xi; a) and the vector of derivatives
dyda â¡ây/âak.

indicates by nonzero entries those components of a that should be ï¬tted for, and by zero

More Advanced Methods for Nonlinear Least Squares
The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can be implemented as a model-trust
region method for minimization (see Â§9.7 and ref. [2]) applied to the special case
of a least squares function. A code of this kind due to MorÂ´e [3] can be found in
MINPACK [4].
Another algorithm for nonlinear least-squares keeps the second-
derivative term we dropped in the Levenberg-Marquardt method whenever it would
be better to do so. These methods are called âfull Newton-typeâ methods and are
reputed to be more robust than Levenberg-Marquardt, but more complex.
One
implementation is the code NL2SOL [5].

15.6 Conï¬dence Limits on Estimated Model
Parameters
Several times already inthischapter we have made statements about the standard
errors, or uncertainties, in a set of M estimated parameters a. We have given some
formulas for computing standard deviations or variances of individual parameters
(equations 15.2.9, 15.4.15, 15.4.19), as well as some formulas for covariances
between pairs of parameters (equation 15.2.10; remark following equation 15.4.15;
equation 15.4.20; equation 15.5.15).
In this section, we want to be more explicit regarding the precise meaning
of these quantitative uncertainties, and to give further information about how
quantitative conï¬dence limits on ï¬tted parameters can be estimated. The subject
can get somewhat technical, and even somewhat confusing, so we will try to make
precise statements, even when they must be offered without proof.
Figure 15.6.1 shows the conceptual scheme of an experiment that âmeasuresâ
a set of parameters. There is some underlying true set of parameters atrue that are
known to Mother Nature but hidden from the experimenter. These true parameters
are statistically realized, along with random measurement errors, as a measured data
set, which we will symbolize as D(0). The data set D(0) is known to the experimenter.
He or she ï¬ts the data to a model by Ï2 minimization or some other technique, and
obtains measured, i.e., ï¬tted, values for the parameters, which we here denote a(0).
Because measurement errors have a random component, D(0) is not a unique
realization of the true parameters atrue.
Rather, there are inï¬nitely many other
realizations of the true parameters as âhypothetical data setsâ each of which could
have been the one measured, but happened not to be.
Let us symbolize these
by D(1), D(2), . . ..
Each one, had it been realized, would have given a slightly
different set of ï¬tted parameters, a(1), a(2), . . ., respectively. These parameter sets
a(i) therefore occur with some probability distribution in the M-dimensional space
of all possible parameter sets a. The actual measured set a(0) is one member drawn
from this distribution.
Even more interesting than the probability distribution of a(i) would be the
distribution of the difference a(i) âatrue. This distribution differs from the former
one by a translationthat puts Mother Natureâs true value at the origin. If we knew this
distribution, we would know everything that there is to know about the quantitative
uncertainties in our experimental measurement a(0).
So the name of the game is to ï¬nd some way of estimating or approximating
the probability distributionof a(i) âatrue without knowing atrue and without having
available to us an inï¬nite universe of hypothetical data sets.
Monte Carlo Simulation of Synthetic Data Sets
Although the measured parameter set a(0) is not the true one, let us consider
a ï¬ctitious world in which it was the true one. Since we hope that our measured
parameters are not too wrong, we hope that that ï¬ctitious world is not too different
from the actual world with parameters atrue. In particular, let us hope â no, let us
assume â that the shape of the probability distribution a(i) âa(0) in the ï¬ctitious
world is the same, or very nearly the same, as the shape of the probabilitydistribution

equal; they are certainly not. We are only assuming that the way in which random
errors enter the experiment and data analysis does not vary rapidly as a function of
atrue, so that a(0) can serve as a reasonable surrogate.
Now, often, the distribution of a(i) âa(0) in the ï¬ctitious world is within our
power to calculate (see Figure 15.6.2). If we know something about the process
that generated our data, given an assumed set of parameters a(0), then we can
usually ï¬gure out how to simulate our own sets of âsyntheticâ realizations of these
parameters as âsynthetic data sets.â The procedure is to draw random numbers from
appropriate distributions (cf. Â§7.2âÂ§7.3) so as to mimic our best understanding of
the underlying process and measurement errors in our apparatus. With such random
draws, we construct data sets with exactly the same numbers of measured points,
and precisely the same values of all control (independent) variables, as our actual
data set D(0). Let us call these simulated data sets DS
(1), DS
(2), . . .. By construction
these are supposed to have exactly the same statistical relationship to a(0) as the
D(i)âs have to atrue. (For the case where you donât know enough about what you
are measuring to do a credible job of simulating it, see below.)
Next, for each DS
(j), perform exactly the same procedure for estimation of
parameters, e.g., Ï2 minimization, as was performed on the actual data to get
the parameters a(0), giving simulated measured parameters aS
(1), aS
(2), . . ..
Each
simulated measured parameter set yields a point aS

sets and enough derived simulated measured parameters, and you map out the desired
probability distribution in M dimensions.

lutionized many ï¬elds of modern experimental science.
Not only is one able to
characterize the errors of parameter estimation in a very precise way; one can also
try out on the computer different methods of parameter estimation, or different data
reduction techniques, and seek to minimize the uncertainty of the result according
to any desired criteria. Offered the choice between mastery of a ï¬ve-foot shelf of
analytical statistics books and middling ability at performing statistical Monte Carlo
simulations, we would surely choose to have the latter skill.
Quick-and-Dirty Monte Carlo: The Bootstrap Method
Here is a powerful technique that can often be used when you donât know
enough about the underlying process, or the nature of your measurement errors,
to do a credible Monte Carlo simulation. Suppose that your data set consists of
N independent and identically distributed (or iid) âdata points.â Each data point
probably consists of several numbers, e.g., one or more control variables (uniformly
distributed, say, in the range that you have decided to measure) and one or more
associated measured values (each distributed however Mother Nature chooses).
âIidâ means that the sequential order of the data points is not of consequence to
the process that you are using to get the ï¬tted parameters a. For example, a Ï2
sum like (15.5.5) does not care in what order the points are added. Even simpler
examples are the mean value of a measured quantity, or the mean of some function
of the measured quantities.
The bootstrap method [1] uses the actual data set DS
(0), with its N data points, to
generate any number of synthetic data sets DS
(1), DS
(2), . . ., also with N data points.
The procedure is simply to draw N data points at a time with replacement from the

set DS
(0). Because of the replacement, you do not simply get back your original
data set each time. You get sets in which a random fraction of the original points,
typically â¼1/e â37%, are replaced by duplicated original points. Now, exactly
as in the previous discussion, you subject these data sets to the same estimation
procedure as was performed on the actual data, giving a set of simulated measured
parameters aS
(1), aS
(2), . . .. These will be distributed around a(0) in close to the same
way that a(0) is distributed around atrue.
Sounds like getting something for nothing, doesnât it? In fact, it has taken more
than a decade for the bootstrap method to become accepted by statisticians. By now,
however, enough theorems have been proved to render the bootstrapreputable (see [2]
for references). The basic idea behind the bootstrap is that the actual data set, viewed
as a probability distribution consisting of delta functions at the measured values, is
in most cases the best â or only â available estimator of the underlying probability
distribution. It takes courage, but one can often simply use that distribution as the
basis for Monte Carlo simulations.
Watch out for cases where the bootstrapâs âiidâ assumption is violated. For
example, if you have made measurements at evenly spaced intervals of some control
variable, then youcan usuallyget away withpretendingthat these are âiid,â uniformly
distributed over the measured range. However, some estimators of a (e.g., ones
involving Fourier methods) might be particularly sensitive to all the points on a grid
being present. In that case, the bootstrap is going to give a wrong distribution. Also
watch out for estimators that look at anything like small-scale clumpiness within the
N data points, or estimators that sort the data and look at sequential differences.
Obviously the bootstrap will fail on these, too. (The theorems justifying the method
are still true, but some of their technical assumptions are violated by these examples.)
For a large class of problems, however, the bootstrap does yield easy, very
quick, Monte Carlo estimates of the errors in an estimated parameter set.
Conï¬dence Limits
Rather than present all details of the probability distribution of errors in
parameter estimation, it is common practice to summarize the distribution in the
form of conï¬dence limits. The full probability distribution is a function deï¬ned
on the M-dimensional space of parameters a. A conï¬dence region (or conï¬dence
interval) is just a region of that M-dimensional space (hopefully a small region) that
contains a certain (hopefully large) percentage of the total probability distribution.
You point to a conï¬dence region and say, e.g., âthere is a 99 percent chance that the
true parameter values fall within this region around the measured value.â
It is worth emphasizing that you, the experimenter, get to pick both the
conï¬dence level (99 percent in the above example), and the shape of the conï¬dence
region. The only requirement is that your region does include the stated percentage
of probability.
Certain percentages are, however, customary in scientiï¬c usage:
68.3 percent (the lowest conï¬dence worthy of quoting), 90 percent, 95.4 percent, 99
percent, and 99.73 percent. Higher conï¬dence levels are conventionallyâninety-nine
point nine . . . nine.â As for shape, obviously you want a region that is compact
and reasonably centered on your measurement a(0), since the whole purpose of a
conï¬dence limit is to inspire conï¬dence in that measured value. In one dimension,
the convention is to use a line segment centered on the measured value; in higher
dimensions, ellipses or ellipsoids are most frequently used.

You might suspect, correctly, that the numbers 68.3 percent, 95.4 percent,
and 99.73 percent, and the use of ellipsoids, have some connection with a normal
distribution. That is true historically, but not always relevant nowadays. In general,
the probability distribution of the parameters will not be normal, and the above
numbers, used as levels of conï¬dence, are purely matters of convention.
Figure 15.6.3 sketches a possible probability distribution for the case M = 2.
Shown are three different conï¬dence regions which might usefully be given, all at the
same conï¬dence level. The two vertical lines enclose a band (horizontal inverval)
which represents the 68 percent conï¬dence interval for the variable a1 without regard
to the value of a2. Similarly the horizontal lines enclose a 68 percent conï¬dence
interval for a2. The ellipse shows a 68 percent conï¬dence interval for a1 and a2
jointly. Notice that to enclose the same probability as the two bands, the ellipse must
necessarily extend outside of both of them (a point we will return to below).
Constant Chi-Square Boundaries as Conï¬dence Limits
When the method used to estimate the parameters a(0) is chi-square minimiza-
tion, as in the previous sections of this chapter, then there is a natural choice for the
shape of conï¬dence intervals, whose use is almost universal. For the observed data
set D(0), the value of Ï2 is a minimum at a(0). Call this minimum value Ï2

region within which Ï2 increases by no more than a set amount âÏ2 deï¬nes some
M-dimensional conï¬dence region around a(0). If âÏ2 is set to be a large number,
this will be a big region; if it is small, it will be small. Somewhere in between there
will be choices of âÏ2 that cause the region to contain, variously, 68 percent, 90
percent, etc. of probability distribution for aâs, as deï¬ned above. These regions are
taken as the conï¬dence regions for the parameters a(0).
Very frequently one is interested not in the full M-dimensional conï¬dence
region, but inindividualconï¬dence regionsfor some smaller number Î½ of parameters.
For example, one might be interested in the conï¬dence interval of each parameter
taken separately (the bands in Figure 15.6.3), in which case Î½ = 1. In that case,
the natural conï¬dence regions in the Î½-dimensional subspace of the M-dimensional
parameter space are the projections of the M-dimensional regions deï¬ned by ï¬xed
âÏ2 into the Î½-dimensional spaces of interest. In Figure 15.6.4, for the case M = 2,
we show regions corresponding to several values of âÏ2. The one-dimensional
conï¬dence interval in a2 corresponding to the region bounded by âÏ2 = 1 lies
between the lines A and Aâ².
Notice that the projection of the higher-dimensional region on the lower-
dimension space is used, not the intersection. The intersection would be the band
between Z and Zâ². It is never used. It is shown in the ï¬gure only for the purpose of
making this cautionary point, that it should not be confused with the projection.

Probability Distribution of Parameters in the Normal Case
You may be wondering why we have, in this section up to now, made no
connection at all with the error estimates that come out of the Ï2 ï¬tting procedure,
most notably the covariance matrix Cij.
The reason is this: Ï2 minimization
is a useful means for estimating parameters even if the measurement errors are
not normally distributed. While normally distributed errors are required if the Ï2
parameter estimate is to be a maximum likelihood estimator (Â§15.1), one is often
willing to give up that property in return for the relative convenience of the Ï2
procedure. Only in extreme cases, measurement error distributions with very large
âtails,â is Ï2 minimization abandoned in favor of more robust techniques, as will
be discussed in Â§15.7.
However, the formal covariance matrix that comes out of a Ï2 minimization has
a clear quantitativeinterpretationonly if (or to the extent that) the measurement errors
actually are normally distributed. In the case of nonnormal errors, you are âallowedâ
â¢ to ï¬t for parameters by minimizing Ï2
â¢ to use a contour of constant âÏ2 as the boundary of your conï¬dence region
â¢ to use Monte Carlo simulation or detailed analytic calculation in deter-
mining which contour âÏ2 is the correct one for your desired conï¬dence
level
â¢ to give the covariance matrix Cij as the âformal covariance matrix of
the ï¬t.â
You are not allowed
â¢ to use formulas that we now give for the case of normal errors, which
establish quantitative relationships among âÏ2, Cij, and the conï¬dence
level.
Here are the key theorems that hold when (i) the measurement errors are
normally distributed, and either (ii) the model is linear in its parameters or (iii) the
sample size is large enough that the uncertainties in the ï¬tted parameters a do not
extend outside a region in which the model could be replaced by a suitable linearized
model. [Note that condition (iii) does not preclude your use of a nonlinear routine
like mqrfit to ï¬nd the ï¬tted parameters.]
Theorem A.
Ï2
min is distributed as a chi-square distribution with N âM
degrees of freedom, where N is the number of data points and M is the number of
ï¬tted parameters. This is the basic theorem that lets you evaluate the goodness-of-ï¬t
of the model, as discussed above in Â§15.1. We list it ï¬rst to remind you that unless
the goodness-of-ï¬t is credible, the whole estimation of parameters is suspect.
Theorem B.
If aS
(j) is drawn from the universe of simulated data sets with
actual parameters a(0), then the probability distribution of Î´a â¡aS
(j) âa(0) is the
multivariate normal distribution
P (Î´a) da1 . . .daM = const. Ã exp

where [Î±] is the curvature matrix deï¬ned in equation (15.5.8).
Theorem C.
If aS
(j) is drawn from the universe of simulated data sets with
actual parameters a(0), then the quantity âÏ2 â¡Ï2(a(j)) âÏ2(a(0)) is distributed
as a chi-square distribution with M degrees of freedom.

evaluated using the ï¬xed (actual) data set D(0). This theorem makes the connection
between particular values of âÏ2 and the fraction of the probability distribution
that they enclose as an M-dimensional region, i.e., the conï¬dence level of the
M-dimensional conï¬dence region.
Theorem D.
Suppose that aS
(j) is drawn from the universe of simulated data
sets (as above), that its ï¬rst Î½ components a1, . . ., aÎ½ are held ï¬xed, and that its
remaining M âÎ½ components are varied so as to minimize Ï2. Call this minimum
value Ï2
Î½. Then âÏ2
Î½ â¡Ï2
Î½ âÏ2
min is distributed as a chi-square distribution with
Î½ degrees of freedom. If you consult Figure 15.6.4, you will see that this theorem
connects the projected âÏ2 region with a conï¬dence level. In the ï¬gure, a point that
is held ï¬xed in a2 and allowed to vary in a1 minimizing Ï2 will seek out the ellipse
whose top or bottom edge is tangent to the line of constant a2, and is therefore the
line that projects it onto the smaller-dimensional space.
As a ï¬rst example, let us consider the case Î½ = 1, where we want to ï¬nd
the conï¬dence interval of a single parameter, say a1. Notice that the chi-square
distributionwithÎ½ = 1 degree of freedom is the same distributionas that ofthe square
of a single normally distributed quantity. Thus âÏ2
Î½ < 1 occurs 68.3 percent of the
time (1-Ï for the normal distribution), âÏ2
Î½ < 4 occurs 95.4 percent of the time (2-Ï
for the normal distribution), âÏ2
Î½ < 9 occurs 99.73 percent of the time (3-Ï for the
normal distribution), etc. In this manner you ï¬nd the âÏ2
Î½ that corresponds to your
desired conï¬dence level. (Additional values are given in the accompanying table.)
Let Î´a be a change in the parameters whose ï¬rst component is arbitrary, Î´a1,
but the rest of whose components are chosen to minimize the âÏ2. Then Theorem
D applies. The value of âÏ2 is given in general by
âÏ2 = Î´a Â· [Î±] Â· Î´a
(15.6.1)
which follows from equation (15.5.8) applied at Ï2
min where Î²k = 0.
Since Î´a
by hypothesis minimizes Ï2 in all but its ï¬rst component, the second through Mth
components of the normal equations (15.5.9) continue to hold.
Therefore, the
solution of (15.5.9) is

where c is one arbitrary constant that we get to adjust to make (15.6.1) give the

and [Î±] are inverse matrices of one another, we get

for any linear combination of them: If

(15.6.5)
then the 68 percent conï¬dence interval on b is
Î´b = Â±
p
c Â· [C] Â· c
(15.6.6)
However, these simple, normal-sounding numerical relationships do not hold
in the case Î½ > 1 [3]. In particular, âÏ2 = 1 is not the boundary, nor does it project
onto the boundary, of a 68.3 percent conï¬dence region when Î½ > 1. If you want
to calculate not conï¬dence intervals in one parameter, but conï¬dence ellipses in
two parameters jointly, or ellipsoids in three, or higher, then you must follow the
following prescription for implementing Theorems C and D above:
â¢ Let Î½ be the number of ï¬tted parameters whose joint conï¬dence region you
wish to display, Î½ â¤M. Call these parameters the âparameters of interest.â
â¢ Let p be the conï¬dence limit desired, e.g., p = 0.68 or p = 0.95.
â¢ Find â(i.e., âÏ2) such that the probability of a chi-square variable with
Î½ degrees of freedom being less than âis p. For some useful values of p
and Î½, âis given in the table. For other values, you can use the routine
gammq and a simple root-ï¬nding routine (e.g., bisection) to ï¬nd âsuch
that gammq(Î½/2, â/2) = 1 âp.
â¢ Take the M Ã M covariance matrix [C] = [Î±]â1 of the chi-square ï¬t.
Copy the intersection of the Î½ rows and columns corresponding to the
parameters of interest into a Î½ Ã Î½ matrix denoted [Cproj].
â¢ Invert the matrix [Cproj]. (In the one-dimensional case this was just taking
the reciprocal of the element C11.)
â¢ The equation for the elliptical boundary of your desired conï¬dence region
in the Î½-dimensional subspace of interest is
â= Î´aâ² Â· [Cproj]â1 Â· Î´aâ²
(15.6.7)
where Î´aâ² is the Î½-dimensional vector of parameters of interest.

Relation of the conï¬dence region ellipse âÏ2 = 1 to quantities computed by singular

The semi-axes have lengths equal to the reciprocal of the singular values wi. If the axes are all scaled
by some constant factor Î±, âÏ2 is scaled by the factor Î±2.
If you are confused at this point, you may ï¬nd it helpful to compare Figure
15.6.4 and the accompanying table, considering the case M = 2 with Î½ = 1 and
Î½ = 2. You should be able to verify the following statements: (i) The horizontal
band between C and Câ² contains 99 percent of the probability distribution, so it
is a conï¬dence limit on a2 alone at this level of conï¬dence. (ii) Ditto the band
between B and Bâ² at the 90 percent conï¬dence level.
(iii) The dashed ellipse,
labeled by âÏ2 = 2.30, contains 68.3 percent of the probability distribution, so it is
a conï¬dence region for a1 and a2 jointly, at this level of conï¬dence.
Conï¬dence Limits from Singular Value Decomposition
When youhave obtainedyourÏ2 ï¬t bysingularvalue decomposition(Â§15.4), the
informationabout the ï¬tâs formal errors comes packaged in a somewhat different, but
generally more convenient, form. The columns of the matrix V are an orthonormal
set of M vectors that are the principal axes of the âÏ2 = constant ellipsoids.
We denote the columns as V(1) . . .V(M). The lengths of those axes are inversely
proportional to the corresponding singular values w1 . . .wM; see Figure 15.6.5. The
boundaries of the ellipsoids are thus given by
âÏ2 = w2
1(V(1) Â· Î´a)2 + Â· Â· Â· + w2
M(V(M) Â· Î´a)2
(15.6.8)
which is the justiï¬cation for writing equation (15.4.18) above. Keep in mind that
it is much easier to plot an ellipsoid given a list of its vector principal axes, than
given its matrix quadratic form!

15.7 Robust Estimation
The concept of robustness has been mentioned in passing several times already.
In Â§14.1 we noted that the median was a more robust estimator of central value than
the mean; in Â§14.6 it was mentioned that rank correlation is more robust than linear
correlation. The concept of outlier points as exceptions to a Gaussian model for
experimental error was discussed in Â§15.1.
The term ârobustâ was coined in statistics by G.E.P. Box in 1953. Various
deï¬nitions of greater or lesser mathematical rigor are possible for the term, but in
general, referring to a statistical estimator, it means âinsensitive to small departures
from the idealized assumptions for which the estimator is optimized.â [1,2] The word
âsmallâ can have two different interpretations, both important: either fractionally
small departures for all data points, or else fractionally large departures for a small
number of data points. It is the latter interpretation, leading to the notion of outlier
points, that is generally the most stressful for statistical procedures.
Statisticians have developed various sorts of robust statistical estimators. Many,
if not most, can be grouped in one of three categories.
M-estimates follow from maximum-likelihood arguments very much as equa-
tions (15.1.5) and (15.1.7) followed from equation (15.1.3). M-estimates are usually
the most relevant class for model-ï¬tting, that is, estimation of parameters.
We
therefore consider these estimates in some detail below.
L-estimates are âlinear combinations of order statistics.â
These are most
applicable to estimations of central value and central tendency, though they can
occasionally be applied to some problems in estimation of parameters.
Two
âtypicalâ L-estimates will give you the general idea. They are (i) the median, and
(ii) Tukeyâs trimean, deï¬ned as the weighted average of the ï¬rst, second, and third
quartile points in a distribution, with weights 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4, respectively.
R-estimates are estimates based on rank tests. For example, the equality or
inequality of two distributions can be estimated by the Wilcoxon test of computing
the mean rank of one distribution in a combined sample of both distributions.

Ï(yi, y {xi; a})

Very often, it is the case that the function Ï depends not independently on its
two arguments, measured yi and predicted y(xi), but only on their difference, at least
if scaled by some weight factors Ïi which we are able to assign to each point. In this
case the M-estimate is said to be local, and we can replace (15.7.2) by the prescription

that the specialization for normally distributed errors is

mean square deviation. Here the tails of the distribution, although exponentially
decreasing, are asymptotically much larger than any corresponding Gaussian.
A distribution with even more extensive â therefore sometimes even more
realistic â tails is the Cauchy or Lorentzian distribution,

(15.7.10)
Notice that the Ï function occurs as a weighting function in the generalized
normal equations (15.7.5). For normally distributed errors, equation (15.7.6) says
that the more deviant the points, the greater the weight. By contrast, when tails are
somewhat more prominent, as in (15.7.7), then (15.7.8) says that all deviant points
get the same relative weight, with only the sign information used. Finally, when
the tails are even larger, (15.7.10) says the Ï increases with deviation, then starts
decreasing, so that very deviant points â the true outliers â are not counted at all
in the estimation of the parameters.
This general idea, that the weight given individual points should ï¬rst increase
with deviation, then decrease, motivates some additional prescriptions for Ï which
do not especially correspond to standard, textbook probability distributions. Two
examples are
Andrewâs sine
Ï(z) =

sin(z/c)
0
|z| < cÏ
|z| > cÏ
(15.7.11)
If the measurement errors happen to be normal after all, with standard deviations Ïi,
then it can be shown that the optimal value for the constant c is c = 2.1.
Tukeyâs biweight
Ï(z) =
 z(1 âz2/c2)2
0
|z| < c
|z| > c
(15.7.12)
where the optimal value of c for normal errors is c = 6.0.
Numerical Calculation of M-Estimates
To ï¬t a model by means of an M-estimate, you ï¬rst decide which M-estimate
you want, that is, which matching pair Ï, Ï you want to use.
We rather like
(15.7.8) or (15.7.10).
You then have to make an unpleasant choice between two fairly difï¬cult
problems. Either ï¬nd the solution of the nonlinear set of M equations (15.7.5), or
else minimize the single function in M variables (15.7.3).
Notice that the function (15.7.8) has a discontinuous Ï, and a discontinuous
derivative for Ï.
Such discontinuities frequently wreak havoc on both general
nonlinear equation solvers and general function minimizing routines. You might
now think of rejecting (15.7.8) in favor of (15.7.10), which is smoother. However,
you will ï¬nd that the latter choice is also bad news for many general equation solving
or minimization routines: small changes in the ï¬tted parameters can drive Ï(z)
off its peak into one or the other of its asymptotically small regimes. Therefore,
different terms in the equation spring into or out of action (almost as bad as analytic
discontinuities).
Donât despair. If your computer budget (or, for personal computers, patience)
is up to it, this is an excellent application for the downhill simplex minimization

algorithm exempliï¬ed in amoeba Â§10.4 or amebsa in Â§10.9. Those algorithms make
no assumptions about continuity; they just ooze downhill and will work for virtually
any sane choice of the function Ï.
It is very much to your (ï¬nancial) advantage to ï¬nd good starting values,
however. Often this is done by ï¬rst ï¬tting the model by the standard Ï2 (nonrobust)
techniques, e.g., as described in Â§15.4 or Â§15.5. The ï¬tted parameters thus obtained
are then used as starting values in amoeba, now using the robust choice of Ï and
minimizing the expression (15.7.3).
Fitting a Line by Minimizing Absolute Deviation
Occasionally there is a special case that happens to be much easier than is
suggested by the general strategy outlined above. The case of equations (15.7.7)â
(15.7.8), when the model is a simple straight line
y(x; a, b) = a + bx
(15.7.13)
and where the weights Ïi are all equal, happens to be such a case. The problem is
precisely the robust version of the problem posed in equation (15.2.1) above, namely
ï¬t a straight line through a set of data points. The merit function to be minimized is
N
X
i=1
|yi âa âbxi|
(15.7.14)
rather than the Ï2 given by equation (15.2.2).
The key simpliï¬cation is based on the following fact: The median cM of a set
of numbers ci is also that value which minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations
X
i
|ci âcM|
(Proof: Differentiate the above expression with respect to cM and set it to zero.)
It follows that, for ï¬xed b, the value of a that minimizes (15.7.14) is
a = median {yi âbxi}
(15.7.15)
Equation (15.7.5) for the parameter b is
0 =
N
X
i=1
xi sgn(yi âa âbxi)
(15.7.16)
(where sgn(0) is to be interpreted as zero). If we replace a in this equation by the
implied function a(b) of (15.7.15), then we are left with an equation in a single
variable which can be solved by bracketing and bisection, as described in Â§9.1.
(In fact, it is dangerous to use any fancier method of root-ï¬nding, because of the
discontinuities in equation 15.7.16.)
Here is a routine that does all this. It calls select (Â§8.5) to ï¬nd the median.
The bracketing and bisection are built in to the routine, as is the Ï2 solution that
generates the initial guesses for a and b. Notice that the evaluation of the right-hand
side of (15.7.16) occurs in the function rofunc, with communication via global
(top-level) variables.

Other Robust Techniques
Sometimes you may have a priori knowledge about the probable values and
probable uncertainties of some parameters that you are trying to estimate from a data
set. In such cases you may want to perform a ï¬t that takes this advance information
properly into account, neither completely freezing a parameter at a predetermined
value (as in lfit Â§15.4) nor completely leaving it to be determined by the data set.
The formalism for doing this is called âuse of a priori covariances.â
A related problem occurs in signal processing and control theory, where it is
sometimes desired to âtrackâ (i.e., maintain an estimate of) a time-varying signal in
the presence of noise. If the signal is known to be characterized by some number
of parameters that vary only slowly, then the formalism of Kalman ï¬ltering tells
how the incoming, raw measurements of the signal should be processed to produce
best parameter estimates as a function of time.
For example, if the signal is a
frequency-modulated sine wave, then the slowly varying parameter might be the
instantaneous frequency. The Kalman ï¬lter for this case is called a phase-locked
loop and is implemented in the circuitry of good radio receivers [3,4].

Chapter 16.
Integration of Ordinary
Differential Equations
16.0 Introduction
Problems involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can always be
reduced to the study of sets of ï¬rst-order differential equations. For example the
second-order equation
d2y
dx2 + q(x)dy
dx = r(x)
(16.0.1)
can be rewritten as two ï¬rst-order equations
dy
dx = z(x)
dz
dx = r(x) âq(x)z(x)
(16.0.2)
where z is a new variable. This exempliï¬es the procedure for an arbitrary ODE. The
usual choice for the new variables is to let them be just derivatives of each other (and
of the original variable). Occasionally, it is useful to incorporate into their deï¬nition
some other factors in the equation, or some powers of the independent variable,
for the purpose of mitigating singular behavior that could result in overï¬ows or
increased roundoff error. Let common sense be your guide: If you ï¬nd that the
original variables are smooth in a solution, while your auxiliary variables are doing
crazy things, then ï¬gure out why and choose different auxiliary variables.
The generic problem in ordinary differential equations is thus reduced to the
study of a set of N coupled ï¬rst-order differential equations for the functions
yi, i = 1, 2, . . ., N, having the general form
dyi(x)
dx
= fi(x, y1, . . ., yN),
i = 1, . . ., N
(16.0.3)
where the functions fi on the right-hand side are known.
A problem involving ODEs is not completely speciï¬ed by its equations. Even
more crucial in determining how to attack the problem numerically is the nature of
the problemâs boundary conditions. Boundary conditions are algebraic conditions

on the values of the functions yi in (16.0.3). In general they can be satisï¬ed at
discrete speciï¬ed points, but do not hold between those points, i.e., are not preserved
automatically by the differential equations. Boundary conditions can be as simple as
requiring that certain variables have certain numerical values, or as complicated as
a set of nonlinear algebraic equations among the variables.
Usually, it is the nature of the boundary conditions that determines which
numerical methods will be feasible.
Boundary conditions divide into two broad
categories.
â¢ In initial value problems all the yi are given at some starting value xs, and
it is desired to ï¬nd the yiâs at some ï¬nal point xf, or at some discrete list
of points (for example, at tabulated intervals).
â¢ In two-point boundary value problems, on the other hand, boundary
conditions are speciï¬ed at more than one x.
Typically, some of the
conditions will be speciï¬ed at xs and the remainder at xf.
This chapter will consider exclusively the initial value problem, deferring two-
point boundary value problems, which are generally more difï¬cult, to Chapter 17.
The underlying idea of any routine for solving the initial value problem is
always this: Rewrite the dyâs and dxâs in (16.0.3) as ï¬nite steps ây and âx, and
multiply the equations by âx. This gives algebraic formulas for the change in the
functions when the independent variable x is âsteppedâ by one âstepsizeâ âx. In
the limit of making the stepsize very small, a good approximation to the underlying
differential equation is achieved. Literal implementation of this procedure results
in Eulerâs method (16.1.1, below), which is, however, not recommended for any
practical use.
Eulerâs method is conceptually important, however; one way or
another, practical methods all come down to this same idea: Add small increments
to your functions corresponding to derivatives (right-hand sides of the equations)
multiplied by stepsizes.
In this chapter we consider three major types of practical numerical methods
for solving initial value problems for ODEs:
â¢ Runge-Kutta methods
â¢ Richardsonextrapolationand itsparticular implementationas the Bulirsch-
Stoer method
â¢ predictor-corrector methods.
A brief description of each of these types follows.
1. Runge-Kutta methods propagate a solution over an interval by combining
the information from several Euler-style steps (each involving one evaluation of the
right-hand fâs), and then using the information obtained to match a Taylor series
expansion up to some higher order.
2. Richardson extrapolationuses the powerful idea of extrapolatinga computed
result to the value that would have been obtained if the stepsize had been very
much smaller than it actually was. In particular, extrapolation to zero stepsize is
the desired goal. The ï¬rst practical ODE integrator that implemented this idea was
developed by Bulirsch and Stoer, and so extrapolation methods are often called
Bulirsch-Stoer methods.
3.
Predictor-corrector methods store the solution along the way, and use
those results to extrapolate the solution one step advanced; they then correct the
extrapolation using derivative information at the new point.
These are best for
very smooth functions.

Runge-Kutta is what you use when (i) you donât know any better, or (ii) you
have an intransigentproblem where Bulirsch-Stoeris failing, or (iii)you have a trivial
problem where computational efï¬ciency is of no concern. Runge-Kutta succeeds
virtually always; but it is not usually fastest, except when evaluating fi is cheap and
moderate accuracy (<â¼10â5) is required. Predictor-corrector methods, since they
use past information, are somewhat more difï¬cult to start up, but, for many smooth
problems, they are computationally more efï¬cient than Runge-Kutta. In recent years
Bulirsch-Stoer has been replacing predictor-corrector in many applications, but it
is too soon to say that predictor-corrector is dominated in all cases. However, it
appears that only rather sophisticated predictor-corrector routines are competitive.
Accordingly, we have chosen not to give an implementation of predictor-corrector
in this book. We discuss predictor-corrector further in Â§16.7, so that you can use
a canned routine should you encounter a suitable problem. In our experience, the
relatively simple Runge-Kutta and Bulirsch-Stoer routines we give are adequate
for most problems.
Each of the three types of methods can be organized to monitor internal
consistency.
This allows numerical errors which are inevitably introduced into
the solution to be controlled by automatic, (adaptive) changing of the fundamental
stepsize.
We always recommend that adaptive stepsize control be implemented,
and we will do so below.
In general, all three types of methods can be applied to any initial value
problem. Each comes with its own set of debits and credits that must be understood
before it is used.
We have organized the routines in this chapter into three nested levels. The
lowest or ânitty-grittyâ level is the piece we call the algorithm routine.
This
implements the basic formulas of the method, starts with dependent variables yi at
x, and calculates new values of the dependent variables at the value x + h. The
algorithm routine also yields up some information about the quality of the solution
after the step. The routine is dumb, however, and it is unable to make any adaptive
decision about whether the solution is of acceptable quality or not.
That quality-control decision we encode in a stepper routine.
The stepper
routine calls the algorithm routine. It may reject the result, set a smaller stepsize, and
call the algorithm routine again, until compatibility with a predetermined accuracy
criterion has been achieved. The stepperâs fundamental task is to take the largest
stepsize consistent with speciï¬ed performance. Only when this is accomplished does
the true power of an algorithm come to light.
Above the stepper is the driver routine, which starts and stops the integration,
stores intermediate results, and generally acts as an interface with the user. There is
nothing at all canonical about our driver routines. You should consider them to be
examples, and you can customize them for your particular application.
Of the routines that follow, rk4, rkck, mmid, stoerm, and simpr are algorithm
routines; rkqs, bsstep, stiff, and stifbs are steppers; rkdumb and odeint
are drivers.
Section 16.6 of this chapter treats the subject of stiff equations, relevant both to
ordinary differential equations and also to partial differential equations (Chapter 19).

16.1 Runge-Kutta Method
The formula for the Euler method is
yn+1 = yn + hf(xn, yn)
(16.1.1)
which advances a solutionfromxn to xn+1 â¡xn+h. The formula isunsymmetrical:
It advances the solution through an interval h, but uses derivative information only
at the beginning of that interval (see Figure 16.1.1). That means (and you can verify
by expansion in power series) that the stepâs error is only one power of h smaller
than the correction, i.e O(h2) added to (16.1.1).
There are several reasons that Eulerâs method is not recommended for practical
use, among them, (i) the method is not very accurate when compared to other,
fancier, methods run at the equivalent stepsize, and (ii) neither is it very stable
(see Â§16.6 below).
Consider, however, the use of a step like (16.1.1) to take a âtrialâ step to the
midpoint of the interval.
Then use the value of both x and y at that midpoint
to compute the ârealâ step across the whole interval. Figure 16.1.2 illustrates the
idea.
In equations,
k1 = hf(xn, yn)
k2 = hf
 xn + 1
2h, yn + 1
2k1

yn+1 = yn + k2 + O(h3)
(16.1.2)
As indicated in the error term, this symmetrization cancels out the ï¬rst-order error

16.1 Runge-Kutta Method
The formula for the Euler method is
yn+1 = yn + hf(xn, yn)
(16.1.1)
which advances a solutionfromxn to xn+1 â¡xn+h. The formula isunsymmetrical:
It advances the solution through an interval h, but uses derivative information only
at the beginning of that interval (see Figure 16.1.1). That means (and you can verify
by expansion in power series) that the stepâs error is only one power of h smaller
than the correction, i.e O(h2) added to (16.1.1).
There are several reasons that Eulerâs method is not recommended for practical
use, among them, (i) the method is not very accurate when compared to other,
fancier, methods run at the equivalent stepsize, and (ii) neither is it very stable
(see Â§16.6 below).
Consider, however, the use of a step like (16.1.1) to take a âtrialâ step to the
midpoint of the interval.
Then use the value of both x and y at that midpoint
to compute the ârealâ step across the whole interval. Figure 16.1.2 illustrates the
idea.

k2 = hf

yn+1 = yn + k2 + O(h3)

As indicated in the error term, this symmetrization cancels out the ï¬rst-order error
term, making the method second order. [A method is conventionally called nth
order if its error term is O(hn+1).]

idea. By far the most often used is the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta formula,
which has a certain sleekness of organization about it:
k1 = hf(xn, yn)
k2 = hf(xn + h

(16.1.3)
The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method requires four evaluations of the right-
hand side per step h (see Figure 16.1.3). This will be superior to the midpoint method
(16.1.2) if at least twice as large a step is possible with (16.1.3) for the same accuracy.
Is that so? The answer is: often, perhaps even usually, but surely not always! This
takes us back to a central theme, namely that high order does not always mean
high accuracy. The statement âfourth-order Runge-Kutta is generally superior to
second-orderâ is a true one, but you should recognize it as a statement about the

contemporary practice of science rather than as a statement about strict mathematics.
That is, it reï¬ects the nature of the problems that contemporary scientists like to solve.
For many scientiï¬c users, fourth-order Runge-Kutta is not just the ï¬rst word on
ODE integrators, but the last word as well. In fact, you can get pretty far on this old
workhorse, especially if you combine it with an adaptive stepsize algorithm. Keep
in mind, however, that the old workhorseâs last trip may well be to take you to the
poorhouse: Bulirsch-Stoer or predictor-corrector methods can be very much more
efï¬cient for problems where very high accuracy is a requirement. Those methods
are the high-strung racehorses. Runge-Kutta is for ploughing the ï¬elds. However,
even the old workhorse is more nimble with new horseshoes. In Â§16.2 we will give
a modern implementation of a Runge-Kutta method that is quite competitive as long
as very high accuracy is not required. An excellent discussion of the pitfalls in
constructing a good Runge-Kutta code is given in [3].
Here is the routine for carrying out one classical Runge-Kutta step on a set
of n differential equations. You input the values of the independent variables, and
you get out new values which are stepped by a stepsize h (which can be positive or
negative). You will notice that the routine requires you to supply not only function
derivs for calculating the right-hand side, but also values of the derivatives at the
starting point. Why not let the routine call derivs for this ï¬rst value? The answer
will become clear only in the next section, but in brief is this: This call may not
be your only one with these starting conditions. You may have taken a previous
step with too large a stepsize, and this is your replacement. In that case, you do not
want to call derivs unnecessarily at the start. Note that the routine that follows
has, therefore, only three calls to derivs.
#include "nrutil.h"
void rk4(float y[], float dydx[], int n, float x, float h, float yout[],
void (*derivs)(float, float [], float []))
Given values for the variables y[1..n] and their derivatives dydx[1..n] known at x, use the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to advance the solution over an interval h and return the
incremented variables as yout[1..n], which need not be a distinct array from y. The user
supplies the routine derivs(x,y,dydx), which returns derivatives dydx at x.

The Runge-Kutta method treats every step in a sequence of steps in identical
manner.
Prior behavior of a solution is not used in its propagation.
This is
mathematically proper, since any point along the trajectory of an ordinary differential
equation can serve as an initial point. The fact that all steps are treated identicallyalso
makes it easy to incorporate Runge-Kutta into relatively simple âdriverâ schemes.
We consider adaptive stepsize control, discussed in the next section, an essential
for serious computing. Occasionally, however, you just want to tabulate a function at
equally spaced intervals, and without particularlyhighaccuracy. In the most common
case, you want to produce a graph of the function. Then all you need may be a
simple driver program that goes from an initial xs to a ï¬nal xf in a speciï¬ed number
of steps. To check accuracy, double the number of steps, repeat the integration, and
compare results. This approach surely does not minimize computer time, and it can
fail for problems whose nature requires a variable stepsize, but it may well minimize
user effort. On small problems, this may be the paramount consideration.
Here is such a driver, self-explanatory, which tabulates the integrated functions
in the global arrays *x and **y; be sure to allocate memory for them with the
routines vector() and matrix(), respectively.

the calculation of this information will add to the computational overhead, but the
investment will generally be repaid handsomely.
With fourth-order Runge-Kutta, the most straightforward technique by far is
step doubling (see, e.g., [1]). We take each step twice, once as a full step, then,
independently, as two half steps (see Figure 16.2.1). How much overhead is this,
say in terms of the number of evaluations of the right-hand sides?
Each of the
three separate Runge-Kutta steps in the procedure requires 4 evaluations, but the
single and double sequences share a starting point, so the total is 11. This is to be
compared not to 4, but to 8 (the two half-steps), since â stepsize control aside â
we are achieving the accuracy of the smaller (half) stepsize. The overhead cost is
therefore a factor 1.375. What does it buy us?
Let us denote the exact solution for an advance from x to x + 2h by y(x + 2h)
and the two approximate solutions by y1 (one step 2h) and y2 (2 steps each of size
h). Since the basic method is fourth order, the true solution and the two numerical
approximations are related by
y(x + 2h) = y1 + (2h)5Ï + O(h6) + . . .
y(x + 2h) = y2 + 2(h5)Ï + O(h6) + . . .
(16.2.1)
where, to order h5, the value Ï remains constant over the step.
[Taylor series
expansion tells us the Ï is a number whose order of magnitude is y(5)(x)/5!.] The
ï¬rst expression in (16.2.1) involves (2h)5 since the stepsize is 2h, while the second
expression involves 2(h5) since the error on each step is h5Ï.
The difference
between the two numerical estimates is a convenient indicator of truncation error
ââ¡y2 ây1
(16.2.2)
It is this difference that we shall endeavor to keep to a desired degree of accuracy,
neither too large nor too small. We do this by adjusting h.
It might also occur to you that, ignoring terms of order h6 and higher, we can
solve the two equations in (16.2.1) to improve our numerical estimate of the true
solution y(x + 2h), namely,
y(x + 2h) = y2 + â
15 + O(h6)
(16.2.3)
This estimate is accurate toï¬fth order, one order higherthan the originalRunge-Kutta
steps.
However, we canât have our cake and eat it: (16.2.3) may be ï¬fth-order
accurate, but we have no way of monitoring its truncation error. Higher order is
not always higher accuracy!
Use of (16.2.3) rarely does harm, but we have no
way of directly knowing whether it is doing any good. Therefore we should use
âas the error estimate and take as âgravyâ any additional accuracy gain derived
from (16.2.3). In the technical literature, use of a procedure like (16.2.3) is called
âlocal extrapolation.â
An alternative stepsize adjustment algorithm is based on the embedded Runge-
Kutta formulas, originally invented by Fehlberg. An interesting fact about Runge-
Kutta formulas is that for orders M higher than four, more than M function
evaluations (though never more than M + 2) are required. This accounts for the

Step-doubling as a means for adaptive stepsize control in fourth-order Runge-Kutta.
Points where the derivative is evaluated are shown as ï¬lled circles. The open circle represents the same
derivatives as the ï¬lled circle immediately above it, so the total number of evaluations is 11 per two

popularity of the classical fourth-order method: It seems to give the most bang
for the buck. However, Fehlberg discovered a ï¬fth-order method with six function
evaluations where another combination of the six functions gives a fourth-order
method. The difference between the two estimates of y(x + h) can then be used as
an estimate of the truncation error to adjust the stepsize. Since Fehlbergâs original
formula, several other embedded Runge-Kutta formulas have been found.
Many practitioners were at one time wary of the robustness of Runge-Kutta-
Fehlberg methods. The feeling was that using the same evaluation points to advance
the function and to estimate the error was riskier than step-doubling, where the
error estimate is based on independent function evaluations. However, experience
has shown that this concern is not a problem in practice. Accordingly, embedded
Runge-Kutta formulas, which are roughly a factor of two more efï¬cient, have
superseded algorithms based on step-doubling.
The general form of a ï¬fth-order Runge-Kutta formula is
k1 = hf(xn, yn)
k2 = hf(xn + a2h, yn + b21k1)

k6 = hf(xn + a6h, yn + b61k1 + Â· Â· Â· + b65k5)

Now that we know, at least approximately, what our error is, we need to
consider how to keep it within desired bounds. What is the relation between â
and h?
According to (16.2.4) â (16.2.5), âscales as h5.
If we take a step h1
and produce an error â1, therefore, the step h0 that would have given some other
value â0 is readily estimated as
h0 = h1

â0
â1

0.2
(16.2.7)
Henceforth we will let â0 denote the desired accuracy. Then equation (16.2.7) is
used in two ways: If â1 is larger than â0 in magnitude, the equation tells how
much to decrease the stepsize when we retry the present (failed) step.
If â1 is
smaller than â0, on the other hand, then the equation tells how much we can safely
increase the stepsize for the next step.
Local extrapolation consists in accepting
the ï¬fth order value yn+1, even though the error estimate actually applies to the
fourth order value yâ
n+1.
Our notation hides the fact that â0 is actually a vector of desired accuracies,
one for each equation in the set of ODEs. In general, our accuracy requirement will
be that all equations are within their respective allowed errors. In other words, we
will rescale the stepsize according to the needs of the âworst-offenderâ equation.
How is â0, the desired accuracy, related to some looser prescription like âget a
solution good to one part in 106â? That can be a subtle question, and it depends on
exactly what your application is! You may be dealing with a set of equations whose
dependent variables differ enormously in magnitude. In that case, you probably
want to use fractional errors, â0 = Ïµy, where Ïµ is the number like 10â6 or whatever.
On the other hand, you may have oscillatory functions that pass through zero but
are bounded by some maximum values. In that case you probably want to set â0
equal to Ïµ times those maximum values.
A convenient way to fold these considerations into a generally useful stepper
routine is this: One of the arguments of the routine will of course be the vector of
dependent variables at the beginning of a proposed step. Call that y[1..n]. Let
us require the user to specify for each step another, corresponding, vector argument
yscal[1..n], and also an overall tolerance level eps. Then the desired accuracy

for the ith equation will be taken to be
â0 = eps Ã yscal[i]
(16.2.8)
If you desire constant fractional errors, plug a pointer to y into the pointer to yscal
calling slot (no need to copy the values into a different array). If you desire constant
absolute errors relative to some maximum values, set the elements of yscal equal to
those maximum values. A useful âtrickâ for getting constant fractional errors except
âveryâ near zero crossings is to set yscal[i] equal to |y[i]| + |h Ã dydx[i]|.
(The routine odeint, below, does this.)
Here is a more technical point. We have to consider one additional possibility
for yscal. The error criteria mentioned thus far are âlocal,â in that they bound the
error of each step individually. In some applications you may be unusually sensitive
about a âglobalâ accumulation of errors, from beginning to end of the integration
and in the worst possible case where the errors all are presumed to add with the
same sign. Then, the smaller the stepsize h, the smaller the value â0 that you will
need to impose. Why? Because there will be more steps between your starting
and ending values of x. In such cases you will want to set yscal proportional to
h, typically to something like
â0 = Ïµh Ã dydx[i]
(16.2.9)
This enforces fractional accuracy Ïµ not on the values of y but (much more stringently)
on the increments to those values at each step. But now look back at (16.2.7). If â0
has an implicit scaling with h, then the exponent 0.20 is no longer correct: When
the stepsize is reduced from a too-large value, the new predicted value h1 will fail to
meet the desired accuracy when yscal is also altered to this new h1 value. Instead
of 0.20 = 1/5, we must scale by the exponent 0.25 = 1/4 for things to work out.
The exponents 0.20 and 0.25 are not really very different. This motivates us
to adopt the following pragmatic approach, one that frees us from having to know
in advance whether or not you, the user, plan to scale your yscalâs with stepsize.
Whenever we decrease a stepsize, let us use the larger value of the exponent (whether
we need it or not!), and whenever we increase a stepsize, let us use the smaller
exponent.
Furthermore, because our estimates of error are not exact, but only
accurate to the leading order in h, we are advised to put in a safety factor S which is
a few percent smaller than unity. Equation (16.2.7) is thus replaced by
h0 =

(16.2.10)
We have found this prescription to be a reliable one in practice.
Here, then, is a stepper program that takes one âquality-controlledâ Runge-
Kutta step.

the ï¬fth-order Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta method to advance the solution over an interval h

truncation error in yout using the embedded fourth-order method. The user supplies the routine
derivs(x,y,dydx), which returns derivatives dydx at x.

Noting that the above routines are all in single precision, donât be too greedy in
specifying eps. The punishment for excessive greediness is interestingand worthyof
Gilbert and SullivanâsMikado: The routinecan always achieve an apparent zero error
by making the stepsize so small that quantities of order hyâ² add to quantities of order
y as if they were zero. Then the routine chugs happily along taking inï¬nitely many
inï¬nitesimal steps and never changing the dependent variables one iota. (You guard
against this catastrophic loss of your computer budget by signaling on abnormally
small stepsizes or on the dependent variable vector remaining unchanged from step
to step. On a personal workstation you guard against it by not taking too long a
lunch hour while your program is running.)
Here is a full-ï¬edged âdriverâ for Runge-Kutta with adaptive stepsize control.
We warmly recommend this routine, or one like it, for a variety of problems, notably

the methods of Chapter 4).
For storage of intermediate results (if you desire to
inspect them) we assume that thetop-level pointerreferences *xp and **yphave been
validly initialized (e.g., by the utilities vector() and matrix()). Because steps
occur at unequal intervals results are only stored at intervals greater than dxsav. The
top-level variable kmax indicates the maximum number of steps that can be stored.
If kmax=0 there is no intermediate storage, and the pointers *xp and **yp need not
point to valid memory. Storage of steps stops if kmax is exceeded, except that the
ending values are always stored. Again, these controls are merely indicative of what
you might need. The routine odeint should be customized to the problem at hand.

0 results are stored at approximate intervals dxsav in the arrays xp[1..kount], yp[1..nvar]
[1..kount], where kount is output by odeint. Deï¬ning declarations for these variables, with
memory allocations xp[1..kmax] and yp[1..nvar][1..kmax] for the arrays, should be in
the calling program.

Runge-Kutta driver with adaptive stepsize control. Integrate starting values ystart[1..nvar]
from x1 to x2 with accuracy eps, storing intermediate results in global variables. h1 should
be set as a guessed ï¬rst stepsize, hmin as the minimum allowed stepsize (can be zero). On
output nok and nbad are the number of good and bad (but retried and ï¬xed) steps taken, and
ystart is replaced by values at the end of the integration interval. derivs is the user-supplied
routine for calculating the right-hand side derivative, while rkqs is the name of the stepper

16.3 Modiï¬ed Midpoint Method
This section discusses the modiï¬ed midpoint method, which advances a vector
of dependent variables y(x) from a point x to a point x + H by a sequence of n
substeps each of size h,
h = H/n
(16.3.1)
In principle, one could use the modiï¬ed midpoint method in its own right as an ODE
integrator. In practice, the method ï¬nds its most important application as a part of
the more powerful Bulirsch-Stoer technique, treated in Â§16.4. You can therefore
consider this section as a preamble to Â§16.4.
The number of right-hand side evaluations required by the modiï¬ed midpoint
method is n + 1. The formulas for the method are
z0 â¡y(x)
z1 = z0 + hf(x, z0)
zm+1 = zmâ1 + 2hf(x + mh, zm)
for
m = 1, 2, . . ., n â1
y(x + H) âyn â¡1

substeps each of size h,
h = H/n
(16.3.1)
In principle, one could use the modiï¬ed midpoint method in its own right as an ODE
integrator. In practice, the method ï¬nds its most important application as a part of
the more powerful Bulirsch-Stoer technique, treated in Â§16.4. You can therefore
consider this section as a preamble to Â§16.4.
The number of right-hand side evaluations required by the modiï¬ed midpoint
method is n + 1. The formulas for the method are
z0 â¡y(x)
z1 = z0 + hf(x, z0)
zm+1 = zmâ1 + 2hf(x + mh, zm)
for
m = 1, 2, . . ., n â1
y(x + H) âyn â¡1
2[zn + znâ1 + hf(x + H, zn)]

Here the zâs are intermediate approximations which march along in steps of h, while
yn is the ï¬nal approximation to y(x + H). The method is basically a âcentered
differenceâ or âmidpointâ method (compare equation 16.1.2), except at the ï¬rst and
last points. Those give the qualiï¬er âmodiï¬ed.â
The modiï¬ed midpoint method is a second-order method, like (16.1.2), but with
the advantage of requiring(asymptoticallyfor large n) only one derivative evaluation
per step h instead of the two required by second-order Runge-Kutta. Perhaps there
are applications where the simplicity of (16.3.2), easily coded in-line in some other
program, recommends it. In general, however, use of the modiï¬ed midpoint method
by itself will be dominated by the embedded Runge-Kutta method with adaptive
stepsize control, as implemented in the preceding section.
The usefulness of the modiï¬ed midpoint method to the Bulirsch-Stoertechnique
(Â§16.4) derives from a âdeepâ result about equations (16.3.2), due to Gragg. It turns
out that the error of (16.3.2), expressed as a power series in h, the stepsize, contains
only even powers of h,
yn ây(x + H) =
â
X
i=1
Î±ih2i
(16.3.3)
where H is held constant, but h changes by varying n in (16.3.1). The importance
of this even power series is that, if we play our usual tricks of combining steps to
knock out higher-order error terms, we can gain two orders at a time!
For example, suppose n is even, and let yn/2 denote the result of applying
(16.3.1) and (16.3.2) with half as many steps, n ân/2. Then the estimate
y(x + H) â4yn âyn/2
3
(16.3.4)
is fourth-order accurate, the same as fourth-order Runge-Kutta, but requires only
about 1.5 derivative evaluations per step h instead of Runge-Kuttaâs 4 evaluations.
Donât be too anxious to implement (16.3.4), since we will soon do even better.
Now would be a good time to look back at the routine qsimp in Â§4.2, and
especially to compare equation (4.2.4) with equation (16.3.4) above. You will see
that the transition in Chapter 4 to the idea of Richardson extrapolation, as embodied
in Romberg integration of Â§4.3, is exactly analogous to the transition in going from
this section to the next one.
Here is the routine that implements the modiï¬ed midpoint method, which will
be used below.
#include "nrutil.h"
void mmid(float y[], float dydx[], int nvar, float xs, float htot, int nstep,
float yout[], void (*derivs)(float, float[], float[]))
Modiï¬ed midpoint step. At xs, input the dependent variable vector y[1..nvar] and its deriva-
tive vector dydx[1..nvar]. Also input is htot, the total step to be made, and nstep, the
number of substeps to be used. The output is returned as yout[1..nvar], which need not
be a distinct array from y; if it is distinct, however, then y and dydx are returned undamaged.

16.4 Richardson Extrapolation and the
Bulirsch-Stoer Method
The techniques described in this section are not for differential equations
containing nonsmooth functions.
For example, you might have a differential
equation whose right-hand side involves a function that is evaluated by table look-up
and interpolation. If so, go back to Runge-Kutta with adaptive stepsize choice:
That method does an excellent job of feeling its way through rocky or discontinuous
terrain.
It is also an excellent choice for quick-and-dirty, low-accuracy solution
of a set of equations. A second warning is that the techniques in this section are
not particularly good for differential equations that have singular points inside the
interval of integration. A regular solution must tiptoe very carefully across such
points. Runge-Kutta withadaptive stepsize can sometimes effect this;more generally,
there are special techniques available for such problems, beyond our scope here.
Apart from those two caveats, we believe that the Bulirsch-Stoer method,
discussed in this section, is the best known way to obtain high-accuracy solutions
to ordinary differential equations with minimal computational effort. (A possible
exception, infrequently encountered in practice, is discussed in Â§16.7.)

Figure 16.4.1.
Richardson extrapolation as used in the Bulirsch-Stoer method. A large interval H is
spanned by different sequences of ï¬ner and ï¬ner substeps. Their results are extrapolated to an answer
that is supposed to correspond to inï¬nitely ï¬ne substeps. In the Bulirsch-Stoer method, the integrations
are done by the modiï¬ed midpoint method, and the extrapolation technique is rational function or
polynomial extrapolation.
Three key ideas are involved.
The ï¬rst is Richardsonâs deferred approach
to the limit, which we already met in Â§4.3 on Romberg integration. The idea is
to consider the ï¬nal answer of a numerical calculation as itself being an analytic
function (if a complicated one) of an adjustable parameter like the stepsize h. That
analytic function can be probed by performing the calculation with various values
of h, none of them being necessarily small enough to yield the accuracy that we
desire. When we know enough about the function, we ï¬t it to some analytic form,
and then evaluate it at that mythical and golden point h = 0 (see Figure 16.4.1).
Richardson extrapolation is a method for turning straw into gold! (Lead into gold
for alchemist readers.)
The second idea has to do withwhat kind of ï¬ttingfunctionis used. Bulirschand
Stoer ï¬rst recognized the strength of rational function extrapolation in Richardson-
type applications. That strength is to break the shackles of the power series and its
limited radius of convergence, out only to the distance of the ï¬rst pole in the complex
plane. Rational function ï¬ts can remain good approximations to analytic functions
even after the various terms in powers of h all have comparable magnitudes. In
other words, h can be so large as to make the whole notion of the âorderâ of the
method meaningless â and the method can still work superbly. Nevertheless, more
recent experience suggests that for smooth problems straightforward polynomial
extrapolation is slightly more efï¬cient than rational function extrapolation. We will
accordingly adopt polynomial extrapolation as the default, but the routine bsstep
below allows easy substitution of one kind of extrapolation for the other.
You
might wish at this point to review Â§3.1âÂ§3.2, where polynomial and rational function
extrapolation were already discussed.
The third idea was discussed in the section before this one, namely to use
a method whose error function is strictly even, allowing the rational function or
polynomial approximation to be in terms of the variable h2 instead of just h.
Put these ideas together and you have the Bulirsch-Stoer method [1]. A single
Bulirsch-Stoer step takes us from x to x+H, where H is supposed to be quite a large

â not at all inï¬nitesimal â distance. That single step is a grand leap consisting
of many (e.g., dozens to hundreds) substeps of modiï¬ed midpoint method, which
are then extrapolated to zero stepsize.
The sequence of separate attempts to cross the interval H is made with
increasing values of n, the number of substeps.
Bulirsch and Stoer originally
proposed the sequence
n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, . . ., [nj = 2njâ2], . . .
(16.4.1)
More recent work by Deuï¬hard [2,3] suggests that the sequence
n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, . . ., [nj = 2j], . . .
(16.4.2)
is usually more efï¬cient. For each step, we do not know in advance how far up this
sequence we will go. After each successive n is tried, a polynomial extrapolation
is attempted. That extrapolation gives both extrapolated values and error estimates.
If the errors are not satisfactory, we go higher in n. If they are satisfactory, we go
on to the next step and begin anew with n = 2.
Of course there must be some upper limit, beyond which we conclude that there
is some obstacle in our path in the interval H, so that we must reduce H rather than
just subdivide it more ï¬nely. In the implementations below, the maximum number
of nâs to be tried is called KMAXX. For reasons described below we usually take this
equal to 8; the 8th value of the sequence (16.4.2) is 16, so this is the maximum
number of subdivisions of H that we allow.
We enforce error control, as in the Runge-Kutta method, by monitoring internal
consistency, and adaptingstepsize tomatch a prescribed boundon the local truncation
error. Each new result from the sequence of modiï¬ed midpoint integrations allows a
tableau like that in Â§3.1 to be extended by one additional set of diagonals. The size of
the new correction added at each stage is taken as the (conservative) error estimate.
How should we use this error estimate to adjust the stepsize? The best strategy now
known is due to Deuï¬hard [2,3]. For completeness we describe it here:
Supposethe absolute value of the error estimate returned from the kth column (and hence
the k + 1st row) of the extrapolation tableau is Ïµk+1,k. Error control is enforced by requiring
Ïµk+1,k < Ïµ
(16.4.3)
as the criterion for accepting the current step, where Ïµ is the required tolerance. For the even
sequence (16.4.2) the order of the method is 2k + 1:
Ïµk+1,k â¼H2k+1
(16.4.4)
Thus a simple estimate ofa new stepsizeHkto obtain convergence in aï¬xed column kwould be
Hk = H

Ïµ
Ïµk+1,k
1/(2k+1)
(16.4.5)
Which column k should we aim to achieve convergence in? Letâs compare the work
required for different k. Suppose Ak is the work to obtain row k of the extrapolation tableau,
so Ak+1 is the work to obtain column k. We will assume the work is dominated by the cost
of evaluating the functions deï¬ning the right-hand sides of the differential equations. For nk
subdivisions in H, the number of function evaluations can be found from the recurrence
A1 = n1 + 1
Ak+1 = Ak + nk+1
(16.4.6)

The work per unit step to get column k is Ak+1/Hk, which we nondimensionalize with a
factor of H and write as
Wk = Ak+1
Hk H
(16.4.7)
= Ak+1
Ïµk+1,k
Ïµ
1/(2k+1)
(16.4.8)
The quantities Wk can be calculated during the integration. The optimal column index q
is then deï¬ned by
Wq =
min
k=1,...,kf
Wk
(16.4.9)
where kf is the ï¬nal column, in which the error criterion (16.4.3) was satisï¬ed.
The q
determined from (16.4.9) deï¬nes the stepsize Hq to be used as the next basic stepsize, so that
we can expect to get convergence in the optimal column q.
Two important reï¬nements have to be made to the strategy outlined so far:
â¢ If the current H is âtoo small,â then kf will be âtoo small,â and so q remains
âtoo small.â
It may be desirable to increase H and aim for convergence in a
column q > kf.
â¢ If the current H is âtoo big,â we may not converge at all on the current step and we
will have to decrease H. We would like to detect this by monitoring the quantities
Ïµk+1,k for each k so we can stop the current step as soon as possible.
Deuï¬hardâs prescription for dealing with these two problems uses ideas from communi-
cation theory to determine the âaverage expected convergence behaviorâ of the extrapolation.
His model produces certain correction factors Î±(k, q) by which Hk is to be multiplied to try
to get convergence in column q. The factors Î±(k, q) depend only on Ïµ and the sequence {ni}
and so can be computed once during initialization:
Î±(k, q) = Ïµ
Ak+1âAq+1
(2k+1)(Aq+1âA1+1)
for
k < q
(16.4.10)
with Î±(q, q) = 1.
Now to handle the ï¬rst problem, suppose convergence occurs in column q = kf. Then
rather than taking Hq for the nextstep, we might aim to increasethe stepsizeto get convergence
in column q + 1. Since we donât have Hq+1 available from the computation, we estimate it as
Hq+1 = HqÎ±(q, q + 1)
(16.4.11)
By equation (16.4.7) this replacement is efï¬cient, i.e., reduces the work per unit step, if
Aq+1
Hq
> Aq+2
Hq+1
(16.4.12)
or
Aq+1Î±(q, q + 1) > Aq+2
(16.4.13)
During initialization, this inequality can be checked for q = 1, 2, . . . to determine kmax, the
largest allowed column. Then when (16.4.12) is satisï¬ed it will always be efï¬cient to use
Hq+1. (In practice we limit kmax to 8 even when Ïµ is very small as there is very little further
gain in efï¬ciency whereas roundoff can become a problem.)
The problem of stepsize reduction is handled by computing stepsize estimates
Â¯Hk â¡HkÎ±(k,q),
k = 1, . . . , q â1
(16.4.14)
during the current step. The Â¯Hâs are estimates of the stepsize to get convergence in the
optimal column q. If any Â¯Hk is âtoo small,â we abandon the current step and restart using
Â¯Hk. The criterion of being âtoo smallâ is taken to be
HkÎ±(k, q + 1) < H
(16.4.15)
The Î±âs satisfy Î±(k, q + 1) > Î±(k, q).

During the ï¬rst step, when we have no information about the solution, the stepsize
reduction check is made for all k.
Afterwards, we test for convergence and for possible
stepsize reduction only in an âorder windowâ
max(1, q â1) â¤k â¤min(kmax, q + 1)
(16.4.16)
The rationale for the order window is that if convergence appears to occur for k < q â1 it
is often spurious, resulting from some fortuitously small error estimate in the extrapolation.
On the other hand, if you need to go beyond k = q + 1 to obtain convergence, your local
model of the convergence behavior is obviously not very good and you need to cut the
stepsize and reestablish it.
In the routine bsstep, these various tests are actually carried out using quantities
Ïµ(k) â¡H
Hk =
Ïµk+1,k
Ïµ
1/(2k+1)
(16.4.17)
called err[k] in the code. As usual, we include a âsafety factorâ in the stepsize selection.
This is implemented by replacing Ïµ by 0.25Ïµ.
Other safety factors are explained in the
program comments.
Note that while the optimal convergence column is restricted to increase by at most one
on each step, a sudden drop in order is allowed by equation (16.4.9). This gives the method
a degree of robustness for problems with discontinuities.
Let us remind you once again that scaling of the variables is often crucial for
successful integration of differential equations. The scaling âtrickâ suggested in
the discussion following equation (16.2.8) is a good general purpose choice, but
not foolproof. Scaling by the maximum values of the variables is more robust, but
requires you to have some prior information.
The following implementation of a Bulirsch-Stoer step has exactly the same
calling sequence as the quality-controlled Runge-Kutta stepper rkqs. This means
that the driver odeint in Â§16.2 can be used for Bulirsch-Stoer as well as Runge-
Kutta: Just substitute bsstep for rkqs in odeintâs argument list. The routine
bsstep calls mmid to take the modiï¬ed midpoint sequences, and calls pzextr, given
below, to do the polynomial extrapolation.

The polynomial extrapolation routine is based on the same algorithm as polint
Â§3.1. It is simpler in that it is always extrapolating to zero, rather than to an arbitrary
value. However, it is more complicated in that it must individually extrapolate each
component of a vector of quantities.

Use polynomial extrapolation to evaluate nv functions at x = 0 by ï¬tting a polynomial to a
sequence of estimates with progressively smaller values x = xest, and corresponding function
vectors yest[1..nv]. This call is number iest in the sequence of calls. Extrapolated function
values are output as yz[1..nv], and their estimated error is output as dy[1..nv].

Current wisdom favors polynomial extrapolation over rational function extrap-
olation in the Bulirsch-Stoermethod. However, our feeling is that this view is guided
more by the kinds of problems used for tests than by one method being actually
âbetter.â Accordingly, we provide the optional routine rzextr for rational function
extrapolation, an exact substitution for pzextr above.
#include "nrutil.h"

Deï¬ned in bsstep.
void rzextr(int iest, float xest, float yest[], float yz[], float dy[], int nv)
Exact substitute for pzextr, but uses diagonal rational function extrapolation instead of poly-
nomial extrapolation.

16.5 Second-Order Conservative Equations
Usually when you have a system of high-order differential equations to solve it is best
to reformulate them as a system of ï¬rst-order equations, as discussed in Â§16.0. There is
a particular class of equations that occurs quite frequently in practice where you can gain
about a factor of two in efï¬ciency by differencing the equations directly. The equations are
second-order systems where the derivative does not appear on the right-hand side:
yâ²â² = f(x,y),
y(x0) = y0,
yâ²(x0) = z0
(16.5.1)
As usual, y can denote a vector of values.
Stoermerâs rule, dating back to 1907, has been a popular method for discretizing such
systems.
With h = H/m we have
y1 = y0 + h[z0 + 1

Here zm is yâ²(x0 + H). Henrici showed how to rewrite equations (16.5.2) to reduce roundoff
error by using the quantities âk â¡yk+1 âyk. Start with
â0 = h[z0 + 1
2hf(x0, y0)]
y1 = y0 + â0
(16.5.3)
Then for k = 1, . . . , m â1, set
âk = âkâ1 + h2f(x0 + kh, yk)
yk+1 = yk + âk
(16.5.4)
Finally compute the derivative from
zm = âmâ1/h + 1
2hf(x0 + H, ym)
(16.5.5)
Gragg again showed that the error series for equations (16.5.3)â(16.5.5) contains only
even powers of h, and so the method is a logical candidatefor extrapolation `a la Bulirsch-Stoer.
We replace mmid by the following routine stoerm:
#include "nrutil.h"
void stoerm(float y[], float d2y[], int nv, float xs, float htot, int nstep,
float yout[], void (*derivs)(float, float [], float []))
Stoermerâs rule for integrating yâ²â² = f(x, y) for a system of n = nv/2 equations. On input
y[1..nv] contains y in its ï¬rst n elements and yâ² in its second n elements, all evaluated at
xs. d2y[1..nv] contains the right-hand side function f (also evaluated at xs) in its ï¬rst n
elements. Its second n elements are not referenced. Also input is htot, the total step to be
taken, and nstep, the number of substeps to be used. The output is returned as yout[1..nv],
with the same storage arrangement as y. derivs is the user-supplied routine that calculates f.

16.6 Stiff Sets of Equations
As soon as one deals with more than one ï¬rst-order differential equation, the
possibility of a stiff set of equations arises. Stiffness occurs in a problem where
there are two or more very different scales of the independent variable on which
the dependent variables are changing.
For example, consider the following set
of equations [1]:
uâ² = 998u + 1998v
vâ² = â999u â1999v
(16.6.1)
with boundary conditions
u(0) = 1
v(0) = 0
(16.6.2)
By means of the transformation
u = 2y âz
v = ây + z
(16.6.3)
we ï¬nd the solution
u = 2eâx âeâ1000x
v = âeâx + eâ1000x
(16.6.4)
If we integrated the system (16.6.1) with any of the methods given so far in this
chapter, the presence of the eâ1000x term would require a stepsize h âª1/1000 for
the method to be stable (the reason for this is explained below). This is so even

Figure 16.6.1.
Example of an instability encountered in integrating a stiff equation (schematic). Here
it is supposed that the equation has two solutions, shown as solid and dashed lines. Although the initial
conditions are such as to give the solid solution, the stability of the integration (shown as the unstable
dotted sequence of segments) is determined by the more rapidly varying dashed solution, even after that
solution has effectively died away to zero. Implicit integration methods are the cure.
though the eâ1000x term is completely negligible in determining the values of u and
v as soon as one is away from the origin (see Figure 16.6.1).
This is the generic disease of stiff equations: we are required to follow the
variation in the solution on the shortest length scale to maintain stability of the
integration, even though accuracy requirements allow a much larger stepsize.
To see how we might cure this problem, consider the single equation
yâ² = âcy
(16.6.5)
where c > 0 is a constant. The explicit (or forward) Euler scheme for integrating
this equation with stepsize h is
yn+1 = yn + hyâ²
n = (1 âch)yn
(16.6.6)
The method is called explicit because the new value yn+1 is given explicitly in
terms of the old value yn.
Clearly the method is unstable if h > 2/c, for then
|yn| ââas n ââ.
The simplest cure is to resort to implicit differencing, where the right-hand side
is evaluated at the new y location. In this case, we get the backward Euler scheme:
yn+1 = yn + hyâ²
n+1
(16.6.7)
or
yn+1 =
yn
1 + ch
(16.6.8)
The method is absolutely stable: even as h ââ, yn+1 â0, which is in fact the
correct solution of the differential equation. If we think of x as representing time,
then the implicit method converges to the true equilibrium solution (i.e., the solution
at late times) for large stepsizes. This nice feature of implicit methods holds only
for linear systems, but even in the general case implicit methods give better stability.

Of course, we give up accuracy in following the evolution towards equilibrium if
we use large stepsizes, but we maintain stability.
These considerations can easily be generalized to sets of linear equations with
constant coefï¬cients:
yâ² = âC Â· y
(16.6.9)
where C is a positive deï¬nite matrix. Explicit differencing gives
yn+1 = (1 âCh) Â· yn
(16.6.10)
Now a matrix An tends to zero as n ââonly if the largest eigenvalue of A
has magnitude less than unity. Thus yn is bounded as n ââonly if the largest
eigenvalue of 1 âCh is less than 1, or in other words
h <
2
Î»max
(16.6.11)
where Î»max is the largest eigenvalue of C.
On the other hand, implicit differencing gives
yn+1 = yn + hyâ²
n+1
(16.6.12)
or
yn+1 = (1 + Ch)â1 Â· yn
(16.6.13)
If the eigenvalues of C are Î», then the eigenvalues of (1 + Ch)â1 are (1 + Î»h)â1,
which has magnitude less than one for all h.
(Recall that all the eigenvalues
of a positive deï¬nite matrix are nonnegative.) Thus the method is stable for all
stepsizes h. The penalty we pay for this stability is that we are required to invert
a matrix at each step.
Not all equations are linear with constant coefï¬cients, unfortunately!
For
the system
yâ² = f(y)
(16.6.14)
implicit differencing gives
yn+1 = yn + hf(yn+1)
(16.6.15)
In general thisis some nasty set of nonlinear equationsthat has to be solvediteratively
at each step. Suppose we try linearizing the equations, as in Newtonâs method:
yn+1 = yn + h

If h is not too big, only one iteration of Newtonâs method may be accurate enough
to solve equation (16.6.15) using equation (16.6.17). In other words, at each step
we have to invert the matrix
1 âh âf
ây
(16.6.18)
to ï¬nd yn+1. Solving implicit methods by linearization is called a âsemi-implicitâ
method, so equation (16.6.17) is the semi-implicit Euler method. It is not guaranteed
to be stable, but it usually is, because the behavior is locally similar to the case of
a constant matrix C described above.
So far we have dealt only with implicit methods that are ï¬rst-order accurate.
While these are very robust, most problems will beneï¬t from higher-order methods.
There are three important classes of higher-order methods for stiff systems:
â¢ Generalizations of the Runge-Kutta method, of which the most useful
are the Rosenbrock methods. The ï¬rst practical implementation of these
ideas was by Kaps and Rentrop, and so these methods are also called
Kaps-Rentrop methods.
â¢ Generalizations of the Bulirsch-Stoer method, in particular a semi-implicit
extrapolation method due to Bader and Deuï¬hard.
â¢ Predictor-corrector methods, most of which are descendants of Gearâs
backward differentiation method.
We shall give implementations of the ï¬rst two methods. Note that systems where
the right-hand side depends explicitly on x, f(y, x), can be handled by adding x to
the list of dependent variables so that the system to be solved is
 y
x
â²
=
 f
1

(16.6.19)
In both the routines to be given in this section, we have explicitly carried out this
replacement for you, so the routines can handle right-hand sides of the form f(y, x)
without any special effort on your part.
We now mention an important point: It is absolutely crucial to scale your vari-
ables properly when integrating stiff problems with automatic stepsize adjustment.
As in our nonstiff routines, you will be asked to supply a vector yscal with which
the error is to be scaled. For example, to get constant fractional errors, simply set
yscal = |y|. You can get constant absolute errors relative to some maximum values
by setting yscal equal to those maximum values. In stiff problems, there are often
strongly decreasing pieces of the solution which you are not particularly interested
in following once they are small. You can control the relative error above some
threshold C and the absolute error below the threshold by setting
yscal = max(C, |y|)
(16.6.20)
If you are using appropriate nondimensional units, then each component of C should
be of order unity.
If you are not sure what values to take for C, simply try
setting each component equal to unity. We strongly advocate the choice (16.6.20)
for stiff problems.
One ï¬nal warning: Solving stiff problems can sometimes lead to catastrophic
precision loss. Be alert for situations where double precision is necessary.

Rosenbrock Methods
These methods have the advantage of being relatively simple to understand and imple-
ment. For moderate accuracies (Ïµ <â¼10â4 â 10â5 in the error criterion) and moderate-sized
systems (N <â¼10), they are competitive with the more complicated algorithms. For more
stringent parameters, Rosenbrock methods remain reliable; they merely become less efï¬cient
than competitors like the semi-implicit extrapolation method (see below).
A Rosenbrock method seeks a solution of the form
y(x0 + h) = y0 +
s
X
i=1
ciki
(16.6.21)
where the corrections ki are found by solving s linear equations that generalize the structure
in (16.6.17):
(1 âÎ³hfâ²) Â· ki = hf
 
y0 +
iâ1
X
j=1
Î±ijkj
!
+ hfâ² Â·
iâ1
X
j=1
Î³ijkj,
i = 1, . . . , s
(16.6.22)
Here we denote the Jacobian matrix by fâ². The coefï¬cients Î³, ci, Î±ij, and Î³ij are ï¬xed
constants independent of the problem. If Î³ = Î³ij = 0, this is simply a Runge-Kutta scheme.
Equations (16.6.22) can be solved successively for k1, k2, . . . .
Crucial to the success of a stiff integration scheme is an automatic stepsize adjustment
algorithm. Kaps and Rentrop [2] discovered an embedded or Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method
as described in Â§16.2: Two estimates of the form (16.6.21) are computed, the ârealâ one y
and a lower-order estimate by with different coefï¬cients Ëci, i = 1, . . . , Ës, where Ës < s but the
ki are the same. The difference between y and by leads to an estimate of the local truncation
error, which can then be used for stepsize control. Kaps and Rentrop showed that the smallest
value of s for which embedding is possible is s = 4, Ës = 3, leading to a fourth-order method.
To minimize the matrix-vector multiplications on the right-hand side of (16.6.22), we
rewrite the equations in terms of quantities
gi =
iâ1
X
j=1
Î³ijkj + Î³ki
(16.6.23)
The equations then take the form
(1/Î³h âfâ²) Â· g1 = f(y0)
(1/Î³h âfâ²) Â· g2 = f(y0 + a21g1) + c21g1/h
(1/Î³h âfâ²) Â· g3 = f(y0 + a31g1 + a32g2) + (c31g1 + c32g2)/h
(1/Î³h âfâ²) Â· g4 = f(y0 + a41g1 + a42g2 + a43g3) + (c41g1 + c42g2 + c43g3)/h
(16.6.24)
In our implementation stiff of the Kaps-Rentrop algorithm, we have carried out the
replacement (16.6.19) explicitly in equations (16.6.24), so you need not concern yourself
about it. Simply provide a routine (called derivs in stiff) that returns f (called dydx) as a
function of x and y. Also supply a routine jacobn that returns fâ² (dfdy) and âf/âx (dfdx)
as functions of x and y. If x does not occur explicitly on the right-hand side, then dfdx will
be zero. Usually the Jacobian matrix will be available to you by analytic differentiation of
the right-hand side f. If not, your routine will have to compute it by numerical differencing
with appropriate increments ây.
Kaps and Rentrop gave two different sets of parameters, which have slightly different
stability properties. Several other sets have been proposed. Our default choice is that of
Shampine [3], but we also give you one of the Kaps-Rentrop sets as an option. Some proposed
parameter sets require function evaluations outside the domain of integration; we prefer to
avoid that complication.
The calling sequence of stiff is exactly the same as the nonstiff routines given earlier
in this chapter. It is thus âplug-compatibleâ with them in the general ODE integrating routine

odeint. This compatibility requires, unfortunately, one slight anomaly: While the user-
supplied routine derivs is a dummy argument (which can therefore have any actual name),
the other user-supplied routine is not an argument and must be named (exactly) jacobn.
stiff begins by saving the initial values, in case the step has to be repeated because
the error tolerance is exceeded. The linear equations (16.6.24) are solved by ï¬rst computing
the LU decomposition of the matrix 1/Î³h âfâ² using the routine ludcmp. Then the four
gi are found by back-substitution of the four different right-hand sides using lubksb. Note
that each step of the integration requires one call to jacobn and three calls to derivs (one
call to get dydx before calling stiff, and two calls inside stiff). The reason only three
calls are needed and not four is that the parameters have been chosen so that the last two
calls in equation (16.6.24) are done with the same arguments. Counting the evaluation of
the Jacobian matrix as roughly equivalent to N evaluations of the right-hand side f, we see
that the Kaps-Rentrop scheme involves about N + 3 function evaluations per step. Note that
if N is large and the Jacobian matrix is sparse, you should replace the LU decomposition
by a suitable sparse matrix procedure.
Stepsize control depends on the fact that
yexact = y + O(h5)
yexact = by + O(h4)
(16.6.25)
Thus
|y âby| = O(h4)
(16.6.26)
Referring back to the steps leading from equation (16.2.4) to equation (16.2.10), we see
that the new stepsize should be chosen as in equation (16.2.10) but with the exponents 1/4
and 1/5 replaced by 1/3 and 1/4, respectively. Also, experience shows that it is wise to
prevent too large a stepsize change in one step, otherwise we will probably have to undo
the large change in the next step. We adopt 0.5 and 1.5 as the maximum allowed decrease
and increase of h in one step.

of h = 2.9 Ã 10â4 using odeint. The components of C in (16.6.20) are all set to unity.
The routines derivs and jacobn for this problem are given below. Even though the ratio
of largest to smallest decay constants for this problem is around 106, stiff succeeds in
integrating this set in only 29 steps with Ïµ = 10â4. By contrast, the Runge-Kutta routine
rkqs requires 51,012 steps!

for (i=1;i<=n;i++) dfdx[i]=0.0;

dfdy[1][3] = -1000.0*y[1];

Semi-implicit Extrapolation Method
The Bulirsch-Stoermethod, which discretizesthe differential equationusing the modiï¬ed
midpoint rule, does not work for stiff problems. Bader and Deuï¬hard [5] discovered a semi-
implicit discretization that works very well and that lends itself to extrapolation exactly as
in the original Bulirsch-Stoer method.
The starting point is an implicit form of the midpoint rule:
yn+1 âynâ1 = 2hf
yn+1 + ynâ1

Convert this equation into semi-implicit form by linearizing the right-hand side about f(yn).
The result is the semi-implicit midpoint rule:

1 âh âf
ây

Â· yn+1 =

1 + h âf
ây

Â· ynâ1 + 2h

f(yn) ââf
ây Â· yn

(16.6.30)
It is used with a special ï¬rst step, the semi-implicit Euler step (16.6.17), and a special
âsmoothingâ last step in which the last yn is replaced by
yn â¡1
2(yn+1 + ynâ1)
(16.6.31)
Bader and Deuï¬hard showed that the error series for this method once again involves only
even powers of h.
For practical implementation, it is better to rewrite the equations usingâk â¡yk+1 âyk.
With h = H/m, start by calculating
â0 =

1 âh âf
ây
â1
Â· hf(y0)
y1 = y0 + â0
(16.6.32)
Then for k = 1, . . . , m â1, set
âk = âkâ1 + 2

1 âh âf
ây
â1
Â· [hf(yk) ââkâ1]
yk+1 = yk + âk
(16.6.33)
Finally compute
âm =

1 âh âf
ây
â1
Â· [hf(ym) ââmâ1]
ym = ym + âm
(16.6.34)
It is easy to incorporate the replacement (16.6.19) in the above formulas. The additional
terms in the Jacobian that come from âf/âx all cancel out of the semi-implicit midpoint rule
(16.6.30). In the special ï¬rst step (16.6.17), and in the corresponding equation (16.6.32), the
term hf becomes hf + h2âf/âx. The remaining equations are all unchanged.
This algorithm is implemented in the routine simpr:
#include "nrutil.h"
void simpr(float y[], float dydx[], float dfdx[], float **dfdy, int n,
float xs, float htot, int nstep, float yout[],
void (*derivs)(float, float [], float []))
Performs one step of semi-implicit midpoint rule. Input are the dependent variable y[1..n], its
derivative dydx[1..n], the derivative of the right-hand side with respect to x, dfdx[1..n],
and the Jacobian dfdy[1..n][1..n] at xs. Also input are htot, the total step to be taken,
and nstep, the number of substeps to be used. The output is returned as yout[1..n].
derivs is the user-supplied routine that calculates dydx.

The routine simpr is intended to be used in a routine stifbs that is almost exactly the
same as bsstep.
The only differences are:
â¢ The stepsize sequence is
n = 2, 6, 10, 14, 22, 34, 50, . . . ,
(16.6.35)
where each member differs from its predecessor by the smallest multiple of 4 that
makes the ratio of successiveterms be â¤5
7. The parameter KMAXX is taken to be 7.
â¢ The work per unit step now includes the cost of Jacobian evaluations as well
as function evaluations. We count one Jacobian evaluation as equivalent to N
function evaluations, where N is the number of equations.
â¢ Onceagain the user-suppliedroutine derivsis a dummy argument and so can have
any name. However, to maintain âplug-compatibilityâ with rkqs, bsstep and
stiff, the routine jacobn is not an argument and must have exactly this name. It
is called once per step to return fâ² (dfdy) and âf/âx (dfdx) as functions of x and y.
Here is the routine, with comments pointing out only the differences from bsstep:
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
#define KMAXX 7
#define IMAXX (KMAXX+1)
#define SAFE1 0.25
#define SAFE2 0.7

Semi-implicit extrapolation step for integrating stiï¬o.d.e.âs, with monitoring of local truncation
error to adjust stepsize. Input are the dependent variable vector y[1..n] and its derivative
dydx[1..n] at the starting value of the independent variable x. Also input are the stepsize to
be attempted htry, the required accuracy eps, and the vector yscal[1..n] against which
the error is scaled. On output, y and x are replaced by their new values, hdid is the stepsize
that was actually accomplished, and hnext is the estimated next stepsize. derivs is a user-
supplied routine that computes the derivatives of the right-hand side with respect to x, while
jacobn (a ï¬xed name) is a user-supplied routine that computes the Jacobi matrix of derivatives
of the right-hand side with respect to the components of y. Be sure to set htry on successive
steps to the value of hnext returned from the previous step, as is the case if the routine is
called by odeint.

The routine stifbs is an excellent routine for all stiff problems, competitive with
the best Gear-type routines. stiff is comparable in execution time for moderate N and
Ïµ <â¼10â4. By the time Ïµ â¼10â8, stifbs is roughly an order of magnitude faster. There
are further improvements that could be applied to stifbs to make it even more robust. For
example, very occasionally ludcmp in simpr will encounter a singular matrix. You could
arrange for the stepsize to be reduced, say by a factor of the current nseq[k]. There are
also certain stability restrictions on the stepsize that come into play on some problems. For
a discussion of how to implement these automatically, see [6].

There is possibly only one exceptional case: high-precision
solution of very smooth equations with very complicated right-hand sides, as we
will describe later.
Nevertheless, these methods have had a long historical run.
Textbooks are
full of information on them, and there are a lot of standard ODE programs around
that are based on predictor-corrector methods. Many capable researchers have a
lot of experience with predictor-corrector routines, and they see no reason to make
a precipitous change of habit. It is not a bad idea for you to be familiar with the
principles involved, and even with the sorts of bookkeeping details that are the bane
of these methods. Otherwise there will be a big surprise in store when you ï¬rst have
to ï¬x a problem in a predictor-corrector routine.
Let us ï¬rst consider the multistep approach. Think about how integrating an
ODE is different from ï¬nding the integral of a function: For a function, the integrand
has a known dependence on the independent variable x, and can be evaluated at
will. For an ODE, the âintegrandâ is the right-hand side, which depends both on
x and on the dependent variables y. Thus to advance the solution of yâ² = f(x, y)
from xn to x, we have
y(x) = yn +
Z x
xn
f(xâ², y) dxâ²
(16.7.1)
In a single-step method like Runge-Kutta or Bulirsch-Stoer, the value yn+1 at xn+1
depends only on yn. In a multistep method, we approximate f(x, y) by a polynomial
passing through several previous points xn, xnâ1, . . . and possibly also through
xn+1. The result of evaluating the integral (16.7.1) at x = xn+1 is then of the form
yn+1 = yn + h(Î²0yâ²
n+1 + Î²1yâ²
n + Î²2yâ²
nâ1 + Î²3yâ²
nâ2 + Â· Â· Â·)
(16.7.2)
where yâ²
n denotes f(xn, yn), and so on. If Î²0 = 0, the method is explicit; otherwise
it is implicit. The order of the method depends on how many previous steps we
use to get each new value of y.
Consider how we might solve an implicit formula of the form (16.7.2) for yn+1.
Two methods suggest themselves: functional iteration and Newtonâs method. In
functional iteration, we take some initial guess for yn+1, insert it into the right-hand
side of (16.7.2) to get an updated value of yn+1, insert this updated value back into
the right-hand side, and continue iterating. But how are we to get an initial guess for
yn+1? Easy! Just use some explicit formula of the same form as (16.7.2). This is
called the predictor step. In the predictor step we are essentially extrapolating the
polynomial ï¬t to the derivative from the previous points to the new point xn+1 and
then doing the integral (16.7.1) in a Simpson-like manner from xn to xn+1. The
subsequent Simpson-like integration, using the prediction stepâs value of yn+1 to
interpolate the derivative, is called the corrector step. The difference between the
predicted and corrected function values supplies information on the local truncation
error that can be used to control accuracy and to adjust stepsize.
If one corrector step is good, arenât many better? Why not use each corrector
as an improved predictor and iterate to convergence on each step? Answer: Even if
you had a perfect predictor, the step would still be accurate only to the ï¬nite order
of the corrector. This incurable error term is on the same order as that which your
iteration is supposed to cure, so you are at best changing only the coefï¬cient in front

of the error term by a fractional amount. So dubious an improvement is certainly not
worth the effort. Your extra effort would be better spent in taking a smaller stepsize.
As described so far, you might think it desirable or necessary to predict several
intervals ahead at each step, then to use all these intervals, with various weights, in
a Simpson-like corrector step. That is not a good idea. Extrapolation is the least
stable part of the procedure, and it is desirable to minimize its effect. Therefore, the
integration steps of a predictor-corrector method are overlapping, each one involving
several stepsize intervals h, but extending just one such interval farther than the
previous ones. Only that one extended interval is extrapolated by each predictor step.
The most popular predictor-corrector methods are probably the Adams-
Bashforth-Moulton schemes, which have good stability properties.
The Adams-
Bashforth part is the predictor. For example, the third-order case is
predictor:
yn+1 = yn + h
12(23yâ²
n â16yâ²
nâ1 + 5yâ²
nâ2) + O(h4)
(16.7.3)
Here information at the current point xn, together with the two previous points xnâ1
and xnâ2 (assumed equally spaced), is used to predict the value yn+1 at the next
point, xn+1. The Adams-Moulton part is the corrector. The third-order case is
corrector:
yn+1 = yn + h
12(5yâ²
n+1 + 8yâ²
n âyâ²
nâ1) + O(h4)
(16.7.4)
Without the trial value of yn+1 from the predictor step to insert on the right-hand
side, the corrector would be a nasty implicit equation for yn+1.
There are actually three separate processes occurring in a predictor-corrector
method: the predictor step, which we call P, the evaluation of the derivative yâ²
n+1
from the latest value of y, which we call E, and the corrector step, which we call
C. In this notation, iterating m times with the corrector (a practice we inveighed
against earlier) would be written P(EC)m. One also has the choice of ï¬nishing with
a C or an E step.
The lore is that a ï¬nal E is superior, so the strategy usually
recommended is PECE.
Notice that a PC method with a ï¬xed number of iterations (say, one) is an
explicit method! When we ï¬x the number of iterations in advance, then the ï¬nal
value of yn+1 can be writtenas some complicated functionof known quantities. Thus
ï¬xed iteration PC methods lose the strong stability properties of implicit methods
and should only be used for nonstiff problems.
For stiff problems we must use an implicit method if we want to avoid having
tiny stepsizes. (Not all implicit methods are good for stiff problems, but fortunately
some good ones such as the Gear formulas are known.) We then appear to have two
choices for solving the implicit equations: functional iteration to convergence, or
Newton iteration. However, it turns out that for stiff problems functional iteration
will not even converge unless we use tiny stepsizes, no matter how close our
prediction is!
Thus Newton iteration is usually an essential part of a multistep
stiff solver. For convergence, Newtonâs method doesnât particularly care what the
stepsize is, as long as the prediction is accurate enough.
Multistep methods, as we have described them so far, suffer from two serious
difï¬culties when one tries to implement them:
â¢ Since the formulas require results from equally spaced steps, adjusting
the stepsize is difï¬cult.

â¢ Starting and stopping present problems. For starting, we need the initial
values plus several previous steps to prime the pump.
Stopping is a
problem because equal steps are unlikely to land directly on the desired
termination point.
Older implementations of PC methods have various cumbersome ways of
dealing with these problems. For example, they might use Runge-Kutta to start
and stop.
Changing the stepsize requires considerable bookkeeping to do some
kind of interpolation procedure. Fortunately both these drawbacks disappear with
the multivalue approach.
For multivalue methods the basic data available to the integrator are the ï¬rst
few terms of the Taylor series expansion of the solution at the current point xn. The
aim is to advance the solution and obtain the expansion coefï¬cients at the next point
xn+1. This is in contrast to multistep methods, where the data are the values of
the solution at xn, xnâ1, . . .. Weâll illustrate the idea by considering a four-value
method, for which the basic data are

It is also conventional to scale the derivatives with the powers of h = xn+1 âxn
as shown. Note that here we use the vector notation y to denote the solution and
its ï¬rst few derivatives at a point, not the fact that we are solving a system of
equations with many components y.
In terms of the data in (16.7.5), we can approximate the value of the solution
y at some point x:
y(x) = yn + (x âxn)yâ²

yâ²â²

Here r will be a ï¬xed vector of numbers, in the same way that B is a ï¬xed matrix.
We ï¬x Î± by requiring that the differential equation
yâ²
n+1 = f(xn+1, yn+1)
(16.7.10)
be satisï¬ed. The second of the equations in (16.7.9) is
hyâ²
n+1 = hey â²
n+1 + Î±r2

and this will be consistent with (16.7.10) provided
r2 = 1,
Î± = hf(xn+1, yn+1) âhey â²
n+1
(16.7.12)
The values of r1, r3, and r4 are free for the inventor of a given four-value method to
choose. Different choices give different orders of method (i.e., through what order
in h the ï¬nal expression 16.7.9 actually approximates the solution), and different
stability properties.
An interesting result, not obvious from our presentation, is that multivalue and
multistep methods are entirely equivalent. In other words, the value yn+1 given by
a multivalue method with given B and r is exactly the same value given by some
multistep method with given Î²âs in equation (16.7.2). For example, it turns out
that the Adams-Bashforth formula (16.7.3) corresponds to a four-value method with
r1 = 0, r3 = 3/4, and r4 = 1/6. The method is explicit because r1 = 0. The
Adams-Moulton method (16.7.4) corresponds to the implicit four-value method with
r1 = 5/12, r3 = 3/4, and r4 = 1/6. Implicit multivalue methods are solved the
same way as implicit multistep methods: either by a predictor-corrector approach
using an explicit method for the predictor, or by Newton iteration for stiff systems.
Why go to all the trouble of introducing a whole new method that turns out
to be equivalent to a method you already knew?
The reason is that multivalue
methods allow an easy solution to the two difï¬culties we mentioned above in
actually implementing multistep methods.
Consider ï¬rst the question of stepsize adjustment. To change stepsize from h
to hâ² at some point xn, simply multiply the components of yn in (16.7.5) by the
appropriate powers of hâ²/h, and you are ready to continue to xn + hâ².
Multivalue methods also allow a relatively easy change in the order of the
method: Simply change r. The usual strategy for this is ï¬rst to determine the new
stepsize with the current order from the error estimate. Then check what stepsize
would be predicted using an order one greater and one smaller than the current
order. Choose the order that allows you to take the biggest next step. Being able to
change order also allows an easy solution to the starting problem: Simply start with
a ï¬rst-order method and let the order automatically increase to the appropriate level.
For low accuracy requirements, a Runge-Kutta routine like rkqs is almost
always the most efï¬cient choice. For high accuracy, bsstep is both robust and
efï¬cient. For very smooth functions, a variable-order PC method can invoke very
high orders. If the right-hand side of the equation is relatively complicated, so that
the expense of evaluating it outweighs the bookkeeping expense, then the best PC
packages can outperform Bulirsch-Stoer on such problems. As you can imagine,
however, such a variable-stepsize, variable-order method is not trivial to program. If

Two Point Boundary
Value Problems
17.0 Introduction
When ordinarydifferential equations are required to satisfy boundary conditions
at more than one value of the independent variable, the resulting problem is called a
two point boundary value problem. As the terminology indicates, the most common
case by far is where boundary conditions are supposed to be satisï¬ed at two points â
usually the starting and ending values of the integration. However, the phrase âtwo
point boundary value problemâ is also used loosely to include more complicated
cases, e.g., where some conditions are speciï¬ed at endpoints, others at interior
(usually singular) points.
The crucial distinction between initial value problems (Chapter 16) and two
point boundary value problems (this chapter) is that in the former case we are able
to start an acceptable solution at its beginning (initial values) and just march it along
by numerical integration to its end (ï¬nal values); while in the present case, the
boundary conditions at the starting point do not determine a unique solution to start
with â and a ârandomâ choice among the solutions that satisfy these (incomplete)
starting boundary conditions is almost certain not to satisfy the boundary conditions
at the other speciï¬ed point(s).
It should not surprise you that iteration is in general required to meld these
spatially scattered boundary conditionsinto a single global solutionof the differential
equations. For this reason, two point boundary value problems require considerably
more effort to solve than do initial value problems. You have to integrate your dif-
ferential equations over the interval of interest, or perform an analogous ârelaxationâ
procedure (see below), at least several, and sometimes very many, times. Only in
the special case of linear differential equations can you say in advance just how
many such iterations will be required.
The âstandardâ two point boundary value problem has the following form: We
desire the solution to a set of N coupled ï¬rst-order ordinary differential equations,
satisfying n1 boundary conditions at the starting point x1, and a remaining set of
n2 = N ân1 boundary conditions at the ï¬nal point x2. (Recall that all differential
equations of order higher than ï¬rst can be written as coupled sets of ï¬rst-order
equations, cf. Â§16.0.)
The differential equations are

B2k(x2, y1, y2, . . ., yN) = 0

(17.0.3)
There are two distinct classes of numerical methods for solving two point
boundary value problems. In the shooting method (Â§17.1) we choose values for all
of the dependent variables at one boundary. These values must be consistent with
any boundary conditions for that boundary, but otherwise are arranged to depend
on arbitrary free parameters whose values we initially ârandomlyâ guess. We then
integratetheODEsbyinitial valuemethods,arrivingat theotherboundary(and/orany
interior points with boundary conditionsspeciï¬ed). In general, we ï¬nd discrepancies
from the desired boundary values there. Now we have a multidimensional root-
ï¬nding problem, as was treated in Â§9.6 and Â§9.7: Find the adjustment of the free
parameters at the starting point that zeros the discrepancies at the other boundary
point(s). If we liken integrating the differential equations to following the trajectory
of a shot from gun to target, then picking the initial conditions corresponds to aiming
(see Figure 17.0.1). The shooting method provides a systematic approach to taking
a set of ârangingâ shots that allow us to improve our âaimâ systematically.
As another variant of the shooting method (Â§17.2), we can guess unknown free
parameters at bothends of the domain, integrate the equations to a common midpoint,
and seek to adjust the guessed parameters so that the solution joins âsmoothlyâ at
the ï¬tting point.
In all shooting methods, trial solutions satisfy the differential
equations âexactlyâ (or as exactly as we care to make our numerical integration),
but the trial solutions come to satisfy the required boundary conditions only after
the iterations are ï¬nished.
Relaxation methods use a different approach. The differential equations are
replaced by ï¬nite-difference equations on a mesh of points that covers the range of

into close agreement with the true solution.
the integration. A trial solution consists of values for the dependent variables at each
mesh point,not satisfyingthe desired ï¬nite-differenceequations, nor necessarily even
satisfying the required boundary conditions. The iteration, now called relaxation,
consists of adjusting all the values on the mesh so as to bring them into successively
closer agreement with the ï¬nite-difference equations and, simultaneously, with the
boundary conditions (see Figure 17.0.2). For example, if the problem involves three
coupled equations and a mesh of one hundred points, we must guess and improve
three hundred variables representing the solution.
With all this adjustment, you may be surprised that relaxation is ever an efï¬cient
method, but (for the right problems) it really is!
Relaxation works better than
shooting when the boundary conditions are especially delicate or subtle, or where
they involve complicated algebraic relations that cannot easily be solved in closed
form. Relaxation works best when the solution is smooth and not highly oscillatory.
Such oscillations would require many grid points for accurate representation. The
number and positionof required pointsmay not be known a priori. Shootingmethods
are usually preferred in such cases, because their variable stepsize integrations adjust
naturally to a solutionâs peculiarities.
Relaxation methods are often preferred when the ODEs have extraneous
solutions which, while not appearing in the ï¬nal solution satisfying all boundary
conditions, may wreak havoc on the initial value integrations required by shooting.
The typical case is that of trying to maintain a dying exponential in the presence
of growing exponentials.
Good initial guesses are the secret of efï¬cient relaxation methods. Often one
has to solve a problem many times, each time with a slightly different value of some
parameter. In that case, the previous solution is usually a good initial guess when
the parameter is changed, and relaxation will work well.
Until you have enough experience to make your own judgment between the two
methods, you might wish to follow the advice of your authors, who are notorious
computer gunslingers: We always shoot ï¬rst, and only then relax.

Problems Reducible to the Standard Boundary Problem
There are two important problems that can be reduced to the standard boundary
value problem described by equations (17.0.1) â (17.0.3). The ï¬rst is the eigenvalue
problem for differential equations.
Here the right-hand side of the system of
differential equations depends on a parameter Î»,
dyi(x)
dx
= gi(x, y1, . . ., yN, Î»)
(17.0.4)
and one has to satisfy N + 1 boundary conditions instead of just N. The problem
is overdetermined and in general there is no solution for arbitrary values of Î». For
certain special values of Î», the eigenvalues, equation (17.0.4) does have a solution.
We reduce this problem to the standard case by introducing a new dependent
variable
yN+1 â¡Î»
(17.0.5)
and another differential equation
dyN+1
dx
= 0
(17.0.6)
An example of this trick is given in Â§17.4.
The other case that can be put in the standard form is a free boundary problem.
Here only one boundary abscissa x1 is speciï¬ed, while the other boundary x2 is to
be determined so that the system (17.0.1) has a solution satisfying a total of N + 1
boundary conditions. Here we again add an extra constant dependent variable:
yN+1 â¡x2 âx1
(17.0.7)
dyN+1
dx
= 0
(17.0.8)
We also deï¬ne a new independent variable t by setting
x âx1 â¡t yN+1,
0 â¤t â¤1
(17.0.9)
The system of N + 1 differential equations for dyi/dt is now in the standard form,

17.1 The Shooting Method
In this section we discuss âpureâ shooting, where the integration proceeds from
x1 to x2, and we try to match boundary conditions at the end of the integration. In
the next section, we describe shooting to an intermediate ï¬tting point, where the
solution to the equations and boundary conditions is found by launching âshotsâ
from both sides of the interval and trying to match continuity conditions at some
intermediate point.
Our implementation of the shooting method exactly implements multidimen-
sional, globally convergent Newton-Raphson (Â§9.7). It seeks to zero n2 functions
of n2 variables. The functions are obtained by integrating N differential equations
from x1 to x2. Let us see how this works:
At the starting point x1 there are N starting values yi to be speciï¬ed, but
subject to n1 conditions. Therefore there are n2 = N ân1 freely speciï¬able starting
values. Let us imagine that these freely speciï¬able values are the components of a
vector V that lives in a vector space of dimension n2. Then you, the user, knowing
the functional form of the boundary conditions (17.0.2), can write a function that
generates a complete set of N starting values y, satisfying the boundary conditions
at x1, from an arbitrary vector value of V in which there are no restrictions on the n2
component values. In other words, (17.0.2) converts to a prescription
yi(x1) = yi(x1; V1, . . ., Vn2)
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.1.1)
Below, the function that implements (17.1.1) will be called load.
Notice that the components of V might be exactly the values of certain âfreeâ
components of y, with the other components of y determined by the boundary
conditions. Alternatively, the components of V might parametrize the solutions that
satisfy the starting boundary conditions in some other convenient way. Boundary
conditions often impose algebraic relations among the yi, rather than speciï¬c values
for each of them. Using some auxiliary set of parameters often makes it easier to
âsolveâ the boundary relations for a consistent set of yiâs. It makes no difference
which way you go, as long as your vector space of Vâs generates (through 17.1.1)
all allowed starting vectors y.
Given a particular V, a particular y(x1) is thus generated. It can then be turned
into a y(x2) by integrating the ODEs to x2 as an initial value problem (e.g., using
Chapter 16âs odeint). Now, at x2, let us deï¬ne a discrepancy vector F, also of
dimension n2, whose components measure how far we are from satisfying the n2
boundary conditions at x2 (17.0.3). Simplest of all is just to use the right-hand
sides of (17.0.3),
Fk = B2k(x2, y)
k = 1, . . ., n2
(17.1.2)
As in the case of V, however, you can use any other convenient parametrization,
as long as your space of Fâs spans the space of possible discrepancies from the
desired boundary conditions, with all components of F equal to zero if and only if
the boundary conditions at x2 are satisï¬ed. Below, you will be asked to supply a
user-written function score which uses (17.0.3) to convert an N-vector of ending
values y(x2) into an n2-vector of discrepancies F.

Now, as far as Newton-Raphson is concerned, we are nearly in business. We
want to ï¬nd a vector value of V that zeros the vector value of F.
We do this
by invoking the globally convergent Newtonâs method implemented in the routine
newt of Â§9.7. Recall that the heart of Newtonâs method involves solving the set
of n2 linear equations
J Â· Î´V = âF
(17.1.3)
and then adding the correction back,
Vnew = Vold + Î´V
(17.1.4)
In (17.1.3), the Jacobian matrix J has components given by
Jij = âFi
âVj
(17.1.5)
It is not feasible to compute these partial derivatives analytically.
Rather, each
requires a separate integration of the N ODEs, followed by the evaluation of
âFi
âVj
âFi(V1, . . ., Vj + âVj, . . .) âFi(V1, . . ., Vj, . . .)
âVj
(17.1.6)
This is done automatically for you in the routine fdjac that comes with newt. The
only input to newt that you have to provide is the routine vecfunc that calculates
F by integrating the ODEs. Here is the appropriate routine, called shoot, that is
to be passed as the actual argument in newt:
#include "nrutil.h"
#define EPS 1.0e-6
extern int nvar;
Variables that you must deï¬ne and set in your main pro-
gram.
extern float x1,x2;
int kmax,kount;
Communicates with odeint.
float *xp,**yp,dxsav;
void shoot(int n, float v[], float f[])
Routine for use with newt to solve a two point boundary value problem for nvar coupled ODEs
by shooting from x1 to x2. Initial values for the nvar ODEs at x1 are generated from the n2
input coeï¬cients v[1..n2], using the user-supplied routine load. The routine integrates the
ODEs to x2 using the Runge-Kutta method with tolerance EPS, initial stepsize h1, and minimum
stepsize hmin. At x2 it calls the user-supplied routine score to evaluate the n2 functions
f[1..n2] that ought to be zero to satisfy the boundary conditions at x2. The functions f
are returned on output. newt uses a globally convergent Newtonâs method to adjust the values
of v until the functions f are zero. The user-supplied routine derivs(x,y,dydx) supplies
derivative information to the ODE integrator (see Chapter 16). The ï¬rst set of global variables
above receives its values from the main program so that shoot can have the syntax required
for it to be the argument vecfunc of newt.

}
For some problems the initial stepsize âV might depend sensitively upon the
initial conditions. It is straightforward to alter load to include a suggested stepsize
h1 as another output variable and feed it to fdjac via a global variable.
A complete cycle of the shooting method thus requires n2 + 1 integrations of
the N coupled ODEs: one integration to evaluate the current degree of mismatch,
and n2 for the partial derivatives. Each new cycle requires a new round of n2 + 1
integrations. This illustrates the enormous extra effort involved in solving two point
boundary value problems compared with intial value problems.
If the differential equations are linear, then only one complete cycle is required,
since (17.1.3)â(17.1.4) should take us right to the solution. A second round can be
useful, however, in mopping up some (never all) of the roundoff error.
As given here, shoot uses the quality controlled Runge-Kutta method of Â§16.2
to integrate the ODEs, but any of the other methods of Chapter 16 could just as
well be used.
You, the user, must supply shoot with: (i) a function load(x1,v,y) which
calculates the n-vector y[1..n] (satisfying the starting boundary conditions, of
course), given the freely speciï¬able variables of v[1..n2] at the initial point x1;
(ii) a function score(x2,y,f) which calculates the discrepancy vector f[1..n2]
of the ending boundary conditions, given the vector y[1..n] at the endpoint x2;
(iii) a starting vector v[1..n2]; (iv) a function derivs for the ODE integration; and
other obvious parameters as described in the header comment above.
In Â§17.4 we give a sample program illustrating how to use shoot.

17.2 Shooting to a Fitting Point
The shooting method described in Â§17.1 tacitly assumed that the âshotsâ would
be able to traverse the entire domain of integration, even at the early stages of
convergence to a correct solution. In some problems it can happen that, for very
wrong starting conditions, an initial solution canât even get from x1 to x2 without
encountering some incalculable, or catastrophic, result. For example, the argument
of a square root might go negative, causing the numerical code to crash. Simple
shooting would be stymied.
A different, but related, case is where the endpoints are both singular points
of the set of ODEs. One frequently needs to use special methods to integrate near
the singular points, analytic asymptotic expansions, for example. In such cases it is
feasible to integrate in the direction away from a singular point, using the special
method to get through the ï¬rst little bit and then reading off âinitialâ values for
further numerical integration. However it is usually not feasible to integrate into
a singular point, if only because one has not usually expended the same analytic
effort to obtain expansions of âwrongâ solutions near the singular point (those not
satisfying the desired boundary condition).
The solution to the above mentioned difï¬culties is shooting to a ï¬tting point.
Instead of integrating from x1 to x2, we integrate ï¬rst from x1 to some point xf that
is between x1 and x2; and second from x2 (in the opposite direction) to xf.
If (as before) the number of boundary conditions imposed at x1 is n1, and the
number imposed at x2 is n2, then there are n2 freely speciï¬able starting values at
x1 and n1 freely speciï¬able starting values at x2. (If you are confused by this, go
back to Â§17.1.) We can therefore deï¬ne an n2-vector V(1) of starting parameters
at x1, and a prescription load1(x1,v1,y) for mapping V(1) into a y that satisï¬es
the boundary conditions at x1,
yi(x1) = yi(x1; V(1)1, . . ., V(1)n2)
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.1)
Likewise we can deï¬ne an n1-vector V(2) of starting parameters at x2, and a
prescription load2(x2,v2,y) for mapping V(2) into a y that satisï¬es the boundary
conditions at x2,
yi(x2) = yi(x2; V(2)1, . . ., V(2)n1)
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.2)
We thus have a total of N freely adjustable parameters in the combination of
V(1) and V(2). The N conditions that must be satisï¬ed are that there be agreement
in N components of y at xf between the values obtained integrating from one side
and from the other,
yi(xf; V(1)) = yi(xf; V(2))
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.3)
In some problems, the N matching conditions can be better described (physically,
mathematically, or numerically) by using N different functionsFi, i = 1 . . .N, each
possibly depending on the N components yi. In those cases, (17.2.3) is replaced by
Fi[y(xf; V(1))] = Fi[y(xf; V(2))]
i = 1, . . ., N

The shooting method described in Â§17.1 tacitly assumed that the âshotsâ would

The solution to the above mentioned difï¬culties is shooting to a ï¬tting point.
Instead of integrating from x1 to x2, we integrate ï¬rst from x1 to some point xf that
is between x1 and x2; and second from x2 (in the opposite direction) to xf.
If (as before) the number of boundary conditions imposed at x1 is n1, and the
number imposed at x2 is n2, then there are n2 freely speciï¬able starting values at
x1 and n1 freely speciï¬able starting values at x2. (If you are confused by this, go
back to Â§17.1.) We can therefore deï¬ne an n2-vector V(1) of starting parameters
at x1, and a prescription load1(x1,v1,y) for mapping V(1) into a y that satisï¬es
the boundary conditions at x1,
yi(x1) = yi(x1; V(1)1, . . ., V(1)n2)
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.1)
Likewise we can deï¬ne an n1-vector V(2) of starting parameters at x2, and a
prescription load2(x2,v2,y) for mapping V(2) into a y that satisï¬es the boundary
conditions at x2,
yi(x2) = yi(x2; V(2)1, . . ., V(2)n1)
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.2)
We thus have a total of N freely adjustable parameters in the combination of
V(1) and V(2). The N conditions that must be satisï¬ed are that there be agreement
in N components of y at xf between the values obtained integrating from one side
and from the other,
yi(xf; V(1)) = yi(xf; V(2))
i = 1, . . ., N
(17.2.3)
In some problems, the N matching conditions can be better described (physically,
mathematically, or numerically) by using N different functionsFi, i = 1 . . .N, each
possibly depending on the N components yi. In those cases, (17.2.3) is replaced by
Fi[y(xf; V(1))] = Fi[y(xf; V(2))]
i = 1, . . ., N

In the program below, the user-supplied function score(xf,y,f) is supposed
to map an input N-vector y into an output N-vector F. In most cases, you can
dummy this function as the identity mapping.
Shooting to a ï¬tting point uses globally convergent Newton-Raphson exactly
as in Â§17.1. Comparing closely with the routine shoot of the previous section, you
should have no difï¬culty in understanding the following routine shootf. The main
differences in use are that you have to supply both load1 and load2. Also, in the
calling program you must supply initial guesses for v1[1..n2] and v2[1..n1].
Once again a sample program illustratingshooting to a ï¬tting point is given in Â§17.4.

load1 (load2). The coeï¬cients v1 and v2 should be stored in a single array v[1..n1+n2]
in the main program by statements of the form v1=v; and v2 = &v[n2];. The input param-
eter n = n1 + n2 = nvar. The routine integrates the ODEs to xf using the Runge-Kutta

17.3 Relaxation Methods
In relaxation methods we replace ODEs by approximate ï¬nite-difference equations
(FDEs) on a grid or mesh of points that spans the domain of interest. As a typical example,
we could replace a general ï¬rst-order differential equation
dy
dx = g(x, y)
(17.3.1)
with an algebraic equation relating function values at two points k, k â1:
yk âykâ1 â(xk âxkâ1) g
 1
2(xk + xkâ1), 1
2(yk + ykâ1)

= 0
(17.3.2)
The form of the FDE in (17.3.2) illustrates the idea, but not uniquely: There are many
ways to turn the ODE into an FDE. When the problem involves N coupled ï¬rst-order ODEs
represented by FDEs on a mesh of M points, a solution consists of values for N dependent
functions given at each of the M mesh points, or N Ã M variables in all. The relaxation
method determines the solution by starting with a guess and improving it, iteratively. As the
iterations improve the solution, the result is said to relax to the true solution.
While several iteration schemes are possible, for most problems our old standby, multi-
dimensional Newtonâs method, works well. The method produces a matrix equation that
must be solved, but the matrix takes a special, âblock diagonalâ form, that allows it to be
inverted far more economically both in time and storage than would be possible for a general
matrix of size (MN) Ã (MN). Since MN can easily be several thousand, this is crucial
for the feasibility of the method.

More points can be coupled, but then the method becomes more complex.
We will provide enough background so that you can write a more general scheme if you
have the patience to do so.

dependent variables y1, y2, . . . , yN at point xk. At an arbitrary point k in the middle of the
mesh, we approximate the set of N ï¬rst-order ODEs by algebraic relations of the form
0 = Ek â¡yk âykâ1 â(xk âxkâ1)gk(xk, xkâ1, yk, ykâ1),
k = 2, 3, . . . , M (17.3.3)
The notation signiï¬es that gk can be evaluated using information from both points k, k â1.
The FDEs labeled by Ek provide N equations coupling 2N variables at points k, k â1.
There are M â1 points, k = 2, 3, . . . , M, at which difference equations of the form (17.3.3)
apply. Thus the FDEs provide a total of (M â1)N equations for the MN unknowns. The
remaining N equations come from the boundary conditions.
At the ï¬rst boundary we have
0 = E1 â¡B(x1, y1)
(17.3.4)
while at the second boundary
0 = EM+1 â¡C(xM, yM)
(17.3.5)
The vectors E1 and B have only n1 nonzero components, corresponding to the n1 boundary
conditions at x1. It will turn out to be useful to take these nonzero components to be the
last n1 components. In other words, Ej,1 Ì¸= 0 only for j = n2 + 1, n2 + 2, . . . , N. At
the other boundary, only the ï¬rst n2 components of EM+1 and C are nonzero: Ej,M+1 Ì¸= 0
only for j = 1, 2, . . . , n2.
The âsolutionâ of the FDE problem in (17.3.3)â(17.3.5) consists of a set of variables
yj,k, the values of the N variables yj at the M points xk.
The algorithm we describe
below requires an initial guess for the yj,k. We then determine increments âyj,k such that
yj,k + âyj,k is an improved approximation to the solution.
Equations for the increments are developed by expanding the FDEs in ï¬rst-order Taylor
series with respect to small changes âyk. At an interior point, k = 2, 3, . . . , M this gives:
Ek(yk + âyk, ykâ1 + âykâ1) âEk(yk, ykâ1)
+

âyn,kâ1
âyn,kâ1 +
N
X
n=1
âEk
âyn,k
âyn,k
(17.3.6)
For a solution we want the updated value E(y+ ây) to be zero, so the general set of equations
at an interior point can be written in matrix form as
N
X
n=1
Sj,nâyn,kâ1 +
2N
X
n=N+1
Sj,nâynâN,k = âEj,k,
j = 1, 2, . . . , N
(17.3.7)
where
Sj,n =
âEj,k
âyn,kâ1 ,
Sj,n+N = âEj,k
âyn,k ,
n = 1, 2, . . . , N
(17.3.8)
The quantity Sj,n is an N Ã 2N matrix at each point k. Each interior point thus supplies a
block of N equations coupling 2N corrections to the solution variables at the points k, k â1.
Similarly, the algebraic relations at the boundaries can be expanded in a ï¬rst-order
Taylor series for increments that improve the solution. Since E1 depends only on y1, we
ï¬nd at the ï¬rst boundary:
N
X
n=1
Sj,nâyn,1 = âEj,1,
j = n2 + 1, n2 + 2, . . . , N
(17.3.9)
where
Sj,n = âEj,1
âyn,1 ,
n = 1, 2, . . . , N
(17.3.10)
At the second boundary,
N
X
n=1
Sj,nâyn,M = âEj,M+1,
j = 1, 2, . . . , n2

âyn,M
,
n = 1, 2, . . . , N
(17.3.12)
We thus have in equations (17.3.7)â(17.3.12) a set of linear equations to be solved for
the corrections ây, iterating until the corrections are sufï¬ciently small. The equations have
a special structure, because each Sj,n couples only points k, k â1. Figure 17.3.1 illustrates
the typical structure of the complete matrix equation for the case of 5 variables and 4 mesh
points, with 3 boundary conditions at the ï¬rst boundary and 2 at the second. The 3 Ã 5
block of nonzero entries in the top left-hand corner of the matrix comes from the boundary
condition Sj,n at point k = 1. The next three 5 Ã 10 blocks are the Sj,n at the interior
points, coupling variables at mesh points (2,1), (3,2), and (4,3). Finally we have the block
corresponding to the second boundary condition.
We can solve equations (17.3.7)â(17.3.12) for the increments ây using a form of
Gaussian elimination that exploits the special structure of the matrix to minimize the total
number of operations, and that minimizes storage of matrix coefï¬cients by packing the
elements in a special blocked structure. (You might wish to review Chapter 2, especially
Â§2.2, if you are unfamiliar with the steps involved in Gaussian elimination.)
Recall that
Gaussian elimination consists of manipulating the equations by elementary operations such
as dividing rows of coefï¬cients by a common factor to produce unity in diagonal elements,
and adding appropriate multiples of other rows to produce zeros below the diagonal. Here
we take advantage of the block structure by performing a bit more reduction than in pure
Gaussian elimination, so that the storage of coefï¬cients is minimized. Figure 17.3.2 shows
the form that we wish to achieve by elimination, just prior to the backsubstitution step. Only a
small subset of the reduced MN Ã MN matrix elements needs to be stored as the elimination
progresses. Once the matrix elements reach the stage in Figure 17.3.2, the solution follows
quickly by a backsubstitution procedure.
Furthermore, the entire procedure, except the backsubstitution step, operates only on
one block of the matrix at a time.
The procedure contains four types of operations: (1)
partial reduction to zero of certain elements of a block using results from a previous step,
(2) elimination of the square structure of the remaining block elements such that the square
section contains unity along the diagonal, and zero in off-diagonal elements, (3) storage of the
remaining nonzero coefï¬cients for use in later steps, and (4) backsubstitution. We illustrate
the steps schematically by ï¬gures.
Considerthe block ofequationsdescribingcorrections availablefrom the initialboundary
conditions. We have n1 equations for N unknown corrections. We wish to transform the ï¬rst
block so that its left-hand n1 Ã n1 square section becomes unity along the diagonal, and zero
in off-diagonal elements. Figure 17.3.3 shows the original and ï¬nal form of the ï¬rst block
of the matrix. In the ï¬gure we designate matrix elements that are subject to diagonalization
by âDâ, and elements that will be altered by âAâ; in the ï¬nal block, elements that are stored
are labeled by âSâ. We get from start to ï¬nish by selecting in turn n1 âpivotâ elements from
among the ï¬rst n1 columns, normalizing the pivot row so that the value of the âpivotâ element
is unity, and adding appropriate multiples of this row to the remaining rows so that they
contain zeros in the pivot column. In its ï¬nal form, the reduced block expresses values for the
corrections to the ï¬rst n1 variables at mesh point 1 in terms of values for the remaining n2
unknown corrections at point 1, i.e., we now know what the ï¬rst n1 elements are in terms of
the remaining n2 elements. We store only the ï¬nal set of n2 nonzero columns from the initial
block, plus the column for the altered right-hand side of the matrix equation.
We must emphasize here an important detail of the method. To exploit the reduced
storage allowed by operating on blocks, it is essential that the ordering of columns in the
s matrix of derivatives be such that pivot elements can be found among the ï¬rst n1 rows
of the matrix. This means that the n1 boundary conditions at the ï¬rst point must contain
some dependence on the ï¬rst j=1,2,...,n1 dependent variables, y[j][1]. If not, then the
original square n1 Ã n1 subsection of the ï¬rst block will appear to be singular, and the method
will fail. Alternatively, we would have to allow the search for pivot elements to involve all
N columns of the block, and this would require column swapping and far more bookkeeping.
The code provides a simple method of reordering the variables, i.e., the columns of the s
matrix, so that this can be done easily. End of important detail.

Next consider the block of N equations representing the FDEs that describe the relation
between the 2N corrections at points 2 and 1. The elements of that block, together with results
from the previous step, are illustrated in Figure 17.3.4. Note that by adding suitable multiples
of rows from the ï¬rst block we can reduce to zero the ï¬rst n1 columns of the block (labeled
by âZâ), and, to do so, we will need to alter only the columns from n1 + 1 to N and the
vector element on the right-hand side. Of the remaining columns we can diagonalize a square
subsection of N Ã N elements, labeled by âDâ in the ï¬gure. In the process we alter the ï¬nal
set of n2 + 1 columns, denoted âAâ in the ï¬gure. The second half of the ï¬gure shows the
block when we ï¬nish operating on it, with the stored (n2 + 1) Ã N elements labeled by âS.â
If we operate on the next setof equations correspondingto the FDEs coupling corrections
at points 3 and 2, we see that the state of available results and new equationsexactly reproduces
the situation described in the previous paragraph. Thus, we can carry out those steps again
for each block in turn through block M. Finally on block M + 1 we encounter the remaining
boundary conditions.
Figure 17.3.5 shows the ï¬nal block of n2 FDEs relating the N corrections for variables
at mesh point M, together with the result of reducing the previous block. Again, we can ï¬rst
use the prior results to zero the ï¬rst n1 columns of the block. Now, when we diagonalize
the remaining square section, we strike gold: We get values for the ï¬nal n2 corrections
at mesh point M.
With the ï¬nal block reduced, the matrix has the desired form shown previously in
Figure 17.3.2, and the matrix is ripe for backsubstitution. Starting with the bottom row and
working up towards the top, at each stage we can simply determine one unknown correction
in terms of known quantities.
The function solvde organizes the steps described above. The principal procedures
used in the algorithm are performed by functions called internally by solvde. The function
red eliminates leading columns of the s matrix using results from prior blocks.
pinvs
diagonalizes the square subsection of s and stores unreduced coefï¬cients. bksub carries
out the backsubstitution step. The user of solvde must understand the calling arguments,
as described below, and supply a function difeq, called by solvde, that evaluates the s
matrix for each block.
Most of the arguments in the call to solvde have already been described, but some
require discussion. Array y[j][k] contains the initial guess for the solution, with j labeling
the dependent variables at mesh points k. The problem involves ne FDEs spanning points
k=1,..., m. nb boundary conditions apply at the ï¬rst point k=1. The array indexv[j]
establishesthe correspondencebetween columns of the s matrix, equations(17.3.8), (17.3.10),
and (17.3.12), and the dependent variables. As described above it is essential that the nb
boundary conditions at k=1 involve the dependentvariables referenced by the ï¬rst nb columns
of the s matrix. Thus, columns j of the s matrix can be ordered by the user in difeq to refer
to derivatives with respect to the dependent variable indexv[j].
The function only attempts itmax correction cycles before returning, even if the solution
has not converged. The parameters conv, slowc, scalv relate to convergence. Each
inversion of the matrix produces corrections for ne variables at m mesh points. We want these
to become vanishingly small as the iterations proceed, but we must deï¬ne a measure for the
size of corrections. This error ânormâ is very problem speciï¬c, so the user might wish to
rewrite this section of the code as appropriate. In the program below we compute a value for
the average correction err by summing the absolute value of all corrections, weighted by a
scale factor appropriate to each type of variable:
err =
1
m Ã ne
m
X
k=1
ne
X
j=1
|âY [j][k]|
scalv[j]
(17.3.13)
When errâ¤conv, the method has converged. Note that the user gets to supply an array
scalv which measures the typical size of each variable.
Obviously, if err is large, we are far from a solution, and perhaps it is a bad idea
to believe that the corrections generated from a ï¬rst-order Taylor series are accurate. The
number slowc modulates application of corrections. After each iteration we apply only a

fraction of the corrections found by matrix inversion:
Y [j][k] âY [j][k] +
slowc
max(slowc,err)âY [j][k]
(17.3.14)
Thus, when err>slowc only a fraction of the corrections are used, but when errâ¤slowc
the entire correction gets applied.
The call statement also supplies solvde with the array y[1..nyj][1..nyk] con-
taining the initial trial solution, and workspace arrays c[1..ne][1..ne-nb+1][1..m+1],
s[1..ne][1..2*ne+1]. The array c is the blockbuster: It stores the unreduced elements
of the matrix built up for the backsubstitution step. If there are m mesh points, then there
will be m+1 blocks, each requiring ne rows and ne-nb+1 columns. Although large, this
is small compared with (neÃm)2 elements required for the whole matrix if we did not
break it into blocks.
We now describe the workings of the user-supplied function difeq. The synopsis of
the function is
void difeq(int k, int k1, int k2, int jsf, int is1, int isf,
int indexv[], int ne, float **s, float **y);
The only information passed from difeq to solvde is the matrix of derivatives
s[1..ne][1..2*ne+1]; all other arguments are input to difeq and should not be altered.
k indicates the current mesh point, or block number. k1,k2 label the ï¬rst and last point in
the mesh. If k=k1 or k>k2, the block involves the boundary conditions at the ï¬rst or ï¬nal
points; otherwise the block acts on FDEs coupling variables at points k-1, k.
The convention on storing information into the array s[i][j] follows that used in
equations (17.3.8), (17.3.10), and (17.3.12): Rows i label equations, columns j refer to
derivatives with respect to dependent variables in the solution. Recall that each equation will
depend on the ne dependent variables at either one or two points. Thus, j runs from 1 to
either ne or 2*ne. The column ordering for dependent variables at each point must agree
with the list supplied in indexv[j]. Thus, for a block not at a boundary, the ï¬rst column
multiplies âY (l=indexv[1],k-1), and the column ne+1 multiplies âY (l=indexv[1],k).
is1,isf give the numbers of the starting and ï¬nal rows that need to be ï¬lled in the s matrix
for this block. jsf labels the column in which the difference equations Ej,k of equations
(17.3.3)â(17.3.5) are stored. Thus, âs[i][jsf] is the vector on the right-hand side of the
matrix. The reason for the minus sign is that difeq supplies the actual difference equation,
Ej,k, not its negative. Note that solvde supplies a value for jsf such that the difference
equation is put in the column just after all derivatives in the s matrix. Thus, difeq expects to
ï¬nd values entered into s[i][j] for rows is1 â¤i â¤isf and 1 â¤j â¤jsf.
Finally, s[1..nsi][1..nsj] and y[1..nyj][1..nyk] supply difeq with storage
for s and the solution variables y for this iteration. An example of how to use this routine
is given in the next section.
Many ideas in the following code are due to Eggleton [1].
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "nrutil.h"
void solvde(int itmax, float conv, float slowc, float scalv[], int indexv[],
int ne, int nb, int m, float **y, float ***c, float **s)
Driver routine for solution of two point boundary value problems by relaxation. itmax is the
maximum number of iterations. conv is the convergence criterion (see text). slowc controls
the fraction of corrections actually used after each iteration. scalv[1..ne] contains typical
sizes for each dependent variable, used to weight errors. indexv[1..ne] lists the column
ordering of variables used to construct the matrix s[1..ne][1..2*ne+1] of derivatives. (The
nb boundary conditions at the ï¬rst mesh point must contain some dependence on the ï¬rst nb
variables listed in indexv.) The problem involves ne equations for ne adjustable dependent
variables at each point. At the ï¬rst mesh point there are nb boundary conditions. There are a
total of m mesh points. y[1..ne][1..m] is the two-dimensional array that contains the initial
guess for all the dependent variables at each mesh point. On each iteration, it is updated by the

âAlgebraically Difï¬cultâ Sets of Differential Equations
Relaxation methods allow you to take advantage of an additional opportunity that, while
not obvious, can speed up some calculations enormously. It is not necessary that the set
of variables yj,k correspond exactly with the dependent variables of the original differential
equations. They can be related to those variables through algebraic equations. Obviously, it
is necessary only that the solution variables allow us to evaluate the functions y, g, B, C that
are used to construct the FDEs from the ODEs. In some problems g depends on functions of
y that are known only implicitly, so that iterative solutions are necessary to evaluate functions
in the ODEs. Often one can dispense with this âinternalâ nonlinear problem by deï¬ning
a new set of variables from which both y, g and the boundary conditions can be obtained
directly. A typical example occurs in physical problems where the equations require solution
of a complex equation of state that can be expressed in more convenient terms using variables
other than the original dependent variables in the ODE. While this approach is analogous to
performing an analytic change of variables directly on the original ODEs, such an analytic
transformation might be prohibitively complicated. The change of variables in the relaxation
method is easy and requires no analytic manipulations.

17.4 A Worked Example: Spheroidal Harmonics
The best way to understand the algorithms of the previous sections is to see
them employed to solve an actual problem. As a sample problem, we have selected
the computation of spheroidal harmonics. (The more common name is spheroidal
angle functions, but we prefer the explicit reminder of the kinship with spherical
harmonics.) We will show how to ï¬nd spheroidal harmonics, ï¬rst by the method
of relaxation (Â§17.3), and then by the methods of shooting (Â§17.1) and shooting
to a ï¬tting point (Â§17.2).

âAlgebraically Difï¬cultâ Sets of Differential Equations
Relaxation methods allow you to take advantage of an additional opportunity that, while
not obvious, can speed up some calculations enormously. It is not necessary that the set
of variables yj,k correspond exactly with the dependent variables of the original differential
equations. They can be related to those variables through algebraic equations. Obviously, it
is necessary only that the solution variables allow us to evaluate the functions y, g, B, C that
are used to construct the FDEs from the ODEs. In some problems g depends on functions of
y that are known only implicitly, so that iterative solutions are necessary to evaluate functions
in the ODEs. Often one can dispense with this âinternalâ nonlinear problem by deï¬ning
a new set of variables from which both y, g and the boundary conditions can be obtained
directly. A typical example occurs in physical problems where the equations require solution
of a complex equation of state that can be expressed in more convenient terms using variables
other than the original dependent variables in the ODE. While this approach is analogous to
performing an analytic change of variables directly on the original ODEs, such an analytic
transformation might be prohibitively complicated. The change of variables in the relaxation
method is easy and requires no analytic manipulations.

17.4 A Worked Example: Spheroidal Harmonics
The best way to understand the algorithms of the previous sections is to see
them employed to solve an actual problem. As a sample problem, we have selected
the computation of spheroidal harmonics. (The more common name is spheroidal
angle functions, but we prefer the explicit reminder of the kinship with spherical
harmonics.) We will show how to ï¬nd spheroidal harmonics, ï¬rst by the method
of relaxation (Â§17.3), and then by the methods of shooting (Â§17.1) and shooting
to a ï¬tting point (Â§17.2).
Spheroidal
harmonics

arise
when
certain
partial
differential
equations are solved by separation of variables in spheroidal coordinates.

Here m is an integer, c is the âoblateness parameter,â and Î» is the eigenvalue. Despite
the notation, c2 can be positive or negative. For c2 > 0 the functions are called
âprolate,â while if c2 < 0 they are called âoblate.â The equation has singular points
at x = Â±1 and is to be solved subject to the boundary conditions that the solution be
regular at x = Â±1. Only for certain values of Î», the eigenvalues, will this be possible.
If we consider ï¬rst the spherical case, where c = 0, we recognize the differential
equation for Legendre functions P m
n (x). In this case the eigenvalues are Î»mn =
n(n + 1), n = m, m + 1, . . ..
The integer n labels successive eigenvalues for
ï¬xed m: When n = m we have the lowest eigenvalue, and the corresponding
eigenfunction has no nodes in the interval â1 < x < 1; when n = m + 1 we have
the next eigenvalue, and the eigenfunction has one node inside (â1, 1); and so on.
A similar situation holds for the general case c2 Ì¸= 0. We write the eigenvalues
of (17.4.1) as Î»mn(c) and the eigenfunctions as Smn(x; c).
For ï¬xed m, n =
m, m + 1, . . . labels the successive eigenvalues.
The computation of Î»mn(c) and Smn(x; c) traditionallyhas been quite difï¬cult.
Complicated recurrence relations, power series expansions, etc., can be found
in references [1-3].
Cheap computing makes evaluation by direct solution of the
differential equation quite feasible.
The ï¬rst step is to investigate the behavior of the solution near the singular
points x = Â±1. Substituting a power series expansion of the form
S = (1 Â± x)Î±
â
X
k=0
ak(1 Â± x)k
(17.4.2)
in equation (17.4.1), we ï¬nd that the regular solution has Î± = m/2. (Without loss
of generality we can take m â¥0 since m ââm is a symmetry of the equation.)
We get an equation that is numerically more tractable if we factor out this behavior.
Accordingly we set
S = (1 âx2)m/2y
(17.4.3)
We then ï¬nd from (17.4.1) that y satisï¬es the equation
(1 âx2)d2y
dx2 â2(m + 1)x dy
dx + (Âµ âc2x2)y = 0
(17.4.4)
where
Âµ â¡Î» âm(m + 1)
(17.4.5)
Both equations (17.4.1) and (17.4.4) are invariant under the replacement
x ââx. Thus the functions S and y must also be invariant, except possibly for an
overall scale factor. (Since the equations are linear, a constant multiple of a solution
is also a solution.) Because the solutions will be normalized, the scale factor can
only be Â±1. If nâm is odd, there are an odd number of zeros in the interval (â1, 1).
Thus we must choose the antisymmetric solution y(âx) = ây(x) which has a zero
at x = 0. Conversely, if n âm is even we must have the symmetric solution. Thus
ymn(âx) = (â1)nâmymn(x)

and similarly for Smn.
The boundary conditions on (17.4.4) require that y be regular at x = Â±1. In
other words, near the endpoints the solution takes the form
y = a0 + a1(1 âx2) + a2(1 âx2)2 + . . .
(17.4.7)
Substituting this expansion in equation (17.4.4) and letting x â1, we ï¬nd that
a1 = âÂµ âc2
4(m + 1)a0
(17.4.8)
Equivalently,
yâ²(1) =
Âµ âc2
2(m + 1)y(1)
(17.4.9)
A similar equation holds at x = â1 with a minus sign on the right-hand side.
The irregular solution has a different relation between function and derivative at
the endpoints.
Instead of integrating the equation from â1 to 1, we can exploit the symmetry
(17.4.6) to integrate from 0 to 1. The boundary condition at x = 0 is
y(0) = 0,
n âm odd
yâ²(0) = 0,
n âm even
(17.4.10)
A third boundary condition comes from the fact that any constant multiple
of a solution y is a solution. We can thus normalize the solution. We adopt the
normalization that the function Smn has the same limiting behavior as P m
n at x = 1:
lim
xâ1(1 âx2)âm/2Smn(x; c) = lim
xâ1(1 âx2)âm/2P m
n (x)
(17.4.11)
Various normalization conventions in the literature are tabulated by Flammer [1].
Imposing three boundary conditions for the second-order equation (17.4.4)
turns it into an eigenvalue problem for Î» or equivalently for Âµ. We write it in the
standard form by setting
y1 = y
(17.4.12)
y2 = yâ²

y3 = Âµ

The boundary condition at x = 0 in this notation is
y1 = 0,
n âm odd
y2 = 0,
n âm even
(17.4.18)
At x = 1 we have two conditions:

(17.4.20)
We are now ready to illustrate the use of the methods of previous sections
on this problem.
Relaxation
If we just want a few isolated values of Î» or S, shooting is probably the quickest
method. However, if we want values for a large sequence of values of c, relaxation
is better. Relaxation rewards a good initial guess with rapid convergence, and the
previous solution should be a good initial guess if c is changed only slightly.
For simplicity, we choose a uniform grid on the interval 0 â¤x â¤1. For a
total of M mesh points, we have
h =
1
M â1
(17.4.21)
xk = (k â1)h,
k = 1, 2, . . ., M
(17.4.22)
At interior points k = 2, 3, . . ., M, equation (17.4.15) gives
E1,k = y1,k ây1,kâ1 âh
2(y2,k + y2,kâ1)
(17.4.23)
Equation (17.4.16) gives

Now recall that the matrix of partial derivatives Si,j of equation (17.3.8) is
deï¬ned so that i labels the equation and j the variable. In our case, j runs from 1 to
3 for yj at k â1 and from 4 to 6 for yj at k. Thus equation (17.4.23) gives
S1,1 = â1,
S1,2 = âh
2 ,
S1,3 = 0
S1,4 = 1,
S1,5 = âh
2 ,
S1,6 = 0
(17.4.28)
Similarly equation (17.4.24) yields
S2,1 = Î±kÎ²k/2,
S2,2 = â1 âÎ²k(xk + xkâ1)(m + 1)/2,
S2,3 = Î²k(y1,k + y1,kâ1)/4
S2,4 = S2,1,
S2,5 = 2 + S2,2,
S2,6 = S2,3
(17.4.29)
while from equation (17.4.27) we ï¬nd
S3,1 = 0,
S3,2 = 0,
S3,3 = â1
S3,4 = 0,
S3,5 = 0,
S3,6 = 1
(17.4.30)
At x = 0 we have the boundary condition
E3,1 =
 y1,1,
n âm odd
y2,1,
n âm even
(17.4.31)
Recall the convention adopted in the solvde routine that for one boundary condition
at k = 1 only S3,j can be nonzero. Also, j takes on the values 4 to 6 since the
boundary condition involves only yk, not ykâ1.
Accordingly, the only nonzero
values of S3,j at x = 0 are
S3,4 = 1,
n âm odd
S3,5 = 1,
n âm even
(17.4.32)
At x = 1 we have
E1,M+1 = y2,M ây3,M âc2
2(m + 1) y1,M
(17.4.33)
E2,M+1 = y1,M âÎ³
(17.4.34)
Thus
S1,4 = ây3,M âc2
2(m + 1) ,
S1,5 = 1,
S1,6 = â
y1,M
2(m + 1)
(17.4.35)
S2,4 = 1,
S2,5 = 0,
S2,6 = 0
(17.4.36)
Here now is the sample program that implements the above algorithm. We
need a main program, sfroid, that calls the routine solvde, and we must supply
the function difeq called by solvde. For simplicity we choose an equally spaced

mesh of m = 41 points, that is, h = .025. As we shall see, this gives good accuracy
for the eigenvalues up to moderate values of n âm.
Since the boundary condition at x = 0 does not involve y1 if n âm is even,
we have to use the indexv feature of solvde. Recall that the value of indexv[j]
describes which column of s[i][j] the variable y[j] has been put in. If n âm
is even, we need to interchange the columns for y1 and y2 so that there is not a
zero pivot element in s[i][j].
The program prompts for values of m and n. It then computes an initial guess
for y based on the Legendre function P m
n . It next prompts for c2, solves for y,
prompts for c2, solves for y using the previous values as an initial guess, and so on.

Shooting
To solve the same problem via shooting (Â§17.1), we supply a function derivs
that implements equations (17.4.15)â(17.4.17). We will integrate the equations over
the range â1 â¤x â¤0. We provide the function load which sets the eigenvalue
y3 to its current best estimate, v[1]. It also sets the boundary values of y1 and
y2 using equations (17.4.20) and (17.4.19) (with a minus sign corresponding to

Shooting to a Fitting Point
For variety we illustrate shootf from Â§17.2 by integrating over the whole
range â1 + dx â¤x â¤1 âdx, with the ï¬tting point chosen to be at x = 0. The
routine derivs is identical to the one for shoot. Now, however, there are two load
routines. The routine load1 for x = â1 is essentially identical to load above. At
x = 1, load2 sets the function value y1 and the eigenvalue y3 to their best current
estimates, v2[1] and v2[2], respectively. If you quite sensibly make your initial
guess of the eigenvalue the same in the two intervals, then v1[1] will stay equal
to v2[2] during the iteration. The function score simply checks whether all three
function values match at the ï¬tting point.

17.5 Automated Allocation of Mesh Points
In relaxation problems, you have to choose values for the independent variable at the
mesh points. This is called allocating the grid or mesh. The usual procedure is to pick
a plausible set of values and, if it works, to be content. If it doesnât work, increasing the
number of points usually cures the problem.
If we know ahead of time where our solutions will be rapidly varying, we can put more
grid points there and less elsewhere. Alternatively, we can solve the problem ï¬rst on a uniform
mesh and then examine the solution to see where we should add more points. We then repeat
the solution with the improved grid. The object of the exercise is to allocate points in such
a way as to represent the solution accurately.
It is also possible to automate the allocation of mesh points, so that it is done
âdynamicallyâ during the relaxation process. This powerful technique not only improves
the accuracy of the relaxation method, but also (as we will see in the next section) allows
internal singularities to be handled in quite a neat way. Here we learn how to accomplish
the automatic allocation.
We want to focus attention on the independent variable x, and consider two alternative
reparametrizations of it. The ï¬rst, we term q; this is just the coordinate corresponding to the
mesh points themselves, so that q = 1 at k = 1, q = 2 at k = 2, and so on. Between any two
mesh points we have âq = 1. In the change of independent variable in the ODEs from x to q,
dy
dx = g
(17.5.1)
becomes
dy
dq = gdx
dq
(17.5.2)
In terms of q, equation (17.5.2) as an FDE might be written

(17.5.3)
or some related version. Note that dx/dq should accompany g. The transformation between
x and q depends only on the Jacobian dx/dq. Its reciprocal dq/dx is proportional to the
density of mesh points.
Now, given the function y(x), or its approximation at the current stage of relaxation,
we are supposed to have some idea of how we want to specify the density of mesh points.
For example, we might want dq/dx to be larger where y is changing rapidly, or near to the
boundaries, or both. In fact, we can probably make up a formula for what we would like
dq/dx to be proportional to. The problem is that we do not know the proportionality constant.
That is, the formula that we might invent would not have the correct integral over the whole
range of x so as to make q vary from 1 to M, according to its deï¬nition. To solve this problem
we introduce a second reparametrization Q(q), where Q is a new independent variable. The
relation between Q and q is taken to be linear, so that a mesh spacing formula for dQ/dx
differs only in its unknown proportionality constant. A linear relation implies
d2Q
dq2 = 0
(17.5.4)
or, expressed in the usual manner as coupled ï¬rst-order equations,
dQ(x)
dq
= Ï
dÏ
dq = 0
(17.5.5)
where Ï is a new intermediate variable. We add these two equations to the set of ODEs
being solved.
Completing the prescription, we add a third ODE that is just our desired mesh-density
function, namely
Ï(x) = dQ
dx = dQ

(17.5.7)
Notice that Ï(x) should be chosen to be positive deï¬nite, so that the density of mesh points is
everywhere positive. Otherwise (17.5.7) can have a zero in its denominator.
To use automated mesh spacing, you add the three ODEs (17.5.5) and (17.5.7) to your
set of equations, i.e., to the array y[j][k]. Now x becomes a dependent variable! Q and Ï
also become new dependentvariables. Normally, evaluating Ï requires little extra work since
it will be composedfrom pieces of the gâs that exist anyway. The automated procedure allows
one to investigate quickly how the numerical results might be affected by various strategies
for mesh spacing. (A special case occurs if the desired mesh spacing function Q can be found
analytically, i.e., dQ/dx is directly integrable. Then, you need to add only two equations,
those in 17.5.5, and two new variables x, Ï.)
As an example of a typical strategy for implementing this scheme, consider a system
with one dependent variable y(x). We could set
dQ = dx
â+ |d ln y|
Î´
(17.5.8)
or
Ï(x) = dQ
dx = 1
â+

dy/dx
yÎ´

(17.5.9)
where âand Î´ are constants that we choose. The ï¬rst term would give a uniform spacing
in x if it alone were present. The second term forces more grid points to be used where y is
changing rapidly. The constants act to make every logarithmic change in y of an amount Î´
about as âattractiveâ to a grid point as a change in x of amount â. You adjust the constants
according to taste. Other strategies are possible, such as a logarithmic spacing in x, replacing
dx in the ï¬rst term with d ln x.

17.6 Handling Internal Boundary Conditions
or Singular Points
Singularities can occur in the interiors of two point boundary value problems. Typically,
there is a point xs at which a derivative must be evaluated by an expression of the form
S(xs) = N(xs, y)
D(xs, y)
(17.6.1)
where the denominator D(xs, y) = 0. In physical problems with ï¬nite answers, singular
points usually come with their own cure: Where D â0, there the physical solution y must
be such as to make N â0 simultaneously, in such a way that the ratio takes on a meaningful
value. This constraint on the solution y is often called a regularity condition. The condition
that D(xs, y) satisfy some special constraint at xs is entirely analogous to an extra boundary
condition, an algebraic relation among the dependent variables that must hold at a point.
We discussed a related situation earlier, in Â§17.2, when we described the âï¬tting point
methodâ to handle the task of integrating equations with singular behavior at the boundaries.
In those problems you are unable to integrate from one side of the domain to the other.

17.6 Handling Internal Boundary Conditions
or Singular Points
Singularities can occur in the interiors of two point boundary value problems. Typically,
there is a point xs at which a derivative must be evaluated by an expression of the form
S(xs) = N(xs, y)
D(xs, y)
(17.6.1)
where the denominator D(xs, y) = 0. In physical problems with ï¬nite answers, singular
points usually come with their own cure: Where D â0, there the physical solution y must
be such as to make N â0 simultaneously, in such a way that the ratio takes on a meaningful
value. This constraint on the solution y is often called a regularity condition. The condition
that D(xs, y) satisfy some special constraint at xs is entirely analogous to an extra boundary
condition, an algebraic relation among the dependent variables that must hold at a point.
We discussed a related situation earlier, in Â§17.2, when we described the âï¬tting point
methodâ to handle the task of integrating equations with singular behavior at the boundaries.
In those problems you are unable to integrate from one side of the domain to the other.

with Figure 17.3.2.
However, the ODEs do have well-behaved derivatives and solutions in the neighborhood of
the singularity, so it is readily possible to integrate away from the point. Both the relaxation
method and the method of âshootingâ to a ï¬tting point handle such problems easily. Also,
in those problems the presence of singular behavior served to isolate some special boundary
values that had to be satisï¬ed to solve the equations.
The difference here is that we are concerned with singularities arising at intermediate
points, where the location of the singular point depends on the solution, so is not known a
priori. Consequently, we face a circular task: The singularity prevents us from ï¬nding a
numerical solution, but we need a numerical solution to ï¬nd its location. Such singularities
are also associated with selecting a special value for some variable which allows the solution
to satisfy the regularity condition at the singular point. Thus, internal singularities take on
aspects of being internal boundary conditions.
One way of handling internal singularities is to treat the problem as a free boundary
problem, as discussed at the end of Â§17.0.
Suppose, as a simple example, we consider
the equation
dy
dx = N(x,y)
D(x,y)
(17.6.2)
where N and D are required to pass through zero at some unknown point xs.
We add
the equation

dx = 0

where xs is the unknown location of the singularity, and change the independent variable
to t by setting
x âx1 = tz,
0 â¤t â¤1
(17.6.4)
The boundary conditions at t = 1 become
N(x, y) = 0,
D(x, y) = 0
(17.6.5)
Use of an adaptive mesh as discussed in the previous section is another way to overcome
the difï¬culties of an internal singularity. For the problem (17.6.2), we add the mesh spacing
equations
dQ
dq = Ï
(17.6.6)
dÏ
dq = 0
(17.6.7)
with a simple mesh spacing function that maps x uniformly into q, where q runs from 1 to
M, the number of mesh points:
Q(x) = x âx1,
dQ
dx = 1
(17.6.8)
Having added three ï¬rst-order differential equations, we must also add their corresponding
boundary conditions. If there were no singularity, these could simply be
at
q = 1 :
x = x1,
Q = 0
(17.6.9)
at
q = M :
x = x2
(17.6.10)
and a total of N values yi speciï¬ed at q = 1. In this case the problem is essentially an
initial value problem with all boundary conditions speciï¬ed at x1 and the mesh spacing
function is superï¬uous.
However, in the actual case at hand we impose the conditions
at
q = 1 :
x = x1,
Q = 0
(17.6.11)
at
q = M :
N(x, y) = 0,
D(x,y) = 0
(17.6.12)
and N â1 values yi at q = 1. The âmissingâ yi is to be adjusted, in other words, so as
to make the solution go through the singular point in a regular (zero-over-zero) rather than
irregular (ï¬nite-over-zero) manner. Notice also that these boundary conditions do not directly
impose a value for x2, which becomes an adjustable parameter that the code varies in an
attempt to match the regularity condition.
In this example the singularity occurred at a boundary, and the complication arose
because the location of the boundary was unknown. In other problems we might wish to
continue the integration beyond the internal singularity. For the example given above, we
could simply integrate the ODEs to the singular point, then as a separate problem recommence
the integration from the singular point on as far we care to go. However, in other cases the
singularity occurs internally, but does not completely determine the problem: There are still
some more boundary conditions to be satisï¬ed further along in the mesh. Such cases present
no difï¬culty in principle, but do require some adaptation of the relaxation code given in Â§17.3.
In effect all you need to do is to add a âspecialâ block of equations at the mesh point where
the internal boundary conditions occur, and do the proper bookkeeping.
Figure 17.6.1 illustrates a concrete example where the overall problem contains 5
equations with 2 boundary conditions at the ï¬rst point, one âinternalâ boundary condition, and
two ï¬nal boundary conditions. The ï¬gure shows the structure of the overall matrix equations
along the diagonal in the vicinity of the special block. In the middle of the domain, blocks
typically involve 5 equations (rows) in 10 unknowns (columns). For each block prior to the
special block, the initial boundary conditions provided enough information to zero the ï¬rst
two columns of the blocks. The ï¬ve FDEs eliminate ï¬ve more columns, and the ï¬nal three
columns need to be stored for the backsubstitution step (as described in Â§17.3). To handle the
extra condition we break the normal cycle and add a special block with only one equation:

coefï¬cients by one column for the rest of the grid, and allows us to reduce to zero the ï¬rst
three columns of subsequent blocks. The functions red, pinvs, bksub can readily handle
these cases with minor recoding, but each problem makes for a special case, and you will
have to make the modiï¬cations as required.

Chapter 18.
Integral Equations
and Inverse Theory
18.0 Introduction
Many people, otherwise numerically knowledgable, imagine that the numerical
solution of integral equations must be an extremely arcane topic, since, until recently,
it was almost never treated in numerical analysis textbooks. Actually there is a
large and growing literature on the numerical solution of integral equations; several
monographs have by now appeared [1-3]. One reason for the sheer volume of this
activity is that there are many different kinds of equations, each with many different
possible pitfalls; often many different algorithms have been proposed to deal with
a single case.
There is a close correspondence between linear integral equations, which specify
linear, integral relations among functions in an inï¬nite-dimensional function space,
and plain old linear equations, which specify analogous relations among vectors
in a ï¬nite-dimensional vector space. Because this correspondence lies at the heart
of most computational algorithms, it is worth making it explicit as we recall how
integral equations are classiï¬ed.
Fredholm equations involve deï¬nite integrals with ï¬xed upper and lower limits.
An inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the ï¬rst kind has the form
g(t) =
Z b
a
K(t, s)f(s) ds
(18.0.1)
Here f(t) is the unknownfunction to be solved for, whileg(t) is a known âright-hand
side.â (In integral equations, for some odd reason, the familiar âright-hand sideâ is
conventionally written on the left!) The function of two variables, K(t, s) is called
the kernel. Equation (18.0.1) is analogous to the matrix equation
K Â· f = g
(18.0.2)
whose solution is f = Kâ1 Â· g, where Kâ1 is the matrix inverse. Like equation
(18.0.2), equation (18.0.1) has a unique solution whenever g is nonzero (the
homogeneous case with g = 0 is almost never useful) and K is invertible. However,
as we shall see, this latter condition is as often the exception as the rule.

is called a Fredholm equation of the second kind, usually written
f(t) = Î»
Z b
a
K(t, s)f(s) ds + g(t)
(18.0.4)
Again, the notational conventions do not exactly correspond: Î» in equation (18.0.4)
is 1/Ï in (18.0.3), while g is âg/Î». If g (or g) is zero, then the equation is said
to be homogeneous. If the kernel K(t, s) is bounded, then, like equation (18.0.3),
equation (18.0.4) has the property that its homogeneous form has solutions for
at most a denumerably inï¬nite set Î» = Î»n, n = 1, 2, . . ., the eigenvalues. The
corresponding solutions fn(t) are the eigenfunctions. The eigenvalues are real if
the kernel is symmetric.
In the inhomogeneous case of nonzero g (or g), equations (18.0.3) and (18.0.4)
are soluble except when Î» (or Ï) is an eigenvalue â because the integral operator
(or matrix) is singular then.
In integral equations this dichotomy is called the
Fredholm alternative.
Fredholm equations of the ï¬rst kind are often extremely ill-conditioned. Ap-
plying the kernel to a function is generally a smoothing operation, so the solution,
which requires inverting the operator, will be extremely sensitive to small changes
or errors in the input. Smoothing often actually loses information, and there is no
way to get it back in an inverse operation. Specialized methods have been developed
for such equations, which are often called inverse problems. In general, a method
must augment the information given with some prior knowledge of the nature of the
solution. This prior knowledge is then used, in one way or another, to restore lost
information. We will introduce such techniques in Â§18.4.
Inhomogeneous Fredholm equations of the second kind are much less often
ill-conditioned. Equation (18.0.4) can be rewritten as
Z b
a
[K(t, s) âÏÎ´(t âs)]f(s) ds = âÏg(t)
(18.0.5)
where Î´(t âs) is a Dirac delta function (and where we have changed from Î» to its
reciprocal Ï for clarity). If Ï is large enough in magnitude, then equation (18.0.5)
is, in effect, diagonally dominant and thus well-conditioned. Only if Ï is small do
we go back to the ill-conditioned case.
Homogeneous Fredholm equations of the second kind are likewise not partic-
ularly ill-posed. If K is a smoothing operator, then it will map many fâs to zero,
or near-zero; there will thus be a large number of degenerate or nearly degenerate
eigenvalues around Ï = 0 (Î» ââ), but this will cause no particular computational
difï¬culties. In fact, we can now see that the magnitude of Ï needed to rescue the
inhomogeneous equation (18.0.5) from an ill-conditionedfate is generally much less
than that required for diagonal dominance. Since the Ï term shifts all eigenvalues,
it is enough that it be large enough to shift a smoothing operatorâs forest of near-
zero eigenvalues away from zero, so that the resulting operator becomes invertible
(except, of course, at the discrete eigenvalues).
Volterra equations are a special case of Fredholm equations with K(t, s) = 0
for s > t. Choppingoff the unnecessary part of the integration, Volterraequations are
written in a form where the upper limit of integration is the independent variable t.

The Volterra equation of the ï¬rst kind
g(t) =
Z t
a
K(t, s)f(s) ds
(18.0.6)
has as its analog the matrix equation (now written out in components)
k
X
j=1
Kkjfj = gk
(18.0.7)
Comparing with equation (18.0.2), we see that the Volterra equation corresponds to
a matrix K that is lower (i.e., left) triangular, with zero entries above the diagonal.
As we know from Chapter 2, such matrix equations are trivially soluble by forward
substitution. Techniques for solving Volterra equations are similarly straightforward.
When experimental measurement noise does not dominate, Volterra equations of the
ï¬rst kind tend not to be ill-conditioned; the upper limit to the integral introduces a
sharp step that conveniently spoils any smoothing properties of the kernel.
The Volterra equation of the second kind is written
f(t) =
Z t
a
K(t, s)f(s) ds + g(t)
(18.0.8)
whose matrix analog is the equation
(K â1) Â· f = g
(18.0.9)
with K lower triangular. The reason there is no Î» in these equations is that (i) in
the inhomogeneous case (nonzero g) it can be absorbed into K, while (ii) in the
homogeneous case (g = 0), it is a theorem that Volterra equations of the second kind
with bounded kernels have no eigenvalues with square-integrable eigenfunctions.
We have specialized our deï¬nitions to the case of linear integral equations.
The integrand in a nonlinear version of equation (18.0.1) or (18.0.6) would be
K(t, s, f(s)) instead of K(t, s)f(s); a nonlinear version of equation (18.0.4) or
(18.0.8) would have an integrand K(t, s, f(t), f(s)). Nonlinear Fredholm equations
are considerably more complicated than their linear counterparts. Fortunately, they
do not occur as frequently in practice and we shall by and large ignore them in this
chapter. By contrast, solving nonlinear Volterra equations usually involves only a
slight modiï¬cation of the algorithm for linear equations, as we shall see.
Almost all methods for solving integral equations numerically make use of
quadrature rules, frequently Gaussian quadratures.
This would be a good time
for you to go back and review Â§4.5, especially the advanced material towards the
end of that section.
In the sections that follow, we ï¬rst discuss Fredholm equations of the second
kind with smooth kernels (Â§18.1).
Nontrivial quadrature rules come into the
discussion, but we will be dealing with well-conditioned systems of equations. We
then return to Volterra equations (Â§18.2), and ï¬nd that simple and straightforward
methods are generally satisfactory for these equations.
In Â§18.3 we discuss how to proceed in the case of singular kernels, focusing
largely on Fredholm equations (both ï¬rst and second kinds). Singularities require

Here the set {wj} are the weights of the quadrature rule, while the N points {sj}

rules. We will see, however, that the solution method involves O(N 3) operations,
and so the most efï¬cient methods tend to use high-order quadrature rules to keep
N as small as possible. For smooth, nonsingular problems, nothing beats Gaussian
quadrature (e.g., Gauss-Legendre quadrature, Â§4.5). (For non-smooth or singular
kernels, see Â§18.3.)
Delves and Mohamed [1] investigated methods more complicated than the
Nystrom method. For straightforward Fredholm equations of the second kind, they
concluded â. . . the clear winner of this contest has been the Nystrom routine . . .with
the N-point Gauss-Legendre rule. This routine is extremely simple. . . . Such results
are enough to make a numerical analyst weep.â
If we apply the quadrature rule (18.1.2) to equation (18.1.1), we get
f(t) = Î»
N

wjK(t, sj)f(sj) + g(t)

X
j=1

(18.1.4)
Let fi be the vector f(ti), gi the vector g(ti), Kij the matrix K(ti, sj), and deï¬ne
eKij = Kijwj
(18.1.5)
Then in matrix notation equation (18.1.4) becomes
(1 âÎ»eK) Â· f = g
(18.1.6)
This is a set of N linear algebraic equations in N unknowns that can be solved
by standard triangular decomposition techniques (Â§2.3) â that is where the O(N 3)
operations count comes in. The solution is usually well-conditioned, unless Î» is
very close to an eigenvalue.
Having obtained the solution at the quadrature points {ti}, how do you get the
solution at some other point t? You do not simply use polynomial interpolation.
This destroys all the accuracy you have worked so hard to achieve. Nystromâs key
observation was that you should use equation (18.1.3) as an interpolatory formula,
maintaining the accuracy of the solution.
We here give two routines for use with linear Fredholm equations of the second
kind.
The routine fred2 sets up equation (18.1.6) and then solves it by LU
decomposition with calls to the routines ludcmp and lubksb. The Gauss-Legendre
quadrature is implemented by ï¬rst getting the weights and abscissas with a call to
gauleg. Routine fred2 requires that you provide an external function that returns
g(t) and another that returns Î»Kij. It then returns the solution f at the quadrature
points. It also returns the quadrature points and weights. These are used by the
second routine fredin to carry out the Nystrom interpolation of equation (18.1.3)
and return the value of f at any point in the interval [a, b].

One disadvantage of a method based on Gaussian quadrature is that there is no
simple way to obtain an estimate of the error in the result. The best practical method
is to increase N by 50%, say, and treat the difference between the two estimates as a
conservative estimate of the error in the result obtained with the larger value of N.

rules, the matrix eK (equation 18.1.5) is not symmetric.

many algorithms for ODEs have counterparts for Volterra equations.
The simplest way to proceed is to solve the equation on a mesh with uniform
spacing:
ti = a + ih,
i = 0, 1, . . ., N,
h â¡b âa

(18.2.2)
To do so, we must choose a quadrature rule. For a uniform mesh, the simplest
scheme is the trapezoidal rule, equation (4.1.11):

(18.2.4)
(For a Volterra equation of the ï¬rst kind, the leading 1 on the left would be absent,
and g would have opposite sign, with corresponding straightforward changes in the
rest of the discussion.)
Equation (18.2.4) is an explicit prescription that gives the solution in O(N 2)
operations. Unlike Fredholm equations, it is not necessary to solve a system of linear
equations. Volterra equations thus usually involve less work than the corresponding
Fredholm equations which, as we have seen, do involve the inversion of, sometimes
large, linear systems.
The efï¬ciency of solving Volterra equations is somewhat counterbalanced by
the fact that systems of these equations occur more frequently in practice. If we
interpret equation (18.2.1) as a vector equation for the vector of m functions f(t),
then the kernel K(t, s) is an m Ã m matrix. Equation (18.2.4) must now also be
understood as a vector equation. For each i, we have to solve the m Ã m set of
linear algebraic equations by Gaussian elimination.
The routine voltra below implements this algorithm. You must supply an
external function that returns the kth function of the vector g(t) at the point t, and
another that returns the (k, l) element of the matrix K(t, s) at (t, s). The routine
voltra then returns the vector f(t) at the regularly spaced points ti.

float (*g)(int, float), float (*ak)(int, int, float, float))
Solves a set of m linear Volterra equations of the second kind using the extended trapezoidal rule.
On input, t0 is the starting point of the integration and n-1 is the number of steps of size h to
be taken. g(k,t) is a user-supplied external function that returns gk(t), while ak(k,l,t,s)
is another user-supplied external function that returns the (k, l) element of the matrix K(t, s).
The solution is returned in f[1..m][1..n], with the corresponding abscissas in t[1..n].

for each i we solve a nonlinear equation for fi with a known right-hand side.
Newtonâs method (Â§9.4 or Â§9.6) with an initial guess of fiâ1 usually works very
well provided the stepsize is not too big.
Higher-order methods for solving Volterra equations are, in our opinion, not as
important as for Fredholm equations, since Volterra equations are relatively easy to
solve. However, there is an extensive literature on the subject. Several difï¬culties
arise. First, any method that achieves higher order by operatingon several quadrature
points simultaneously will need a special method to get started, when values at the
ï¬rst few points are not yet known.
Second, stable quadrature rules can give rise to unexpected instabilities in
integral equations. For example, suppose we try to replace the trapezoidal rule in
the algorithm above with Simpsonâs rule. Simpsonâs rule naturally integrates over
an interval 2h, so we easily get the function values at the even mesh points. For the
odd mesh points, we could try appending one panel of trapezoidal rule. But to which
end of the integration should we append it? We could do one step of trapezoidal rule
followed by all Simpsonâs rule, or Simpsonâs rule with one step of trapezoidal rule
at the end. Surprisingly, the former scheme is unstable, while the latter is ï¬ne!
A simple approach that can be used with the trapezoidal method given above
is Richardson extrapolation: Compute the solution with stepsize h and h/2. Then,
assuming the error scales with h2, compute
fE = 4f(h/2) âf(h)

This procedure can be repeated as with Romberg integration.
The general consensus is that the best of the higher order methods is the
block-by-block method (see [1]).
Another important topic is the use of variable
stepsize methods, which are much more efï¬cient if there are sharp features in K or
f. Variable stepsize methods are quite a bit more complicated than their counterparts
for differential equations; we refer you to the literature [1,2] for a discussion.
You should also be on the lookout for singularities in the integrand. If you ï¬nd
them, then look to Â§18.3 for additional ideas.

18.3 Integral Equations with Singular Kernels
Many integral equations have singularities in either the kernel or the solution or both.
A simple quadrature method will show poor convergence with N if such singularities are
ignored. There is sometimes art in how singularities are best handled.
We start with a few straightforward suggestions:
1. Integrablesingularities canoften be removedby achangeofvariable. Forexample, the
singular behavior K(t,s) â¼s1/2 or sâ1/2 near s = 0 can be removed by the transformation
z = s1/2. Note that we are assuming that the singular behavior is conï¬ned to K, whereas
the quadrature actually involves the product K(t,s)f(s), and it is this product that must
be âï¬xed.â Ideally, you must deduce the singular nature of the product before you try a
numerical solution, and take the appropriate action. Commonly, however, a singular kernel
does not produce a singular solution f(t). (The highly singular kernel K(t,s) = Î´(t âs)
is simply the identity operator, for example.)
2. If K(t,s) can be factored as w(s)K(t, s), where w(s) is singular and K(t, s) is
smooth, then a Gaussian quadrature based on w(s) as a weight function will work well. Even
if the factorization is only approximate, the convergence is often improved dramatically. All
you have to do is replace gauleg in the routine fred2 by another quadrature routine. Section
4.5 explained how to construct such quadratures; or you can ï¬nd tabulated abscissas and
weights in the standard references [1,2]. You must of course supply K instead of K.
This method is a special case of the productNystrom method [3,4], where one factors out
a singular term p(t, s) depending on both t and s from K and constructs suitable weights for
its Gaussian quadrature. The calculations in the general case are quite cumbersome, because
the weights depend on the chosen {ti} as well as the form of p(t, s).
We prefer to implementthe productNystrom method on a uniform grid, with a quadrature
scheme that generalizes the extended Simpsonâs 3/8 rule (equation 4.1.5) to arbitrary weight
functions. We discuss this in the subsections below.
3. Special quadrature formulas are also useful when the kernel is not strictly singular,
but is âalmostâ so. One example is when the kernel is concentrated near t = s on a scale much
smaller than the scale on which the solution f(t) varies. In that case, a quadrature formula
can be based on locally approximating f(s) by a polynomial or spline, while calculating the
ï¬rst few moments of the kernel K(t,s) at the tabulation points ti. In such a scheme the
narrow width of the kernel becomes an asset, rather than a liability: The quadrature becomes
exact as the width of the kernel goes to zero.
4. An inï¬nite range of integration is also a form of singularity. Truncating the range at a
large ï¬nite value should be used only as a last resort. If the kernel goes rapidly to zero, then

f. Variable stepsize methods are quite a bit more complicated than their counterparts
for differential equations; we refer you to the literature [1,2] for a discussion.
You should also be on the lookout for singularities in the integrand. If you ï¬nd
them, then look to Â§18.3 for additional ideas.

18.3 Integral Equations with Singular Kernels
Many integral equations have singularities in either the kernel or the solution or both.
A simple quadrature method will show poor convergence with N if such singularities are
ignored. There is sometimes art in how singularities are best handled.
We start with a few straightforward suggestions:
1. Integrablesingularities canoften be removedby achangeofvariable. Forexample, the
singular behavior K(t,s) â¼s1/2 or sâ1/2 near s = 0 can be removed by the transformation
z = s1/2. Note that we are assuming that the singular behavior is conï¬ned to K, whereas
the quadrature actually involves the product K(t,s)f(s), and it is this product that must
be âï¬xed.â Ideally, you must deduce the singular nature of the product before you try a
numerical solution, and take the appropriate action. Commonly, however, a singular kernel
does not produce a singular solution f(t). (The highly singular kernel K(t,s) = Î´(t âs)
is simply the identity operator, for example.)
2. If K(t,s) can be factored as w(s)K(t, s), where w(s) is singular and K(t, s) is
smooth, then a Gaussian quadrature based on w(s) as a weight function will work well. Even
if the factorization is only approximate, the convergence is often improved dramatically. All
you have to do is replace gauleg in the routine fred2 by another quadrature routine. Section
4.5 explained how to construct such quadratures; or you can ï¬nd tabulated abscissas and
weights in the standard references [1,2]. You must of course supply K instead of K.
This method is a special case of the productNystrom method [3,4], where one factors out
a singular term p(t, s) depending on both t and s from K and constructs suitable weights for
its Gaussian quadrature. The calculations in the general case are quite cumbersome, because
the weights depend on the chosen {ti} as well as the form of p(t, s).
We prefer to implementthe productNystrom method on a uniform grid, with a quadrature
scheme that generalizes the extended Simpsonâs 3/8 rule (equation 4.1.5) to arbitrary weight
functions. We discuss this in the subsections below.
3. Special quadrature formulas are also useful when the kernel is not strictly singular,
but is âalmostâ so. One example is when the kernel is concentrated near t = s on a scale much
smaller than the scale on which the solution f(t) varies. In that case, a quadrature formula
can be based on locally approximating f(s) by a polynomial or spline, while calculating the
ï¬rst few moments of the kernel K(t,s) at the tabulation points ti. In such a scheme the
narrow width of the kernel becomes an asset, rather than a liability: The quadrature becomes
exact as the width of the kernel goes to zero.
4. An inï¬nite range of integration is also a form of singularity. Truncating the range at a
large ï¬nite value should be used only as a last resort. If the kernel goes rapidly to zero, then

a Gauss-Laguerre [w â¼exp(âÎ±s)] or Gauss-Hermite [w â¼exp(âs2)] quadrature should
work well. Long-tailed functions often succumb to the transformation
s =
2Î±
z + 1 âÎ±
(18.3.1)
which maps 0 < s < âto 1 > z > â1 so that Gauss-Legendre integration can be used.
Here Î± > 0 is a constant that you adjust to improve the convergence.
5. A common situation in practice is that K(t,s) is singular along the diagonal line
t = s. Here the Nystrom method fails completely becausethe kernel gets evaluated at (ti, si).
Subtraction of the singularity is one possible cure:
Z b
a
K(t,s)f(s) ds =
Z b
a
K(t,s)[f(s) âf(t)]ds +
Z b
a
K(t,s)f(t)ds
=
Z b
a
K(t,s)[f(s) âf(t)]ds + r(t)f(t)
(18.3.2)
where r(t) =
R b
a K(t,s) ds is computed analytically or numerically. If the ï¬rst term on
the right-hand side is now regular, we can use the Nystrom method. Instead of equation
(18.1.4), we get
fi = Î»
N
X
j=1
jÌ¸=i
wjKij[fj âfi] + Î»rifi + gi
(18.3.3)
Sometimes the subtraction processmustbe repeated before thekernel is completelyregularized.
See [3] for details. (And read on for a different, we think better, way to handle diagonal
singularities.)
Quadrature on a Uniform Mesh with Arbitrary Weight
It is possible in general to ï¬nd n-point linear quadrature rules that approximate the
integral of a function f(x), times an arbitrary weight function w(x), over an arbitrary range
of integration (a, b), as the sum of weights times n evenly spaced values of the function f(x),
say at x = kh, (k + 1)h, . . . , (k + n â1)h. The general scheme for deriving such quadrature
rules is to write down the n linear equations that must be satisï¬ed if the quadrature rule is
to be exact for the n functions f(x) = const, x,x2, . . . , xnâ1, and then solve these for the
coefï¬cients. This can be done analytically, once and for all, if the moments of the weight
function over the same range of integration,
Wn â¡1
hn
Z b
a
xnw(x)dx
(18.3.4)
are assumed to be known. Here the prefactor hân is chosen to make Wn scale as h if (as
in the usual case) b âa is proportional to h.
Carrying out this prescription for the four-point case gives the result
Z b

w(x)f(x)dx =

While the terms in brackets superï¬cially appear to scale as k2, there is typically cancellation
at both O(k2) and O(k).
Equation (18.3.5) can be specialized to various choices of (a, b). The obvious choice
is a = kh, b = (k + 3)h, in which case we get a four-point quadrature rule that generalizes
Simpsonâs 3/8 rule (equation 4.1.5).
In fact, we can recover this special case by setting
w(x) = 1, in which case (18.3.4) becomes
Wn =
h
n + 1[(k + 3)n+1 âkn+1]
(18.3.6)
The four terms in square brackets equation (18.3.5) each become independent of k, and
(18.3.5) in fact reduces to
Z (k+3)h
kh
f(x)dx = 3h
8 f(kh)+ 9h
8 f([k+1]h)+ 9h
8 f([k+2]h)+ 3h
8 f([k+3]h) (18.3.7)
Back to the case of general w(x), some other choices for a and b are also useful. For
example, we may want to choose (a, b) to be ([k + 1]h, [k + 3]h) or ([k + 2]h, [k + 3]h),
allowing us to ï¬nish off an extended rule whose number of intervals is not a multiple
of three, without loss of accuracy: The integral will be estimated using the four values
f(kh), . . . , f([k + 3]h). Even more useful is to choose (a, b) to be ([k + 1]h, [k + 2]h), thus
using four points to integrate a centered single interval. These weights, when sewed together
into an extended formula, give quadrature schemes that have smooth coefï¬cients, i.e., without
the Simpson-like 2, 4, 2, 4, 2 alternation. (In fact, this was the technique that we used to derive
equation 4.1.14, which you may now wish to reexamine.)
All these rules are of the same order as the extended Simpsonâs rule, that is, exact
for f(x) a cubic polynomial. Rules of lower order, if desired, are similarly obtained. The
three point formula is
Z b
a
w(x)f(x)dx = 1
2f(kh)

(k + 1)(k + 2)W0 â(2k + 3)W1 + W2



+ 1
2 f([k + 2]h)

k(k + 1)W0 â(2k + 1)W1 + W2

(18.3.8)
Here the simple special case is to take, w(x) = 1, so that
Wn =
h
n + 1[(k + 2)n+1 âkn+1]
(18.3.9)
Then equation (18.3.8) becomes Simpsonâs rule,
Z (k+2)h
kh
f(x)dx = h
3 f(kh) + 4h
3 f([k + 1]h) + h
3 f([k + 2]h)
(18.3.10)
For nonconstant weight functions w(x), however, equation (18.3.8) gives rules of one order
less than Simpson, since they do not beneï¬t from the extra symmetry of the constant case.
The two point formula is simply
Z (k+1)h
kh
w(x)f(x)dx = f(kh)[(k + 1)W0 âW1] + f([k + 1]h)[âkW0 + W1] (18.3.11)
Here is a routine wwghts that uses the above formulas to return an extended N-point
quadrature rule for the interval (a, b) = (0, [N â1]h). Input to wwghts is a user-supplied
routine, kermom, that is called to get the ï¬rst four indeï¬nite-integralmoments of w(x), namely
Fm(y) â¡
Z y
smw(s)ds
m = 0, 1, 2, 3
(18.3.12)
(The lower limit is arbitrary and can be chosen for convenience.) Cautionary note: When
called with N < 4, wwghts returns a rule of lower order than Simpson; you should structure
your problem to avoid this.

Worked Example: A Diagonally Singular Kernel
As a particular example, consider the integral equation
f(x) +
Z Ï
0
K(x,y)f(y)dy = sin x
(18.3.13)
with the (arbitrarily chosen) nasty kernel
K(x,y) = cos x cos y Ã

ln(x ây)
y < x
ây âx
y â¥x
(18.3.14)
which has a logarithmic singularity on the left of the diagonal, combined with a square-root
discontinuity on the right.
The ï¬rst step is to do (analytically, in this case) the required moment integrals over
the singular part of the kernel, equation (18.3.12). Since these integrals are done at a ï¬xed
value of x, we can use x as the lower limit.
For any speciï¬ed value of y, the required
indeï¬nite integral is then either
Fm(y; x) =
Z y
x
sm(s âx)1/2ds =
Z yâx
0
(x + t)mt1/2dt
if y > x
(18.3.15)
or
Fm(y; x) =
Z y
x
sm ln(x âs)ds =
Z xây
0
(x ât)m ln t dt
if y < x
(18.3.16)
(where a change of variable has been made in the second equality in each case). Doing these
integrals analytically (actually, we used a symbolic integration package!), we package the
resulting formulas in the following routine. Note that w(j + 1) returns Fj(y; x).
#include <math.h>
extern double x;
Deï¬ned in quadmx.
void kermom(double w[], double y, int m)
Returns in w[1..m] the ï¬rst m indeï¬nite-integral moments of one row of the singular part of
the kernel. (For this example, m is hard-wired to be 4.) The input variable y labels the column,
while the global variable x is the row. We can take x as the lower limit of integration. Thus,
we return the moment integrals either purely to the left or purely to the right of the diagonal.
{
double d,df,clog,x2,x3,x4,y2;
if (y >= x) {
d=y-x;
df=2.0*sqrt(d)*d;
w[1]=df/3.0;
w[2]=df*(x/3.0+d/5.0);
w[3]=df*((x/3.0 + 0.4*d)*x + d*d/7.0);
w[4]=df*(((x/3.0 + 0.6*d)*x + 3.0*d*d/7.0)*x+d*d*d/9.0);
} else {
x3=(x2=x*x)*x;
x4=x2*x2;
y2=y*y;
d=x-y;
w[1]=d*((clog=log(d))-1.0);
w[2] = -0.25*(3.0*x+y-2.0*clog*(x+y))*d;
w[3]=(-11.0*x3+y*(6.0*x2+y*(3.0*x+2.0*y))

the quadrature weights which integrate the singular part of the kernel are obtained via calls
to wwghts. An external routine kermom, which supplies indeï¬nite-integral moments of the
singular part of the kernel, is passed to wwghts.
{
void kermom(double w[], double y, int m);
void wwghts(float wghts[], int n, float h,
void (*kermom)(double [], double ,int));
int j,k;

h=PI/(n-1);
for (j=1;j<=n;j++) {

Put x in global variable for use by kermom.

free_vector(wt,1,n);

With N = 40, this program gives accuracy at about the 10â5 level. The accuracy
increases as N 4 (as it should for our Simpson-order quadrature scheme) despite the highly
singular kernel.
Figure 18.3.1 shows the solution obtained, also plotting the solution for
smaller values of N, which are themselves seen to be remarkably faithful. Notice that the
solution is smooth, even though the kernel is singular, a common occurrence.

18.4 Inverse Problems and the Use of A Priori
Information
Later discussion will be facilitated by some preliminary mention of a couple
of mathematical points. Suppose that u is an âunknownâ vector that we plan to
determine by some minimization principle. Let A[u] > 0 and B[u] > 0 be two
positive functionals of u, so that we can try to determine u by either
minimize:
A[u]
or
minimize:
B[u]
(18.4.1)
(Of course these will generally give different answers for u.) As another possibility,
now suppose that we want to minimize A[u] subject to the constraint that B[u] have
some particular value, say b. The method of Lagrange multipliers gives the variation
Î´
Î´u {A[u] + Î»1(B[u] âb)} = Î´
Î´u (A[u] + Î»1B[u]) = 0
(18.4.2)
where Î»1 is a Lagrange multiplier. Notice that b is absent in the second equality,
since it doesnât depend on u.
Next, suppose that we change our minds and decide to minimize B[u] subject
to the constraint that A[u] have a particular value, a. Instead of equation (18.4.2)
we have
Î´
Î´u {B[u] + Î»2(A[u] âa)} = Î´
Î´u (B[u] + Î»2A[u]) = 0
(18.4.3)
with, this time, Î»2 the Lagrange multiplier. Multiplying equation (18.4.3) by the
constant 1/Î»2, and identifying 1/Î»2 with Î»1, we see that the actual variations are
exactly the same in the two cases. Both cases will yield the same one-parameter
family of solutions, say, u(Î»1).
As Î»1 varies from 0 to â, the solution u(Î»1)
varies along a so-called trade-off curve between the problem of minimizing A and
the problem of minimizing B.
Any solution along this curve can equally well
be thought of as either (i) a minimization of A for some constrained value of B,
or (ii) a minimization of B for some constrained value of A, or (iii) a weighted
minimization of the sum A + Î»1B.
The second preliminarypointhas to dowithdegenerate minimizationprinciples.
In the example above, now suppose that A[u] has the particular form
A[u] = |A Â· u âc|2
(18.4.4)
for some matrix A and vector c. If A has fewer rows than columns, or if A is square
but degenerate (has a nontrivial nullspace, see Â§2.6, especially Figure 2.6.1), then
minimizing A[u] will not give a unique solution for u. (To see why, review Â§15.4,
and note that for a âdesign matrixâ A with fewer rows than columns, the matrix
AT Â· A in the normal equations 15.4.10 is degenerate.) However, if we add any
multiple Î» times a nondegenerate quadratic form B[u], for example u Â· H Â· u with H
a positive deï¬nite matrix, then minimization of A[u] + Î»B[u] will lead to a unique
solution for u. (The sum of two quadratic forms is itself a quadratic form, with the
second piece guaranteeing nondegeneracy.)

We can combine these two points, for this conclusion: When a quadratic
minimization principle is combined with a quadratic constraint, and both are
positive, only one of the two need be nondegenerate for the overall problem to be
well-posed. We are now equipped to face the subject of inverse problems.
The Inverse Problem with Zeroth-Order Regularization
Suppose that u(x) is some unknown or underlying (u stands for both unknown
and underlying!)
physical process, which we hope to determine by a set of N
measurements ci, i = 1, 2, . . ., N. The relation between u(x) and the ciâs is that
each ci measures a (hopefullydistinct)aspect of u(x) through its own linear response
kernel ri, and with its own measurement error ni. In other words,
ci â¡si + ni =
Z
ri(x)u(x)dx + ni
(18.4.5)
(compare this to equations 13.3.1 and 13.3.2). Within the assumption of linearity,
this is quite a general formulation. The ciâs might approximate values of u(x) at
certain locations xi, in which case ri(x) would have the form of a more or less
narrow instrumental response centered around x = xi. Or, the ciâs might âliveâ in an
entirely different function space from u(x), measuring different Fourier components
of u(x) for example.
The inverse problem is, given the ciâs, the ri(x)âs, and perhaps some information
about the errors ni such as their covariance matrix
Sij â¡Covar[ni, nj]
(18.4.6)
how do we ï¬nd a good statistical estimator of u(x), call it bu(x)?
It should be obvious that this is an ill-posed problem. After all, how can we
reconstruct a whole function bu(x) from only a ï¬nite number of discrete values ci?
Yet, whether formally or informally, we do this all the time in science. We routinely
measure âenough pointsâ and then âdraw a curve through them.â In doing so, we
are making some assumptions, either about the underlying function u(x), or about
the nature of the response functions ri(x), or both. Our purpose now is to formalize
these assumptions, and to extend our abilities to cases where the measurements and
underlying function live in quite different function spaces. (How do you âdraw a
curveâ through a scattering of Fourier coefï¬cients?)
We canât really want every point x of the function bu(x). We do want some
large number M of discrete points xÂµ, Âµ = 1, 2, . . ., M, where M is sufï¬ciently
large, and the xÂµâs are sufï¬ciently evenly spaced, that neither u(x) nor ri(x) varies
much between any xÂµ and xÂµ+1. (Here and following we will use Greek letters like
Âµ to denote values in the space of the underlying process, and Roman letters like i
to denote values of immediate observables.) For such a dense set of xÂµâs, we can
replace equation (18.4.5) by a quadrature like
ci =
X
Âµ
RiÂµu(xÂµ) + ni
(18.4.7)
where the N Ã M matrix R has components
RiÂµ â¡ri(xÂµ)(xÂµ+1 âxÂµâ1)/2

(or any other simple quadrature â it rarely matters which). We will view equations
(18.4.5) and (18.4.7) as being equivalent for practical purposes.
How do you solve a set of equations like equation (18.4.7) for the unknown
u(xÂµ)âs? Here is a bad way, but one that contains the germ of some correct ideas:
Form a Ï2 measure of how well a model bu(x) agrees with the measured data,
Ï2 =
N

i=1

Ïi
#2
(18.4.9)
(compare with equation 15.1.5). Here Sâ1 is the inverse of the covariance matrix,
and the approximate equality holds if you can neglect the off-diagonal covariances,
with Ïi â¡(Covar[i, i])1/2.
Now you can use the method of singular value decomposition (SVD) in Â§15.4
to ï¬nd the vector bu that minimizes equation (18.4.9). Donât try to use the method
of normal equations; since M is greater than N they will be singular, as we already
discussed. The SVD process will thus surely ï¬nd a large number of zero singular
values, indicative of a highly non-unique solution. Among the inï¬nity of degenerate
solutions (most of them badly behaved with arbitrarily large bu(xÂµ)âs) SVD will
select the one with smallest |bu| in the sense of
X
Âµ
[bu(xÂµ)]2
a minimum
(18.4.10)
(look at Figure 2.6.1).
This solution is often called the principal solution.
It
is a limiting case of what is called zeroth-order regularization, corresponding to
minimizing the sum of the two positive functionals
minimize:
Ï2[bu] + Î»(bu Â· bu)
(18.4.11)
in the limit of small Î». Below, we will learn how to do such minimizations, as well
as more general ones, without the ad hoc use of SVD.
What happens if we determine bu by equation (18.4.11) with a non-inï¬nitesimal
value of Î»? First, note that if M â«N (many more unknowns than equations), then
u will often have enough freedom to be able to make Ï2 (equation 18.4.9) quite
unrealistically small, if not zero. In the language of Â§15.1, the number of degrees of
freedom Î½ = N âM, which is approximately the expected value of Ï2 when Î½ is
large, is being driven down to zero (and, not meaningfully, beyond). Yet, we know
that for the true underlying function u(x), which has no adjustable parameters, the
number of degrees of freedom and the expected value of Ï2 should be about Î½ âN.
Increasing Î» pulls the solutionaway from minimizingÏ2 in favor of minimizing
bu Â· bu. From the preliminary discussion above, we can view this as minimizing bu Â· bu
subject to the constraint that Ï2 have some constant nonzero value.
A popular
choice, in fact, is to ï¬nd that value of Î» which yields Ï2 = N, that is, to get about as
much extra regularization as a plausible value of Ï2 dictates. The resulting bu(x) is
called the solution of the inverse problem with zeroth-order regularization.

Figure 18.4.1.
Almost all inverse problem methods involve a trade-off between two optimizations:
agreementbetween data and solution, or âsharpnessâof mappingbetween true and estimated solution (here
denoted A), and smoothness or stability of the solution (here denoted B). Among all possible solutions,
shown here schematically as the shaded region, those on the boundary connecting the unconstrained
minimum of A and the unconstrained minimum of B are the âbestâ solutions, in the sense that every
other solution is dominated by at least one solution on the curve.
The value N is actually a surrogate for any value drawn from a Gaussian
distribution with mean N and standard deviation (2N)1/2 (the asymptotic Ï2
distribution). One might equally plausibly try two values of Î», one giving Ï2 =
N + (2N)1/2, the other N â(2N)1/2.
Zeroth-order regularization, though dominated by better methods, demonstrates
most of the basic ideas that are used in inverse problem theory. In general, there are
two positive functionals, call them A and B. The ï¬rst, A, measures something like
the agreement of a model to the data (e.g., Ï2), or sometimes a related quantity like
the âsharpnessâ of the mapping between the solution and the underlying function.
When A by itself is minimized, the agreement or sharpness becomes very good
(often impossibly good), but the solution becomes unstable, wildly oscillating, or in
other ways unrealistic, reï¬ecting that A alone typically deï¬nes a highly degenerate
minimization problem.
That is where B comes in. It measures something like the âsmoothnessâ of the
desired solution, or sometimes a related quantity that parametrizes the stability of
the solution with respect to variations in the data, or sometimes a quantity reï¬ecting
a priori judgments about the likelihood of a solution. B is called the stabilizing
functional or regularizing operator. In any case, minimizing B by itself is supposed
to give a solution that is âsmoothâ or âstableâ or âlikelyâ â and that has nothing
at all to do with the measured data.

The single central idea in inverse theory is the prescription
minimize:
A + Î»B
(18.4.12)
for various values of 0 < Î» < âalong the so-called trade-off curve (see Figure
18.4.1), and then to settle on a âbestâ value of Î» by one or another criterion, ranging
from fairly objective (e.g., making Ï2 = N) to entirely subjective.
Successful
methods, several of which we will now describe, differ as to their choices of A and
B, as to whether the prescription (18.4.12) yields linear or nonlinear equations, as
to their recommended method for selecting a ï¬nal Î», and as to their practicality for
computer-intensive two-dimensional problems like image processing.
They also differ as to the philosophical baggage that they (or rather, their
proponents) carry. We have thus far avoided the word âBayesian.â (Courts have
consistently held that academic license does not extend to shouting âBayesianâ in a
crowded lecture hall.) But it is hard, nor have we any wish, to disguise the fact that
B has something to do with a priori expectation, or knowledge, of a solution, while
A has something to do with a posteriori knowledge. The constant Î» adjudicates a
delicate compromise between the two. Some inverse methods have acquired a more
Bayesian stamp than others, but we think that this is purely an accident of history.
An outsider looking only at the equations that are actually solved, and not at the
accompanying philosophical justiï¬cations, would have a difï¬cult time separating the
so-called Bayesian methods from the so-called empirical ones, we think.
The next three sections discuss three different approaches to the problem of
inversion, which have had considerable success in different ï¬elds.
All three ï¬t
within the general framework that we have outlined, but they are quite different in
detail and in implementation.

generalization of zeroth-order regularization (equation 18.4.11, above). As before,
the functional A is taken to be the Ï2 deviation, equation (18.4.9), but the functional
B is replaced by more sophisticated measures of smoothness that derive from ï¬rst
or higher derivatives.

Note that B has one fewer row than column.
It follows that the symmetric H
is degenerate; it has exactly one zero eigenvalue corresponding to the value of a
constant function, any one of which makes B exactly zero.
If, just as in Â§15.4, we write
AiÂµ â¡RiÂµ/Ïi

or, in vector notation,
(AT Â· A + Î»H) Â· bu = AT Â· b
(18.5.8)
Equations (18.5.7) or (18.5.8) can be solved by the standard techniques of
Chapter 2, e.g., LU decomposition. The usual warnings about normal equations
being ill-conditioned do not apply, since the whole purpose of the Î» term is to cure
that same ill-conditioning. Note, however, that the Î» term by itself is ill-conditioned,
since it does not select a preferred constant value.
You hope your data can at
least do that!
Although inversion of the matrix (AT Â· A+Î»H) is not generally the best way to
solve for bu, let us digress to write the solution to equation (18.5.8) schematically as
bu =

1
AT Â· A + Î»H Â· AT Â· A

Aâ1 Â· b
(schematic only!)
(18.5.9)
where the identity matrix in the form A Â· Aâ1 has been inserted. This is schematic
not only because the matrix inverse is fancifully written as a denominator, but
also because, in general, the inverse matrix Aâ1 does not exist. However, it is
illuminating to compare equation (18.5.9) with equation (13.3.6) for optimal or
Wiener ï¬ltering, or with equation (13.6.6) for general linear prediction. One sees
that AT Â· A plays the role of S2, the signal power or autocorrelation, while Î»H
plays the role of N 2, the noise power or autocorrelation. The term in parentheses
in equation (18.5.9) is something like an optimal ï¬lter, whose effect is to pass the
ill-posed inverse Aâ1 Â· b through unmodiï¬ed when AT Â· A is sufï¬ciently large, but
to suppress it when AT Â· A is small.
The above choices of B and H are only the simplest in an obvious sequence of
derivatives. If your a priori belief is that a linear function is a good approximation
to u(x), then minimize

(Weâll leave the calculation of cubics and above to the compulsive reader.)
Notice that you can regularize with âcloseness to a differential equation,â if
you want. Just pick B to be the appropriate sum of ï¬nite-difference operators (the
coefï¬cients can depend on x), and calculate H = BT Â· B. You donât need to know
the values of your boundary conditions, since B can have fewer rows than columns,
as above; hopefully, your data will determine them. Of course, if you do know some
boundary conditions, you can build these into B too.
With all the proportionalitysigns above, you may have lost track of what actual
value of Î» to try ï¬rst. A simple trick for at least getting âon the mapâ is to ï¬rst try
Î» = Tr(AT Â· A)/Tr(H)
(18.5.16)
where Tr is the trace of the matrix (sum of diagonal components).
This choice
will tend to make the two parts of the minimization have comparable weights, and
you can adjust from there.
As for what is the âcorrectâ value of Î», an objective criterion, if you know
your errors Ïi with reasonable accuracy, is to make Ï2 (that is, |A Â· bu âb|2) equal
to N, the number of measurements. We remarked above on the twin acceptable
choices N Â± (2N)1/2. A subjective criterion is to pick any value that you like in the

posteriori evidence. (Yes, people actually do that. Donât blame us.)
Two-Dimensional Problems and Iterative Methods
Up to now our notation has been indicative of a one-dimensional problem,
ï¬nding bu(x) or buÂµ = bu(xÂµ). However, all of the discussion easily generalizes to the
problem of estimating a two-dimensional set of unknowns buÂµÎº, Âµ = 1, . . ., M, Îº =
1, . . ., K, corresponding, say, to the pixel intensities of a measured image. In this
case, equation (18.5.8) is still the one we want to solve.
In image processing, it is usual to have the same number of input pixels in a
measured ârawâ or âdirtyâ image as desired âcleanâ pixels in the processed output
image, so the matrices R and A (equation 18.5.5) are square and of size MK ÃMK.
A is typically much too large to represent as a full matrix, but often it is either (i)
sparse, with coefï¬cients blurring an underlying pixel (i, j) only into measurements
(iÂ±few, jÂ±few), or (ii)translationallyinvariant, so that A(i,j)(Âµ,Î½) = A(iâÂµ, jâÎ½).
Both of these situations lead to tractable problems.
In the case of translational invariance, fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) are the
obvious method of choice. The general linear relation between underlying function
and measured values (18.4.7) now becomes a discrete convolution like equation
(13.1.1). If k denotes a two-dimensional wave-vector, then the two-dimensional
FFT takes us back and forth between the transform pairs
A(i âÂµ, j âÎ½) ââeA(k)
b(i,j) ââeb(k)
bu(i,j) ââeu(k) (18.5.17)
We also need a regularization or smoothing operator B and the derived H = BT Â· B.
One popular choice for B is the ï¬ve-point ï¬nite-difference approximation of the
Laplacian operator, that is, the difference between the value of each point and the
average of its four Cartesian neighbors. In Fourier space, this choice implies,
eB(k) âsin2(Ïk1/M) sin2(Ïk2/K)
eH(k) âsin4(Ïk1/M) sin4(Ïk2/K)
(18.5.18)
In Fourier space, equation (18.5.7) is merely algebraic, with solution
eu(k) =
eA*(k)eb(k)
| eA(k)|2 + Î» eH(k)
(18.5.19)
where asterisk denotes complex conjugation. You can make use of the FFT routines
for real data in Â§12.5.
Turn now to the case where A is not translationally invariant. Direct solution
of (18.5.8) is now hopeless, since the matrix A is just too large. We need some
kind of iterative scheme.
One way to proceed is to use the full machinery of the conjugate gradient
method in Â§10.6 to ï¬nd the minimum of A + Î»B, equation (18.5.6). Of the various
methods in Chapter 10, conjugate gradient is the unique best choice because (i)
it does not require storage of a Hessian matrix, which would be infeasible here,

and (ii) it does exploit gradient information, which we can readily compute: The
gradient of equation (18.5.6) is
â(A + Î»B) = 2[(AT Â· A + Î»H) Â· bu âAT Â· b]
(18.5.20)
(cf. 18.5.8). Evaluation of both the function and the gradient should of course take
advantage of the sparsity of A, for example via the routines sprsax and sprstx
in Â§2.7. We will discuss the conjugate gradient technique further in Â§18.7, in the
context of the (nonlinear) maximum entropy method. Some of that discussion can
apply here as well.
The conjugate gradient method notwithstanding, application of the unsophis-
ticated steepest descent method (see Â§10.6) can sometimes produce useful results,
particularly when combined with projections onto convex sets (see below). If the
solution after k iterations is denoted bu(k), then after k + 1 iterations we have
bu(k+1) = [1 âÏµ(AT Â· A + Î»H)] Â· bu(k) + ÏµAT Â· b
(18.5.21)
Here Ïµ is a parameter that dictates how far to move in the downhill gradient direction.
The method converges when Ïµ is small enough, in particular satisfying
0 < Ïµ <
2
max eigenvalue (AT Â· A + Î»H)
(18.5.22)
There exist complicated schemes for ï¬nding optimal values or sequences for Ïµ,
see [7]; or, one can adopt an experimental approach, evaluating (18.5.6) to be sure
that downhill steps are in fact being taken.
In those image processing problems where the ï¬nal measure of success is
somewhat subjective (e.g., âhow good does the picture look?â), iteration (18.5.21)
sometimes produces signiï¬cantly improved images long before convergence is
achieved.
This probably accounts for much of its use, since its mathematical
convergence is extremely slow.
In fact, (18.5.21) can be used with H = 0, in
which case the solution is not regularized at all, and full convergence would be
disastrous! This is called Van Cittertâs method and goes back to the 1930s. A number
of iterations the order of 1000 is not uncommon [7].
Deterministic Constraints: Projections onto Convex Sets
A set of possible underlying functions (or images) {bu} is said to be convex if,
for any two elements bua and bub in the set, all the linearly interpolated combinations
(1 âÎ·)bua + Î·bub
0 â¤Î· â¤1
(18.5.23)
are also in the set. Many deterministic constraints that one might want to impose on
the solution bu to an inverse problem in fact deï¬ne convex sets, for example:
â¢ positivity
â¢ compact support (i.e., zero value outside of a certain region)

â¢ known bounds (i.e., uL(x) â¤bu(x) â¤uU(x) for speciï¬ed functions uL
and uU).
(In this last case, the bounds might be related to an initial estimate and its error bars,
e.g., bu0(x) Â± Î³Ï(x), where Î³ is of order 1 or 2.) Notice that these, and similar,
constraints can be either in the image space, or in the Fourier transform space, or
(in fact) in the space of any linear transformation of bu.
If Ci is a convex set, then Pi is called a nonexpansive projection operator onto
that set if (i) Pi leaves unchanged any bu already in Ci, and (ii) Pi maps any bu outside
Ci to the closest element of Ci, in the sense that
|Pibu âbu| â¤|bua âbu|
for all bua in Ci
(18.5.24)
While this deï¬nitionsounds complicated, examples are very simple: A nonexpansive
projection onto the set of positive buâs is âset all negative components of bu equal
to zero.â A nonexpansive projection onto the set of bu(x)âs bounded by uL(x) â¤
bu(x) â¤uU(x) is âset all values less than the lower bound equal to that bound, and
set all values greater than the upper bound equal to that bound.â A nonexpansive
projection onto functions with compact support is âzero the values outside of the
region of support.â
The usefulness of these deï¬nitions is the following remarkable theorem: Let C
be the intersection of m convex sets C1, C2, . . ., Cm. Then the iteration
bu(k+1) = (P1P2 Â· Â· Â·Pm)bu(k)
(18.5.25)
will converge to C from all starting points, as k ââ. Also, if C is empty (there
is no intersection), then the iteration will have no limit point. Application of this
theorem is called the method of projections onto convex sets or sometimes POCS [7].
A generalization of the POCS theorem is that the Piâs can be replaced by
a set of Tiâs,
Ti â¡1 + Î²i(Pi â1)
0 < Î²i < 2
(18.5.26)
A well-chosen set of Î²iâs can accelerate the convergence to the intersection set C.
Some inverse problems can be completely solved by iteration (18.5.25) alone!
For example, a problem that occurs in both astronomical imaging and X-ray
diffraction work is to recover an image given only the modulus of its Fourier
transform (equivalent to its power spectrum or autocorrelation) and not the phase.
Here three convex sets can be utilized: the set of all images whose Fourier transform
has the speciï¬ed modulus to within speciï¬ed error bounds; the set of all positive
images; and the set of all images with zero intensityoutside of some speciï¬ed region.
In this case the POCS iteration (18.5.25) cycles among these three, imposing each
constraint in turn; FFTs are used to get in and out of Fourier space each time the
Fourier constraint is imposed.
The speciï¬c application of POCS to constraints alternately in the spatial and
Fourier domains is also known as the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm [8]. While this
algorithm is non-expansive, and is frequently convergent in practice, it has not been
proved to converge in all cases [9]. In the phase-retrieval problem mentioned above,
the algorithm often âgets stuckâ on a plateau for many iterations before making
sudden, dramatic improvements. As many as 104 to 105 iterations are sometimes

necessary. (For âunstickingâ procedures, see [10].) The uniqueness of the solution
is also not well understood, although for two-dimensional images of reasonable
complexity it is believed to be unique.
Deterministic constraints can be incorporated, via projection operators, into
iterative methods of linear regularization. In particular, rearranging terms somewhat,
we can write the iteration (18.5.21) as
bu(k+1) = [1 âÏµÎ»H] Â· bu(k) + ÏµAT Â· (b âA Â· bu(k))
(18.5.27)
If the iteration is modiï¬ed by the insertion of projection operators at each step
bu(k+1) = (P1P2 Â· Â· Â· Pm)[1 âÏµÎ»H] Â· bu(k) + ÏµAT Â· (b âA Â· bu(k))
(18.5.28)

deterministic constraints. See [7] for references to more sophisticated, and faster

The Backus-Gilbert method [1,2] (see, e.g., [3] or [4] for summaries) differs from
other regularization methods in the nature of its functionals A and B. For B, the
method seeks to maximize the stability of the solution bu(x) rather than, in the ï¬rst
instance, its smoothness.

is also not well understood, although for two-dimensional images of reasonable
complexity it is believed to be unique.
Deterministic constraints can be incorporated, via projection operators, into
iterative methods of linear regularization. In particular, rearranging terms somewhat,
we can write the iteration (18.5.21) as
bu(k+1) = [1 âÏµÎ»H] Â· bu(k) + ÏµAT Â· (b âA Â· bu(k))

is used as a measure of how much the solution bu(x) varies as the data vary within
their measurement errors. Note that this variance is not the expected deviation of
bu(x) from the true u(x) â that will be constrained by A â but rather measures
the expected experiment-to-experiment scatter among estimates bu(x) if the whole
experiment were to be repeated many times.
For A the Backus-Gilbert method looks at the relationship between the solution
bu(x) and the true function u(x), and seeks to make the mapping between these as
close to the identity map as possible in the limit of error-free data. The method is
linear, so the relationship between bu(x) and u(x) can be written as
bu(x) =
Z
bÎ´(x, xâ²)u(xâ²)dxâ²
(18.6.2)
for some so-called resolution function or averaging kernel bÎ´(x, xâ²). The Backus-
Gilbert method seeks to minimize the width or spread of bÎ´ (that is, maximize the
resolving power). A is chosen to be some positive measure of the spread.
While Backus-Gilbertâs philosophyis thus rather different from that of Phillips-
Twomey and related methods, in practice the differences between the methods are
less than one might think.
A stable solution is almost inevitably bound to be
smooth: The wild, unstable oscillations that result from an unregularized solution
are always exquisitely sensitive to small changes in the data. Likewise, making
bu(x) close to u(x) inevitably will bring error-free data into agreement with the
model. Thus A and B play roles closely analogous to their corresponding roles
in the previous two sections.
The principal advantage of the Backus-Gilbert formulation is that it gives good
control over just those properties that it seeks to measure, namely stability and
resolving power. Moreover, in the Backus-Gilbert method, the choice of Î» (playing
its usual role of compromise between A and B) is conventionally made, or at least
can easily be made, before any actual data are processed. Oneâs uneasiness at making
a post hoc, and therefore potentiallysubjectively biased, choice of Î» is thus removed.
Backus-Gilbert is often recommended as the method of choice for designing, and
predicting the performance of, experiments that require data inversion.
Letâs see how this all works. Starting with equation (18.4.5),
ci â¡si + ni =
Z
ri(x)u(x)dx + ni
(18.6.3)
and building in linearity from the start, we seek a set of inverse response kernels
qi(x) such that
bu(x) =
X
i
qi(x)ci
(18.6.4)
is the desired estimator of u(x). It is useful to deï¬ne the integrals of the response
kernels for each data point,

Substituting equation (18.6.4) into equation (18.6.3), and comparing with equation
(18.6.2), we see that
bÎ´(x, xâ²) =
X
i
qi(x)ri(xâ²)

qi(x)Sijqj(x) = q(x) Â· S Â· q(x)

covariances (as when the errors on the ciâs are independent), then Sij = Î´ijÏ2
i
is diagonal.
We now need to deï¬ne a measure of the width or spread of bÎ´(x, xâ²) at each
value of x. While many choices are possible, Backus and Gilbert choose the second
moment of its square. This measure becomes the functional A,
A â¡w(x) =

Wij(x) â¡
Z
(xâ² âx)2ri(xâ²)rj(xâ²)dxâ²
(18.6.10)
The functions qi(x) are now determined by the minimization principle
minimize:

(18.6.11)
subject to the constraint (18.6.7) that q(x) Â· R = 1.
The solution of equation (18.6.11) is
q(x) =
[W(x) + Î»S]â1 Â· R
R Â· [W(x) + Î»S]â1 Â· R
(18.6.12)
(Reference [4] gives an accessible proof.)
For any particular data set c (set of
measurements ci), the solution bu(x) is thus
bu(x) = c Â· [W(x) + Î»S]â1 Â· R
R Â· [W(x) + Î»S]â1 Â· R

(Donât let this notation mislead you into inverting the full matrix W(x) + Î»S. You
only need to solve for some y the linear system (W(x) + Î»S) Â· y = R, and then
substitute y into both the numerators and denominators of 18.6.12 or 18.6.13.)
Equations (18.6.12) and (18.6.13) have a completely different character from
the linearly regularized solutionsto (18.5.7) and (18.5.8). The vectors and matrices in
(18.6.12) all have size N, the number of measurements. There is no discretization of
the underlying variable x, so M does not come into play at all. One solves a different
N Ã N set of linear equations for each desired value of x. By contrast, in (18.5.8),
one solves an M ÃM linear set, but only once. In general, the computational burden
of repeatedly solving linear systems makes the Backus-Gilbert method unsuitable
for other than one-dimensional problems.
How does one choose Î» within the Backus-Gilbert scheme?
As already
mentioned, you can (in some cases should) make the choice before you see any
actual data. For a given trial value of Î», and for a sequence of xâs, use equation
(18.6.12) to calculate q(x); then use equation (18.6.6) to plot the resolutionfunctions
bÎ´(x, xâ²) as a function of xâ².
These plots will exhibit the amplitude with which
different underlying values xâ² contribute to the point bu(x) of your estimate. For the
same value of Î», also plot the function
p
Var[bu(x)] using equation (18.6.8). (You
need an estimate of your measurement covariance matrix for this.)
As you change Î» you will see very explicitly the trade-off between resolution
and stability. Pick the value that meets your needs. You can even choose Î» to be a
function of x, Î» = Î»(x), in equations (18.6.12) and (18.6.13), should you desire to
do so. (This is one beneï¬t of solving a separate set of equations for each x.) For
the chosen value or values of Î», you now have a quantitative understanding of your
inverse solution procedure. This can prove invaluable if â once you are processing
real data â you need to judge whether a particular feature, a spike or jump for
example, is genuine, and/or is actually resolved. The Backus-Gilbert method has
found particular success among geophysicists, who use it to obtain information about
the structure of the Earth (e.g., density run with depth) from seismic travel time data.

also comment in passing that the connection between maximum entropy inversion
methods, considered here, and maximum entropy spectral estimation, discussed in
Â§13.7, is rather abstract. For practical purposes the two techniques, though both
named maximum entropy method or MEM, are unrelated.
Bayesâ Theorem, which follows from the standard axioms of probability,relates
the conditional probabilities of two events, say A and B:
Prob(A|B) = Prob(A) Prob(B|A)
Prob(B)
(18.7.1)
Here Prob(A|B) is the probability of A given that B has occurred, and similarly for
Prob(B|A), while Prob(A) and Prob(B) are unconditional probabilities.
âBayesiansâ (so-called) adopt a broader interpretation of probabilities than do
so-called âfrequentists.â
To a Bayesian, P (A|B) is a measure of the degree of
plausibility of A (given B) on a scale ranging from zero to one. In this broader view,
A and B need not be repeatable events; they can be propositions or hypotheses.
The equations of probability theory then become a set of consistent rules for
conducting inference [1,2]. Since plausibility is itself always conditioned on some,
perhaps unarticulated, set of assumptions, all Bayesian probabilities are viewed as
conditional on some collective background information I.
Suppose H is some hypothesis.
Even before there exist any explicit data,
a Bayesian can assign to H some degree of plausibility Prob(H|I), called the
âBayesian prior.â Now, when some data D1 comes along, Bayes theorem tells how
to reassess the plausibility of H,
Prob(H|D1I) = Prob(H|I)Prob(D1|HI)
Prob(D1|I)
(18.7.2)
The factor in the numerator on the right of equation (18.7.2) is calculable as the
probability of a data set given the hypothesis (compare with âlikelihoodâ in Â§15.1).
The denominator, called the âprior predictive probabilityâ of the data, is in this case
merely a normalization constant which can be calculated by the requirement that
the probability of all hypotheses should sum to unity. (In other Bayesian contexts,
the prior predictive probabilities of two qualitatively different models can be used
to assess their relative plausibility.)
If some additional data D2 comes along tomorrow, we can further reï¬ne our
estimate of Hâs probability, as
Prob(H|D2D1I) = Prob(H|D1I)Prob(D2|HD1I)
Prob(D1|D1I)
(18.7.3)
Using the product rule for probabilities, Prob(AB|C) = Prob(A|C)Prob(B|AC),
we ï¬nd that equations (18.7.2) and (18.7.3) imply
Prob(H|D2D1I) = Prob(H|I)Prob(D2D1|HI)
Prob(D2D1|I)
(18.7.4)
which shows that we would have gotten the same answer if all the data D1D2
had been taken together.

From a Bayesian perspective, inverse problems are inference problems [3,4].
The underlying parameter set u is a hypothesiswhose probability,given the measured
data values c, and the Bayesian prior Prob(u|I) can be calculated. We might want
to report a single âbestâ inverse u, the one that maximizes
Prob(u|cI) = Prob(c|uI)Prob(u|I)
Prob(c|I)
(18.7.5)
over all possible choices of u.
Bayesian analysis also admits the possibility of
reporting additional information that characterizes the region of possible uâs with
high relative probability, the so-called âposterior bubbleâ in u.
The calculation of the probability of the data c, given the hypothesis u proceeds
exactly as in the maximum likelihoodmethod. For Gaussian errors, e.g., it is given by
Prob(c|uI) = exp(â1
2Ï2)âu1âu2 Â· Â· Â· âuM
(18.7.6)
where Ï2 is calculated from u and c using equation (18.4.9), and the âuÂµâs are
constant, small ranges of the components of u whose actual magnitude is irrelevant,
because they do not depend on u (compare equations 15.1.3 and 15.1.4).
In maximum likelihood estimation we, in effect, chose the prior Prob(u|I) to
be constant. That was a luxury that we could afford when estimating a small number
of parameters from a large amount of data.
Here, the number of âparametersâ
(components of u) is comparable to or larger than the number of measured values
(components of c); we need to have a nontrivial prior, Prob(u|I), to resolve the
degeneracy of the solution.
In maximum entropy image restoration, that is where entropy comes in. The
entropy of a physical system in some macroscopic state, usually denoted S, is the
logarithm of the number of microscopically distinct conï¬gurations that all have
the same macroscopic observables (i.e., consistent with the observed macroscopic
state). Actually, we will ï¬nd it useful to denote the negative of the entropy, also
called the negentropy, by H â¡âS (a notation that goes back to Boltzmann). In
situations where there is reason to believe that the a priori probabilities of the
microscopic conï¬gurations are all the same (these situations are called ergodic), then
the Bayesian prior Prob(u|I) for a macroscopic state with entropy S is proportional
to exp(S) or exp(âH).
MEM uses this concept to assign a prior probability to any given underlying
function u. For example [5-7], suppose that the measurement of luminance in each
pixel is quantized to (in some units) an integer value. Let
U =
M
X
Âµ=1
uÂµ
(18.7.7)
be the total number of luminance quanta in the whole image. Then we can base our
âpriorâ on the notion that each luminance quantum has an equal a priori chance of
being in any pixel. (See [8] for a more abstract justiï¬cation of this idea.) The number
of ways of getting a particular conï¬guration u is

Here the left side can be understood as the number of distinct orderings of all
the luminance quanta, divided by the numbers of equivalent reorderings within
each pixel, while the right side follows by Stirlingâs approximation to the factorial
function. Taking the negative of the logarithm, and neglecting terms of order log U
in the presence of terms of order U, we get the negentropy

This ought to remind you of equation (18.4.11), or equation (18.5.6), or in fact any of
our previous minimization principles along the lines of A + Î»B, where Î»B = H(u)
is a regularizing operator. Where is Î»? We need to put it in for exactly the reason
discussed following equation (18.4.11): Degenerate inversions are likely to be able
to achieve unrealistically small values of Ï2. We need an adjustable parameter to
bring Ï2 into its expected narrow statistical range of N Â±(2N)1/2. The discussion at
the beginning of Â§18.4 showed that it makes no difference which term we attach the
Î» to. For consistency in notation, we absorb a factor 2 into Î» and put it on the entropy
term. (Another way to see the necessity of an undetermined Î» factor is to note that it
is necessary if our minimization principle is to be invariant under changing the units
in which u is quantized, e.g., if an 8-bit analog-to-digital converter is replaced by a
12-bit one.) We can now also put âhatsâ back to indicate that this is the procedure
for obtaining our chosen statistical estimator:
minimize:
A + Î»B = Ï2[bu] + Î»H(bu) = Ï2[bu] + Î»

Âµ=1
buÂµ ln(buÂµ)

(Formally, we might also add a second Lagrange multiplier Î»â²U, to constrain the
total intensity U to be constant.)
It is not hard to see that the negentropy, H(bu), is in fact a regularizing operator,
similar to bu Â· bu (equation 18.4.11) or bu Â· H Â· bu (equation 18.5.6). The following of
its properties are noteworthy:
1. When U is held constant, H(bu) is minimized for buÂµ = U/M = constant, so it
smooths in the sense of trying to achieve a constant solution, similar to equation
(18.5.4). The fact that the constant solution is a minimum follows from the fact
that the second derivative of u lnu is positive.

2. Unlike equation (18.5.4), however, H(bu) is local, in the sense that it does not
difference neighboring pixels. It simply sums some function f, here
f(u) = u lnu
(18.7.13)
over all pixels; it is invariant, in fact, under a complete scrambling of the pixels
in an image. This form implies that H(bu) is not seriously increased by the
occurrence of a small number of very bright pixels (point sources) embedded
in a low-intensity smooth background.
3. H(bu) goes to inï¬nite slope as any one pixel goes to zero. This causes it to
enforce positivityof the image, without the necessity of additional deterministic
constraints.
4. The biggest difference between H(bu) and the other regularizing operators that
we have met is that H(bu) is not a quadratic functional of bu, so the equations
obtained by varying equation (18.7.12) are nonlinear. This fact is itself worthy
of some additional discussion.
Nonlinear equations are harder to solve than linear equations.
For image
processing, however, the large number of equations usually dictates an iterative
solution procedure,even for linear equations,so the practical effect of the nonlinearity
is somewhat mitigated. Below, we will summarize some of the methods that are
successfully used for MEM inverse problems.
For some problems, notably the problem in radio-astronomy of image recovery
from an incomplete set of Fourier coefï¬cients, the superior performance of MEM
inversion can be, in part, traced to the nonlinearity of H(bu). One way to see this [5]
is to consider the limit of perfect measurements Ïi â0. In this case the Ï2 term in
the minimization principle (18.7.12) gets replaced by a set of constraints, each with
its own Lagrange multiplier, requiring agreement between model and data; that is,
minimize:

(18.7.14)
(cf. equation 18.4.7). Setting the formal derivative with respect to buÂµ to zero gives
âH
âbuÂµ

or deï¬ning a function G as the inverse function of fâ²,
buÂµ = G

ï£­X
j
Î»jRjÂµ
ï£¶
ï£¸
(18.7.16)
This solution is only formal, since the Î»jâs must be found by requiring that equation
(18.7.16) satisfy all the constraints built into equation (18.7.14). However, equation
(18.7.16) does show the crucial fact that ifG is linear,then the solution bucontains only
a linear combination of basis functions RjÂµ corresponding to actual measurements
j. This is equivalent to setting unmeasured cjâs to zero. Notice that the principal
solution obtained from equation (18.4.11) in fact has a linear G.

In the problem of incomplete Fourier image reconstruction, the typical RjÂµ
has the form exp(â2Ïikj Â· xÂµ), where xÂµ is a two-dimensional vector in the image
space and kÂµ is a two-dimensional wave-vector. If an image contains strong point
sources, then the effect of setting unmeasured cjâs to zero is to produce sidelobe
ripples throughout the image plane. These ripples can mask any actual extended,
low-intensity image features lying between the point sources. If, however, the slope
of G is smaller for small values of its argument, larger for large values, then ripples
in low-intensity portions of the image are relatively suppressed, while strong point
sources will be relatively sharpened (âsuperresolutionâ). This behavior on the slope
of G is equivalent to requiring fâ²â²â²(u) < 0. For f(u) = u ln u, we in fact have
fâ²â²â²(u) = â1/u2 < 0.
In more picturesque language, the nonlinearity acts to âcreateâ nonzero values
for the unmeasured ciâs, so as to suppress the low-intensity ripple and sharpen the
point sources.
Is MEM Really Magical?
How unique is the negentropy functional (18.7.9)? Recall that that equation is
based on the assumption that luminance elements are a priori distributed over the
pixels uniformly. If we instead had some other preferred a priori image in mind, one
with pixel intensities mÂµ, then it is easy to show that the negentropy becomes
H(u) =
M
X
Âµ=1
uÂµ ln(uÂµ/mÂµ) + constant
(18.7.17)
(the constant can then be ignored). All the rest of the discussion then goes through.
More fundamentally, and despite statements by zealots to the contrary [7], there
is actually nothing universal about the functional form f(u) = u ln u.
In some
other physical situations (for example, the entropy of an electromagnetic ï¬eld in the
limit of many photons per mode, as in radio-astronomy) the physical negentropy
functional is actually f(u) = âln u (see [5] for other examples). In general, the
question, âEntropy of what?â is not uniquely answerable in any particular situation.
(See reference [9] for an attempt at articulating a more general principle that reduces
to one or another entropy functional under appropriate circumstances.)
The four numbered properties summarized above, plus the desirable sign for
nonlinearity, fâ²â²â²(u) < 0, are all as true for f(u) = âln u as for f(u) = u lnu. In
fact these properties are shared by a nonlinear function as simple as f(u) = ââu,
which has no information theoretic justiï¬cation at all (no logarithms!).
MEM
reconstructions of test images using any of these entropy forms are virtually
indistinguishable [5].
By all available evidence, MEM seems to be neither more nor less than one
usefully nonlinear version of the general regularization scheme A+Î»B that we have
by now considered in many forms. Its peculiarities become strengths when applied
to the reconstruction from incomplete Fourier data of images that are expected
to be dominated by very bright point sources, but which also contain interesting
low-intensity, extended sources. For images of some other character, there is no
reason to suppose that MEM methods will generally dominate other regularization
schemes, either ones already known or yet to be invented.

Algorithms for MEM
The goal is to ï¬nd the vector bu that minimizes A + Î»B where in the notation
of equations (18.5.5), (18.5.6), and (18.7.13),
A = |b âA Â· bu|2
B =
X
Âµ
f(buÂµ)
(18.7.18)
Compared with a âgeneralâ minimization problem, we have the advantage that
we can compute the gradients and the second partial derivative matrices (Hessian
matrices) explicitly,
âA = 2(AT Â· A Â· bu âAT Â· b)
â2A
âbuÂµâbuÏ
= [2AT Â· A]ÂµÏ
[âB]Âµ = fâ²(buÂµ)
â2B
âbuÂµâbuÏ
= Î´ÂµÏfâ²â²(buÂµ)
(18.7.19)
It is important to note that while Aâs second partial derivative matrix cannot be
stored (its size is the square of the number of pixels), it can be applied to any vector
by ï¬rst applying A, then AT . In the case of reconstruction from incomplete Fourier
data, or in the case of convolution with a translation invariant point spread function,
these applications will typically involve several FFTs. Likewise, the calculation of
the gradient âA will involve FFTs in the application of A and AT .
While some success has been achieved with the classical conjugate gradient
method (Â§10.6), it is often found that the nonlinearity in f(u) = u lnu causes
problems. Attempted steps that give bu with even one negative value must be cut in
magnitude, sometimes so severely as to slow the solution to a crawl. The underlying
problem is that the conjugate gradient method develops its information about the
inverse of the Hessian matrix a bit at a time, while changing its location in the search
space. When a nonlinear function is quite different from a pure quadratic form, the
old information becomes obsolete before it gets usefully exploited.
Skilling and collaborators [6,7,10,11] developed a complicated but highly suc-
cessful scheme, wherein a minimum is repeatedly sought not along a single search
direction, but in a small- (typically three-) dimensional subspace, spanned by vectors
that are calculated anew at each landing point.
The subspace basis vectors are
chosen in such a way as to avoid directions leading to negative values. One of the
most successful choices is the three-dimensional subspace spanned by the vectors
with components given by
e(1)
Âµ
= buÂµ[âA]Âµ
e(2)
Âµ
= buÂµ[âB]Âµ
e(3)

(18.7.20)
(In these equationsthere is no sum over Âµ.) The form of the e(3) has some justiï¬cation
if one views dot products as occurring in a space with the metric gÂµÎ½ = Î´ÂµÎ½/uÂµ,
chosen to make zero values âfar awayâ; see [6].

Within the three-dimensional subspace, the three-component gradient and nine-
component Hessian matrix are computed by projection from the large space, and
the minimum in the subspace is estimated by (trivially) solving three simultaneous
linear equations, as in Â§10.7, equation (10.7.4). The size of a step âbu is required
to be limited by the inequality
X
Âµ
(âbuÂµ)2/buÂµ < (0.1 to 0.5)U
(18.7.21)
Because the gradient directions âA and âB are separately available, it is possible
to combine the minimum search with a simultaneous adjustment of Î» so as ï¬nally to
satisfy the desired constraint. There are various further tricks employed.
A less general, but in practice often equally satisfactory, approach is due to
Cornwell and Evans [12]. Here, noting that Bâs Hessian (second partial derivative)
matrix is diagonal, one asks whether there is a useful diagonal approximation to
Aâs Hessian, namely 2AT Â· A. If ÎÂµ denotes the diagonal components of such an
approximation, then a useful step in bu would be
âbuÂµ = â
1
ÎÂµ + Î»fâ²â²(buÂµ)(âA + Î»âB)
(18.7.22)
(again compare equation 10.7.4). Even more extreme, one might seek an approx-
imation with constant diagonal elements, ÎÂµ = Î, so that
âbuÂµ = â
1
Î + Î»fâ²â²(buÂµ)(âA + Î»âB)
(18.7.23)
Since AT Â· A has something of the nature of a doubly convolved point spread
function, and since in real cases one often has a point spread function with a sharp
central peak, even the more extreme of these approximations is often fruitful. One
starts with a rough estimate of Î obtained from the AiÂµâs, e.g.,
Î â¼
*X
i
[AiÂµ]2
+
(18.7.24)
An accurate value is not important, since in practice Î is adjusted adaptively: If Î
is too large, then equation (18.7.23)âs steps will be too small (that is, larger steps in
the same direction will produce even greater decrease in A + Î»B). If Î is too small,
then attempted steps will land in an unfeasible region (negative values of buÂµ), or will
result in an increased A+Î»B. There is an obvious similarity between the adjustment
of Î here and the Levenberg-Marquardt method of Â§15.5; this should not be too
surprising, since MEM is closely akin to the problem of nonlinear least-squares
ï¬tting. Reference [12] also discusses how the value of Î + Î»fâ²â²(buÂµ) can be used to
adjust the Lagrange multiplier Î» so as to converge to the desired value of Ï2.
All practical MEM algorithms are found to require on the order of 30 to 50
iterations to converge. This convergence behavior is not now understood in any
fundamental way.
âBayesianâ versus âHistoricâ Maximum Entropy
Several more recent developments in maximum entropy image restoration
go under the rubric âBayesianâ to distinguish them from the previous âhistoricâ
methods. See [13] for details and references.

â¢ Better priors: We already noted that the entropy functional (equation
18.7.13) is invariant under scrambling all pixels and has no notion of
smoothness. The so-called âintrinsic correlation functionâ (ICF) model
(Ref. [13], where it is called âNew MaxEntâ) is similar enough to the
entropy functional to allow similar algorithms, but it makes the values of
neighboring pixels correlated, enforcing smoothness.
â¢ Better estimation of Î»: Above we chose Î» to bring Ï2 into its expected
narrow statistical range of N Â± (2N)1/2. This in effect overestimates Ï2,
however, since some effective number Î³ of parameters are being âï¬ttedâ
in doing the reconstruction. A Bayesian approach leads to a self-consistent
estimate of this Î³ and an objectively better choice for Î».

Chapter 19.
Partial Differential
Equations
19.0 Introduction
The numerical treatment of partial differential equations is, by itself, a vast
subject.
Partial differential equations are at the heart of many, if not most,
computer analyses or simulations of continuous physical systems, such as ï¬uids,
electromagnetic ï¬elds, the human body, and so on. The intent of this chapter is to
give the briefest possible useful introduction. Ideally, there wouldbe an entire second
volume of Numerical Recipes dealing with partial differential equations alone. (The
references [1-4] provide, of course, available alternatives.)
In most mathematics books, partial differential equations (PDEs) are classiï¬ed
into the three categories, hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic, on the basis of their
characteristics, or curves of information propagation. The prototypical example of
a hyperbolic equation is the one-dimensional wave equation
â2u
ât2 = v2 â2u
âx2
(19.0.1)
where v = constant is the velocity of wave propagation. The prototypical parabolic
equation is the diffusion equation
âu
ât = â
âx

Dâu
âx

(19.0.2)
where D is the diffusion coefï¬cient.
The prototypical elliptic equation is the
Poisson equation
â2u
âx2 + â2u
ây2 = Ï(x, y)
(19.0.3)
where the source term Ï is given. If the source term is equal to zero, the equation
is Laplaceâs equation.
From a computational point of view, the classiï¬cation into these three canonical
types is not very meaningful â or at least not as important as some other essential
distinctions. Equations (19.0.1) and (19.0.2) both deï¬ne initial value or Cauchy
problems: If information on u (perhaps including time derivative information) is

previous rows need be maintained in memory. In (b), boundary values are speciï¬ed around the edge of
a grid, and an iterative process is employed to ï¬nd the values of all the internal points (open circles).
All grid points must be maintained in memory.
given at some initial time t0 for all x, then the equations describe how u(x, t)
propagates itself forward in time. In other words, equations (19.0.1) and (19.0.2)
describe time evolution. The goal of a numerical code should be to track that time
evolution with some desired accuracy.
By contrast, equation (19.0.3) directs us to ï¬nd a single âstaticâ function u(x, y)
which satisï¬es the equation within some (x, y) region of interest, and which â one
must also specify â has some desired behavior on the boundary of the region of
interest. These problems are called boundary value problems. In general it is not

possible stably to just âintegrate in from the boundaryâ in the same sense that an
initial value problem can be âintegrated forward in time.â Therefore, the goal of a
numerical code is somehow to converge on the correct solution everywhere at once.
This, then, is the most important classiï¬cation from a computational point
of view: Is the problem at hand an initial value (time evolution) problem?
or
is it a boundary value (static solution) problem?
Figure 19.0.1 emphasizes the
distinction. Notice that while the italicized terminology is standard, the terminology
in parentheses is a much better description of the dichotomy from a computational
perspective.
The subclassiï¬cation of initial value problems into parabolic and
hyperbolic is much less important because (i) many actual problems are of a mixed
type, and (ii) as we will see, most hyperbolic problems get parabolic pieces mixed
into them by the time one is discussing practical computational schemes.
Initial Value Problems
An initial value problem is deï¬ned by answers to the following questions:
â¢ What are the dependent variables to be propagated forward in time?
â¢ What is the evolution equation for each variable? Usually the evolution
equations will all be coupled, with more than one dependent variable
appearing on the right-hand side of each equation.
â¢ What is the highest time derivative that occurs in each variableâs evolution
equation?
If possible, this time derivative should be put alone on the
equationâs left-hand side. Not only the value of a variable, but also the
value of all its time derivatives â up to the highest one â must be
speciï¬ed to deï¬ne the evolution.
â¢ What special equations (boundary conditions)govern the evolutionin time
of points on the boundary of the spatial region of interest? Examples:
Dirichlet conditionsspecify the values of the boundary points as a function
of time; Neumann conditions specify the values of the normal gradients on
the boundary; outgoing-wave boundary conditions are just what they say.
Sections 19.1â19.3 of this chapter deal with initial value problems of several
different forms. We make no pretence of completeness, but rather hope to convey a
certain amount of generalizable information through a few carefully chosen model
examples.
These examples will illustrate an important point: Oneâs principal
computational concern must be the stability of the algorithm. Many reasonable-
looking algorithms for initial value problems just donât work â they are numerically
unstable.
Boundary Value Problems
The questions that deï¬ne a boundary value problem are:
â¢ What are the variables?
â¢ What equations are satisï¬ed in the interior of the region of interest?
â¢ What equations are satisï¬ed by points on the boundary of the region of
interest? (Here Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are possible choices for
ellipticsecond-order equations, but more complicated boundaryconditions
can also be encountered.)

In contrast to initial value problems, stability is relatively easy to achieve
for boundary value problems.
Thus, the efï¬ciency of the algorithms, both in
computational load and storage requirements, becomes the principal concern.
Because all the conditions on a boundary value problem must be satisï¬ed
âsimultaneously,â these problems usually boil down, at least conceptually, to the
solutionof large numbers of simultaneous algebraic equations. When such equations
are nonlinear, they are usually solved by linearization and iteration; so without much
loss of generality we can view the problem as being the solution of special, large
linear sets of equations.
As an example, one which we will refer to in Â§Â§19.4â19.6 as our âmodel
problem,â let us consider the solution of equation (19.0.3) by the ï¬nite-difference
method. We represent the function u(x, y) by its values at the discrete set of points
xj = x0 + jâ,
j = 0, 1, ..., J
yl = y0 + lâ,
l = 0, 1, ..., L
(19.0.4)
where âis the grid spacing. From now on, we will write uj,l for u(xj, yl), and
Ïj,l for Ï(xj, yl). For (19.0.3) we substitute a ï¬nite-difference representation (see
Figure 19.0.2),
uj+1,l â2uj,l + ujâ1,l
â2
+ uj,l+1 â2uj,l + uj,lâ1
â2
= Ïj,l
(19.0.5)
or equivalently
uj+1,l + ujâ1,l + uj,l+1 + uj,lâ1 â4uj,l = â2Ïj,l
(19.0.6)
To write this system of linear equations in matrix form we need to make a
vector out of u.
Let us number the two dimensions of grid points in a single
one-dimensional sequence by deï¬ning
i â¡j(L + 1) + l
for
j = 0, 1, ..., J,
l = 0, 1, ..., L
(19.0.7)
In other words, i increases most rapidly along the columns representing y values.
Equation (19.0.6) now becomes
ui+L+1 + uiâ(L+1) + ui+1 + uiâ1 â4ui = â2Ïi
(19.0.8)
This equation holds only at the interior points j = 1, 2, ..., J â1; l = 1, 2, ...,
L â1.
The points where
j = 0
j = J
l = 0
l = L
[i.e., i = 0, ..., L]
[i.e., i = J(L + 1), ..., J(L + 1) + L]
[i.e., i = 0, L + 1, ..., J(L + 1)]
[i.e., i = L, L + 1 + L, ..., J(L + 1) + L]

all this âknownâ information over to the right-hand side of equation (19.0.8), then
the equation takes the form

be constants.
As a rough classiï¬cation, there are three different approaches to the solution
of equation (19.0.10), not all applicable in all cases: relaxation methods, ârapidâ
methods (e.g., Fourier methods), and direct matrix methods.

Figure 19.0.3. Matrix structure derived from a second-order elliptic equation (here equation 19.0.6). All
elements not shown are zero. The matrix has diagonal blocks that are themselves tridiagonal, and sub-
and super-diagonal blocks that are diagonal. This form is called âtridiagonal with fringes.â A matrix this
sparse would never be stored in its full form as shown here.
Relaxation methods make immediate use of the structure of the sparse matrix
A.
The matrix is split into two parts
A = E âF
(19.0.12)
where E is easily invertible and F is the remainder. Then (19.0.10) becomes
E Â· u = F Â· u + b
(19.0.13)
The relaxation method involves choosing an initial guess u(0) and then solving
successively for iterates u(r) from
E Â· u(r) = F Â· u(râ1) + b
(19.0.14)
Since E is chosen to be easily invertible, each iteration is fast. We will discuss
relaxation methods in some detail in Â§19.5 and Â§19.6.

So-called rapid methods [5] apply for only a rather special class of equations:
those with constant coefï¬cients, or, more generally, those that are separable in the
chosen coordinates. In addition, the boundaries must coincide with coordinate lines.
This special class of equations is met quite often in practice. We defer detailed
discussion to Â§19.4. Note, however, that the multigrid relaxation methods discussed
in Â§19.6 can be faster than ârapidâ methods.
Matrix methods attempt to solve the equation
A Â· x = b
(19.0.15)
directly. The degree to which this is practical depends very strongly on the exact
structure of the matrix A for the problem at hand, so our discussion can go no farther
than a few remarks and references at this point.
Sparseness of the matrix must be the guiding force.
Otherwise the matrix
problem is prohibitively large. For example, the simplest problem on a 100 Ã 100
spatial grid would involve 10000 unknown uj,lâs, implying a 10000 Ã 10000 matrix
A, containing 108 elements!
As we discussed at the end of Â§2.7, if A is symmetric and positive deï¬nite
(as it usually is in elliptic problems), the conjugate-gradient algorithm can be
used.
In practice, rounding error often spoils the effectiveness of the conjugate
gradient algorithm for solving ï¬nite-difference equations.
However, it is useful
when incorporated in methods that ï¬rst rewrite the equations so that A is transformed
to a matrix Aâ² that is close to the identitymatrix. The quadratic surface deï¬ned by the
equations then has almost spherical contours, and the conjugate gradient algorithm
works very well.
In Â§2.7, in the routine linbcg, an analogous preconditioner
was exploited for non-positive deï¬nite problems with the more general biconjugate
gradient method. For the positive deï¬nite case that arises in PDEs, an example of
a successful implementation is the incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient method
(ICCG) (see [6-8]).
Another method that relies on a transformation approach is the strongly implicit
procedure of Stone [9]. A program called SIPSOL that implements this routine has
been published [10].
A third class of matrix methods is the Analyze-Factorize-Operate approach as
described in Â§2.7.
Generally speaking, when you have the storage available to implement these
methods â not nearly as much as the 108 above, but usually much more than is
required by relaxation methods â then you should consider doing so. Only multigrid
relaxation methods (Â§19.6) are competitive with the best matrix methods. For grids
larger than, say, 300 Ã 300, however, it is generally found that only relaxation
methods, or ârapidâ methods when they are applicable, are possible.
There Is More to Life than Finite Differencing
Besides ï¬nite differencing, there are other methods for solving PDEs. Most
important are ï¬nite element, Monte Carlo, spectral, and variational methods. Unfor-
tunately, we shall barely be able to do justice to ï¬nite differencing in this chapter,
and so shall not be able to discuss these other methods in this book. Finite element
methods [11-12] are often preferred by practitioners in solid mechanics and structural

functions; they converge more rapidly than ï¬nite-difference methods (cf. Â§19.4), but
they do not work well for problems with discontinuities.

(The physicist-reader may recognize equations (19.1.3) as analogous to Maxwellâs
equations for one-dimensional propagation of electromagnetic waves.)
We will consider, in this section, a prototypical example of the general ï¬ux-
conservative equation (19.1.1), namely the equation for a scalar u,
âu
ât = âvâu
âx
(19.1.6)
with v a constant. As it happens, we already know analytically that the general
solution of this equation is a wave propagating in the positive x-direction,
u = f(x âvt)
(19.1.7)
where f is an arbitrary function. However, the numerical strategies that we develop
will be equally applicable to the more general equations represented by (19.1.1). In
some contexts, equation (19.1.6) is called an advective equation, because the quantity
u is transported by a âï¬uid ï¬owâ with a velocity v.
How do we go about ï¬nite differencing equation (19.1.6) (or, analogously,
19.1.1)? The straightforward approach is to choose equally spaced points along both
the t- and x-axes.
Thus denote
xj = x0 + jâx,
j = 0, 1, . . ., J
tn = t0 + nât,
n = 0, 1, . . ., N
(19.1.8)
Let un
j denote u(tn, xj). We have several choices for representing the time
derivative term. The obvious way is to set

This is called forward Euler differencing (cf. equation 16.1.1). While forward Euler
is only ï¬rst-order accurate in ât, it has the advantage that one is able to calculate

that are used to calculate spatial derivatives; the dashed lines connect points that are used to calculate time
derivatives. The FTCS scheme is generally unstable for hyperbolic problems and cannotusually be used.

which can easily be rearranged to be a formula for un+1
j
in terms of the other
quantities. The FTCS scheme is illustrated in Figure 19.1.1. Itâs a ï¬ne example of
an algorithm that is easy to derive, takes little storage, and executes quickly. Too
bad it doesnât work!
(See below.)
The FTCS representation is an explicit scheme. This means that un+1
j
for each
j can be calculated explicitly from the quantities that are already known. Later we
shall meet implicit schemes, which require us to solve implicit equations coupling
the un+1
j
for various j.
(Explicit and implicit methods for ordinary differential
equations were discussed in Â§16.6.) The FTCS algorithm is also an example of
a single-level scheme, since only values at time level n have to be stored to ï¬nd
values at time level n + 1.
von Neumann Stability Analysis
Unfortunately, equation (19.1.11) is of very limited usefulness. It is an unstable
method, which can be used only (if at all) to study waves for a short fraction of one
oscillation period. To ï¬nd alternative methods with more general applicability, we
must introduce the von Neumann stability analysis.
The von Neumann analysis is local: We imagine that the coefï¬cients of the
difference equations are so slowly varying as to be considered constant in space
and time. In that case, the independent solutions, or eigenmodes, of the difference
equations are all of the form

j = Î¾neikjâx

criterion for this scheme is the Courant condition.
where k is a real spatial wave number (which can have any value) and Î¾ = Î¾(k) is
a complex number that depends on k. The key fact is that the time dependence of
a single eigenmode is nothing more than successive integer powers of the complex
number Î¾.
Therefore, the difference equations are unstable (have exponentially
growing modes) if |Î¾(k)| > 1 for some k. The number Î¾ is called the ampliï¬cation
factor at a given wave number k.
To ï¬nd Î¾(k), we simply substitute (19.1.12) back into (19.1.11).
Dividing
by Î¾n, we get
Î¾(k) = 1 âivât
âx sin kâx
(19.1.13)
whose modulus is > 1 for all k; so the FTCS scheme is unconditionally unstable.
If the velocity v were a function of t and x, then we would write vn
j in equation
(19.1.11). In the von Neumann stability analysis we would still treat v as a constant,
the idea being that for v slowly varying the analysis is local. In fact, even in the
case of strictly constant v, the von Neumann analysis does not rigorously treat the
end effects at j = 0 and j = N.
More generally, if the equationâs right-hand side were nonlinear in u, then a
von Neumann analysis would linearize by writing u = u0 + Î´u, expanding to linear
order in Î´u. Assuming that the u0 quantities already satisfy the difference equation
exactly, the analysis would look for an unstable eigenmode of Î´u.
Despite its lack of rigor, the von Neumann method generally gives valid
answers and is much easier to apply than more careful methods. We accordingly
adopt it exclusively. (See, for example, [1] for a discussion of other methods of
stability analysis.)
Lax Method
The instabilityin the FTCS method can be cured by a simple change due to Lax.

j in the time derivative term by its average (Figure 19.1.2):

Figure 19.1.3.
Courant condition for stability of a differencing scheme. The solution of a hyperbolic
problem at a point depends on information within some domain of dependency to the past, shown here
shaded. The differencing scheme (19.1.15) has its own domain of dependency determined by the choice
of points on one time slice (shown as connected solid dots) whose values are used in determining a new
point (shown connected by dashed lines). A differencing scheme is Courant stable if the differencing
domain of dependency is larger than that of the PDEs, as in (a), and unstable if the relationship is the
reverse, as in (b). For more complicated differencing schemes, the domain of dependency might not be
determined simply by the outermost points.
Substituting equation (19.1.12), we ï¬nd for the ampliï¬cation factor
Î¾ = cos kâx âivât
âx sin kâx
(19.1.16)
The stability condition |Î¾|2 â¤1 leads to the requirement
|v|ât
âx
â¤1
(19.1.17)
This
is the
famous
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability criterion,
often
called simply the Courant condition.
Intuitively, the stability condition can be
understood as follows (Figure 19.1.3): The quantity un+1
j
in equation (19.1.15) is
computed from information at points j â1 and j + 1 at time n. In other words,
xjâ1 and xj+1 are the boundariesof the spatial region that is allowed tocommunicate
information to un+1
j
. Now recall that in the continuum wave equation, information
actually propagates with a maximum velocity v. If the point un+1
j
is outside of
the shaded region in Figure 19.1.3, then it requires information from points more
distant than the differencing scheme allows. Lack of that information gives rise to
an instability. Therefore, ât cannot be made too large.
The surprising result, that the simple replacement (19.1.14) stabilizes the FTCS
scheme, is our ï¬rst encounter with the fact that differencing PDEs is an art as much
as a science.
To see if we can demystify the art somewhat, let us compare the
FTCS and Lax schemes by rewriting equation (19.1.15) so that it is in the form of
equation (19.1.11) with a remainder term:
un+1

where â2 = â2/âx2 in one dimension. We have, in effect, added a diffusion term to
the equation, or, if you recall the form of the Navier-Stokes equation for viscous ï¬uid
ï¬ow, a dissipative term. The Lax scheme is thus said to have numerical dissipation,
or numerical viscosity. We can see this also in the ampliï¬cation factor. Unless |v|ât
is exactly equal to âx, |Î¾| < 1 and the amplitude of the wave decreases spuriously.
Isnât a spurious decrease as bad as a spurious increase? No. The scales that we
hope to study accurately are those that encompass many grid points, so that they have
kâx âª1. (The spatial wave number k is deï¬ned by equation 19.1.12.) For these
scales, the ampliï¬cation factor can be seen to be very close to one, in both the stable
and unstable schemes. The stable and unstable schemes are therefore about equally
accurate. For the unstable scheme, however, short scales with kâx â¼1, which we
are not interested in, will blow up and swamp the interesting part of the solution.
Much better to have a stable scheme in which these short wavelengths die away
innocuously. Both the stable and the unstable schemes are inaccurate for these short
wavelengths, but the inaccuracy is of a tolerable character when the scheme is stable.
When the independent variable u is a vector, then the von Neumann analysis
is slightly more complicated.
For example, we can consider equation (19.1.3),
rewritten as
â
ât

r
s

j+1 + sn
jâ1) + vât
2âx(rn

(19.1.22)
Here the vector on the right-hand side is a constant (both in space and in time)
eigenvector, and Î¾ is a complex number, as before.
Substituting (19.1.22) into
(19.1.21), and dividing by the power Î¾n, gives the homogeneous vector equation

This admits a solution only if the determinant of the matrix on the left vanishes, a
condition easily shown to yield the two roots Î¾
Î¾ = cos kâx Â± ivât

(19.1.24)
The stability condition is that both roots satisfy |Î¾| â¤1. This again turns out to be
simply the Courant condition (19.1.17).

Other Varieties of Error
Thus far we have been concerned with amplitude error, because of its intimate
connection with the stability or instability of a differencing scheme. Other varieties
of error are relevant when we shift our concern to accuracy, rather than stability.
Finite-difference schemes for hyperbolic equations can exhibit dispersion, or
phase errors. For example, equation (19.1.16) can be rewritten as
Î¾ = eâikâx + i

1 âvât
âx

sin kâx
(19.1.25)
An arbitrary initial wave packet is a superposition of modes with different kâs.
At each timestep the modes get multiplied by different phase factors (19.1.25),
depending on their value of k. If ât = âx/v, then the exact solution for each mode
of a wave packet f(xâvt) is obtained if each mode gets multipliedby exp(âikâx).
For this value of ât, equation (19.1.25) shows that the ï¬nite-difference solution
gives the exact analytic result. However, if vât/âx is not exactly 1, the phase
relations of the modes can become hopelessly garbled and the wave packet disperses.
Note from (19.1.25) that the dispersion becomes large as soon as the wavelength
becomes comparable to the grid spacing âx.
A third type of error is one associated with nonlinear hyperbolic equations and
is therefore sometimes called nonlinear instability. For example, a piece of the Euler
or Navier-Stokes equations for ï¬uid ï¬ow looks like
âv
ât = âv âv
âx + . . .
(19.1.26)
The nonlinear term in v can cause a transfer of energy in Fourier space from
long wavelengths to short wavelengths. This results in a wave proï¬le steepening
until a vertical proï¬le or âshockâ develops.
Since the von Neumann analysis
suggests that the stability can depend on kâx, a scheme that was stable for shallow
proï¬les can become unstable for steep proï¬les. This kind of difï¬culty arises in
a differencing scheme where the cascade in Fourier space is halted at the shortest
wavelength representable on the grid, that is, at k â¼1/âx.
If energy simply
accumulates in these modes, it eventually swamps the energy in the long wavelength
modes of interest.
Nonlinear instability and shock formation is thus somewhat controlled by
numerical viscosity such as that discussed in connection with equation (19.1.18)
above. In some ï¬uid problems,however, shock formation is not merely an annoyance,
but an actual physical behavior of the ï¬uid whose detailed study is a goal. Then,
numerical viscosity alone may not be adequate or sufï¬ciently controllable. This is a
complicated subject which we discuss further in the subsection on ï¬uid dynamics,
below.
For wave equations, propagation errors (amplitude or phase) are usually most
worrisome. For advective equations, on the other hand, transport errors are usually
of greater concern.
In the Lax scheme, equation (19.1.15), a disturbance in the
advected quantity u at mesh point j propagates to mesh points j + 1 and j â1 at
the next timestep. In reality, however, if the velocity v is positive then only mesh
point j + 1 should be affected.

Representation of upwind differencing schemes. The upper scheme is stable when the
advection constant v is negative, as shown; the lower scheme is stable when the advection constant v is
positive, also as shown. The Courant condition must, of course, also be satisï¬ed.

(19.1.27)
Note that this scheme is only ï¬rst-order, not second-order, accurate in the
calculation of the spatial derivatives.
How can it be âbetterâ?
The answer is
one that annoys the mathematicians: The goal of numerical simulations is not
always âaccuracyâ in a strictly mathematical sense, but sometimes âï¬delityâ to the
underlying physics in a sense that is looser and more pragmatic. In such contexts,
some kinds of error are much more tolerable than others.
Upwind differencing
generally adds ï¬delity to problems where the advected variables are liable to undergo
sudden changes of state, e.g., as they pass through shocks or other discontinuities.
You will have to be guided by the speciï¬c nature of your own problem.
For the differencingscheme (19.1.27), the ampliï¬cation factor (for constant v) is
Î¾ = 1 â

 (1 âcos kâx) âivât

So the stability criterion |Î¾|2 â¤1 is (again) simply the Courant condition (19.1.17).
There are various ways of improving the accuracy of ï¬rst-order upwind
differencing. In the continuum equation, material originally a distance vât away

arrives at a given point after a time interval ât.
In the ï¬rst-order method, the
material always arrives from âx away. If vât âªâx (to insure accuracy), this can
cause a large error. One way of reducing this error is to interpolate u between j â1
and j before transporting it. This gives effectively a second-order method. Various
schemes for second-order upwind differencing are discussed and compared in [2-3].
Second-Order Accuracy in Time
When using a method that is ï¬rst-order accurate in time but second-order
accurate in space, one generally has to take vât signiï¬cantly smaller than âx to
achieve desired accuracy, say, by at least a factor of 5. Thus the Courant condition
is not actually the limiting factor with such schemes in practice. However, there are
schemes that are second-order accurate in both space and time, and these can often be
pushed right to their stability limit, with correspondingly smaller computation times.
For example, the staggered leapfrog method for the conservation equation
(19.1.1) is deï¬ned as follows (Figure 19.1.5): Using the values of un at time tn,
compute the ï¬uxes F n
j . Then compute new values un+1 using the time-centered
values of the ï¬uxes:
un+1
j
âunâ1
j
= âât
âx(F n
j+1 âF n
jâ1)
(19.1.30)
The name comes from the fact that the time levels in the time derivative term
âleapfrogâ over the time levels in the space derivative term. The method requires
that unâ1 and un be stored to compute un+1.
For our simple model equation (19.1.6), staggered leapfrog takes the form
un+1
j
âunâ1
j
= âvât
âx (un
j+1 âun
jâ1)
(19.1.31)

(19.1.33)
Thus the Courant condition is again required for stability.
In fact, in equation
(19.1.33), |Î¾|2 = 1 for any vât â¤âx. This is the great advantage of the staggered
leapfrog method: There is no amplitude dissipation.
Staggered leapfrog differencing of equations like (19.1.20) is most transparent
if the variables are centered on appropriate half-mesh points:
rn

(19.1.34)
This is purely a notational convenience: we can think of the mesh on which r and
s are deï¬ned as being twice as ï¬ne as the mesh on which the original variable u is
deï¬ned. The leapfrog differencing of equation (19.1.20) is

(19.1.35)
If you substitute equation (19.1.22) in equation (19.1.35), you will ï¬nd that once
again the Courant condition is required for stability, and that there is no amplitude
dissipation when it is satisï¬ed.
If we substitute equation (19.1.34) in equation (19.1.35), we ï¬nd that equation
(19.1.35) is equivalent to
un+1

j + unâ1

j+1 â2un

(19.1.36)
This is just the âusualâ second-order differencing of the wave equation (19.1.2). We
see that it is a two-level scheme, requiring both un and unâ1 to obtain un+1. In
equation (19.1.35) this shows up as both snâ1/2 and rn being needed to advance
the solution.
For equations more complicated than our simple model equation, especially
nonlinear equations, the leapfrog method usually becomes unstable when the gradi-
ents get large. The instability is related to the fact that odd and even mesh points are
completely decoupled, like the black and white squares of a chess board, as shown

mesh-coupling piece.
in Figure 19.1.6. This mesh drifting instability is cured by coupling the two meshes
through a numerical viscosity term, e.g., adding to the right side of (19.1.31) a small
coefï¬cient (âª1) times un

j + un
jâ1. For more on stabilizing difference
schemes by adding numerical dissipation, see, e.g., [4].
The Two-Step Lax-Wendroff scheme is a second-order in time method that
avoids large numerical dissipation and mesh drifting.
One deï¬nes intermediate
values uj+1/2 at the half timesteps tn+1/2 and the half mesh points xj+1/2. These
are calculated by the Lax scheme:

Then
Î¾ = 1 âiÎ± sin kâx âÎ±2(1 âcos kâx)

so
|Î¾|2 = 1 âÎ±2(1 âÎ±2)(1 âcos kâx)2
(19.1.42)
The stability criterion |Î¾|2 â¤1 is therefore Î±2 â¤1, or vât â¤âx as usual.
Incidentally, you should not think that the Courant condition is the only stability
requirement that ever turns up in PDEs. It keeps doing so in our model examples
just because those examples are so simple in form.
The method of analysis is,
however, general.
Except when Î± = 1, |Î¾|2 < 1 in (19.1.42), so some amplitude damping does
occur. The effect is relatively small, however, for wavelengths large compared with
the mesh size âx. If we expand (19.1.42) for small kâx, we ï¬nd

with equation (19.1.16) for the Lax method, which shows that

In summary, our recommendation for initial value problems that can be cast
in ï¬ux-conservative form, and especially problems related to the wave equation,
is to use the staggered leapfrog method when possible. We have personally had
better success with it than with the Two-Step Lax-Wendroff method. For problems
sensitive to transport errors, upwind differencing or one of its reï¬nements should
be considered.
Fluid Dynamics with Shocks
As we alluded to earlier, the treatment of ï¬uid dynamics problems with shocks
has become a very complicated and very sophisticated subject. All we can attempt
to do here is to guide you to some starting points in the literature.
There are basically three important general methods for handling shocks. The
oldest and simplest method, invented by von Neumann and Richtmyer, is to add
artiï¬cial viscosity to the equations, modeling the way Nature uses real viscosity
to smooth discontinuities. A good starting point for trying out this method is the
differencing scheme in Â§12.11 of [1]. This scheme is excellent for nearly all problems
in one spatial dimension.
The second method combines a high-order differencing scheme that is accurate
for smooth ï¬ows with a low order scheme that is very dissipative and can smooth
the shocks. Typically, various upwind differencing schemes are combined using
weights chosen to zero the low order scheme unless steep gradients are present, and
also chosen to enforce various âmonotonicityâ constraints that prevent nonphysical
oscillations from appearing in the numerical solution. References [2-3,5] are a good
place to start with these methods.
The third, and potentially most powerful method, is Godunovâs approach. Here
one gives up the simple linearization inherent in ï¬nite differencing based on Taylor
series and includes the nonlinearity of the equations explicitly. There is an analytic
solution for the evolutionof two uniformstates of a ï¬uid separated by a discontinuity,
the Riemann shock problem. Godunovâs idea was to approximate the ï¬uid by a
large number of cells of uniform states, and piece them together using the Riemann
solution. There have been many generalizations of Godunovâs approach, of which
the most powerful is probably the PPM method [6].
Readable reviews of all these methods, discussing the difï¬culties arising when
one-dimensional methods are generalized to multidimensions, are given in [7-9].

The physical interpretation of the restriction (19.2.6) is that the maximum
allowed timestep is, up to a numerical factor, the diffusion time across a cell of
width âx.
More generally, the diffusion time Ï across a spatial scale of size Î» is of order
Ï â¼Î»2
D
(19.2.7)
Usually we are interested in modeling accurately the evolution of features with
spatial scales Î» â«âx. If we are limited to timesteps satisfying (19.2.6), we will
need to evolve through of order Î»2/(âx)2 steps before things start to happen on the
scale of interest. This number of steps is usually prohibitive. We must therefore
ï¬nd a stable way of taking timesteps comparable to, or perhaps â for accuracy â
somewhat smaller than, the time scale of (19.2.7).
This goal poses an immediate âphilosophicalâ question. Obviously the large
timesteps that we propose to take are going to be woefully inaccurate for the small
scales that we have decided not to be interested in. We want those scales to do
something stable, âinnocuous,â and perhaps not too physically unreasonable. We
want to build this innocuous behavior into our differencing scheme. What should
it be?
There are two different answers, each of which has its pros and cons. The
ï¬rst answer is to seek a differencing scheme that drives small-scale features to their
equilibrium forms, e.g., satisfying equation (19.2.3) with the left-hand side set to
zero. This answer generally makes the best physical sense; but, as we will see, it leads
to a differencing scheme (âfully implicitâ) that is only ï¬rst-order accurate in time for
the scales that we are interested in. The second answer is to let small-scale features
maintain their initial amplitudes, so that the evolution of the larger-scale features
of interest takes place superposed with a kind of âfrozen inâ (though ï¬uctuating)
background of small-scale stuff. This answer gives a differencing scheme (âCrank-
Nicholsonâ) that is second-order accurate in time. Toward the end of an evolution
calculation, however, one might want to switch over to some steps of the other kind,
to drive the small-scale stuff into equilibrium. Let us now see where these distinct
differencing schemes come from:
Consider the following differencing of (19.2.3),

un+1
j+1 â2un+1

(19.2.8)
This is exactly like the FTCS scheme (19.2.4), except that the spatial derivatives on
the right-hand side are evaluated at timestep n + 1. Schemes with this character are
called fully implicit or backward time, by contrast with FTCS (which is called fully
explicit). To solve equation (19.2.8) one has to solve a set of simultaneous linear
equations at each timestep for theun+1
j
. Fortunately, this is a simple problem because
the system is tridiagonal: Just group the terms in equation (19.2.8) appropriately:
âÎ±un+1
jâ1 + (1 + 2Î±)un+1

Supplemented by Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions at j = 0 and j = J,
equation (19.2.9) is clearly a tridiagonal system, which can easily be solved at each
timestep by the method of Â§2.4.
What is the behavior of (19.2.8) for very large timesteps? The answer is seen
most clearly in (19.2.9), in the limit Î± ââ(ât ââ). Dividing by Î±, we see that
the difference equations are just the ï¬nite-difference form of the equilibriumequation
â2u
âx2 = 0
(19.2.11)
What about stability? The ampliï¬cation factor for equation (19.2.8) is
Î¾ =
1
1 + 4Î± sin2
kâx
2

(19.2.12)
Clearly |Î¾| < 1 for any stepsize ât. The scheme is unconditionally stable. The details
of the small-scale evolution from the initial conditions are obviously inaccurate for
large ât. But, as advertised, the correct equilibrium solution is obtained. This is
the characteristic feature of implicit methods.
Here, on the other hand, is how one gets to the second of our above philosophical
answers, combining the stability of an implicit method with the accuracy of a method
that is second-order in both space and time. Simply form the average of the explicit
and implicit FTCS schemes:

(âx)2
#
(19.2.13)
Here both the left- and right-handsides are centered at timestep n+ 1
2, so the method
is second-order accurate in time as claimed. The ampliï¬cation factor is
Î¾ =
1 â2Î± sin2
kâx
2

1 + 2Î± sin2
kâx
2

(19.2.14)
so the method is stable for any size ât. This scheme is called the Crank-Nicholson
scheme, and is our recommended method for any simple diffusion problem (perhaps
supplemented by a few fully implicit steps at the end). (See Figure 19.2.1.)
Now turn to some generalizations of the simple diffusion equation (19.2.3).
Suppose ï¬rst that the diffusion coefï¬cient D is not constant, say D = D(x). We can
adopt either of two strategies. First, we can make an analytic change of variable

(19.2.21)
The Crank-Nicholson method can be generalized similarly.
The second complication one can consider is a nonlinear diffusion problem,
for example where D = D(u). Explicit schemes can be generalized in the obvious
way. For example, in equation (19.2.19) write
Dj+1/2 = 1

(19.2.22)
Implicit schemes are not as easy. The replacement (19.2.22) with n ân + 1 leaves
us with a nasty set of coupled nonlinear equations to solve at each timestep. Often
there is an easier way: If the form of D(u) allows us to integrate
dz = D(u)du
(19.2.23)
analytically for z(u), then the right-hand side of (19.2.1) becomes â2z/âx2, which
we difference implicitly as

Now linearize each term on the right-hand side of equation (19.2.24), for example

(19.2.25)
This reduces the problem to tridiagonal form again and in practice usually retains
the stability advantages of fully implicit differencing.
SchrÂ¨odinger Equation
Sometimes the physical problem being solved imposes constraints on the
differencing scheme that we have not yet taken into account. For example, consider
the time-dependent SchrÂ¨odinger equation of quantum mechanics. This is basically a
parabolic equation for the evolution of a complex quantity Ï. For the scattering of a
wavepacket by a one-dimensional potential V (x), the equation has the form
iâÏ
ât = ââ2Ï
âx2 + V (x)Ï
(19.2.26)
(Here we have chosen units so that Planckâs constant Â¯h = 1 and the particle mass
m = 1/2.) One is given the initial wavepacket, Ï(x, t = 0), together with boundary

This is unconditionally stable, but unfortunately is not unitary. The underlying
physical problem requires that the total probabilityof ï¬nding the particle somewhere
remains unity.
This is represented formally by the modulus-square norm of Ï
remaining unity:

The initial wave function Ï(x, 0) is normalized to satisfy (19.2.29). The SchrÂ¨odinger
equation (19.2.26) then guarantees that this condition is satisï¬ed at all later times.
Let us write equation (19.2.26) in the form

(19.2.30)
where the operator H is
H = ââ2

The formal solution of equation (19.2.30) is
Ï(x, t) = eâiHtÏ(x, 0)
(19.2.32)
where the exponential of the operator is deï¬ned by its power series expansion.
The unstable explicit FTCS scheme approximates (19.2.32) as

where H is represented by a centered ï¬nite-difference approximation in x. The
stable implicit scheme (19.2.27) is, by contrast,

These are both ï¬rst-order accurate in time, as can be seen by expanding equation

19.3 Initial Value Problems in Multidimensions
The methods described in Â§19.1 and Â§19.2 for problems in 1 + 1 dimension
(one space and one time dimension) can easily be generalized to N + 1 dimensions.
However, the computing power necessary to solve the resulting equations is enor-
mous. If you have solved a one-dimensional problem with 100 spatial grid points,
solving the two-dimensional version with 100 Ã 100 mesh points requires at least
100 times as much computing. You generally have to be content with very modest
spatial resolution in multidimensional problems.
Indulge us in offering a bit of advice about the development and testing of
multidimensional PDE codes: You should always ï¬rst run your programs on very
small grids, e.g., 8 Ã 8, even though the resulting accuracy is so poor as to be
useless. When your program is all debugged and demonstrably stable, then you can
increase the grid size to a reasonable one and start looking at the results. We have
actually heard someone protest, âmy program would be unstable for a crude grid,
but I am sure the instability will go away on a larger grid.â That is nonsense of a
most pernicious sort, evidencing total confusion between accuracy and stability. In
fact, new instabilities sometimes do show up on larger grids; but old instabilities
never (in our experience) just go away.
Forced to live with modest grid sizes, some people recommend going to higher-
order methods in an attempt to improve accuracy. This is very dangerous. Unless the
solution you are looking for is known to be smooth, and the high-order method you

than second-order in time (for sets of ï¬rst-order equations). For spatial differencing,
we recommend the order of the underlying PDEs, perhaps allowing second-order
spatial differencing for ï¬rst-order-in-space PDEs. When you increase the order of
a differencing method to greater than the order of the original PDEs, you introduce
spurious solutions to the difference equations. This does not create a problem if they
all happen to decay exponentially; otherwise you are going to see all hell break loose!

(19.3.12)
An explicit method, such as FTCS, can be generalized from the one-dimensional
case in the obvious way. However, we have seen that diffusive problems are usually
best treated implicitly. Suppose we try to implement the Crank-Nicholson scheme
in two dimensions. This would give us

solving the coupled linear equations. Whereas in one space dimension the system
was tridiagonal, that is no longer true, though the matrix is still very sparse. One
possibility is to use a suitable sparse matrix technique (see Â§2.7 and Â§19.0).
Another possibility, which we generally prefer, is a slightly different way of
generalizing the Crank-Nicholson algorithm. It is still second-order accurate in time
and space, and unconditionally stable, but the equations are easier to solve than

(19.3.13). Called the alternating-direction implicit method (ADI), this embodies the
powerful concept of operator splitting or time splitting, about which we will say
more below. Here, the idea is to divide each timestep into two steps of size ât/2.
In each substep, a different dimension is treated implicitly:

(19.3.16)
The advantage of this method is that each substep requires only the solution of a
simple tridiagonal system.
Operator Splitting Methods Generally
The basic idea of operator splitting, which is also called time splitting or the
method of fractional steps, is this: Suppose you have an initial value equation of
the form
âu
ât = Lu
(19.3.17)
where L is some operator. While L is not necessarily linear, suppose that it can at
least be written as a linear sum of m pieces, which act additively on u,
Lu = L1u + L2u + Â· Â· Â· + Lmu
(19.3.18)
Finally, suppose that for each of the pieces, you already know a differencing scheme
for updating the variable u from timestep n to timestep n + 1, valid if that piece
of the operator were the only one on the right-hand side.
We will write these
updatings symbolically as
un+1 = U1(un, ât)
un+1 = U2(un, ât)
Â· Â· Â·
un+1 = Um(un, ât)
(19.3.19)
Now, one form of operator splitting would be to get from n to n + 1 by the
following sequence of updatings:
un+(1/m) = U1(un, ât)
un+(2/m) = U2(un+(1/m), ât)
Â· Â· Â·
un+1 = Um(un+(mâ1)/m, ât)

For example, a combined advective-diffusion equation, such as
âu
ât = âvâu
âx + Dâ2u
âx2
(19.3.21)
might proï¬tably use an explicit scheme for the advective term combined with a
Crank-Nicholson or other implicit scheme for the diffusion term.
The alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method, equation (19.3.16), is an
example of operator splitting with a slightly different twist.
Let us reinterpret
(19.3.19) to have a different meaning: Let U1 now denote an updating method that
includes algebraically all the pieces of the total operator L, but which is desirably
stable only for the L1 piece; likewise U2, . . .Um. Then a method of getting from
un to un+1 is
un+1/m = U1(un, ât/m)

For example, a combined advective-diffusion equation, such as
âu
ât = âvâu
âx + Dâ2u
âx2
(19.3.21)
might proï¬tably use an explicit scheme for the advective term combined with a
Crank-Nicholson or other implicit scheme for the diffusion term.
The alternating-direction implicit (ADI) method, equation (19.3.16), is an
example of operator splitting with a slightly different twist.
Let us reinterpret
(19.3.19) to have a different meaning: Let U1 now denote an updating method that
includes algebraically all the pieces of the total operator L, but which is desirably
stable only for the L1 piece; likewise U2, . . .Um. Then a method of getting from
un to un+1 is
un+1/m = U1(un, ât/m)

Two important techniques lead to ârapidâ solution of equation (19.4.1) when
the sparse matrix is of certain frequently occurring forms. The Fourier transform
method is directly applicable when the equations have coefï¬cients that are constant
in space. The cyclic reduction method is somewhat more general; its applicability
is related to the question of whether the equations are separable (in the sense of
âseparation of variablesâ). Both methods require the boundaries to coincide with
the coordinate lines. Finally, for some problems, there is a powerful combination
of these two methods called FACR (Fourier Analysis and Cyclic Reduction). We
now consider each method in turn, using equation (19.0.3), with ï¬nite-difference
representation (19.0.6), as a model example. Generally speaking, the methods in this
section are faster, when they apply, than the simpler relaxation methods discussed
in Â§19.5; but they are not necessarily faster than the more complicated multigrid
methods discussed in Â§19.6.
Fourier Transform Method
The discrete inverse Fourier transform in both x and y is
ujl =
1
JL
Jâ1
X
m=0
Lâ1
X
n=0
bumneâ2Ïijm/Jeâ2Ïiln/L
(19.4.2)
This can be computed using the FFT independently in each dimension, or else all at
once via the routine fourn of Â§12.4 or the routine rlft3 of Â§12.5. Similarly,
Ïjl =
1
JL
Jâ1
X
m=0
Lâ1
X
n=0
bÏmneâ2Ïijm/Jeâ2Ïiln/L
(19.4.3)
If we substitute expressions (19.4.2) and (19.4.3) in our model problem (19.0.6),
we ï¬nd
bumn

e2Ïim/J + eâ2Ïim/J + e2Ïin/L + eâ2Ïin/L â4

= bÏmnâ2

bÏmnâ2


cos 2Ïm
J
+ cos 2Ïn
L

(19.4.5)
Thus the strategy for solving equation (19.0.6) by FFT techniques is:
â¢ Compute bÏmn as the Fourier transform
bÏmn =
Jâ1
X
j=0
Lâ1

â¢ Compute ujl by the inverse Fourier transform (19.4.2).
The above procedure is valid for periodic boundary conditions. In other words,
the solution satisï¬es
ujl = uj+J,l = uj,l+L
(19.4.7)
Next consider a Dirichlet boundary conditionu = 0 on the rectangular boundary.
Instead of the expansion (19.4.2), we now need an expansion in sine waves:
ujl = 2
J

L
Jâ1
X
m=1
Lâ1
X
n=1
bumn sin Ïjm
J
sin Ïln
L
(19.4.8)
This satisï¬es the boundary conditions that u = 0 at j = 0, J and at l = 0, L. If we
substitute this expansion and the analogous one for Ïjl into equation (19.0.6), we
ï¬nd that the solution procedure parallels that for periodic boundary conditions:
â¢ Compute bÏmn by the sine transform
bÏmn =
Jâ1
X
j=1
Lâ1
X
l=1
Ïjl sin Ïjm
J
sin Ïln
L
(19.4.9)
(A fast sine transform algorithm was given in Â§12.3.)
â¢ Compute bumn from the expression analogous to (19.4.5),
bumn =
â2bÏmn


cos Ïm
J
+ cos Ïn
L â2

(19.4.10)
â¢ Compute ujl by the inverse sine transform (19.4.8).
If we have inhomogeneous boundary conditions, for example u = 0 on all
boundaries except u = f(y) on the boundary x = Jâ, we have to add to the above
solution a solution uH of the homogeneous equation
â2u
âx2 + â2u
ây2 = 0
(19.4.11)
that satisï¬es the required boundary conditions. In the continuum case, this would
be an expression of the form
uH =
X
n
An sinh nÏx
Jâsin nÏy
Lâ
(19.4.12)
where An would be found by requiring that u = f(y) at x = Jâ. In the discrete
case, we have
uH
jl = 2

(19.4.14)
The complete solution to the problem is
u = ujl + uH
jl
(19.4.15)
By adding appropriate terms of the form (19.4.12), we can handle inhomogeneous
terms on any boundary surface.
A much simpler procedure for handling inhomogeneous terms is to note that
whenever boundary terms appear on the left-hand side of (19.0.6), they can be taken
over to the right-hand side since they are known.
The effective source term is
therefore Ïjl plus a contribution from the boundary terms. To implement this idea
formally, write the solution as
u = uâ² + uB
(19.4.16)
where uâ² = 0 on the boundary, while uB vanishes everywhere except on the
boundary. There it takes on the given boundary value. In the above example, the
only nonzero values of uB would be
uB
J,l = fl
(19.4.17)
The model equation (19.0.3) becomes
â2uâ² = ââ2uB + Ï
(19.4.18)
or, in ï¬nite-difference form,
uâ²
j+1,l + uâ²
jâ1,l + uâ²
j,l+1 + uâ²
j,lâ1 â4uâ²
j,l =
â(uB
j+1,l + uB
jâ1,l + uB
j,l+1 + uB
j,lâ1 â4uB
j,l) + â2Ïj,l
(19.4.19)
All the uB terms in equation (19.4.19) vanish except when the equation is evaluated
at j = J â1, where
uâ²
J,l + uâ²
Jâ2,l + uâ²
Jâ1,l+1 + uâ²
Jâ1,lâ1 â4uâ²
Jâ1,l = âfl + â2ÏJâ1,l
(19.4.20)
Thus the problem is now equivalent to the case of zero boundary conditions, except
that one row of the source term is modiï¬ed by the replacement
â2ÏJâ1,l ââ2ÏJâ1,l âfl
(19.4.21)
The case of Neumann boundary conditions âu = 0 is handled by the cosine

Here the double prime notation means that the terms for m = 0 and m = J should
be multiplied by 1
2, and similarly for n = 0 and n = L. Inhomogeneous terms
âu = g can be again included by adding a suitable solution of the homogeneous
equation, or more simply by taking boundary terms over to the right-hand side.
For example, the condition
âu
âx = g(y)
at
x = 0
(19.4.23)
becomes
u1,l âuâ1,l
2â
= gl
(19.4.24)
where gl â¡g(y = lâ). Once again we write the solution in the form (19.4.16),
where now âuâ² = 0 on the boundary. This time âuB takes on the prescribed value
on the boundary, but uB vanishes everywhere except just outside the boundary.
Thus equation (19.4.24) gives
uB
â1,l = â2âgl
(19.4.25)
All the uB terms in equation (19.4.19) vanish except when j = 0:
uâ²
1,l + uâ²
â1,l + uâ²
0,l+1 + uâ²
0,lâ1 â4uâ²
0,l = 2âgl + â2Ï0,l
(19.4.26)
Thus uâ² is the solution of a zero-gradient problem, with the source term modiï¬ed
by the replacement
â2Ï0,l ââ2Ï0,l + 2âgl
(19.4.27)
Sometimes Neumann boundary conditions are handled by using a staggered
grid, with the uâs deï¬ned midway between zone boundaries so that ï¬rst derivatives
are centered on the mesh points.
You can solve such problems using similar
techniques to those described above if you use the alternative form of the cosine
transform, equation (12.3.23).
Cyclic Reduction
Evidently the FFT method works only when the original PDE has constant
coefï¬cients, and boundaries that coincide with the coordinate lines. An alternative
algorithm, which can be used on somewhat more general equations, is called cyclic
reduction (CR).
We illustrate cyclic reduction on the equation
â2u
âx2 + â2u
ây2 + b(y)âu
ây + c(y)u = g(x, y)
(19.4.28)
This form arises very often in practice from the Helmholtz or Poisson equations in
polar, cylindrical, or spherical coordinate systems. More general separable equations
are treated in [1].

The ï¬nite-difference form of equation (19.4.28) can be written as a set of
vector equations
ujâ1 + T Â· uj + uj+1 = gjâ2
(19.4.29)
Here the index j comes from differencing in the x-direction, while the y-differencing
(denoted by the index l previously) has been left in vector form. The matrix T
has the form
T = B â21
(19.4.30)
where the 21 comes from the x-differencingand the matrix B from the y-differencing.
The matrix B, and hence T, is tridiagonal with variable coefï¬cients.
The CR method is derived by writing down three successive equations like
(19.4.29):
ujâ2 + T Â· ujâ1 + uj = gjâ1â2
ujâ1 + T Â· uj + uj+1 = gjâ2
uj + T Â· uj+1 + uj+2 = gj+1â2
(19.4.31)
Matrix-multiplying the middle equation by âT and then adding the three equations,
we get
ujâ2 + T(1) Â· uj + uj+2 = g(1)
j â2
(19.4.32)
This is an equation of the same form as (19.4.29), with
T(1) = 21 âT2
g(1)
j
= â2(gjâ1 âT Â· gj + gj+1)
(19.4.33)
After one level of CR, we have reduced the number of equations by a factor of
two. Since the resulting equations are of the same form as the original equation, we
can repeat the process. Taking the number of mesh points to be a power of 2 for
simplicity, we ï¬nally end up with a single equation for the central line of variables:
T(f) Â· uJ/2 = â2g(f)
J/2 âu0 âuJ
(19.4.34)
Here we have moved u0 and uJ to the right-hand side because they are known
boundary values.
Equation (19.4.34) can be solved for uJ/2 by the standard
tridiagonal algorithm. The two equations at level f â1 involve uJ/4 and u3J/4. The
equation for uJ/4 involves u0 and uJ/2, both of which are known, and hence can be
solved by the usual tridiagonal routine. A similar result holds true at every stage,
so we end up solving J â1 tridiagonal systems.
In practice, equations (19.4.33) should be rewritten to avoid numerical instabil-
ity. For these and other practical details, refer to [2].

FACR Method
The best way to solve equations of the form (19.4.28), including the constant
coefï¬cient problem(19.0.3), isacombinationofFourieranalysisandcyclicreduction,
the FACR method [3-6]. If at the rth stage of CR we Fourier analyze the equations of
the form (19.4.32) along y, that is, with respect to the suppressed vector index, we
will have a tridiagonal system in the x-direction for each y-Fourier mode:
buk
jâ2r + Î»(r)
k buk
j + buk
j+2r = â2g(r)k
j
(19.4.35)
Here Î»(r)
k
is the eigenvalue of T(r) corresponding to the kth Fourier mode. For
the equation (19.0.3), equation (19.4.5) shows that Î»(r)
k
will involve terms like
cos(2Ïk/L) â2 raised to a power. Solve the tridiagonal systems for buk
j at the levels
j = 2r, 2 Ã 2r, 4 Ã 2r, ..., J â2r. Fourier synthesize to get the y-values on these
x-lines. Then ï¬ll in the intermediate x-lines as in the original CR algorithm.
The trick is to choose the number of levels of CR so as to minimize the total
number of arithmetic operations. One can show that for a typical case of a 128Ã128
mesh, the optimal level is r = 2; asymptotically, r âlog2(log2 J).
A rough estimate of running times for these algorithms for equation (19.0.3)
is as follows: The FFT method (in both x and y) and the CR method are roughly
comparable.
FACR with r = 0 (that is, FFT in one dimension and solve the
tridiagonal equations by the usual algorithm in the other dimension) gives about a
factor of two gain in speed. The optimal FACR with r = 2 gives another factor
of two gain in speed.

19.5 Relaxation Methods for Boundary Value
Problems
As we mentioned in Â§19.0, relaxation methods involve splitting the sparse
matrix that arises from ï¬nite differencing and then iterating until a solution is found.
There is another way of thinking about relaxation methods that is somewhat
more physical. Suppose we wish to solve the elliptic equation
Lu = Ï

19.5 Relaxation Methods for Boundary Value
Problems
As we mentioned in Â§19.0, relaxation methods involve splitting the sparse
matrix that arises from ï¬nite differencing and then iterating until a solution is found.
There is another way of thinking about relaxation methods that is somewhat
more physical. Suppose we wish to solve the elliptic equation
Lu = Ï

where L represents some elliptic operator and Ï is the source term. Rewrite the
equation as a diffusion equation,
âu
ât = Lu âÏ
(19.5.2)
An initial distribution u relaxes to an equilibrium solution as t ââ.
This
equilibrium has all time derivatives vanishing. Therefore it is the solution of the
original ellipticproblem (19.5.1). We see that all the machinery of Â§19.2, on diffusive
initial value equations, can be brought to bear on the solution of boundary value
problems by relaxation methods.
Let us apply this idea to our model problem (19.0.3). The diffusion equation is
âu
ât = â2u
âx2 + â2u
ây2 âÏ
(19.5.3)
If we use FTCS differencing (cf. equation 19.2.4), we get

j,l + ât

jâ1,l + un

Recall from (19.2.6) that FTCS differencing is stable in one spatial dimension only if
ât/â2 â¤1
2. In two dimensions this becomes ât/â2 â¤1
4. Suppose we try to take
the largest possible timestep, and set ât = â2/4. Then equation (19.5.4) becomes

(19.5.5)
Thus the algorithm consists of using the average of u at its four nearest-neighbor
points on the grid (plus the contribution from the source). This procedure is then
iterated until convergence.
This method is in fact a classical method with origins dating back to the
last century, called Jacobiâs method (not to be confused with the Jacobi method
for eigenvalues).
The method is not practical because it converges too slowly.
However, it is the basis for understanding the modern methods, which are always
compared with it.
Another classical method is the Gauss-Seidel method, which turns out to be
important in multigridmethods (Â§19.6). Here we make use of updated values of u on
the right-hand side of (19.5.5) as soon as they become available. In other words, the
averaging is done âin placeâ instead of being âcopiedâ from an earlier timestep to a
later one. If we are proceeding along the rows, incrementing j for ï¬xed l, we have
un+1

(19.5.6)
This method is also slowly converging and only of theoretical interest when used by
itself, but some analysis of it will be instructive.
Let us look at the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods in terms of the matrix
splitting concept. We change notation and call u âx,â to conform to standard matrix
notation.

we can consider splitting A as
A = L + D + U
(19.5.8)
where D is the diagonal part of A, L is the lower triangle of A with zeros on the
diagonal, and U is the upper triangle of A with zeros on the diagonal.
In the Jacobi method we write for the rth step of iteration
D Â· x(r) = â(L + U) Â· x(râ1) + b
(19.5.9)
For our model problem (19.5.5), D is simply the identity matrix. The Jacobi method
converges for matrices A that are âdiagonally dominantâ in a sense that can be
made mathematically precise.
For matrices arising from ï¬nite differencing, this
condition is usually met.
What is the rate of convergence of the Jacobi method? A detailed analysis is
beyond our scope, but here is some of the ï¬avor: The matrix âDâ1 Â· (L + U) is
the iteration matrix which, apart from an additive term, maps one set of xâs into the
next. The iteration matrix has eigenvalues, each one of which reï¬ects the factor by
which the amplitude of a particular eigenmode of undesired residual is suppressed
during one iteration. Evidently those factors had better all have modulus < 1 for
the relaxation to work at all! The rate of convergence of the method is set by the
rate for the slowest-decaying eigenmode, i.e., the factor with largest modulus. The
modulus of this largest factor, therefore lying between 0 and 1, is called the spectral
radius of the relaxation operator, denoted Ïs.
The number of iterations r required to reduce the overall error by a factor
10âp is thus estimated by
r â
p ln10
(âln Ïs)
(19.5.10)
In general, the spectral radius Ïs goes asymptotically to the value 1 as the grid
size J is increased, so that more iterations are required. For any given equation,
grid geometry, and boundary condition, the spectral radius can, in principle, be
computed analytically. For example, for equation (19.5.5) on a J Ã J grid with
Dirichlet boundary conditions on all four sides, the asymptotic formula for large
J turns out to be
Ïs â1 âÏ2
2J2
(19.5.11)
The number of iterations r required to reduce the error by a factor of 10âp is thus
r â2pJ2 ln 10
Ï2
â1
2pJ2
(19.5.12)
In other words, the number of iterations is proportionalto the number of mesh points,
J2. Since 100 Ã 100 and larger problems are common, it is clear that the Jacobi
method is only of theoretical interest.

The Gauss-Seidel method, equation (19.5.6), corresponds to the matrix de-
composition
(L + D) Â· x(r) = âU Â· x(râ1) + b
(19.5.13)
The fact that L is on the left-hand side of the equation follows from the updating
in place, as you can easily check if you write out (19.5.13) in components. One
can show [1-3] that the spectral radius is just the square of the spectral radius of the
Jacobi method. For our model problem, therefore,

(19.5.15)
The factor of two improvement in the number of iterations over the Jacobi method
still leaves the method impractical.
Successive Overrelaxation (SOR)
We get a better algorithm â one that was the standard algorithm until the 1970s
â if we make an overcorrection to the value of x(r) at the rth stage of Gauss-Seidel
iteration, thus anticipating future corrections.
Solve (19.5.13) for x(r), add and
subtract x(râ1) on the right-hand side, and hence write the Gauss-Seidel method as
x(r) = x(râ1) â(L + D)â1 Â· [(L + D + U) Â· x(râ1) âb]
(19.5.16)
The term in square brackets is just the residual vector Î¾(râ1), so
x(r) = x(râ1) â(L + D)â1 Â· Î¾(râ1)
(19.5.17)
Now overcorrect, deï¬ning
x(r) = x(râ1) âÏ(L + D)â1 Â· Î¾(râ1)
(19.5.18)
Here Ï is called the overrelaxation parameter, and the method is called successive
overrelaxation (SOR).
The following theorems can be proved [1-3]:
â¢ The method is convergent only for 0 < Ï < 2. If 0 < Ï < 1, we speak
of underrelaxation.
â¢ Under certain mathematical restrictions generally satisï¬ed by matrices
arising from ï¬nite differencing, only overrelaxation (1 < Ï < 2 ) can give
faster convergence than the Gauss-Seidel method.
â¢ If ÏJacobi is the spectral radius of the Jacobi iteration (so that the square
of it is the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel iteration), then the optimal
choice for Ï is given by
Ï =

As an application of the above results, consider our model problem for which

a factor of 10âp,
r âpJ ln10

â1
3pJ
(19.5.23)
Comparing with equation (19.5.12) or (19.5.15), we see that optimal SOR requires
of order J iterations, as opposed to of order J2. Since J is typically 100 or larger,
this makes a tremendous difference!
Equation (19.5.23) leads to the mnemonic
that 3-ï¬gure accuracy (p = 3) requires a number of iterations equal to the number
of mesh points along a side of the grid. For 6-ï¬gure accuracy, we require about
twice as many iterations.
How do we choose Ï for a problem for which the answer is not known
analytically? That is just the weak point of SOR! The advantages of SOR obtain
only in a fairly narrow window around the correct value of Ï. It is better to take Ï
slightly too large, rather than slightly too small, but best to get it right.
One way to choose Ï is to map your problem approximately onto a known
problem, replacing the coefï¬cients in the equation by average values. Note, however,
that the known problem must have the same grid size and boundary conditions as the
actual problem. We give for reference purposes the value of ÏJacobi for our model
problem on a rectangular J Ã L grid, allowing for the possibility that âx Ì¸= ây:
ÏJacobi =
cos Ï
J +
âx
ây
2
cos Ï
L
1 +
âx
ây
2
(19.5.24)
Equation (19.5.24) holds for homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condi-
tions. For periodic boundary conditions, make the replacement Ï â2Ï.
A second way, which is especially useful if you plan to solve many similar
elliptic equations each time with slightly different coefï¬cients, is to determine the
optimum value Ï empirically on the ï¬rst equation and then use that value for the
remaining equations. Various automated schemes for doing this and for âseeking
outâ the best values of Ï are described in the literature.
While the matrix notation introduced earlier is useful for theoretical analyses,
for practical implementation of the SOR algorithm we need explicit formulas.

Consider a general second-order elliptic equation in x and y, ï¬nite differenced on
a square as for our model equation. Corresponding to each row of the matrix A
is an equation of the form
aj,luj+1,l + bj,lujâ1,l + cj,luj,l+1 + dj,luj,lâ1 + ej,luj,l = fj,l
(19.5.25)
For our model equation, we had a = b = c = d = 1, e = â4. The quantity
f is proportional to the source term. The iterative procedure is deï¬ned by solving
(19.5.25) for uj,l:
u*j,l =
1
ej,l
(fj,l âaj,luj+1,l âbj,lujâ1,l âcj,luj,l+1 âdj,luj,lâ1)
(19.5.26)
Then unew
j,l
is a weighted average
unew
j,l
= Ïu*j,l + (1 âÏ)uold
j,l
(19.5.27)
We calculate it as follows: The residual at any stage is
Î¾j,l = aj,luj+1,l + bj,lujâ1,l + cj,luj,l+1 + dj,luj,lâ1 + ej,luj,l âfj,l
(19.5.28)
and the SOR algorithm (19.5.18) or (19.5.27) is
unew
j,l
= uold
j,l âÏÎ¾j,l
ej,l
(19.5.29)
This formulation is very easy to program, and the norm of the residual vector Î¾j,l
can be used as a criterion for terminating the iteration.
Another practical point concerns the order in which mesh points are processed.
The obvious strategy is simply to proceed in order down the rows (or columns).
Alternatively, suppose we divide the mesh into âoddâ and âevenâ meshes, like the
red and black squares of a checkerboard. Then equation (19.5.26) shows that the
odd points depend only on the even mesh values and vice versa.
Accordingly,
we can carry out one half-sweep updating the odd points, say, and then another
half-sweep updating the even points with the new odd values. For the version of
SOR implemented below, we shall adopt odd-even ordering.
The last practical point is that in practice the asymptotic rate of convergence
in SOR is not attained until of order J iterations.
The error often grows by a
factor of 20 before convergence sets in. A trivial modiï¬cation to SOR resolves this
problem. It is based on the observation that, while Ï is the optimum asymptotic
relaxation parameter, it is not necessarily a good initial choice.
In SOR with
Chebyshev acceleration, one uses odd-even ordering and changes Ï at each half-
sweep according to the following prescription:
Ï(0) = 1
Ï(1/2) = 1/(1 âÏ2
Jacobi/2)
Ï(n+1/2) = 1/(1 âÏ2

The beauty of Chebyshev acceleration is that the norm of the error always decreases
with each iteration. (This is the norm of the actual error in uj,l.
The norm of
the residual Î¾j,l need not decrease monotonically.) While the asymptotic rate of
convergence is the same as ordinary SOR, there is never any excuse for not using
Chebyshev acceleration to reduce the total number of iterations required.
Here we give a routine for SOR with Chebyshev acceleration.

void sor(double **a, double **b, double **c, double **d, double **e,

d, e, and f are input as the coeï¬cients of the equation, each dimensioned to the grid size
[1..jmax][1..jmax]. u is input as the initial guess to the solution, usually zero, and returns
with the ï¬nal value. rjac is input as the spectral radius of the Jacobi iteration, or an estimate
of it.

1.0/(1.0-0.25*rjac*rjac*omega));
}
if (anorm < EPS*anormf) return;
}

The main advantage of SOR is that it is very easy to program.
Its main
disadvantage is that it is still very inefï¬cient on large problems.

ADI (Alternating-Direction Implicit) Method
The ADI method of Â§19.3 for diffusion equations can be turned into a relaxation
method for elliptic equations [1-4]. In Â§19.3, we discussed ADI as a method for
solving the time-dependent heat-ï¬ow equation
âu
ât = â2u âÏ
(19.5.31)
By letting t ââone also gets an iterative method for solving the elliptic equation
â2u = Ï
(19.5.32)
In either case, the operator splitting is of the form
L = Lx + Ly
(19.5.33)
where Lx represents the differencing in x and Ly that in y.
For example, in our model problem (19.0.6) with âx = ây = â, we have
Lxu = 2uj,l âuj+1,l âujâ1,l
Lyu = 2uj,l âuj,l+1 âuj,lâ1
(19.5.34)
More complicated operators may be similarly split, but there is some art involved.
A bad choice of splitting can lead to an algorithm that fails to converge. Usually
one tries to base the splitting on the physical nature of the problem. We know for
our model problem that an initial transient diffuses away, and we set up the x and
y splitting to mimic diffusion in each dimension.
Having chosen a splitting, we difference the time-dependent equation (19.5.31)
implicitly in two half-steps:
un+1/2 âun
ât/2
= âLxun+1/2 + Lyun

un+1 âun+1/2
ât/2
= âLxun+1/2 + Lyun+1

âÏ

(cf. equation 19.3.16). Here we have suppressed the spatial indices (j, l). In matrix
notation, equations (19.5.35) are
(Lx + r1) Â· un+1/2 = (r1 âLy) Â· un ââ2Ï

standardtridiagonal algorithm. Givenun, onesolves(19.5.36)forun+1/2, substitutes
on the right-hand side of (19.5.37), and then solves for un+1. The key question
is how to choose the iteration parameter r, the analog of a choice of timestep for
an initial value problem.
As usual, the goal is to minimize the spectral radius of the iteration matrix.
Although it is beyond our scope to go into details here, it turns out that, for the
optimal choice of r, the ADI method has the same rate of convergence as SOR.
The individual iteration steps in the ADI method are much more complicated than

choose the same parameter r for every iteration step. However, it is possible to
choose a different r for each step. If this is done optimally, then ADI is generally
more efï¬cient than SOR. We refer you to the literature [1-4] for details.
Our reason for not fully implementing ADI here is that, in most applications,
it has been superseded by the multigrid methods described in the next section. Our
advice is to use SOR for trivial problems (e.g., 20 Ã 20), or for solving a larger
problem once only, where ease of programming outweighs expense of computer
time. Occasionally, the sparse matrix methods of Â§2.7 are useful for solving a set
of difference equations directly. For production solution of large elliptic problems,
however, multigrid is now almost always the method of choice.

on the right-hand side of (19.5.37), and then solves for un+1. The key question
is how to choose the iteration parameter r, the analog of a choice of timestep for
an initial value problem.
As usual, the goal is to minimize the spectral radius of the iteration matrix.
Although it is beyond our scope to go into details here, it turns out that, for the
optimal choice of r, the ADI method has the same rate of convergence as SOR.
The individual iteration steps in the ADI method are much more complicated than
in SOR, so the ADI method would appear to be inferior. This is in fact true if we
choose the same parameter r for every iteration step. However, it is possible to
choose a different r for each step. If this is done optimally, then ADI is generally

introduction to the subject here. In particular, we will give two sample multigrid
routines, one linear and one nonlinear.
By following these prototypes and by
perusing the references [1-4], you should be able to develop routines to solve your
own problems.
There are two related, but distinct, approaches to the use of multigridtechniques.
The ï¬rst, termed âthe multigridmethod,â is a means for speeding up the convergence
of a traditional relaxation method, as deï¬ned by you on a grid of pre-speciï¬ed
ï¬neness. In this case, you need deï¬ne your problem (e.g., evaluate its source terms)
only on this grid. Other, coarser, grids deï¬ned by the method can be viewed as
temporary computational adjuncts.
The second approach, termed (perhaps confusingly) âthe full multigrid (FMG)
method,â requires you to be able to deï¬ne your problem on grids of various sizes
(generally by discretizing the same underlyingPDE into different-sized sets of ï¬nite-
difference equations). In this approach, the method obtains successive solutions on
ï¬ner and ï¬ner grids. You can stop the solution either at a pre-speciï¬ed ï¬neness, or
you can monitor the truncation error due to the discretization, quitting only when
it is tolerably small.
In this section we will ï¬rst discuss the âmultigridmethod,â then use the concepts
developed to introduce the FMG method. The latter algorithm is the one that we
implement in the accompanying programs.
From One-Grid, through Two-Grid, to Multigrid
The key idea of the multigrid method can be understood by considering the
simplest case of a two-grid method.
Suppose we are trying to solve the linear
elliptic problem
Lu = f
(19.6.1)
where L is some linear elliptic operator and f is the source term. Discretize equation
(19.6.1) on a uniform grid with mesh size h.
Write the resulting set of linear
algebraic equations as
Lhuh = fh
(19.6.2)
Let euh denote some approximate solution to equation (19.6.2). We will use the
symbol uh to denote the exact solution to the difference equations (19.6.2). Then
the error in euh or the correction is
vh = uh âeuh
(19.6.3)
The residual or defect is
dh = Lheuh âfh
(19.6.4)
(Beware: some authors deï¬ne residual as minus the defect, and there is not universal
agreement about which of these two quantities 19.6.4 deï¬nes.) Since Lh is linear,
the error satisï¬es
Lhvh = âdh
(19.6.5)

At this point we need to make an approximation to Lh in order to ï¬nd vh. The
classical iteration methods, such as Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel, do this by ï¬nding, at
each stage, an approximate solution of the equation
bLhbvh = âdh
(19.6.6)
where bLh is a âsimplerâ operator than Lh. For example, bLh is the diagonal part of
Lh for Jacobi iteration, or the lower triangle for Gauss-Seidel iteration. The next
approximation is generated by
eunew
h
= euh + bvh
(19.6.7)
Now consider, as an alternative, a completely different type of approximation
for Lh, one in which we âcoarsifyâ rather than âsimplify.â That is, we form some
appropriate approximation LH of Lh on a coarser grid with mesh size H (we will
always take H = 2h, but other choices are possible). The residual equation (19.6.5)
is now approximated by
LHvH = âdH
(19.6.8)
Since LH has smaller dimension, this equation will be easier to solve than equation
(19.6.5). To deï¬ne the defect dH on the coarse grid, we need a restriction operator
R that restricts dh to the coarse grid:
dH = Rdh
(19.6.9)
The restriction operator is also called the ï¬ne-to-coarse operator or the injection
operator. Once we have a solution evH to equation (19.6.8), we need a prolongation
operator P that prolongates or interpolates the correction to the ï¬ne grid:
evh = PevH
(19.6.10)
The prolongation operator is also called the coarse-to-ï¬ne operator or the inter-
polation operator. Both R and P are chosen to be linear operators. Finally the
approximation euh can be updated:
eunew
h
= euh + evh
(19.6.11)
One step of this coarse-grid correction scheme is thus:
Coarse-Grid Correction
â¢ Compute the defect on the ï¬ne grid from (19.6.4).
â¢ Restrict the defect by (19.6.9).
â¢ Solve (19.6.8) exactly on the coarse grid for the correction.
â¢ Interpolate the correction to the ï¬ne grid by (19.6.10).

â¢ Compute the next approximation by (19.6.11).
Letâs contrast the advantages and disadvantages of relaxationand the coarse-grid
correction scheme. Consider the error vh expanded intoa discrete Fourier series. Call
the components in the lower half of the frequency spectrum the smooth components
and the high-frequency components the nonsmooth components. We have seen that
relaxation becomes very slowly convergent in the limit h â0, i.e., when there are a
large number of mesh points. The reason turns out to be that the smooth components
are only slightly reduced in amplitude on each iteration. However, many relaxation
methods reduce the amplitude of the nonsmooth components by large factors on
each iteration: They are good smoothing operators.
For the two-grid iteration, on the other hand, components of the error with
wavelengths <â¼2H are not even representable on the coarse grid and so cannot be
reduced to zero on this grid. But it is exactly these high-frequency components that
can be reduced by relaxation on the ï¬ne grid! This leads us to combine the ideas
of relaxation and coarse-grid correction:
Two-Grid Iteration
â¢ Pre-smoothing: Compute Â¯uh by applying Î½1 â¥0 steps of a relaxation
method to euh.
â¢ Coarse-grid correction: As above, using Â¯uh to give Â¯unew
h
.
â¢ Post-smoothing: Compute eunew
h
by applying Î½2 â¥0 steps of the relaxation
method to Â¯unew
h
.
It is only a short step from the above two-grid method to a multigrid method.
Instead of solving the coarse-grid defect equation (19.6.8) exactly, we can get
an approximate solution of it by introducing an even coarser grid and using the
two-grid iteration method.
If the convergence factor of the two-grid method is
small enough, we will need only a few steps of this iteration to get a good enough
approximate solution. We denote the number of such iterations by Î³. Obviously
we can apply this idea recursively down to some coarsest grid. There the solution
is found easily, for example by direct matrix inversion or by iterating the relaxation
scheme to convergence.
One iteration of a multigrid method, from ï¬nest grid to coarser grids and back
to ï¬nest grid again, is called a cycle. The exact structure of a cycle depends on
the value of Î³, the number of two-grid iterations at each intermediate stage. The
case Î³ = 1 is called a V-cycle, while Î³ = 2 is called a W-cycle (see Figure 19.6.1).
These are the most important cases in practice.
Note that once more than two grids are involved, the pre-smoothing steps after
the ï¬rst one on the ï¬nest grid need an initial approximation for the error v. This
should be taken to be zero.
Smoothing, Restriction, and Prolongation Operators
The most popular smoothing method, and the one you should try ï¬rst, is
Gauss-Seidel, since it usually leads to a good convergence rate. If we order the mesh
points from 1 to N, then the Gauss-Seidel scheme is
ui = â

Structure of multigrid cycles. S denotes smoothing, while E denotes exact solution
on the coarsest grid. Each descending line \ denotes restriction (R) and each ascending line / denotes
prolongation (P). The ï¬nest grid is at the top level of each diagram. For the V-cycles (Î³ = 1) the E
step is replaced by one 2-grid iteration each time the number of grid levels is increased by one. For the
W-cycles (Î³ = 2), each E step gets replaced by two 2-grid iterations.
where new values of u are used on the right-hand side as they become available. The
exact form of the Gauss-Seidel method depends on the ordering chosen for the mesh
points. For typical second-order elliptic equations like our model problem equation
(19.0.3), as differenced in equation (19.0.8), it is usually best to use red-black
ordering, making one pass through the mesh updating the âevenâ points (like the red
squares of a checkerboard) and another pass updating the âoddâ points (the black
squares).
When quantities are more strongly coupled along one dimension than
another, one should relax a whole line along that dimension simultaneously. Line
relaxation for nearest-neighbor coupling involves solving a tridiagonal system, and
so is still efï¬cient. Relaxing odd and even lines on successive passes is called zebra
relaxation and is usually preferred over simple line relaxation.
Note that SOR should not be used as a smoothing operator. The overrelaxation
destroys the high-frequency smoothing that is so crucial for the multigrid method.
A succint notation for the prolongation and restriction operators is to give their
symbol. The symbol of P is found by considering vH to be 1 at some mesh point
(x, y), zero elsewhere, and then asking for the values of PvH. The most popular
prolongation operator is simple bilinear interpolation. It gives nonzero values at
the 9 points (x, y), (x + h, y), . . ., (x âh, y âh), where the values are 1, 1

The symbol of R is deï¬ned by considering vh to be deï¬ned everywhere on the
ï¬ne grid, and then asking what is Rvh at (x, y) as a linear combination of these
values. The simplest possible choice for R is straight injection, which means simply
ï¬lling each coarse-grid point with the value from the corresponding ï¬ne-grid point.
Its symbol is â[1].â However, difï¬culties can arise in practice with this choice. It
turns out that a safe choice for R is to make it the adjoint operator to P. To deï¬ne the
adjoint, deï¬ne the scalar product of two grid functions uh and vh for mesh size h as
â¨uh|vhâ©h â¡h2 X
x,y
uh(x, y)vh(x, y)
(19.6.14)
Then the adjoint of P, denoted Pâ , is deï¬ned by
â¨uH|Pâ vhâ©H = â¨PuH|vhâ©h
(19.6.15)
Now take P to be bilinearinterpolation,and choose uH = 1 at (x, y), zero elsewhere.
Set Pâ  = R in (19.6.15) and H = 2h. You will ï¬nd that
(Rvh)(x,y) = 1

The particular choice of R in (19.6.17) is called full weighting. Another popular
choice for R is half weighting, âhalfwayâ between full weighting and straight

If you are confronted with a new problem and you are not sure what P and R
choices are likely to work well, here is a safe rule: Suppose mp is the order of the
interpolation P (i.e., it interpolates polynomials of degree mp â1 exactly). Suppose
mr is the order of R, and that R is the adjoint of some P (not necessarily the P you
intend to use). Then if m is the order of the differential operator Lh, you should
satisfy the inequality mp + mr > m. For example, bilinear interpolation and its
adjoint, full weighting, for Poissonâs equation satisfy mp + mr = 4 > m = 2.
Of course the P and R operators should enforce the boundary conditions for
your problem. The easiest way to do this is to rewrite the difference equation to
have homogeneous boundary conditions by modifying the source term if necessary
(cf. Â§19.4). Enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions simply requires the P
operator to produce zeros at the appropriate boundary points. The corresponding
R is then found by R = Pâ .
Full Multigrid Algorithm
So far we have described multigrid as an iterative scheme, where one starts
with some initial guess on the ï¬nest grid and carries out enough cycles (V-cycles,
W-cycles,. . . ) to achieve convergence. This is the simplest way to use multigrid:
Simply apply enough cycles until some appropriate convergence criterion is met.
However, efï¬ciency can be improved by using the Full Multigrid Algorithm (FMG),
also known as nested iteration.
Instead of starting with an arbitrary approximation on the ï¬nest grid (e.g.,
uh = 0), the ï¬rst approximation is obtained by interpolating from a coarse-grid
solution:
uh = PuH
(19.6.20)
The coarse-grid solution itself is found by a similar FMG process from even coarser
grids. At the coarsest level, you start with the exact solution. Rather than proceed as
in Figure 19.6.1, then, FMG gets to its solution by a series of increasingly tall âNâs,â
each taller one probing a ï¬ner grid (see Figure 19.6.2).
Note that P in (19.6.20) need not be the same P used in the multigrid cycles.
It should be at least of the same order as the discretization Lh, but sometimes a
higher-order operator leads to greater efï¬ciency.
It turns out that you usually need one or at most two multigrid cycles at each
level before proceeding down to the next ï¬ner grid.
While there is theoretical
guidance on the required number of cycles (e.g., [2]), you can easily determine it
empirically. Fix the ï¬nest level and study the solution values as you increase the
number of cycles per level. The asymptotic value of the solutionis the exact solution
of the difference equations.
The difference between this exact solution and the
solution for a small number of cycles is the iteration error. Now ï¬x the number of
cycles to be large, and vary the number of levels, i.e., the smallest value of h used. In
this way you can estimate the truncation error for a given h. In your ï¬nal production
code, there is no point in using more cycles than you need to get the iteration error
down to the size of the truncation error.
The simple multigrid iteration (cycle) needs the right-hand side f only at the
ï¬nest level. FMG needs f at all levels. If the boundary conditions are homogeneous,

you can use fH = Rfh. This prescription is not always safe for inhomogeneous
boundary conditions. In that case it is better to discretize f on each coarse grid.
Note that the FMG algorithm produces the solutionon all levels. It can therefore
be combined with techniques like Richardson extrapolation.
We now give a routine mglin that implements the Full Multigrid Algorithm
for a linear equation, the model problem (19.0.6). It uses red-black Gauss-Seidel as
the smoothing operator, bilinear interpolation for P, and half-weighting for R. To
change the routine to handle another linear problem, all you need do is modify the
functions relax, resid, and slvsml appropriately. A feature of the routine is the
dynamical allocation of storage for variables deï¬ned on the various grids.

â¢ The defect dh vanishes identicallyat all black mesh points after a red-black
Gauss-Seidel step. Thus dH = Rdh for half-weighting reduces to simply
copying half the defect from the ï¬ne grid to the corresponding coarse-grid
point. The calls to resid followed by rstrct in the ï¬rst part of the
V-cycle can be replaced by a routine that loops only over the coarse grid,
ï¬lling it with half the defect.
â¢ Similarly, the quantity eunew
h
= euh + PevH need not be computed at red
mesh points, since they will immediately be redeï¬ned in the subsequent
Gauss-Seidel sweep. This means that addint need only loop over black
points.
â¢ You can speed up relax in several ways. First, you can have a special
form when the initial guess is zero, and omit the routine fill0. Next, you
can store h2fh on the various grids and save a multiplication. Finally, it
is possible to save an addition in the Gauss-Seidel formula by rewriting
it with intermediate variables.
â¢ On typical problems, mglin with ncycle = 1 will return a solution with
the iteration error bigger than the truncation error for the given size of h.
To knock the error down to the size of the truncation error, you have to
set ncycle = 2 or, more cheaply, npre = 2. A more efï¬cient way turns
out to be to use a higher-order P in (19.6.20) than the linear interpolation
used in the V-cycle.
Implementing all the above features typically gives up to a factor of two
improvement in execution time and is certainly worthwhile in a production code.
Nonlinear Multigrid: The FAS Algorithm
Now turn to solving a nonlinear elliptic equation, which we write symbolically as
L(u) = 0
(19.6.21)
Any explicit source term has been moved to the left-hand side. Suppose equation (19.6.21)
is suitably discretized:
Lh(uh) = 0
(19.6.22)
We will see below that in the multigrid algorithm we will have to consider equations where a
nonzero right-hand side is generated during the course of the solution:
Lh(uh) = fh
(19.6.23)
One way of solving nonlinearproblems with multigrid is to use Newtonâs method, which
produces linear equations for the correction term at each iteration. We can then use linear
multigrid to solve these equations. A great strength of the multigrid idea, however, is that it
can be applied directly to nonlinear problems. All we need is a suitable nonlinear relaxation
method to smooth the errors, plus a procedure for approximating corrections on coarser grids.
This direct approach is Brandtâs Full Approximation Storage Algorithm (FAS). No nonlinear
equations need be solved, except perhaps on the coarsest grid.
To develop the nonlinear algorithm, suppose we have a relaxation procedure that can
smooth the residual vector as we did in the linear case. Then we can seek a smooth correction
vh to solve (19.6.23):
Lh(euh + vh) = fh
(19.6.24)
To ï¬nd vh, note that
Lh(euh + vh) âLh(euh) = fh âLh(euh)
= âdh
(19.6.25)

The right-hand side is smooth after a few nonlinear relaxation sweeps. Thus we can transfer
the left-hand side to a coarse grid:
LH(uH) âLH(Reuh) = âRdh
(19.6.26)
that is, we solve
LH(uH) = LH(Reuh) âRdh
(19.6.27)
on the coarse grid. (This is how nonzero right-hand sides appear.) Suppose the approximate
solution is euH. Then the coarse-grid correction is
evH = euH âReuh
(19.6.28)
and
eunew
h
= euh + P(euH âReuh)
(19.6.29)
Note that PR Ì¸= 1 in general, so eunew
h
Ì¸= PeuH. This is a key point: In equation (19.6.29) the
interpolation error comes only from the correction, not from the full solution euH.
Equation (19.6.27) shows that one is solving for the full approximation uH, not just the
error as in the linear algorithm. This is the origin of the name FAS.
The FAS multigrid algorithm thus looks very similar to the linear multigrid algorithm.
The only differences are that both the defect dh and the relaxed approximation uh have to be
restricted to the coarse grid, where now it is equation (19.6.27) that is solved by recursive
invocation of the algorithm. However, instead of implementing the algorithm this way, we
will ï¬rst describe the so-called dual viewpoint, which leads to a powerful alternative way
of looking at the multigrid idea.
The dual viewpoint considers the local truncation error, deï¬ned as
Ï â¡Lh(u) âfh
(19.6.30)
where u is the exact solution of the oiginal continuum equation. If we rewrite this as
Lh(u) = fh + Ï
(19.6.31)
we see that Ï can be regarded as the correction to fh so that the solution of the ï¬ne-grid
equation will be the exact solution u.
Now consider the relative truncation error Ïh, which is deï¬ned on the H-grid relative
to the h-grid:
Ïh â¡LH(Ruh) âRLh(uh)
(19.6.32)
Since Lh(uh) = fh, this can be rewritten as
LH(uH) = fH + Ïh
(19.6.33)
In other words, we can think of Ïh as the correction to fH that makes the solution of the
coarse-grid equation equal to the ï¬ne-grid solution. Of course we cannot compute Ïh, but we
do have an approximation to it from using euh in equation (19.6.32):
Ïh âeÏh â¡LH(Reuh) âRLh(euh)
(19.6.34)
Replacing Ïh by eÏh in equation (19.6.33) gives
LH(uH) = LH(Reuh) âRdh
(19.6.35)
which is just the coarse-grid equation (19.6.27)!
Thus we see that there are two complementary viewpoints for the relation between
coarse and ï¬ne grids:
â¢ Coarse grids are used to accelerate the convergence of the smooth components
of the ï¬ne-grid residuals.

â¢ Fine grids are used to compute correction terms to the coarse-grid equations,
yielding ï¬ne-grid accuracy on the coarse grids.
One beneï¬tof this new viewpoint is that it allows us to derive a natural stopping criterion
for a multigrid iteration. Normally the criterion would be
â¥dhâ¥â¤Ïµ
(19.6.36)
and the question is how to choose Ïµ.
There is clearly no beneï¬t in iterating beyond the
point when the remaining error is dominated by the local truncation error Ï. The computable
quantity is eÏh. What is the relation between Ï and eÏh? For the typical case of a second-order
accurate differencing scheme,
Ï = Lh(u) âLh(uh) = h2Ï2(x, y) + Â· Â· Â·
(19.6.37)
Assume the solution satisï¬es uh = u + h2u2(x, y) + Â· Â· Â· . Then, assuming R is of high
enough order that we can neglect its effect, equation (19.6.32) gives
Ïh âLH(u + h2u2) âLh(u + h2u2)
= LH(u) âLh(u) + h2[Lâ²
H(u2) âLâ²
h(u2)] + Â· Â· Â·
= (H2 âh2)Ï2 + O(h4)
(19.6.38)
For the usual case of H = 2h we therefore have
Ï â1
3Ïh â1
3 eÏh
(19.6.39)
The stopping criterion is thus equation (19.6.36) with
Ïµ = Î±â¥eÏhâ¥,
Î± â¼1
3
(19.6.40)
We have one remaining task before implementing our nonlinear multigrid algorithm:
choosing a nonlinear relaxation scheme. Once again, your ï¬rst choice should probably be
the nonlinear Gauss-Seidel scheme.
If the discretized equation (19.6.23) is written with
some choice of ordering as
Li(u1, . . . , uN) = fi,
i = 1, . . . , N
(19.6.41)
then the nonlinear Gauss-Seidel schemes solves
Li(u1, . . . , uiâ1, unew
i
, ui+1, . . . , uN) = fi
(19.6.42)
for unew
i
. As usualnew uâs replaceold uâs as soonas they havebeencomputed. Often equation
(19.6.42) is linear in unew
i
, since the nonlinear terms are discretized by means of its neighbors.
If this is not the case, we replace equation (19.6.42) by one step of a Newton iteration:
unew
i
= uold
i
âLi(uold
i
) âfi
âLi(uold
i
)/âui
(19.6.43)
For example, consider the simple nonlinear equation
â2u + u2 = Ï
(19.6.44)
In two-dimensional notation, we have
L(ui,j) = (ui+1,j + uiâ1,j + ui,j+1 + ui,jâ1 â4ui,j)/h2 + u2
i,j âÏi,j = 0
(19.6.45)
Since
âL
âui,j = â4/h2 + 2ui,j
(19.6.46)
the Newton Gauss-Seidel iteration is
unew
i,j
= ui,j â
L(ui,j)
â4/h2 + 2ui,j
(19.6.47)
Here is a routine mgfasthat solves equation(19.6.44) using the Full Multigrid Algorithm
and the FAS scheme. Restriction and prolongation are done as in mglin. We have included
the convergencetest based on equation (19.6.40). A successfulmultigrid solution of a problem
should aim to satisfy this condition with the maximum number of V-cycles, maxcyc, equal to
1 or 2. The routine mgfas uses the same functions copy, interp, and rstrct as mglin.

Less-Numerical
Algorithms
20.0 Introduction
You can stop reading now. You are done with Numerical Recipes, as such. This
ï¬nal chapter is an idiosyncratic collection of âless-numerical recipesâ which, for one
reason or another, we have decided to include between the covers of an otherwise
more-numerically oriented book. Authors of computer science texts, weâve noticed,
like to throw in a token numerical subject (usually quite a dull one â quadrature,
for example). We ï¬nd that we are not free of the reverse tendency.
Our selection of material is not completely arbitrary. One topic, Gray codes, was
already used in the construction of quasi-random sequences (Â§7.7), and here needs
only some additional explication. Two other topics, on diagnosing a computerâs
ï¬oating-point parameters, and on arbitrary precision arithmetic, give additional
insight into the machinery behind the casual assumption that computers are useful
for doing things with numbers (as opposed to bits or characters). The latter of these
topics also shows a very different use for Chapter 12âs fast Fourier transform.
The three other topics (checksums, Huffman and arithmetic coding) involve
different aspects of data coding, compression, and validation. If you handle a large
amount of data â numerical data, even â then a passing familiarity with these
subjects might at some point come in handy. In Â§13.6, for example, we already
encountered a good use for Huffman coding.
But again, you donât have to read this chapter. (And you should learn about
quadrature from Chapters 4 and 16, not from a computer science text!)
20.1 Diagnosing Machine Parameters
A convenient ï¬ction is that a computerâs ï¬oating-point arithmetic is âaccurate
enough.â If you believe this ï¬ction, then numerical analysis becomes a very clean
subject.
Roundoff error disappears from view; many ï¬nite algorithms become
âexactâ; only docile truncation error (Â§1.3) stands between you and a perfect
calculation. Sounds rather naive, doesnât it?
Yes, it is naive. Notwithstanding, it is a ï¬ction necessarily adopted throughout
most of this book. To do a good job of answering the question of how roundoff error

propagates, or can be bounded, for every algorithm that we have discussed would be
impractical. In fact, it would not be possible: Rigorous analysis of many practical
algorithms has never been made, by us or anyone.
Proper numerical analysts cringe when they hear a user say, âI was getting
roundoff errors with single precision, so I switched to double.â The actual meaning
is, âfor this particular algorithm, and my particular data, double precision seemed
able to restore my erroneous belief in the âconvenient ï¬ctionâ.â We admit that most
of the mentions of precision or roundoff in Numerical Recipes are only slightlymore
quantitative in character. That comes along with our trying to be âpractical.â
It is important to know what the limitations of your machineâs ï¬oating-point
arithmetic actually are â the more so when your treatment of ï¬oating-pointroundoff
error is going to be intuitive, experimental, or casual.
Methods for determining
useful ï¬oating-point parameters experimentally have been developed by Cody [1],
Malcolm [2], and others, and are embodied in the routine machar, below, which
follows Codyâs implementation.
All of macharâs arguments are returned values. Here is what they mean:
â¢ ibeta (called B in Â§1.3) is the radix in which numbers are represented,
almost always 2, but occasionally 16, or even 10.
â¢ it is the number of base-ibeta digits in the ï¬oating-point mantissa M
(see Figure 1.3.1).
â¢ machep is the exponent of the smallest (most negative) power of ibeta
that, added to 1.0, gives something different from 1.0.
â¢ eps is the ï¬oating-point number ibetamachep, loosely referred to as the
âï¬oating-point precision.â
â¢ negep is the exponent of the smallest power of ibeta that, subtracted
from 1.0, gives something different from 1.0.
â¢ epsneg is ibetanegep, another way of deï¬ning ï¬oating-point precision.
Not infrequently epsneg is 0.5 times eps; occasionally eps and epsneg
are equal.
â¢ iexp is the number of bits in the exponent (including its sign or bias).
â¢ minexp is the smallest (most negative) power of ibeta consistent with
there being no leading zeros in the mantissa.
â¢ xmin is the ï¬oating-point number ibetaminexp, generally the smallest
(in magnitude) useable ï¬oating value.
â¢ maxexp is the smallest (positive) power of ibeta that causes overï¬ow.
â¢ xmaxis (1âepsneg)Ãibetamaxexp, generally the largest (inmagnitude)
useable ï¬oating value.
â¢ irnd returns a code in the range 0 . . .5, givinginformationon what kind of
roundingis done in addition, and on how underï¬ow is handled. See below.
â¢ ngrd is the number of âguard digitsâ used when truncating the product of
two mantissas to ï¬t the representation.
There is a lot of subtlety in a program like machar, whose purpose is to ferret
out machine properties that are supposed to be transparent to the user. Further, it must
do so avoiding error conditions, like overï¬ow and underï¬ow, that might interrupt
its execution. In some cases the program is able to do this only by recognizing
certain characteristics of âstandardâ representations.
For example, it recognizes
the IEEE standard representation [3] by its rounding behavior, and assumes certain
features of its exponent representation as a consequence. We refer you to [1] and

references therein for details. Be aware that machar can give incorrect results on
some nonstandard machines.
The parameter irnd needs some additional explanation. In the IEEE standard,
bit patterns correspond to exact, ârepresentableâ numbers. The speciï¬ed method
for rounding an addition is to add two representable numbers âexactly,â and then
round the sum to the closest representable number. If the sum is precisely halfway
between two representable numbers, it should be rounded to the even one (low-order
bit zero). The same behavior should hold for all the other arithmetic operations,
that is, they should be done in a manner equivalent to inï¬nite precision, and then
rounded to the closest representable number.
If irnd returns 2 or 5, then your computer is compliant with this standard. If it
returns 1 or 4, then it is doing some kind of rounding, but not the IEEE standard. If
irnd returns 0 or 3, then it is truncating the result, not rounding it â not desirable.
The other issue addressed by irnd concerns underï¬ow. If a ï¬oating value is
less than xmin, many computers underï¬ow its value to zero. Values irnd = 0, 1,
or 2 indicate this behavior. The IEEE standard speciï¬es a more graceful kind of
underï¬ow: As a value becomes smaller than xmin, its exponent is frozen at the
smallest allowed value, while its mantissa is decreased, acquiring leading zeros and
âgracefullyâ losing precision. This is indicated by irnd = 3, 4, or 5.

20.2 Gray Codes
A Gray code is a function G(i) of the integers i, that for each integer N â¥0
is one-to-one for 0 â¤i â¤2N â1, and that has the following remarkable property:
The binary representation of G(i) and G(i+1) differ in exactly one bit. An example
of a Gray code (in fact, the most commonly used one) is the sequence 0000, 0001,
0011, 0010, 0110, 0111, 0101, 0100, 1100, 1101, 1111, 1110, 1010, 1011, 1001, and
1000, for i = 0, . . ., 15. The algorithm for generating this code is simply to form
the bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) of i with i/2 (integer part). Think about how the
carries work when you add one to a number in binary, and you will be able to see
why this works. You will also see that G(i) and G(i + 1) differ in the bit position of
the rightmost zero bit of i (preï¬xing a leading zero if necessary).
The spelling is âGray,â not âgrayâ: The codes are named after one Frank Gray,
who ï¬rst patented the idea for use in shaft encoders. A shaft encoder is a wheel with
concentric coded stripes each of which is âreadâ by a ï¬xed conducting brush. The
idea is to generate a binary code describing the angle of the wheel. The obvious,
but wrong, way to build a shaft encoder is to have one stripe (the innermost, say)
conducting on half the wheel, but insulating on the other half; the next stripe is
conducting in quadrants 1 and 3; the next stripe is conducting in octants 1, 3, 5,

and 7; and so on.
The brushes together then read a direct binary code for the
position of the wheel.
The reason this method is bad, is that there is no way to guarantee that all the
brushes will make or break contact exactly simultaneously as the wheel turns. Going
from position7 (0111) to 8 (1000), one might pass spuriously and transiently through
6 (0110), 14 (1110), and 10 (1010), as the different brushes make or break contact.
Use of a Gray code on the encoding stripes guarantees that there is no transient state
between 7 (0100 in the sequence above) and 8 (1100).
Of course we then need circuitry, or algorithmics, to translate from G(i) to i.
Figure 20.2.1 (b) shows how this is done by a cascade of XOR gates. The idea is
that each output bit should be the XOR of all more signiï¬cant input bits. To do
N bits of Gray code inversion requires N â1 steps (or gate delays) in the circuit.
(Nevertheless, this is typically very fast in circuitry.) In a register with word-wide
binary operations, we donât have to do N consecutive operations, but only ln2 N.
The trick is to use the associativity of XOR and group the operations hierarchically.
This involves sequential right-shifts by 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . bits until the wordlength is

In numerical work, Gray codes can be useful when you need to do some task
that depends intimately on the bits of i, looping over many values of i. Then, if there
are economies in repeating the task for values differing by only one bit, it makes
sense to do things in Gray code order rather than consecutive order. We saw an
example of this in Â§7.7, for the generation of quasi-random sequences.

20.3 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums
When you send a sequence of bits from point A to point B, you want to know
that it will arrive without error. A common form of insurance is the âparity bit,â
attached to 7-bit ASCII characters to put them into 8-bit format. The parity bit is
chosen so as to make the total number of one-bits (versus zero-bits) either always
even (âeven parityâ) or always odd (âodd parityâ). Any single bit error in a character
will thereby be detected. When errors are sufï¬ciently rare, and do not occur closely
bunched in time, use of parity provides sufï¬cient error detection.
Unfortunately, in real situations, a single noise âeventâ is likely to disrupt more
than one bit. Since the parity bit has two possible values (0 and 1), it gives, on
average, only a 50% chance of detecting an erroneous character with more than one
wrong bit. That probability, 50%, is not nearly good enough for most applications.
Most communications protocols [1] use a multibit generalization of the parity bit
called a âcyclic redundancy checkâ or CRC. In typical applications the CRC is 16
bits long (two bytes or two characters), so that the chance of a random error going
undetected is 1 in 216 = 65536. Moreover, M-bit CRCs have the mathematical

property of detecting all errors that occur in M or fewer consecutive bits, for any
length of message. (We prove this below.) Since noise in communication channels
tends to be âbursty,â with short sequences of adjacent bits getting corrupted, this
consecutive-bit property is highly desirable.
Normally CRCs lie in the province of communications software experts and
chip-level hardware designers â people with bits under their ï¬ngernails. However,
there are at least two kinds of situations where some understanding of CRCs can be
useful to the rest of us. First, we sometimes need to be able to communicate with
a lower-level piece of hardware or software that expects a valid CRC as part of its
input. For example, it can be convenient to have a program generate XMODEM
or Kermit [2] packets directly into the communications line rather than having to
store the data in a local ï¬le.
Second, in the manipulation of large quantities of (e.g., experimental) data, it
is useful to be able to tag aggregates of data (whether numbers, records, lines, or
whole ï¬les) with a statistically unique âkey,â its CRC. Aggregates of any size can
then be compared for identity by comparing only their short CRC keys. Differing
keys imply nonidentical records. Identical keys imply, to high statistical certainty,
identical records. If you canât tolerate the very small probabilityof being wrong, you
can do a full comparison of the records when the keys are identical. When there is a
possibility of ï¬les or data records being inadvertently or irresponsibly modiï¬ed (for
example, by a computer virus), it is useful to have their prior CRCs stored externally
on a physically secure medium, like a ï¬oppy disk.
Sometimes CRCs can be used to compress data as it is recorded. If identical data
records occur frequently, one can keep sorted in memory the CRCs of previously
encountered records.
A new record is archived in full if its CRC is different,
otherwise only a pointer to a previous record need be archived. In this application
one might desire a 4- or 8-byte CRC, to make the odds of mistakenly discarding
a different data record be tolerably small; or, if previous records can be randomly
accessed, a full comparison can be made to decide whether records with identical
CRCs are in fact identical.
Now let us brieï¬y discuss the theory of CRCs.
After that, we will give
implementations of various (related) CRCs that are used by the ofï¬cial or de facto
standard protocols [1-3] listed in the accompanying table.
The mathematics underlying CRCs is âpolynomials over the integers modulo
2.â Any binary message can be thought of as a polynomial with coefï¬cients 0 and 1.
For example, the message â1100001101â is the polynomial x9 + x8 + x3 + x2 + 1.
Since 0 and 1 are the only integers modulo 2, a power of x in the polynomial is
either present (1) or absent (0). A polynomial over the integers modulo 2 may be
irreducible, meaning that it canât be factored. A subset of the irreduciblepolynomials
are the âprimitiveâ polynomials. These generate maximum length sequences when
used in shift registers, as described in Â§7.4. The polynomial x2 +1 is not irreducible:
x2+1 = (x+1)(x+1),so it is also not primitive. The polynomial x4+x3+x2+x+1
is irreducible, but it turns out not to be primitive. The polynomial x4 + x + 1 is
both irreducible and primitive.
An M-bit long CRC is based on a particular primitive polynomial of degree M,
called the generator polynomial. The choice of which primitive polynomial to use
is only a matter of convention. For 16-bit CRCâs, the CCITT (ComitÂ´e Consultatif
International TÂ´elÂ´egraphique et TÂ´elÂ´ephonique) has anointed the âCCITT polynomial,â

C1 is CRCâs least

which is x16 + x12 + x5 + 1. This polynomial is used by all of the protocols listed in
the table. Another common choice is the âCRC-16â polynomial x16 + x15 + x2 + 1,
which is used for EBCDIC messages in IBMâs BISYNCH [1]. A common 12-bit
choice, âCRC-12,â is x12+x11 +x3+x+1. A common 32-bit choice, âAUTODIN-
II,â is x32+x26+x23+x22+x16+x12+x11+x10+x8 +x7+x5+x4+x2+x+1.
For a table of some other primitive polynomials, see Â§7.4.
Given the generator polynomial G of degree M (which can be written either
in polynomial form or as a bit-string, e.g., 10001000000100001 for CCITT), here is
how you compute the CRC for a sequence of bits S: First, multiply S by xM, that is,
append M zero bits to it. Second divide â by long division â G into SxM. Keep
in mind that the subtractions in the long division are done modulo 2, so that there
are never any âborrowsâ: Modulo 2 subtraction is the same as logical exclusive-or
(XOR). Third, ignore the quotient you get. Fourth, when you eventually get to a
remainder, it is the CRC, call it C. C will be a polynomial of degree M â1 or less,
otherwise you would not have ï¬nished the long division. Therefore, in bit string
form, it has M bits, which may include leading zeros. (C might even be all zeros,
see below.) See [3] for a worked example.
If you work through the above steps in an example, you will see that most of
what you write down in the long-division tableau is superï¬uous. You are actually
just left-shifting sequential bits of S, from the right, into an M-bit register. Every
time a 1 bit gets shifted off the left end of this register, you zap the register by an
XOR with the M low order bits of G (that is, all the bits of G except its leading
1). When a 0 bit is shifted off the left end you donât zap the register. When the
last bit that was originally part of S gets shifted off the left end of the register,
what remains is the CRC.
You can immediately recognize how efï¬ciently this procedure can be imple-
mented in hardware. It requires only a shift register with a few hard-wired XOR
taps into it. That is how CRCs are computed in communications devices, by a single

chip (or small part of one). In software, the implementation is not so elegant, since
bit-shifting is not generally very efï¬cient. One therefore typically ï¬nds (as in our
implementation below) table-driven routines that pre-calculate the result of a bunch
of shifts and XORs, say for each of 256 possible 8-bit inputs [4].
We can now see how the CRC gets its ability to detect all errors in M
consecutive bits. Suppose two messages, S and T, differ only within a frame of M
bits. Then their CRCs differ by an amount that is the remainder when G is divided
into (S âT)xM â¡D. Now D has the form of leading zeros (which can be ignored),
followed by some 1âs in an M-bit frame, followed by trailing zeros (which are just
multiplicative factors of x). Since factorization is unique, G cannot possibly divide
D: G is primitive of degree M, while D is a power of x times a factor of (at most)
degree M â1. Therefore S and T have inevitably different CRCs.
In most protocols, a transmitted block of data consists of some N data bits,
directly followed by the M bits of their CRC (or the CRC XORed with a constant,
see below). There are two equivalent ways of validating a block at the receiving end.
Most obviously, the receiver can compute the CRC of the data bits, and compare it to
the transmitted CRC bits. Less obviously, but more elegantly, the receiver can simply
compute the CRC of the total block, with N +M bits, and verify that a result of zero
is obtained. Proof: The total block is the polynomial SxM + C (data left-shifted to
make room for the CRC bits). The deï¬nition of C is that Sxm = QG + C, where
Q is the discarded quotient. But then SxM + C = QG + C + C = QG (remember
modulo 2), which is a perfect multiple of G. It remains a multiple of G when it gets
multiplied by an additional xM on the receiving end, so it has a zero CRC, q.e.d.
A couple of small variations on the basic procedure need to be mentioned [1,3]:
First, when the CRC is computed, the M-bit register need not be initialized to zero.
Initializing it to some other M-bit value (e.g., all 1âs) in effect prefaces all blocks by
a phantom message that would have given the initialization value as its remainder.
It is advantageous to do this, since the CRC described thus far otherwise cannot
detect the addition or removal of any number of initial zero bits. (Loss of an initial
bit, or insertion of zero bits, are common âclocking errors.â) Second, one can add
(XOR) any M-bit constant K to the CRC before it is transmitted. This constant
can either be XORed away at the receiving end, or else it just changes the expected
CRC of the whole block by a known amount, namely the remainder of dividing G
into KxM. The constant K is frequently âall bits,â changing the CRC into its ones
complement. This has the advantage of detecting another kind of error that the CRC
would otherwise not ï¬nd: deletion of an initial 1 bit in the message with spurious
insertion of a 1 bit at the end of the block.
The accompanying function icrc implements the above CRC calculation,
including the possibility of the mentioned variations.
Input to the function is a
pointer to an array of characters, and the length of that array. icrc has two âswitchâ
arguments that specify variations in the CRC calculation. A zero or positive value
of jinit causes the 16-bit register to have each byte initialized with the value
jinit. A negative value of jrev causes each input character to be interpreted as
its bit-reverse image, and a similar bit reversal to be done on the output CRC. You
do not have to understand this; just use the values of jinit and jrev speciï¬ed in
the table. (If you insist on knowing, the explanation is that serial data ports send
characters least-signiï¬cant bit ï¬rst (!), and many protocols shift bits into the CRC
register in exactly the order received.) The table shows how to construct a block

of characters from the input array and output CRC of icrc. You should not need
to do any additional bit-reversal outside of icrc.
The switch jinit has one additional use: When negative it causes the input
value of the array crc to be used as initializationof the register. If you set crc to the
result of the last call to icrc, this in effect appends the current input array to that of
the previous call or calls. Use this feature, for example, to build up the CRC of a
whole ï¬le a line at a time, without keeping the whole ï¬le in memory.
The routine icrc is loosely based on the function in [4].
Here is how to
understand its operation: First look at the function icrc1. This incorporates one
input character into a 16-bit CRC register. The only trick used is that character bits
are XORed into the most signiï¬cant bits, eight at a time, instead of being fed into
the least signiï¬cant bit, one bit at a time, at the time of the register shift. This works
because XOR is associative and commutative â we can feed in character bits any
time before they will determine whether to zap with the generator polynomial. (The
decimal constant 4129 has the generatorâs bits in it.)
unsigned short icrc1(unsigned short crc, unsigned char onech)
Given a remainder up to now, return the new CRC after one character is added. This routine
is functionally equivalent to icrc(,,1,-1,1), but slower. It is used by icrc to initialize its
table.
{
int i;
unsigned short ans=(crc ^ onech << 8);
for (i=0;i<8;i++) {
Here is where 8 one-bit shifts, and some XORs with the
generator polynomial, are done.
if (ans & 0x8000)
ans = (ans <<= 1) ^ 4129;
else
ans <<= 1;
}
return ans;
}
Now look at icrc. There are two parts to understand, how it builds a table
when it initializes, and how it uses that table later on. Go back to thinking about a
characterâs bits being shifted into the CRC register from the least signiï¬cant end. The
key observation is that while 8 bits are being shifted into the registerâs low end, all
the generator zapping is being determined by the bits already in the high end. Since
XOR is commutative and associative, all we need is a table of the result of all this
zapping, for each of 256 possible high-bit conï¬gurations. Then we can play catch-up
and XOR an input character into the result of a lookup into this table. The only
other content to icrc is the construction at initialization time of an 8-bit bit-reverse
table from the 4-bit table stored in it, and the logic associated with doing the bit
reversals. References [4-6] give further details on table-driven CRC computations.

What if you need a 32-bit checksum? For a true 32-bit CRC, you will need
to rewrite the routines given to work with a longer generating polynomial. For
example, x32 +x7 +x5 +x3 +x2 +x+1 is primitivemodulo 2, and has nonleading,
nonzero bits only in its least signiï¬cant byte (which makes for some simpliï¬cation).
The idea of table lookup on only the most signiï¬cant byte of the CRC register
goes through unchanged.
If you do not care about the M-consecutive bit property of the checksum, but
rather only need a statistically random 32 bits, then you can use icrc as given
here: Call it once with jrev = 1 to get 16 bits, and again with jrev = â1 to get
another 16 bits. The internal bit reversals make these two 16-bit CRCs in effect
totally independent of each other.
Other Kinds of Checksums
Quite different from CRCs are the various techniques used to append a decimal
âcheck digitâ to numbers that are handled by human beings (e.g., typed into a
computer). Check digits need to be proof against the kinds of highly structured
errors that humans tend to make, such as transposing consecutive digits. Wagner and
Putter [7] give an interesting introductiontothis subject,including speciï¬c algorithms.
Checksums now in widespread use vary from fair to poor. The 10-digit ISBN
(International Standard Book Number) that you ï¬nd on most books, including this
one, uses the check equation
10d1 + 9d2 + 8d3 + Â· Â· Â· + 2d9 + d10 = 0
(mod 11)
(20.3.1)
where d10 is the right-hand check digit. The character âXâ is used to represent a
check digit value of 10. Another popular scheme is the so-called âIBM check,â often

The bar code put on many envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service is decoded by
removing the single tall marker bars at each end, and breaking the remaining bars
into 6 or 10 groups of ï¬ve. In each group the ï¬ve bars signify (from left to right)
the values 7,4,2,1,0. Exactly two of them will be tall. Their sum is the represented

None of these schemes is close to optimal. An elegant scheme due to Verhoeff
is described in [7]. The underlying idea is to use the ten-element dihedral group D5,
which corresponds to the symmetries of a pentagon, instead of the cyclic group of
the integers modulo 10. The check equation is
a1*f(a2)*f2(a3)* Â· Â· Â·*fnâ1(an) = 0
(20.3.5)
where * is (noncommutative) multiplication in D5, and fi denotes the ith iteration
of a certain ï¬xed permutation. Verhoeffâs method ï¬nds all single errors in a string,
and all adjacent transpositions. It also ï¬nds about 95% of twin errors (aa âbb),
jump transpositions (acb âbca), and jump twin errors (aca âbcb). Here is an
implementation:
int decchk(char string[], int n, char *ch)
Decimal check digit computation or veriï¬cation. Returns as ch a check digit for appending
to string[1..n], that is, for storing into string[n+1]. In this mode, ignore the returned
boolean (integer) value. If string[1..n] already ends with a check digit (string[n]), re-
turns the function value true (1) if the check digit is valid, otherwise false (0). In this mode,
ignore the returned value of ch. Note that string and ch contain ASCII characters corre-
sponding to the digits 0-9, not byte values in that range. Other ASCII characters are allowed in
string, and are ignored in calculating the check digit.

20.4 Huffman Coding and Compression of Data
A lossless data compression algorithm takes a string of symbols (typically
ASCII characters or bytes) and translates it reversibly into another string, one that
is on the average of shorter length.
The words âon the averageâ are crucial; it
is obvious that no reversible algorithm can make all strings shorter â there just
arenât enough short strings to be in one-to-one correspondence with longer strings.
Compression algorithms are possible only when, on the input side, some strings, or
some input symbols, are more common than others. These can then be encoded in
fewer bits than rarer input strings or symbols, giving a net average gain.
There exist many, quite different, compression techniques, corresponding to
different ways of detecting and usingdepartures from equiprobabilityin input strings.
In this section and the next we shall consider only variable length codes with deï¬ned
word inputs.
In these, the input is sliced into ï¬xed units, for example ASCII
characters, while the corresponding output comes in chunks of variable size. The
simplest such method is Huffman coding [1], discussed in this section.
Another
example, arithmetic compression, is discussed in Â§20.5.
At the opposite extreme from deï¬ned-word, variable length codes are schemes
that divide up the input into units of variable length (words or phrases of English text,
for example) and then transmit these, often witha ï¬xed-lengthoutput code. The most
widely used code of this type is the Ziv-Lempel code [2]. References [3-6] give the
ï¬avor of some other compression techniques, with references to the large literature.
The idea behind Huffman coding is simply to use shorter bit patterns for more
common characters. We can make this idea quantitative by considering the concept
of entropy. Suppose the input alphabet has Nch characters, and that these occur in
the input string with respective probabilities pi, i = 1, . . ., Nch, so that Ppi = 1.
Then the fundamental theorem of information theory says that strings consisting of

independently random sequences of these characters (a conservative, but not always
realistic assumption) require, on the average, at least
H = â
X
pi log2 pi
(20.4.1)
bits per character. Here H is the entropy of the probability distribution. Moreover,
coding schemes exist which approach the bound arbitrarily closely. For the case of
equiprobable characters, with all pi = 1/Nch, one easily sees that H = log2 Nch,
which is the case of no compression at all. Any other set of piâs gives a smaller
entropy, allowing some useful compression.
Notice that the boundof(20.4.1) wouldbe achieved ifwe couldencode character
i with a code of length Li = âlog2 pi bits: Equation (20.4.1) would then be the
average P piLi. The trouble with such a scheme is that âlog2 pi is not generally
an integer. How can we encode the letter âQâ in 5.32 bits? Huffman coding makes
a stab at this by, in effect, approximating all the probabilities pi by integer powers
of 1/2, so that all the Liâs are integral. If all the piâs are in fact of this form, then a
Huffman code does achieve the entropy bound H.
The construction of a Huffman code is best illustrated by example. Imagine
a language, Vowellish, with the Nch = 5 character alphabet A, E, I, O, and U,
occurring with the respective probabilities 0.12, 0.42, 0.09, 0.30, and 0.07. Then the
construction of a Huffman code for Vowellish is accomplished in the followingtable:

Here is how it works, proceeding in sequence through Nch stages, represented
by the columns of the table. The ï¬rst stage starts with Nch nodes, one for each
letter of the alphabet, containing their respective relative frequencies. At each stage,
the two smallest probabilities are found, summed to make a new node, and then
dropped from the list of active nodes. (A âblockâ denotes the stage where a node is
dropped.) All active nodes (including the new composite) are then carried over to
the next stage (column). In the table, the names assigned to new nodes (e.g., AUI)
are inconsequential. In the example shown, it happens that (after stage 1) the two

Figure 20.4.1.
Huffman code for the ï¬ctitious language Vowellish, in tree form. A letter (A, E, I,
O, or U) is encoded or decoded by traversing the tree from the top down; the code is the sequence of
0âs and 1âs on the branches. The value to the right of each node is its probability; to the left, its node
number in the accompanying table.
smallest nodes are always an original node and a composite one; this need not be
true in general: The two smallest probabilities might be both original nodes, or both
composites, or one of each. At the last stage, all nodes will have been collected into
one grand composite of total probability 1.
Now, to see the code, you redraw the data in the above table as a tree (Figure
20.4.1). As shown, each node of the tree corresponds to a node (row) in the table,
indicated by the integer to its left and probability value to its right. Terminal nodes,
so called, are shown as circles; these are single alphabetic characters. The branches
of the tree are labeled 0 and 1. The code for a character is the sequence of zeros and
ones that lead to it, from the top down. For example, E is simply 0, while U is 1010.
Any string of zeros and ones can now be decoded into an alphabetic sequence.
Consider, for example, the string 1011111010. Starting at the top of the tree we
descend through 1011 to I, the ï¬rst character. Since we have reached a terminal
node, we reset to the top of the tree, next descending through 11 to O. Finally 1010
gives U. The string thus decodes to IOU.
These ideas are embodied in the following routines. Input to the ï¬rst routine
hufmak is an integer vector of the frequency of occurrence of the nchin â¡Nch
alphabetic characters, i.e., a set of integers proportional to the piâs. hufmak, along
with hufapp, which it calls, performs the constructionof the above table, and also the
tree of Figure 20.4.1. The routine utilizes a heap structure (see Â§8.3) for efï¬ciency;
for a detailed description, see Sedgewick [7].

Decoding a Huffman-encoded message is slightly more complicated.
The

typedef struct {
unsigned long *icod,*ncod,*left,*right,nch,nodemax;
} huffcode;
void hufdec(unsigned long *ich, unsigned char *code, unsigned long lcode,
unsigned long *nb, huffcode *hcode)
Starting at bit number nb in the character array code[1..lcode], use the Huï¬man code stored
in the structure hcode to decode a single character (returned as ich in the range 0..nch-1)
and increment nb appropriately. Repeated calls, starting with nb = 0 will return successive
characters in a compressed message. The returned value ich=nch indicates end-of-message.
The structure hcode must already have been deï¬ned and allocated in your main program, and
also ï¬lled by a call to hufmak.
{
long nc,node;
static unsigned char setbit[8]={0x1,0x2,0x4,0x8,0x10,0x20,0x40,0x80};
node=hcode->nodemax;
for (;;) {
Set node to the top of the decoding tree, and loop
until a valid character is obtained.
nc=(*nb >> 3);
if (++nc > lcode) {
Ran out of input; with ich=nch indicating end of
message.
*ich=hcode->nch;
return;
}
node=(code[nc] & setbit[7 & (*nb)++] ?
hcode->right[node] : hcode->left[node]);
Branch left or right in tree, depending on its value.
if (node <= hcode->nch) {
If we reach a terminal node, we have a complete
character and can return.

For simplicity, hufdec quits when it runs out of code bytes; if your coded
message is not an integral number of bytes, and if Nch is less than 256, hufdec
can return a spurious ï¬nal character or two, decoded from the spurious trailing
bits in your last code byte. If you have independent knowledge of the number of
characters sent, you can readily discard these. Otherwise, you can ï¬x this behavior
by providing a bit, not byte, count, and modifying the routine accordingly. (When
Nch is 256 or larger, hufdec will normally run out of code in the middle of a
spurious character, and it will be discarded.)
Run-Length Encoding
For the compression of highly correlated bit-streams (for example the black or
white values along a facsimile scan line), Huffman compression is often combined
with run-length encoding: Instead of sending each bit, the input stream is converted
to a series of integers indicating how many consecutive bits have the same value.
These integers are then Huffman-compressed.
The Group 3 CCITT facsimile
standard functions in this manner, with a ï¬xed, immutable, Huffman code, optimized
for a set of eight standard documents [8,9].

20.5 Arithmetic Coding
We saw in the previous section that a perfect (entropy-bounded) coding scheme
would use Li = âlog2 pi bits to encode character i (in the range 1 â¤i â¤Nch),
if pi is its probability of occurrence. Huffman coding gives a way of rounding the
Liâs to close integer values and constructing a code with those lengths. Arithmetic
coding [1], which we now discuss, actually does manage to encode characters using
noninteger numbers of bits! It also provides a convenient way to output the result
not as a stream of bits, but as a stream of symbols in any desired radix. This latter
property is particularly useful if you want, e.g., to convert data from bytes (radix
256) to printable ASCII characters (radix 94), or to case-independent alphanumeric
sequences containing only A-Z and 0-9 (radix 36).
In arithmetic coding, an input message of any length is represented as a real
number R in the range 0 â¤R < 1. The longer the message, the more precision
required of R. This is best illustrated by an example, so let us return to the ï¬ctitious
language, Vowellish, of the previous section. Recall that Vowellish has a 5 character
alphabet (A, E, I, O, U), with occurrence probabilities 0.12, 0.42, 0.09, 0.30, and
0.07, respectively. Figure 20.5.1 shows how a message beginning âIOUâ is encoded:
The interval [0, 1) is divided into segments corresponding to the 5 alphabetical
characters; the length of a segment is the corresponding pi. We see that the ï¬rst
message character, âIâ, narrows the range of R to 0.37 â¤R < 0.46. This interval is
now subdividedintoï¬ve subintervals, again withlengths proportionalto the piâs. The
second message character, âOâ, narrows the range of R to 0.3763 â¤R < 0.4033.
The âUâ character further narrows the range to 0.37630 â¤R < 0.37819. Any value
of R in this range can be sent as encoding âIOUâ. In particular, the binary fraction
.011000001 is in this range, so âIOUâ can be sent in 9 bits. (Huffman coding took
10 bits for this example, see Â§20.4.)
Of course there is the problem of knowing when to stop decoding.
The
fraction .011000001 represents not simply âIOU,â but âIOU. . .,â where the ellipses
represent an inï¬nite string of successor characters.
To resolve this ambiguity,
arithmetic coding generally assumes the existence of a special Nch + 1th character,
EOM (end of message), which occurs only once at the end of the input. Since
EOM has a low probability of occurrence, it gets allocated only a very tiny piece
of the number line.
In the above example, we gave R as a binary fraction. We could just as well
have output it in any other radix, e.g., base 94 or base 36, whatever is convenient
for the anticipated storage or communication channel.
You might wonder how one deals with the seemingly incredible precision
required of R for a long message. The answer is that R is never actually represented
all at once. At any give stage we have upper and lower bounds for R represented
as a ï¬nite number of digits in the output radix. As digits of the upper and lower
bounds become identical, we can left-shift them away and bring in new digits at the
low-signiï¬cance end. The routines below have a parameter NWK for the number of
working digits to keep around. This must be large enough to make the chance of
an accidental degeneracy vanishingly small. (The routines signal if a degeneracy
ever occurs.) Since the process of discarding old digits and bringing in new ones is
performed identically on encoding and decoding, everything stays synchronized.

not as a stream of bits, but as a stream of symbols in any desired radix. This latter
property is particularly useful if you want, e.g., to convert data from bytes (radix
256) to printable ASCII characters (radix 94), or to case-independent alphanumeric
sequences containing only A-Z and 0-9 (radix 36).
In arithmetic coding, an input message of any length is represented as a real
number R in the range 0 â¤R < 1. The longer the message, the more precision
required of R. This is best illustrated by an example, so let us return to the ï¬ctitious
language, Vowellish, of the previous section. Recall that Vowellish has a 5 character
alphabet (A, E, I, O, U), with occurrence probabilities 0.12, 0.42, 0.09, 0.30, and
0.07, respectively. Figure 20.5.1 shows how a message beginning âIOUâ is encoded:
The interval [0, 1) is divided into segments corresponding to the 5 alphabetical
characters; the length of a segment is the corresponding pi. We see that the ï¬rst
message character, âIâ, narrows the range of R to 0.37 â¤R < 0.46. This interval is
now subdividedintoï¬ve subintervals, again withlengths proportionalto the piâs. The
second message character, âOâ, narrows the range of R to 0.3763 â¤R < 0.4033.
The âUâ character further narrows the range to 0.37630 â¤R < 0.37819. Any value
of R in this range can be sent as encoding âIOUâ. In particular, the binary fraction
.011000001 is in this range, so âIOUâ can be sent in 9 bits. (Huffman coding took
10 bits for this example, see Â§20.4.)
Of course there is the problem of knowing when to stop decoding.
The
fraction .011000001 represents not simply âIOU,â but âIOU. . .,â where the ellipses
represent an inï¬nite string of successor characters.
To resolve this ambiguity,
arithmetic coding generally assumes the existence of a special Nch + 1th character,
EOM (end of message), which occurs only once at the end of the input. Since
EOM has a low probability of occurrence, it gets allocated only a very tiny piece
of the number line.
In the above example, we gave R as a binary fraction. We could just as well
have output it in any other radix, e.g., base 94 or base 36, whatever is convenient
for the anticipated storage or communication channel.
You might wonder how one deals with the seemingly incredible precision
required of R for a long message. The answer is that R is never actually represented
all at once. At any give stage we have upper and lower bounds for R represented
as a ï¬nite number of digits in the output radix. As digits of the upper and lower
bounds become identical, we can left-shift them away and bring in new digits at the
low-signiï¬cance end. The routines below have a parameter NWK for the number of
working digits to keep around. This must be large enough to make the chance of
an accidental degeneracy vanishingly small. (The routines signal if a degeneracy
ever occurs.) Since the process of discarding old digits and bringing in new ones is
performed identically on encoding and decoding, everything stays synchronized.

Arithmetic coding of the message âIOU...â
in the ï¬ctitious language Vowellish.
Successive characters give successively ï¬ner subdivisions of the initial interval between 0 and 1. The
ï¬nal value can be output as the digits of a fraction in any desired radix. Note how the subinterval allocated
to a character is proportional to its probability of occurrence.
The routine arcmak constructs the cumulative frequency distributiontable used
to partition the interval at each stage. In the principal routine arcode, when an
interval of size jdif is to be partitioned in the proportions of some n to some ntot,
say, then we must compute (n*jdif)/ntot. With integer arithmetic, the numerator
is likely to overï¬ow; and, unfortunately, an expression like jdif/(ntot/n) is not
equivalent.
In the implementation below, we resort to double precision ï¬oating
arithmetic for this calculation. Not only is this inefï¬cient, but different roundoff
errors can (albeit very rarely) make different machines encode differently, thoughany
one type of machine will decode exactly what it encoded, since identical roundoff
errors occur in the two processes. For serious use, one needs to replace this ï¬oating
calculation with an integer computation in a double register (not available to the
C programmer).
The internally set variable minint, which is the minimum allowed number
of discrete steps between the upper and lower bounds, determines when new low-
signiï¬cance digits are added. minint must be large enough to provide resolution of
all the input characters. That is, we must have pi Ã minint > 1 for all i. A value
of 100Nch, or 1.1/ minpi, whichever is larger, is generally adequate. However, for
safety, the routine below takes minint to be as large as possible, with the product
minint*nradd just smaller than overï¬ow. This results in some time inefï¬ciency,
and in a few unnecessary characters being output at the end of a message. You can

decrease minint if you want to live closer to the edge.
A ï¬nal safety feature in arcmak is its refusal to believe zero values in the table
nfreq; a 0 is treated as if it were a 1. If this were not done, the occurrence in a
message of a single character whose nfreq entry is zero would result in scrambling
the entire rest of the message. If you want to live dangerously, with a very slightly
more efï¬cient coding, you can delete the IMAX( ,1) operation.
#include "nrutil.h"
#include <limits.h>
ANSI header ï¬le containing integer ranges.
#define MC 512
#ifdef ULONG_MAX
Maximum value of unsigned long.
#define MAXINT (ULONG_MAX >> 1)
#else
#define MAXINT 2147483647
#endif
Here MC is the largest anticipated value of nchh; MAXINT is a large positive integer that does
not overï¬ow.
typedef struct {
unsigned long *ilob,*iupb,*ncumfq,jdif,nc,minint,nch,ncum,nrad;
} arithcode;
void arcmak(unsigned long nfreq[], unsigned long nchh, unsigned long nradd,
arithcode *acode)
Given a table nfreq[1..nchh] of the frequency of occurrence of nchh symbols, and given
a desired output radix nradd, initialize the cumulative frequency table and other variables for
arithmetic compression in the structure acode.

unsigned long j;
if (nchh > MC) nrerror("input radix may not exceed MC in arcmak.");
if (nradd > 256) nrerror("output radix may not exceed 256 in arcmak.");
acode->minint=MAXINT/nradd;
acode->nch=nchh;
acode->nrad=nradd;
acode->ncumfq[1]=0;

acode->ncumfq[j]=acode->ncumfq[j-1]+IMAX(nfreq[j-1],1);
acode->ncum=acode->ncumfq[acode->nch+2]=acode->ncumfq[acode->nch+1]+1;
}
The structure acode must be deï¬ned and allocated in your main program with
statements like this:
#include "nrutil.h"
#define MC 512
Maximum anticipated value of nchh in arcmak.
#define NWK 20
Keep this value the same as in arcode, below.
typedef struct {
unsigned long *ilob,*iupb,*ncumfq,jdif,nc,minint,nch,ncum,nrad;
} arithcode;
...
arithcode acode;
...
acode.ilob=(unsigned long *)lvector(1,NWK);

acode.ncumfq=(unsigned long *)lvector(1,MC+2);

incrementing lcd so that, on return, lcd points to the ï¬rst unused byte in *codep. Note
that the structure acode contains both information on the code, and also state information on
the particular output being written into the array *codep. An initializing call with isign=0
is required before beginning any *codep array, whether for encoding or decoding. This is in
addition to the initializing call to arcmak that is required to initialize the code itself. A call
with ich=nch (as set in arcmak) has the reserved meaning âend of message.â

20.6 Arithmetic at Arbitrary Precision
Letâs compute the number Ï to a couple of thousand decimal places. In doing
so, weâll learn some things about multiple precision arithmetic on computers and
meet quite an unusual application of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Weâll also
develop a set of routines that you can use for other calculations at any desired level
of arithmetic precision.
To start with, we need an analytic algorithm for Ï.
Useful algorithms are
quadratically convergent, i.e., they double the number of signiï¬cant digits at
each iteration. Quadratically convergent algorithms for Ï are based on the AGM
(arithmetic geometric mean) method, which also ï¬nds application to the calculation
of elliptic integrals (cf. Â§6.11) and in advanced implementations of the ADI method
for elliptic partial differential equations (Â§19.5). Borwein and Borwein [1] treat this
subject, which is beyond our scope here. One of their algorithms for Ï starts with

character arrays can be directly interpreted as strings of digits. At the very end of

one four one ï¬ve nine. . ..â For any less frivolous calculation, we would likely never
leave base 256 (or the thence trivially reachable hexadecimal, octal, or binary bases).
We will adopt the convention of storing digit strings in the âhumanâ ordering,
that is, with the ï¬rst stored digit in an array being most signiï¬cant, the last stored digit
being least signiï¬cant. The opposite convention would, of course, also be possible.
âCarries,â where we need to partition a number larger than 255 into a low-order
byte and a high-order carry, present a minor programming annoyance, solved, in the
routines below, by the use of the macros LOBYTE and HIBYTE.
It is easy at this point, following Knuth [2], to write a routine for the âfastâ
arithmetic operations: short addition (adding a single byte to a string), addition,
subtraction, short multiplication (multiplying a string by a single byte), short
division, ones-complement negation; and a couple of utility operations, copying
and left-shifting strings.
(On the diskette, these functions are all in the single

Full multiplication of two digit strings, if done by the traditional hand method,
is not a fast operation: In multiplying two strings of length N, the multiplicand
would be short-multiplied in turn by each byte of the multiplier, requiring O(N 2)
operations in all. We will see, however, that all the arithmetic operations on numbers
of length N can in fact be done in O(N Ã logN Ã loglog N) operations.
The trick is to recognize that multiplication is essentially a convolution (Â§13.1)
of the digits of the multiplicand and multiplier, followed by some kind of carry
operation. Consider, for example, two ways of writing the calculation 456 Ã 789:
456
Ã 789
4104
3648
3192
359784

Ã 7

36 45 54

40 48
28 35
42
28 67 118 93 54
3
5
9
7

4
The tableau on the left shows the conventional method of multiplication, in which
three separate short multiplications of the full multiplicand (by 9, 8, and 7) are
added to obtain the ï¬nal result. The tableau on the right shows a different method
(sometimes taught for mental arithmetic), where the single-digit cross products are
all computed (e.g. 8 Ã 6 = 48), then added in columns to obtain an incompletely
carried result (here, the list 28, 67, 118, 93, 54). The ï¬nal step is a single pass from
right to left, recording the single least-signiï¬cant digit and carrying the higher digit
or digits into the total to the left (e.g. 93 + 5 = 98, record the 8, carry 9).
You can see immediately that the column sums in the right-hand method are
components of the convolution of the digit strings, for example 118 = 4 Ã 9 + 5 Ã
8 + 6 Ã 7. In Â§13.1 we learned how to compute the convolution of two vectors by
the fast Fourier transform (FFT): Each vector is FFTâd, the two complex transforms
are multiplied, and the result is inverse-FFTâd. Since the transforms are done with
ï¬oating arithmetic, we need sufï¬cient precision so that the exact integer value of
each component of the result is discernible in the presence of roundoff error. We
should therefore allow a (conservative) few times log2(log2 N) bits for roundoff
in the FFT. A number of length N bytes in radix 256 can generate convolution
components as large as the order of (256)2N, thus requiring 16 + log2 N bits of
precision for exact storage.
If it is the number of bits in the ï¬oating mantissa
(cf. Â§20.1), we obtain the condition
16 + log2 N + few Ã log2 log2 N < it
(20.6.3)
We see that single precision, say with it = 24, is inadequate for any interesting
value of N, while double precision, say with it = 53, allows N to be greater
than 106, corresponding to some millions of decimal digits. The following routine
therefore presumes double precision versions of realft (Â§12.3) and four1 (Â§12.2),
here called drealft and dfour1. (These routines are included on the Numerical
Recipes diskettes.)

With multiplication thus a âfastâ operation, division is best performed by
multiplying the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor. The reciprocal of a value
V is calculated by iteration of Newtonâs rule,
Ui+1 = Ui(2 âV Ui)
(20.6.4)
which results in the quadratic convergence of Uâto 1/V , as you can easily
prove.
(Many supercomputers and RISC machines actually use this iteration to
perform divisions.) We can now see where the operations count N log N log log N,
mentioned above, originates: N log N is in the Fourier transform, with the iteration
to converge Newtonâs rule giving an additional factor of log log N.

We already mentioned that radix conversion to decimal is a merely cosmetic
operation that should normally be omitted. The simplest way to convert a fraction to
decimal is to multiply it repeatedly by 10, picking off (and subtracting) the resulting
integer part. This, has an operations count of O(N 2), however, since each liberated
decimal digit takes an O(N) operation. It is possible to do the radix conversion as
a fast operation by a âdivide and conquerâ strategy, in which the fraction is (fast)
multiplied by a large power of 10, enough to move about half the desired digits
to the left of the radix point. The integer and fractional pieces are now processed
independently, each further subdivided. If our goal were a few billion digits of Ï,
instead of a few thousand, we would need to implement this scheme. For present
purposes, the following lazy routine is adequate:
#define IAZ 48
void mp2dfr(unsigned char a[], unsigned char s[], int n, int *m)
Converts a radix 256 fraction a[1..n] (radix point before a[1]) to a decimal fraction rep-
resented as an ascii string s[1..m], where m is a returned value. The input array a[1..n]
is destroyed. NOTE: For simplicity, this routine implements a slow (âN 2) algorithm. Fast
(âN ln N), more complicated, radix conversion algorithms do exist.
{
void mplsh(unsigned char u[], int n);
void mpsmu(unsigned char w[], unsigned char u[], int n, int iv);
int j;
*m=(int) (2.408*n);
for (j=1;j<=(*m);j++) {
mpsmu(a,a,n,10);
s[j]=a[1]+IAZ;
mplsh(a,n);
}
}
Finally, then, we arrive at a routine implementing equations (20.6.1) and
(20.6.2):

Appendix A:
Table of Prototype
Declarations
We here list ANSI prototype declarations for all the routines in Numerical
Recipes in C. If, as is preferred, you are using a compiler that implements the ANSI
standard, then you should #include this listing (or the relevant lines thereof) in
each separately compiled source ï¬le that contains or references any routine from this
book. That will alert your compiler to the fact that our routines do not generally
expect argument conversions, and also allow your compiler to point out possible
errors in your invocation of our routines.
On the diskette, this Appendix is in the ï¬le nr.h. An important point about
the ï¬le on the diskette is that it contains both ANSI C and âtraditionalâ or âK&Râ
style declarations. The ANSI forms are invoked if any of the following macros are
deï¬ned: __STDC__, ANSI, or NRANSI. (The purpose of the last one is to give you
an invocation that does not conï¬ict with other possible uses of the ï¬rst two names.)
If you do have an ANSI compiler it is essential that you invoke it with one or more
of these macros deï¬ned. The typical means for doing so is to include a switch like
â-DANSIâ on the compiler command line.
If you have a âtraditionalâ or âK&Râ C compiler, then the above discussion
does not apply to you: you do not need the ANSI header ï¬le listed here. If you
have the diskette nr.h ï¬le, you will probably ï¬nd it helpful to #include nr.h
anyway, without setting any of the macros __STDC__, ANSI, or NRANSI. That will
at least alert your compiler to the returned value types of our routines. You should
of course be sure to use the K&R versions of our programs, as included (along with
the primary ANSI versions) on the Numerical Recipes C Diskette. Your compiler
will do the âusual argument conversionsâ whether you like it or not, but it will also
undo them upon entering routines whose arguments have been declared differently
from the usual conversions.
Here is a listing of the ï¬le nr.h:
#ifndef _NR_H_
#define _NR_H_
#ifndef _FCOMPLEX_DECLARE_T_
typedef struct FCOMPLEX {float r,i;} fcomplex;
#define _FCOMPLEX_DECLARE_T_
#endif /* _FCOMPLEX_DECLARE_T_ */
#ifndef _ARITHCODE_DECLARE_T_

Appendix B:
Utility Routines
Non-Copyright Notice: This Appendix and its utility routines are herewith
placed into the public domain. Anyone may copy them freely for any purpose.
We of course accept no liability whatsoever for any such use.
The routines listed below are used by many of the Recipes in this book. The ï¬rst
routine, nrerror, is invoked to terminate program execution â with an appropriate
message â when a fatal error is encountered. The other routines are used to allocate
and deallocate memory for vectors and matrices, as explained in detail in Â§1.2. All
memory allocation and deallocation in Numerical Recipes in C is done using these
routines as intermediaries.
Therefore, if you want to allocate memory in some
different way, you need change only these routines, not the programs themselves.
On the diskette, these routines are in the ï¬le nrutil.c. Also listed here is
the header ï¬le nrutil.h. Besides the declarations for the routines in nrutil.h, it
contains several macros that are used throughout the book. The ideas behind some
of these macros were described in Â§1.2.
Memory Allocation: Advanced Topics
Two issues regarding vector and matrix memory allocation are worth discussing here:
ï¬rst, a âback-doorâ compatibility between our matrices and those used by other C software;
second, the question of whether our pointer arithmetic for unit-offset vectors and matrices
violates the ANSI C standard.
1. Back-door compatibility. As explained in Â§1.2, we always allocate matrices via the
scheme âpointer to an array of pointers to rowsâ (shown in Figure 1.2.1). With this scheme,
once storage for a matrix is allocated, the top level pointer (the ânameâ of the matrix) can
be used to store a matrix of any size whose dimensions are less than or equal to the size of
the dimensions allocated. The only time that the allocated size ever again becomes relevant
is when the matrix storage is ï¬nally deallocated.
In this scheme, the rows of a matrix need not be stored in physically contiguous storage;
each row has its own pointer addressing it (see Figure 1.2.1). However, the allocation routines
printed below in fact (and by design) allocate an entire matrix as one contiguous block, via
a single call to malloc(). This âback-doorâ fact allows you to use matrices created with
our routines directly with other software: The address of the ï¬rst element in a matrix **a
(usually &a[1][1] if a has been allocated with a statement like a=matrix(1,m,1,n); but
possibly &a[0][0] if a was created with zero-offsets) is guaranteed to point to the beginning
of a contiguous block containing the full physical matrix, stored by rows. This address can be
used as an argument to other software. (Note that this other software will generally also need
to know the physical size of the matrix, or at least the number of columns.)
2. Unit-offset vectors. In Â§1.2, we described how a unit-offset vector bb[1..4]could be
obtained from a zero-offset array b[0..3] by the pointer arithmetic operation bb=b-1. Since
bb points to one location before b, bb[1] addresses the same element as b[0], and so on.

Strictly speaking, this scheme is not blessed by the ANSI C standard. The problem
is not the fact that b-1 points to unallocated storage: location b-1 will never be referenced
without an increment back into the allocated region. Rather, the problem is that it might
happen in rare cases (and probably only on a segmented machine) that the expression b-1
has no representation at all.
If this occurs, then there is no guarantee that the relation
b=(b-1)+1 is satisï¬ed.
In practice, this is much less of a problem than one might think. We are not aware of
any compiler or machine on which b=(b-n)+n fails to be true for small integer n. Even on a
segmented machine, what typically happens is that the compiler stores some (perhaps illegal)
representation of b-n, and that b is recovered when n is added back to this representation. The
memory allocation routines in the First Edition of Numerical Recipes in C, in wide use since
1988, all have this âproblemâ, and we have had not even a single report of their failure in this
respect (notwithstanding the many readers who have told us that theoretically it could fail).
We have also communicated to standards bodies the desirability of blessing âb=(b-n)+nâ (at
least for some range of n, say n representable as type short) in a future standard, since there
would seem to be no conï¬ict with existing compilers in doing so.
Despite the absence of any experimental (as opposed to theoretical) problem, we have
taken some steps in this edition to make our vector and matrix allocation routines more ANSI
compliant. In thelisting thatfollows, the parameterNR_ENDis usedasa numberofextra storage
locations allocated at the beginning of every vector or matrix block, simply for the purpose
of making offset pointer references guaranteed-representable. We set NR_END to a default
value of 1. This has the effect of making all unit-offset allocations (e.g., b=vector(1,7);
or a=matrix(1,128,1,128);) be strictly ANSI compliant. With NR_END = 1, the number
of storage locations wasted is fairly negligible. Allocations with offsets other than 1 (e.g.,
b=vector(2,10)) are still theoretically non-compliant, but are virtually unknown in our
routines. If you need to make such allocations, you may wish to consider increasing the value
of NR_END (noting that larger values increase the amount of wasted storage).

Appendix C:
Complex Arithmetic
The functions listed below are used by the Recipes cisi, frenel, hypdrv,
hypgeo, hypser, laguer, zroots, and fixrts for complex arithmetic. A complex
number is deï¬ned to be a structure containing two float values, the real (.r) and
imaginary (.i) parts. Complex arguments are passed and returned by value. See
additional discussion in Â§1.2.
On the diskette, this Appendix is in the ï¬le complex.c.

Index of Programs and Dependencies
The following table lists, in alphabetical order, all the routines in Numerical
Recipes. When a routine requires subsidiary routines, either from this book or else
user-supplied, the full dependency tree is shown: A routine calls directly all routines
to which it is connected by a solid line in the column immediately to its right; it
calls indirectly the connected routines in all columns to its right. Typographical
conventions: Routines from this book are in typewriter font (e.g., eulsum, gammln).
The smaller, slanted font is used for the second and subsequent occurences of a
routine in a single dependency tree.
(When you are getting routines from the
Numerical Recipes diskettes, or their archive ï¬les, you need only specify names in
the larger, upright font.) User-supplied routines are indicated by the use of text
font and square brackets, e.g., [funcv]. Consult the text for individual speciï¬cations
of these routines. The right-hand side of the table lists section and page numbers
for each program.
