BUT FIRST THIS.
I
a copy of Januarys CU, as one
does occasionally, and low and
behold, there is not one single
C64 game review. Therefore I
would like to take this opportunity to
wish the CU team great fortune in
their new market, and I would also
like to welcome all the C64 readers
that they hove abandoned. We are
the only C64/C128 dedicated
magazine around, and we're proud
of it too.
One thing though. Ever since the
new YC appeared, it has been
made dear to us that we hove
made a decision that not
everybody is happy with. The
readers that relished the listings and
serious articles seem to have been
affronted by our change towards a
game based magazine. Again I
must stress that today's C64 market
IS (in a vast majority) games based,
and I'm sorry if anybody doesn't
realise that. I don't wish you all to go
away. but if you do wish to sample
another magazine that caters for
your tastes I'd recommend
Commodore Disk User, our sister title,
you won't be disappointed.
Now onto the cassette. Over the
three issues of YC so far you've hod
twelve games (twelve games for
£5.85, plus three wonderful mags of
course), but in the future things are
likely to change.
No doubt you've seen a gallery
or demos column in many other
rags. We intend to go one step
further as we'd like to Put your
graphical/musical stills/dernos on
the rope, so that everyone can hear
and see them for themselves. As an
incentive, yours (if used) will win a
wonderful mystery prize (we've yet
to decide what it is) that is worth
mega-bucks, so send 'em in now...
Yours until Post Apocalypse
shoves my head in a joystick port.

brand new watch.
f
as the face, the new line of

Commodore distributor, Parkﬁeld Communications is claiming that
Santa was overloaded with computers this year in the biggest
hardware boom since 1984.
With the C64 Light Fantastic and am go 500 Batman packs
selling well, Loretta Cohen, Parkﬁeld's managing director, sees this
as an especially surprising occurence "showing that the Batman
craze can overcome even the Chancellor's tight money policy".
During the run up to Christmas. Commodore and Parkﬁeld hit a
landmark with the sale of the 200.000th amigo 500. This makes
the machine the most succesful 16-bit games computer in the UK
(in other words, bigger than the ST but less than the PC). Maybe
one day the Amiga may equal the number of sales that the C64
has achieved - one day in the far future though.

The Europress Group has turned its Database
software divisions and Mandarin Software into o
separate company, which means that sales must
make them a viable, self-supporting proposition.
Database Software will now be the umbrella
name covering the old Database software.
Database Educational Software and Mandarin,
though each will maintain irs own label and
identity.
The Mini-Ofﬁce business program suite is
deﬁnitely the biggest selling product which the new
company inherits bur Fun School 2 has built up on
unprecedented sales record for an educational
product while Mandarin has nor been without
success in the games and game construction
program area. During this year rhe company will be
releasing over 20 titles so we should be hearing
more soon.
British Telecom hos scored a
success in the area of data
compression. The home
grown compression system
has been adopted as the
heart of the proposed
V24bis standard which is
expected to hove gained
ﬁnal approval of the CCITT
during February.
The approval will mean
that V24bis will be
incorporated in modems
and various proprietary
networking systems. Its
good to see that a British
company can still have an
international impact in the

his is a 3-Dimensional version
1 o f  the old game of Breakout,
with the wall being in the
distance and the ball apparently
moving in and our of the screen.
You simply have to hit the ball back
towards the wall with a joystick
controlled bat (in parr 2) to knock
the wall down and score points.
The game play differs from the
original in two ways. Firstly or higher
scores the bat does not reduce in
size as this made the game
practically unplayable, and secondly
when the ball is hit through a gap in
the wall it does nor bounce back
and fore behind the wall, as this
mode it far to easy to play, but
breaks bock through the wall at
random.
The game gradually speeds up
as you score more points until it is
played at wice the starting speed.
The speed increases occur or 400,
800, 1200, 2000, 4000 and 10000

then, that you, Earths most
intrepid space jockey, have been
selected to go in and clean out this
nest of alien war machinery. The
problem is that Santolus station is a
maze ﬁlled with hostile devices.
Frankly, you haven't got a
snowﬂake's chance of getting in and
out alive. But, chin up, shoulders
bock - you might as well try._
A maze of death
The game presents you with a view
of the maze seen from above. Using
points, and
if you get
to that stage
you must
hove faster reactions than
me, You start off with 3 balls (if you'll
pardon the expression) and for
every 1000 points scored you get
another life. Also when you have
completely cleared the screen you
will get a bonus of another 3 lives
up to a maximum of 9 lives.
If you fancy a break from
Breakout then the game can be
paused by pressing any key, and
restarted by pressing the space bar.
To start a game or to restart a game
if you should happen to miss a ball
then simply press the ﬁre button on
the joystick.

a joystick in Parr 2 you have to shoot
your way through a number of
obstacles in order to reach the alien
mothership at the end of the maze.
Kill this by shooting into its power

problem is that alien defenders will
be tying to stop you. Your ship can
absorb a certain amount of
punishment, as it is composed of
three modules, but as more and
more of your ship modules are
destroyed, your laser's range and
rate of ﬁre will diminish. You have

one ship module.

to the Christmas
compilation market.
"Thrill Time" consists of
"Airwolf", "Scooby Doo",
Supplier: ELITE
Price: 9.99 (Coss) 14.99 (Disk)
"Battleships", "Saboteur'',
and "Frank Bruno's World
Championship Boxing".
Obviously, the emphasis
on the package is value
for money, but will it be
'Thrill Time' on Christmas
morning - or will The
Sound Of Music" be an
enjoyable alternative?
For those of you who
can't remember it,
"Airwolf ' was an American
IV series. In it, a Billion
dollar helicopter was
stolen from the US
Government, Much to their
embarrassment, it would
show up and solve Top
Secret missions. Then it
would ﬂy off into the
sunset. It had all the
features that you'd spend
a billion dollars on if you
were building the ultimate
chopper.
Anyway, this time
several scientists have
been kidnapped. They are
held in an underground
base and QS the top pilot
available you've got the
job. Piloting Airwolf is hard
enough without lazers,
security systems and
machine guns everywhere.
This is of course exactly
what you're up against.
You can ﬂy airwolf around
and blast at various
hazards with your guns.
There are ﬁve scientists in
all, and each is more
difﬁcult to ﬁnd than the
last.
This game is simply too
hard. The helicopter is very
difﬁcult to control with any
degree of accuracy. As
you've only got one life
the game restarts far TOO
often. Dated.
''Scooby Doo' ﬁnds our
food-loving chum in a bit
of a ﬁx. The rest of the
gong hove been
kidnapped and are being
20 4 C
THRILL TIME
(GOLD 2)

held in a creepy old castle.
Despite being a coward at
heart, Scooby decides to
go in and rescue them.
Our hero has to jump over
the hazards in the castle
whilst avoiding the
inhabitants.
These take the form of
Scary Ghost, Ghastly Ghouls
and Devious Devils. Scooby
can punch the baddies on
the snout. Even so, Scooby
might ﬁnd it all too much
were it not for the Scooby
snacks, These ore scattered
around the castle at
random and give Scooby
an extra life.
-
and it shows, The graphics,
whilst large, are clumsy
and lacklustre, Punching
ghosts on the nose is okay
for a few minutes but it
soon palls. Scooby can
quickly lose lives because
the ghosts rematerialize
very suddenly.
"Battleships" is the
classic game of seek and
destroy. Iris usually played
by two players. However
there is a one player versus
the computer and a
league option. Each player
has his own water space.
He places his ships secretly
and then the players take
it in turns to shoot
randomly. The winner is
the person who skins their
opponent's ships.
This game appears
more polished than the
others onthe compilation.
The graphics ore interesting
as well as functional and
the shooting phase is a
nice addition. The game is
one that you'll either love
or hate, This is o game that
the whole family con
enjoy and I recommend it.
In "Saboteur", you are
a man with a mission.
Highly trained in both
armed and unarmed
combat, you have to
retrieve a disk. This contains
the names of Rebel
leaders and is, of course,
Top Secret. Not surprisingly,
it is well-defended. Held in
a top security
establishment and
protected by guards, dogs
and security devices.
You start by landing at
the jetty in an inﬂatable
dinghy. Throughout the
complex there ore various
weapons to help your
tasks. These include
shuriken, grenades, knives
and bricks. You have to
ﬁnd the disk and meet the
helicopter on the roof so
there's no time to spare.
This is another game
that shows its age. The
graphics ore indistinct and
the controls are ﬁddly. It's
hard to pick up items and
climb ladders. Although
the game is hard to ﬁnish
its really not worth trying.
Finally, "Frank Bruno"
lets you play the part of
your favourite
heavyweight hero. You
must guide him through his
bid for the world title. He
must ﬁght eight opponents
from all around the world.
Each one has a different
graphic and ﬁghting style.
Also they have a dirty trick
up their sleeves: Fling Long
Chop does a ﬂying kick
and Andra Puncheredov
does a head butt.
But our Frank is not
going to stand for any of
that, Harry. As he punches
his opponents his
punchometer increases.
When it becomes
maximum he can unleash
a dynamite punch.
Unfortunately if Frank gets
hit then the punchorneter
decreases. Once Frank
defeats an opponent then
he gets a code and you
have to load in the next
boxer.
"Frank Bruno" the
game, is about as current
as his bid for the World
Championship today. The
graphics are extremely
blocky and the game itself
is frustrating. Control is
awkward using both keys
and joystick. There's still a
lot of game here for those
who like a challenge. I was
put off though.
Overall the package is
for too dated. There are
many better compliations
available on the market

T original ghostbustering
team return to save
New York again. After
being sued following the
destruction of the Stay-Puft
Marshmallow Man, the
team disbanded, The
media blew up the affair
as a hoax. Sadly, our
heroes have had to make
ends meet by becoming
performers.
Dana Barrett (alias
Sigorney Weaver) returns
to New York, She now has
a son, Oscar, but the
powers of the supernatural
kidnap him. Dana knows
that the forces of evil are

back. She also knows what
to do about it. Who you
gonna call?
Ghostbusters of course!
The real gang of four ore
back and ﬁghting ﬁt. New
York is in peril from the evil
spirits - freaky phenomena
of all shapes and forms!
The game itself is in three
ports. and the ﬁrst sub-
game sets you the task of
collecting a sample of
slime. To do this a ream
member needs to be
lowered down a shaft by
winch, on the way he
encounters slimers, ghosts,
winch-eating blobs and
huge hands.
Luckily, like every good
boy scout, the ghostbuster
is well prepared, as he has
a choice of three weapons
at his disposal. The usual
proton beams; an energy
shield; and a PK bomb.
The lasers can shoot most
of the ghosts, and the
bomb destroys the winch-
eaters and ﬂying blobs
easily. As you swing from
side to side you hove to
pick up the three parrs of
the gloop scoop. These
and replacement
weapons are on ledges on
the sides. Picking these up
is the hardest port of this
section, but once you've
done this it's onto
Broadway.
Now the team have to
reach the art museum and
to get there before the
new year they've
animated the Statue of
Liberry! You have to
protect it from the ﬂying
spuds, slimers and ghosts
with but a mere ﬁreball.
This shoots missiles at the
ghosts who, once hit, turn
into drops of slime. Your
loyal group of men can
then run out to pick it up.
This slime then odds to
your energy, which is
reduced when hit,
This section of the
game is tough to
complete with hoards of
ghosts swooping into the
artock. These are all well
drawn and animated.
Control of the ﬁreball is
simple and effective.
The ﬁnal section of the
game is at the musuern.
You have to rescue Oscar
and destroy something
called "Vigo the
Carpathian". You start by
abseiling in from the roof.
It is another blasting
section, and is also hard to
play.
Ghostbusters II is fairly
well programmed. I liked
The opening sequences
which included digitized
graphics from the ﬁlm. The
ghost graphics were the
best (and most amusing).
Unfortunately, the game
will fall down on it's lasting
interest because the
challenge is too
insubstantial. Having said
that, it is fun for a while. A
score of some kind would
have added interest. As it
stands, the only incentive
to play is to complete it,
and not too many people
will ﬁnd that difﬁcult. One
for kids only.

1 t seems that crime
is paying more often
these days, because the
bad guys to be seen with
are driving Ferraris,
Lomborginis and Lotus'.
This would make catching
them impossible for your
run-of-the-mill police
cruiser or Panda car, so at
Chase H.Q. the low-
enforcers ore given a
Turbo charged Porsche
928 instead.
At chase H.Q., no-one
ever shouts "PULL OVER!"
to a criminal he's got to
be forced off the rood in
true James Bond style_ The
difﬁculty of this task vories
according to the level but
then who said that being a
speed cop was going to
be easy?
Whilst chasing the
criminal you hove to
negotiate forks in the rood,
road signs and the other
road-users (who actually
obey the speed limit) and
all against the clock. You
are given sixty seconds to
track him down. Crashing
into other cars or roadside
obstacles causes a
catastrophic loss of speed
(and time). Taking a
wrong turn in the road
more or less ruins your
chances of catching him as
well.
If you ﬁnally catch up
with the boddie, you are
given a further sixty
seconds to run him off the
road It's here that your
Turbo comes in handy.
Government funds being
what they ore, its use is
limited to three per game.
Once activated, you
accelerate to speeds of
over 300mp/h which gives
you a deﬁnate edge! You

then hove to collide
forcibly with the back of
the rogue driver's car. Each
time you do this
successfully a hit is
recorded. A gouge records
the number of hits left
before submission_ Once
the criminal submits, Nancy
at H.Q. then gives you
details of the next mission_
As a game, Chose H.Q.
breaks very lite new
ground. The idea of
running a car off the rood
is not new now is the
perspective view from
above and behind your
car. The car responds fairly
well to speed and inertia,
so screaming around a
corner at 300mp/h is a
bad ideal The graphics
work fairly well with a
good impression of on
uneven rood created. The
impression of speed is not
so good, and the whole
game seems to advance
in slow motion. the game
plays well enough, but is
perhaps a little too easy
despite the time limit.
There is average music
on the riﬂe page but only
engine sound fx during the
game. There is no high-

hardest part of the game,

hove no trouble

And that's it. Nothing is

doubts about its lasting

lippa is-a small,
round thing with legs.
Life as a small, round
thing with legs would be
very boring if it were not
for the mazes of the Upper
Plane_ These ore jolly good
fun to be in. For one thing,
every time Flippo takes a
step he makes the
ﬂagstone which he's
treading on ﬂip over. This
often changes its colour to
another bright shade.
Flippo is blissfully happy
when he's tearing around
the mazes, ﬂipping loads
of paving stones over.
Sadly, there are other
inhabitants of the planes
who have nothing better
to do than drain Flippo's
energy. These rake several
nasty forms but none are
as cute as Flippo.
Also deadly to Flippo's
health ore the gaps in the
maze. These ore gaps in
the Upper plane and if
fallen through our hero
dies, This is preferable to
life in the inner space
below_ Luckily. Flippo
could give Olympic long
jumpers training and can
leap over the gaps. He
can even turn in mid air!
Some of the squares
turn over a different colour
to the rest. These are
squares that need to be
run over from a different
direction. Hippo often has
to backtrack in order to
change these again.
Occasionally. Flippo
encounters icons ﬂoating
around the maze. These
give him temporary
immunity to the monsters
and in some cases another
life. Should Hippo turn all
the squares the right colour
he has to ﬁnd the portal.
This is a ﬂashing square
which transports him to the
next maze.
The graphics are
represented from above in
forced perspective, The
borders of the maze are
varied according to the
level. Each is colourful and
well drawn_ Flippo himself
is a nicely done character:
short and fat and blue. The
monsters in the maze vary
from excellently to poorly
drown and animated.
Some are large and
colourful: others are small
and blurry. They seem to
move randomly about the
maze but ifs easy to be
trapped by them.
The game is very
playable and fairly
addictive. It has got
enough frustration to keep
you playing rather than
annoying you. Should you
progress through a level
there is a restart option
which functions twice in
any one game. The levels
ore fairly tough, with each
one taking up several
screens. These are ﬂip-
screen rather than scrolling.
Having said that, I feel
that Hewson have token a
few steps back with Maze
Mania. It is a cross between
Pacmania and Q*Bert
(remember that?). Maze
games are the deﬁnition
of unoriginality and this
one is no exception. Flippo
has the cute potential to
be a cult ﬁgure. But I doubt
that this game will be
successful enough to
warrant a sequel. The truth
is that there are far too
many games of this type
available already. Many of
them are better than this
one too. Unless you have
money to burn or you ore
a real fan of maze games
then try before your buy.

There is plenty to see

but all the action happens
very slowly. This is not so
much due to the game
itself but the fact that disk
accessing -- and there is a

underway to see who can
invade the most planets.
Not unreasonably, a few
people are a little
unhappy about this, and as

chosen to stop this contest.
Guess what - this means
blowing them to
smithereens with your
blaster!
This is the setting to
Retrograde, the latest
shoot-em-up from
Thalamus. As usual, ifs one
man against the rest of the
universe. Fortunately, you
hove on answer to the
latest dastardly bid to
overthrow Humanity. You
have a hugely destructive
lazer pack. When the
game begins, you have a
small bullet type lazer
beam. This makes
destroying the aliens quite
hard work, as they take
several hits to kill. Luckily,
when shot they turn into
k a  Ara is the local
currency and comes in 5,
10 or 20 Ara sizes.
Once you have
collected lots of Ara, you
can go to the shop. It sells
various "power ups" for
your weapon, including
extra shots, diagonal shots,
super shots and triples.
These all make blasting
the aliens that little bit
easier. In turn this makes
F U N * 1
getting Ara that much
more simple. Also for sale
are weapons that can be
strapped to your ﬁst. This ﬁst
weapon is used Robocop
style, to punch Out the
aliens when you are
walking along the planet's
surface.
Colliding with aliens
drains the energy from
your shield. You start with
ﬁve shields: one is lost if the
energy reaches zero.
Helpfully an extra shield is
awarded with every
20,000 points. As well as
this, an alien occasionally
drops a "POW" symbol. If
collected, you hove a
bonus shield which cannot
be replenished but you do
not lose a life if it is
depleted.
It would be nice if life
were as simple as that. But
you still hove a whole
Universe to save, not just
one planet. On each
planet there ore several
reactor ducts. As you punch
robots on the ground,
occasionally one drops a
planet buster. Once
primed, it can be carried
down the shaft and
planted. This starts the
destruction of the planet.
Once all of the ducts have
been primed then the
planet is destroyed. This
means thor you cannot
merely ﬂy around the
planet blasting - you must
combine it with a bit of the
Robocop too.
Your activity has not
gone unnoticed.
Predictably, the evil owner
of the planet is none too
pleased at ifs destruction.
This is where the trouble
really starts. It appears to

destroy you itself, in the
form of a gigantic monster.
I think I've seen this before
somewhere...
The evil monster
resembles a cross between
an octopus and a
shrubbery! You appear in
deep space behind it.
Using just your pitiful
weapons it must be
destroyed in order for you
to progress. It is heavily
armed, launching missiles
and shooting lazer beams
or you. As you destroy it,
pieces break off and it gets
weaker. Kill it and you can
progress to the next
planet. There are seven in
all, each one harder than
the last. Later planets
feature different sprites
and backdrops, 05 well 05
more ducts. The end of
level beings become
more and more difﬁcult to
destroy, bigger and more
heavily armed.
A lot of creatNity and
imagination has gone into
the production of
Retrograde. Thalamus
have not only
concentrated on the
graphics nor merely the
gameplay. The result is a
well-balanced game
which uses the
Commodore 64 to its
maximum potential. The
graphics are colourful and
well animated, wirh
smooth scrolling. Despite
the number of sprites
which move around on
screen, neither the speed
nor the smoothness suffer
as a result.
There ore many clever
touches in Retrograde. As
the game loads you get a
choice of seven different
tunes. These vary from slow
melodies to funky rhythms

and all are well
programmed. Selecting
weapons is handled by hi-

Having said that,
Retrograde is not
particularly original.
Countless games feature
the idea of upgradable
weapons and end of level
monsters. The central
character is similar to that

However, this is no slur on
a game which uses these
elements well, and this
one does.
Retrograde is a

f you've ever fancied
canoeing down some of
the most dangerous
rivers in the world, bur
were scared off by the risks
involved, perhaps you'd
rather try it in a rubber
tube?! That's the challenge
that "Toobin" offers you in
this arcade conversion
from Domark
As either Buff or jet, you
must paddle down rivers
and rapids. Your tube does
nor puncture on rocks, you
just bounce off. Starring at
the top of the river, you
hove to negotiate your
way to the party or the
other end. As if this were
nor dangerous enough,
there are many added
dangers along the way.
These include ﬂy
ﬁshermen, water snakes, a
hungry aligator and sub-
aqua cactus(?). All of these
hazards puncture your
tube and lose you a life.
On top of all these
dangers, there are anti-
social party poopers along
the river banks, These will
try everything in their
power to stop Buff and Jet
from obtaining their goal.
Fortunately, you are not
defenceless, Beer cans can
be collected en route
which you can throw at the
various enemies which line
the river bank, stunning
them for long enough for
you to escape past them.
There ore also rapids which
rush you quickly down the
vertically scrolling screen
and gates which oward
bonus points if successfully
negotiated.
Propulsion is achieved
in the time-honoured
fashion of frantically
1
padding with your hands
either backwards or
forwards, and rotating left
or right with your feet. This
is a frustrating mode of
control, which is very easy
to misjudge.
This would be all very
well, bur the game is
utterly ler down by its
graphics. The Toobers "Buff"
and "Jet" look like
waterboatmen and some
of the riverside enemies
ore entirely
indistinguishable from the
background: the ones you
can see include several
harpooning Sphinx(??),
and the ﬂy ﬁshermen
resemble disjointed
Legomen. Some of the
objects you collect look
like beds of nails,
tangerines and shuriken.
Some of the hazards
are almost impossible to
avoid, as the scrolling often
hides them until you're on
top of them. Add to this
the ﬁddly control system,
which often gets you stuck
on a gate and eoten by
the aligator, and you'll
soon be headbutting the
keyboard in frustration.
remember seeing this
game in the arcade, and
its attraction was its
colourful graphics. Domork
hove unfortunately failed
to convert them with any
degree of accuracy, and
so the game loses its
"cute" appeal. Apparently
Buff and Jet ore "in search
of the most outrageous
parry they can ﬁnd." Six
old-age pensioners
drinking lemonade and
dancing to the Birdy Song
would doubtless be more
entertaining than this dire
effort.
There is a two-player
option for the brave, but I
doubt if anyone would
dare show this to their
friends, for sake of losing
them, This has the feel to
me of an arcade
conversion which has been
rushed out to coincide with
other versions. There is no
excuse for this. Avoid this
game.

Mekon lurks you are
sure to ﬁnd the
intergalactic hero Don
Dare_ In this the third
computerised
confrontation Dan must
escape from the Mekon's
clutches. Caught while
sleeping Dan ﬁnds himself
inside in the Mekon's
hideaway asteroid_ His
only hope of escape is vio
a lone ﬁghter he has
discovered the only
problem is its lack of fuel_
So Dan sets forth jet pack
on bock, gun in hand,
ready for all space borne
monstrositites the Mekon
may core to throw or him.
Dan starts his adventure
in the storage area, but
even here the hostiles lurk.
After blasting a few
mutants (they weren't until
they met with the Mekon's
surgeons) with his portable
mutant blaster he comes
face to face with his
adversary. Dan leaps or
this chance to destroy his
age old adversary but it is
not to be. After
exchanging plasma bolts
the Mekon heads for
sunnier climes, with his
personal teleporter.
However all is not lost as
he leaves behind a poss
for the public teleporter.
Before dashing off to
adventures new a quick
scan of the surroundings
reveal two computer
terminals. One supplies
fuel for the jet pack, but
the other is o for more
versatile machine. At this
terminal Don can purchase
extra weaponry in the
form of bouncing bombs,
smart bombs and extra
ammunition for his blaster.
It is also possible to buy
extra lives here if you hove
the cash.
Using the teleporrer
brings about its own
hazards. As Dan sails
through the ether he must
be guided through a
tunnel of squares which
come at him. Failure to
correctly navigate a square
results in damage which in
turn can lead to an early
demise. If you die during
teleportorion your body is
returned to the starring
teleport terminal before
you resume with another
life.
The second level is
slightly larger and contains
even more mutants. Once
again you ﬁnd the Mekon
and slug it out. Now you
hove your third pass you
can choose your
destination. Here lies the
strategy element of the
game, you can risk all by
assaulting the next level of
you can play it safe and
return to the stores for a
few more lives and some
extra ﬁre-power. After a
few levels you have
enough fuel to escape so
with all haste you return PO
the stores, access the
terminal and blast off into,

but the blast doors. After

who said that simulations
aren't fun?
Of course there is a
more serious side to the
game. There are ﬁve in
depth missions. Before
starting one you hove to
CalSIT1111:11
equip your plane from
scratch. You can select
various missiles and other
add ons to your heart's
content. Clearly, different
missiles will be used for
different missions. For the
scramble mission, you'll
need air-to-air missiles; for
Tankbuster, air-to-ground
are better. Add ons include
ﬂares and extra fuel tanks.
When equipped, you
then have to taxi your way
out of the hanger. Even
this comparatively simple
operation is certainly not
easy. It requires a very
delicate touch on the
controls indeed if you ore
to avoid crashing. When
you've eventually found

the runway again it's take
off time. This should by
now be a routine
operation.
Bock in the air, and
H.Q. will begin to
broadcast information to
you. This will be relevant to
the mission, and may be
as simple as the position of
the next target.
Alternatively it could be a
bottle stations alert! There
are also ﬁve different radar
type displays. These show
ground targets, maps and
other vital information_
Depending on your
mission, you may then
hove to ﬂy to a target to
strike, or seek out on
enemy plane. You can
enable your combat
computer once engaged.
This helps you to plan your
attacking strategy. You can
lock a missile on your
target. or blast away with
your guns.
Of course the enemy
have also put Out their best
pilots. These ore all intent
on sending you to on early
state funeral. They know all
of the tricks in the book
and will use them
mercilessly. Fortunately for
all you budding top guns
out there, you get a copy
of the book.
This is the ﬂight manual.
It's essentially "The ABC of
how to ﬂy an F-16".
Included in this hallowed
tomb is a detailed
breakdown of the various
types of missile. This is very
useful as it helps to plan
your arming of the plane.
There are sections detailing
taking off and landing,
taxiing and combat
procedures. These are
especially useful and ore
worth practising. Even if
you can't perform a
reverse slam loop with
twist, it'll impress your
friends if you say you can!
The book is well
produced and written. If
you don't read it before
taking off it's like wiring a
plug without knowing
which wire is live. Certainty
the missions are far harder
without the essential
_
88%1
background knoWedge.
The missions con all be
altered to suit your skill
level. If you hove the
inclination you can litter
the map with tanks but
don't expect to complete
the mission easily_
The plane isn't at all
discriminate about how
you write it off. Whether
you scrape the top of the
control tower or take a
missile in the backside the
screen shatters. All that
hard work down the drain.
Luckily you can start all
over again on a different
mission.
F-16 Combat Pilot is a
milestone in Commodore
programming. Despite the
program's huge size and
complexity the speed
does not suffer. There are
thirty-three controls
including the more
obscure: ejector seat, fuel
and weapons dump and
autopilot. Cramming all of
these into the '64 whilst
retaining the gameplay
and speed is a true
achievement. Digital
Integration should be
proud of this effort when
they could so easily have
bodged Out a conversion
as other do.

Leisure Genius 3 Pack from
Virgin Mastertronic
Three board games
ore presented in their
pixelated splendour for
your delectation; Clued°,
Scrabble De Luxe and
Monopoly. All three games
have previously been
released but this is the ﬁrst
time that they have been
presented in a single
package and for the paltry
sum of E19,99.
The ﬁrst game to fall
under my scrutiny is
Clued°. The essence of the
original board game has
been preserved with a few
minor additions as only a
computer can do it. When
the characters appear
ready for their trip around
the board a little ditty is
played which corresponds
to the current character.
All of the participating
characters can be under
either human or computer
control. It is even possible
to select the intelligence
34 4 C
level of each computer
controlled character. A
number of options are
presented to the player
each turn. It is possible to
make the ﬁnal accusation,
a simple suggestion or
review the cards you hold.
There is also a notes option
which displays the notes
the computer
automatically makes for
you character as the game
progresses.
The graphical
representation of the
board occupies two thirds
of the screen with the
remaining third displaying
the current character and a
list of options. The only
disadvantage of this game
occurs when more than
one human player is
playing. When you view
your notes or cards you
must cover a portion of the
screen so the other players
do not gain an unfair
advantage when they see
your cards.
Monopoly is a classic
board game and this is a
classic conversion.
Gameplay in the
computer version is
identical to that of the
board version. Once again
there is the problem of
covering part of the screen
to view your cards but
apart from that this is a fun
conversion. For the single
or limited group of players
it is possible to have a
number of computer
controlled characters each
with a user deﬁned IQ.
The race around the
board holds the familiar
thrills as the mad dash for
the expensive properties
begins. One advantage of
the computer version is
that you will lose none of
the cards and the
computer handles all the
banking functions, a blow
to those slight of hand
players.
The problem with
playing only against
computer controlled
characters is that you
cannot see them sweat as
the dice rolls and they
approach your hotels. At
least you con set the
computer characters to the
lowest level and give
them a severe thrashing.
The ﬁnal game in this
selection is Scrabble De
Luxe. This is by far the
easiest and most playable
of the conversions.
Although you can see
each other's letters this
does not unduly disrupt the

game. Mere ore the usual
options to hove a number
of computer controlled
players with an IQ of your
choice but there ore also
several features which odd
signiﬁcantly to the game.
The computer version
of the game nearly
eliminates those obscure
two letter words by
checking entry against its
in-built dictionary. Those
words is does not
recognise it queries, but
the human player can
override this and thus
cheat. For those players
that ﬁnd it hard to string
two sentences together a
help option is available.
Wnen activiated this option
ﬁnds the best possible use
for the letters you hold. A
rack full of tiles can at
times bring little inspiration
so_to help the struggling
player the tiles can be
randomly juggled in order
to bring forth that elusive
combination. Further
options allow the players
to place a limit upon the
thinking time and access
charts showing rile and
board values.
This is one computer
version that plays equally
well despite the number of
players and if a player
drops out the computer
can always take over.
One fun aspect of all
these games is the ability
to switch to a completely
computer controlled game
or any time If the
outcome cannot be
waited for, make every
character a computer
controlled character, set
the game speed to
maximum and go make
a cup of tea
As a package this
selection represents
excellent value. Although
each of the games support
a number of human
participants only Scrabble
De Luxe really works with
more than one human
player. This is simply a
solitary social event of the
year.

Duel" is the sequel
to Accolades very
successful driving simulator.

does not mean that the

suffered. Its just that the

this version.
Having a grey Porsche
has mode you friends and
enemies. One of these
drives a red Lambourgini
and has challenged you to
a race. Not wishing to lose
credibility you rise to the
challenge.
On loading you are
given several options. Both
cars ore displayed with a
detailed description o
each beside. Here you can
choose which car to drive.
Each has its pros and cons
but they're roughly equal
in performance. You can
choose to take on the Duel
straight away, or either
practice or race against the
clock. As with any pseudo
realistic game it's worth a
practice before jumping in
at the deep end.
The clock is a fairly hard
game which should set
you up for the main
challenge. This starts with
vie.,•77
you sitting in front of your
opponent. You can see
him in your rear view
mirrors. he's obviously
conﬁdent enough to give
you a head start! Along the
road (Speed Limit 55mph?
Ha!) you'll encounter other
drivers. These merely serve
to obstruct you as you race.
Hitting one of these makes
you lose one of your ﬁve
lives.
You hove to refuel or
the 'Demol stations en route.
Miss one and it's game
over time. Your computer

opponent is a mean driver
and will try to force an
error from you in order to
win. There are many skill
levels including a choice of
manual or automatic
transmission. At the higher
levels the enemy
becomes meaner and
faster than ever. He
weaves about in front of
your car, trying to get you
to crash. The other cars are
more frequent and cause
more trouble for you.
Its very easy to miss a
gear change or a crucial
moment and lose the
Duel. Understandably this
leads to a distinct loss of
street credibility. Of course
you must re-challenge
your adversary, in the
hope that you con bear
him this time._
The Duel is a very good
driving game come
simulation. Its hard
enough to keep control of
a performance car without
the added worry of a race.
The graphics are updated
well and smoothly ond the
perspective effect is
successful. The game is
very reminiscent of Test
Drive and as such is nor as
stunning as it could be.
However if you don't
own Test Drive or would
rather be racing than on
the run check our The Duel.
It might be what you're
looking for. On its own
merits this game is very
good indeed, is fun to play
and sufﬁciently difﬁcult to
keep you playing for some
hours. Driving freaks should
check it out.

and Goblins" featured
our Knight in shining
armour. He hod a quest; to
rescue his kidnapped lady
from the clutches of evil.
Well, guess what? Arthur
the Knight is back. Guess
what h e  has to rescue
the Princess Hus(?) from
the clutches of evil. Ho
hum. You'd have thought
that Arthur would hove
found something different
to do after three years.
Still, a Knight has to do
what a Knight has to do.
Arthur is kilted out (as
before) in his suit of patent
boddy-bashing armour.
This disappears if he is hit.
Arthur then hos only his
underpants for protection.
He has a silver lance (oo-
erl) with which he con slice
the nasties into kebobs. As
Arthur runs across the
barren scenes of depravity
and evil he encounters
chests. Shooting these
reveals either a secret
weapon or a magician.
The secret weapons range
from knives to magical
bombs. These can far
more easily destroy the
nestles then the lance.
The magicians are
faceless men in vampire
costumes. These are
deadly to the touch, but
cast a spell on you. This
turns you into a duck for
about ﬁve seconds. This
can be useful if you need
to avoid lots of nosties as
you're far smaller. When
you turn back into Arthur
your armour is replenished_
Life is not all plain
sailing for Arthur. After all,
there is the little matter of

the nasties he has to
despatch. These vary from
The Grimreoper to ﬂying
Tasmanian Devils. All of
them cause damage to
Arthur. Other static hazards

include collapsing ﬂoors,
guillotines and skull
throwing ﬁres. At the end
of each level Arthur
encounters a huge
Demonic monster. This is
ﬁerce and shoots ﬁreballs
at Arthur. Should Arthur
stab him enough times
with his weapon then he
can progress to the next
l
The third level gives
Arthur a change of task. He
now stands on a ﬂoating
platform. As it rises up a
shaft he is beset by yet
more nasties. Giant Knights
croM out of the walls to
haunt him. Bats ﬂy around
and drop blobs onto him.
Ghouls snap at him with
giant pairs of scissors! This
level makes a nice change
from the horizontally
scrolling other levels.
"Ghouls and Ghosts" is
not a particularly brilliant
game at all. Nor much
imagination has been put
into the charocters or the
backgrounds. Arthur is as
blocky as he was in the ﬁrst
game all that time ago.
The monsters ore not badly
drawn but still aren't
fantastic. It is quite difﬁcult
to shoot across the screen;
Arthur tends to shoot up by
mistake.
This aside, "Ghouls and
Ghosts" is a playable
game. It has good
addictive qualities and is a
nice shoot em up. The
extra weapons are a fun if
fairly ineffective addition
to the game. The game
has terriﬁc music which
partly makes up for its
other shortcomings. My
advice is to try before you
buy.

inclination to become
world champ, then
perhaps this game could
be for you. Hopefully you'll
make it if you don't hang
yourself ﬁrst. Yes, this is a
frustrating game!
No one ever said that
ﬁghting your way up to the
top would be easy. In fact
to prove the point you
hove to start by brawling in
the street. These ﬁghts are
all very well organised
though. There's still a bell
and three minute rounds.
The corners aren't strict
though - you can end up
or either side of the street.
As usual in this type of
game, there are a variety
of moves to knock the
stufﬁng our of your
opponents. You con job,
hook, body punch and
uppercut. Also you can
throw a P u n c h " .  This
is a gloriﬁed uppercut
which takes about a
second a hot. It is also
wildly inaccurate and fails
to land about 90% of the
time. However the
computer boxer manages
to land it on you about
once in every three
attempts. This is, to say the
least. annoying. If more
than one of these killer
blows hits you then it's
Knock Out time for you.
This seems to happen
almost every game. You
box away at the latest
street boxer, using a
variety of moves. He then
turns around and clobbers
smeg out of you with a
couple of killers. KO time
again! Iris possible to beat
the occasional ﬁghter but
then the next will take out
his revenge.
Other moves include
clinching (this makes the
boxers kiss) ond whot's
supposed to be dancing.
On screen the boxers
appear to be about to
lose their breakfasts. They
retch backwards and
forwards from the waist.
Fortunately the nausea
seems to pass when you
release the control.
The graphics on this
section are reasonable but
not excellent. Rubbish
litters the street and the
alleys are well drawn. The
boxers ore very chunky
indeed, they look as if
they're built from
sticklebricks. They move
fairly well without
ﬂickering Blows are
greeted with a solid thud
and the bell rings
convincingly. There's no
music though.
if you're diligent (and
extremely patient) you
might get discovered by a
professional coach. He'll
see that you get to ﬁght in
the ring. However, in
between the street and
the ring is the gym phase.
This is an optional training
phase which is a little
repetitive but makes a
pleasant change. Once in
the ring the boxers start to
get really tough. Fight on
through and after a lot of
suffering and pain you
may get a shot at
becoming the champ.

potential to be a really
great game. However it is
let down by being
completely frustrating. The
computer boxer often pulls
out a couple of deadly
shots and your work is
wasted. There is a two
player mode which is a fun
addition. This is a great
game if you like boxing
and enjoy a long term
challenge.

ﬁfteen huge men try to
throw, catch and carry a
small leather ball into the
"endzone". Should they be
successful then a
"Touchdown" is the result.
This scores six points. The
kicker then has a chance
to score the extra point by
booting the ball over the
goalposts. (NiloII Quinn
would be good at it then
Ed). The game is very
much a physical contact
sport. The teams ore all
kitted out in pods and
helmets to avoid injury.
This sounds quite
simple, but the game is
also very subtle too. There
are many different
variations on the basic pass
or running plays. These are
all named, including
"shotgun", "pocket" and
"reverse". Each play is
intended to catch out the
opposition and run the boll
into the endzone. As well
as a touchdown you can
elect to kick a ﬁeld goal.

This scores three points but
is better than losing the
ball.
You have four attempts
to carry the ball ten yards.
This is known as a ﬁrst
down. Fail this and the
possession turns over to the
other team. This also
happens if the ball is
dropped or a pass is
intercepted by an
opposing player.
John Madden Football
is a superb game. It has
captured all of the subtle
complexities of what is a
very complicated and
involved sport. For those of
you who like on arcade
type game as well as a
strategy you can assume
control of the players on
screen. The graphics ore
fairly well deﬁned but a
little blocky. This means
that it is sometimes very
difﬁcult to see what's going
on. However the same is
true of the real sport so it's
excuseable of the
corn purer version_
The packaging is very
extravagant. There is a
handbook, two pomphlets
which individually detail
offensive and defensive
plays and a "season
ticket". This is a revolving
card disk which contains
codes to access the
program and discourage
piracy. The books ore well
written and concise with
clear instructions and step
by step guides to play.
This is not a game
where you can sit down
and enjoy it instantly. You
have to understand the
sport ﬁrst. Then you have to
understand the program. It
works extremely well once
you suss Out the way it is
structured. Then you'll be
absolutely hooked. You
won't be able to drag
yourself away from the
screen until you've won a
few key plays. Sure to be a
hit with fans of the sport.

5  treet Hassle is an
ancient game and one
that passed by many of
us without much notice. It

second-hand trumpet a lot
louder this time.

doubt that it comes as

a beat-em-up. You are a
half-screen high sprite

embarrassment. Your

The 'Hassle parr of the
title comes from the fact
that you are often
attacked by people and
animals. Dogs, gorillas, and

you, alas, must do the

favourite is the violent

glitches, and only three
levels, but at its new found
price it could be described
as worthwhile.

game by E+J Software, best
known for its serious sport

It is best suited for the
budget market as it is very
limited, but fun. It is a
shoot-em-up without an
awful lot of thought. A sort
of cross between Defender

being much like either of

The boat creation part
is very good and the

do have effect in the race,
The race is a doddle to
handle as all you have to
do is steer and raise and
lower your spinnaker

legocy remains. Few

the safety of its home as
the contestants pit reﬂex
and wit against the Snare.
Your rime has come or
last. You enter the maze in
a highly mobile hovercrok
The only armaments being
a small cannon, the ability
to leave a trail behind you
and, most importantly,
your wit. At ﬁrst the maze
Price: 69.99 Tape,
£12.99 Disk
Supplier: Thalamus
confounds the mind as
each ninety degree turn of
your craft rotates not you
but the maze. This means
that no matter how you
twist and turn you always
travel up the screen. The
ﬁrst few minutes spent in
the maze result in many a
crash until your brain
adjusts to this novel
method of rotation.
Threading your way
through the walls and pits
of the Snare is complicated
by the patterned tiles
which lie scattered on the
ﬂoor. Some rotate your
craft involuntary, other slow
it down, messing up your
timing but others
accelerate your craft,
usually into a wall.
Learning the effect of each
tile is almost as important
as ﬁnding the exit.
When you hove
mastered the art of wall
avoidance you must face
the challence of the robots.
These mechanical ﬁends
patrol the maze with
deadly intent. Your cannon
can account for the early
droids but in later levels
they become
indestructible. Your only
hope of avoiding these
creatures is to wall them
off with your
impenetratable trail.
The third major hazard
to your health are the pits
and chasms. To clear these
you need a good run-up
and good timing to use
the jump capabilities of
your craft
Each level has its own
hazards and internal
conditions, before entering
each maze you are given
a read out of these
conditions and the effects
they have upon your craft.
Certain levels cause some
of your ships functions to
fail thus creating new
complexities for you to
overcome.
To aid your quest for
fame and fortune a bonus
ship is awarded every
twenty thousand points. To
help you accumulate this
veritable fortune in bonus
points bonuses can be
collected from air vents
which sporadically appear
in the maze. Caution
should be exercised when
harvesting bonus points as
the air vents do not always
blow favourably for your
craft.
Although mastering the
variations of the maze is
far from ease (even after
your brain has ceased
reeling from the unusual
method of movement) it is
strangely addictive.
The allure of this game
lies not in the average
graphics or the burp of
your cannons but in the
challenge it presents. Your
ship responds well to your
commands allowing those
with quick reﬂexes to
handle even the most
stringent of the mazes
tests.

elcome to the
Federation, this is
on unparalleled
chance to explore strange
worlds, meet interesting
aliens and get your head
blown off.
As a new recruit you
not only have to combat
the hidden menace of the
raiders but face the
despair of budget cuts. This
does not mean the
scenery will wobble or the
aliens will wear diving suits
but something for more
insidious. Thrown into deep
space by the Federation
you are left to your own
devices armed only with a
combat jacket, blaster and
a twin laser compouter
guided interceptor combat
ship.
Together with your four
other crew members (all
ﬁve crew members can be
created indMdually or you
can use the ﬁve provided)
you must learn the identity
of the mysterious raiders
and counter the threat. To
do this you will place your
life in peril many times as
you seek Out new
encounters and
knowledge. Tuning into
the Federation frequency
allows you to pick up
information on recent
hostile actions and if you
are lucky you can arrive in
time to blast a few aliens.
The journey starts on
bood your craft amidst a
battle between the raiders

and ﬂeet of transporters.
Using your eight directional
movements you guide
your craft to the action.
Here you can lock onto a
vessel to either
communicate or attach. If
activated your lasers ﬁre
automatically at the
nearest enemy. To prevent
a raider from escaping
your wrath you can utilise
the ship computer and
instruct it to shodow the
enemy vessel. Many of the
computer functions can be
improved if your crew
have the nerve and skill to
rewrite the programs, but
beware, the unskilled can
decrease the efﬁciency of
the computer as easily as
enhancing it.
After trading blows with
the enemy and receiving
a few credits for your
trouble you can begin the
search for information.
There are two main ways
of gathering information
about the raiders. The most
dangerous method is to
cripple and board a hostile
vessel, not recommended
for weaker beginning
parties, or you can visit the
many worlds for a quick
chat. When landing on a
world you switch from the
spaceship to an all terrain
vehicle. With this vehicle
you can explore the
subtleties of land borne
life. If any of the life gets a
little restless you can
always blast it from the
safety of your ATV,
Exploring towns is a great
way to pick up information
but for those that prefer a
face to face confrontation
there ore always the bottle

alien menace with their

computer provides the
graphics needed to
navigate the landscape as
well as providing
information on aliens
encountered and the suit

It is refreshing to
encounter a role-playing
game that does not rely
upon brawn and a keen
blade. The interstellar
quest for knowledge is fun
but the control and
graphics of your ship in
ﬂight and combat leave
much to be desired.

I think YC is cool, but I hove a few
questions I'd like to thrust in your
genital direction:
1. Is YC a new name for the old
(and excessively boring) Your
Commodore?
2. Who does your ortwork?
3. Who is the Purple Ashlord really?
4. Is Pro Mountain pike Simulator
really THAT bad?
5. How many entries do you get for
each competition (is it worth
entering)?
6. What is your favourite game?
7. Is Hackatak ever going to print a
map for Super Wonderboy?
Peter Mills, Coventry
PA: 1. Yes. 2. Lee Brimmicombe-
Wood, Alan Lathwell, and now Rik
Henderson himself all contribute
scribbles. 3. The Purple Fishlord (are
you thick or something?). 4. Yep (Or
so Nk tells me). 5. Well over a

the sake of causing Nk more hassle.
6. Anyﬁng with loads of death in it.

I notice that in the February issue of
Your Commodore (sorry, YCI), a
magazine that I hove been buying

for three years now, that you have
included an article about violence_ I
have no qualms against the printing
of such material as long as it is done
in a matter that is not offensive.
Unfortunately, although the text
itself was of a very professional
nature, the way in which it was
presented was in very poor taste
indeed. The title 'Die Alien Scum'
was completely unnecessary, and in
my mind was only used for the
•Shods' effect that it may have. The
pictures were far too explicit for the
games mag that you have now
seemed to become, and the
alarming array of weaponry that
adorn each page only helps to
glomourise the subject matter.

Thankfully, the Code Masters
boys have one they prepared
earlier; a lead to connect a CD
player to 064 ond o disc (compact,
notch) to go with it containing thirty-
four games. What's more it's only
619.95.
How did all this happen?
Explains Mike Clark, the codies' PR
supremo, "Nobody does anything
original", While moping about this,
Ted Carron, programmer of
International Rugby for the 64, was
(says Mike) "given some hardware
to play with which he opened up
and found out how it worked".

A Richard Darling
Er_ David's brother.
"I have a general interest in
technology" says Ted, "with a CD
you can have lots of information
and get at it quickly... ifs random
access". Rather bizarrely the system
is "using the 64's speaker to
playback the CD'',
Ted came up not only with a
cable but a way of loading games
in around 20 seconds from CD. This
gave Code Masters the idea to
produce, as David Darling puts it, ''a
compilorion with style... the best of
Code Masters".
They did it because they found
that 30-40% of people who buy the
Code Masters games have CDs,
lucky dogs! If this compilation was
released on disk it would rake at
least ten, and tope_ ugh,., all that
winding back and forth!
"It's of most advantage to 8-bit
r
The bedingS Ond PR geezer Mike
users with cassette-based systems"
concedes Richard Darling. "The C64
version actually has the edge", says
Mike, "we all love the machine"
(that's enough fawning to 64
owners!).
Being a rather technical chappie,
Ted demonstrated how it worked._
You plug one end of the cable into
the CD player's headphone socket
and the other into the joystick port.
Because of a huddle of components
at one end of the special cable, the
64 can understand the CD - even
better after playing in a small
loader program from the disc.
To get a game, you just select
the required track (game) and...
whizzo! There it is! If you press
"Restore", you just need to select
another track and that begins to
load.
"If you have this cable, you're
going to ﬁnd it very useful" says
Mike, mysteriously. "Ther could be
any number of speical products in
the future, Bigger games, huge
multiloads, endless capacity for
secret sub-games and hidden
levels.., fantastic possibilities". For
instance, he sees no reason why
c

there couldn't be a real Dragon's
Lair for the 64 on a CD - "anything
that relies on massive amounts of
storage would be a cinch'' he
boasts.
None of this explains a
mysterious "research mission" to the
For East. "Richard and Ted
announced they were going to
Taiwan" recalls Mike, "they said they
were staying for four days." They
ended up staying for three weeks!
What did they do? Maybe the
company might accept answers on
a postcard in a return for a CD pack?
Maybe not.

To review every one of this
staggering amount of games is a

Herculean task. So, I'm not going to
do it. (You're no Hercules, are you? -
Ed). As CM's Mike Clark put it, ''It
would be difﬁcult to recommend
one game as devastatingly
outstanding given that there are so
many good games on it."
There are some real corkers on it.
ATV Simulator (a great cross-country
buggy game for two players) is
probably one of the best, if not the
best. Mike explained how fast it was
- "ﬁfty frames a second, the fastest
you can update it" b u t  then he
wrote the game!
There's also Pro Ski Simulator
(another great two-player game,
this time full of on-piste action),
Treasure Island Dizzy (an arcade-
adventure puzzle game for
eggheads) and Four Soccer
Simulators (er, four footie games).

W
role-playing game on
computersays Julian Gallop
of Harlow-based Target
Games. With his brother, Nick, he's
helping to change that through their
latest project. Lords Of Chaos.
So why program this, a fantasy
RPG? 'It's my favourite sort of grame
and obviously based on Chaos._
There aren't many fantasy-strategy
games around, most of them ore
pretty naff",
The original Chaos was a
Spectrum game (stop complaining
at the back, there) from Games
Workshop. the well-known
roleplaying-game company_ Their
short-lived software section
produced a few games in 1984/85
and then had its plug pulled.
something Julian is still bitter about.
His ﬁrst games Timelords,
Nebula, and Rebelstar Raiders
(another predecessor to a later
game) - were for Red Shift
Software, which no longer exists.
After that, he went to Games
Workshop where he wrote Chaos
and worked on Battle Cars before
starring on the hit budget strategy
game Rebelstar (born out of
Rebelstar Raiders) for Firebird Silver,
to be followed a few years later by
Rebelstar II.
He very nearly stopped
programming but came bock to the
fold to establish Target Games with
brother Nidc and father Peter. Their
philosophy being "to produce high-
quality strategy games which are
designed to go beyond the middle
mark".
Their ﬁrst release. Loser Squad,
did exactly that. A strategy game
with solid near-30 characters and a
degree of action and charm that just
isn't there with most games of the
genre. After an abortive self-
publishing attempt, the company
signed to Blade who relaunched
I.

Laser Squad and will be publishing
the new gome too.
Lords of Chaos has a simple
concept_ There ore (up to eight)
wizards who hove to compete for
victory points and, after one "wins"
must disappear into a portal to win
the game. A player accrues points
by ﬁnding objects, killing the other
wizards (magically, of course) &
their creations and costing spells.
Which is where it gets fun. Players
create creatures by costing certain
spells. The harder the spell, the more
it costs to cast and the more
incredible a creature is likely to be.
Its all dependent on ''Mono" which
is the magical power of the wizard.
This goes down when a spell is cast
but can be rejuvenated by some of
the objects lying around,
Creature spells start with the
lowly Giant Bar (worse than
pathetic), go through, amongst
many others, Dwarves, Bears,
harpies, Zombies, Vampires, all they
way up to the most powerful
creatures of all dragons - which
come in Green, Red, and Gold, the
most powerful of all.
The are also a variety of other
spells: projectile spells like magic
lightning; terrain spells such as the
Tangle Vine, Flood, Fire, or Gooey
Blob which advance across the
landscape like the Red Weed in
War of the Worlds; and more
intangible spells such as Subversion
(of other players' creatures).
The conﬂict is played out on a
wide expanse of terrain (which you
can scroll around or see on a ''big
map") which is covered in wizards'
strongholds, chests, objects, swamp),
forest and, by the time the game
has got going, loads of pseudo-3D
creations, trampling around the
map picking things up and hitting
each other.
"Every game will be different, Ifs
mindboggling" says Julian. He's
right, too.
"Lords of Chaos" will be released
by Blade Software or Easter for the
Commodore 84.

a whole month ﬂash
by as if in on instant, down
here in the Neon Zone. It
seems like only yesterday when I
was clocking up a pretty cool

14,760,000 on a three ball Joketz
machine. Beat that anyone?
I freely admit to being a pinball

for raising well over E500 in the
process.
Last month I think I promised
news of the follow-up to Chase HQ

Well, it takes up exactly where
Chase Mk I left off. I mean - the

all you do to stop the bad guys is...
knock their motors around a bit.
Believable? Nope. The vital
ingredient missing was - guns!

remedies this with a vengence. Like
before, you zoom off in your motor,
givng chase to assorted villainary,
but this time, when you get near
them, do you just give 'em a shunt?

And if you're good and I mean
very good - you get something
extra special dropped from a

you start taking the miscreants out
with that! Community policing it isn't,
but if you did enjoy the original,

drivers and spectators killed in this
rally than any other on the
international race calendar? It's quite
surprising then that the game
doesn't involve trying to run people
down - you just have to drive fast!
Controls are simple - accellerator
pedal, hi/law gears and steering
wheel, with you making your way
through the various stages of the
event - starting in the bright lights of
Paris, but soon entering the rugged
terrain of the Sahara. Although the
implementation is good - the
graphics are nice and the scrolling
and sprite scaling smooth enough -
it has to be said that the game is a
little locking in the originality stakes.
Still, if you ore into driving yourself,
it'll be worth having a go to see if
you agree with me.
If you're not into driving, then
maybe it's more action you're
looking for. How about Quad Bikes?

tractor things that you see quite
often in these action events like 'Run
the Gauntlet'. Take it from me, they
ore fantastic fun to ride in real life
and now Namco has given you the
chance to ﬁnd out for yourself in a
game called Four Trox.
It comes in a double unit, so you
can ply head to head against a
friend - as you sit down on the
bike's saddle and rev the throttle
wide open. Spin those wheels, drift
across those corners, fall over those
straw bales! Great stuff! Expert to see
loads of these about this year.
One you won't see too much of,
but is worthy of note, is a game
from a company called Gottlieb.
Renowned for its pinball machines,
the Big G has suddenly released a
deeply weird game - Exterminator.
Utilising largely digitised graphics,
you control a disembodied hand
which has to clear rooms of rather
unusual infestations. Like bortallions
of toy tanks, which have a tendency
to ﬁre bock, for example.
You have three weapons; your
hand can stamp down on the ﬂoor
directly below you (so crushing
anything underneath), grab
something out of the air or direct a
beam of purple energy across the
room, as directed.
While all this is going on you
have to watch for ﬂying objects, like
the Wasp. Try grabbing him and
your hand will throb in agony as it
stings you.
Deeply surreal, you might not
enjoy playing this frankly bizzare
game but on the other hand - you
might. For something completely
different, try it!
What's green, got 4 legs, is 15
years old and would rake your

you. What else but A teenage

Basically a four player (yes, four

bit of fun when Raphael, Leonardo,
Donatello and Michaelangelo get
into action against the bad guys.
Lightweight. but OK, if there's a
crowd of you our for a giggle.
DataEast has come up with
some goodies lately. Robocop for
example and more recently, Secret
Agent. Now comes another that is
likely to be very successful for them,
Midnight Resistance.
Relatively small sprites here, but
the control is interesting, using a
rotary joystick. It moves eight ways in
the usual manner, to move your
central character, but the knob on
top also rotates to direct your line of
ﬁre. So you con be running one way
and ﬁring in the other. Very sensible.

Dear Miles,
I am currently writing myself o

have tried coding a routine that
when inputed with a hex number
will read off from the memory
location inputed, and display the
content as hex bytes. The problem I
am having is converting the contents
of the memory location to screen
codes. Would you please explain
how it should be done?
Mark Jackson, Newcastle
Deer Mark,
Thanks for writing to me with your
question, and I am pleased to tell
you that I do hove the answer, and
very easy it is too. Quite simply,
what you hove to do is LOAD the
accumulator with the hex value,
AND it with 00001111 leoving you
with a value from 0 to 15. Check to
see if the value is 10 or greater; if
so, then subtract 9 (giving you a
letter from A-F. If the value is 0-9
then add 48 giving you a number
from 0-9). Now store the contents of
the accumulator at, say, 1025 (Dec),

this putting o number of letter on
the screen (top left). Now re-load
the accumulator with the original
HEX value. This time rotate the
accumulator four places to the right,
then AND it with 00001111. Once
again check if the value is greater or
less than 10. Store the A reg. or, say,
1024 (Dec). Now you should see
the original hex value as two screen
codes.
Dear Miles,
After reading your article on roster
routines in YC's sister magazine
(Commodore Disk User), I wanted to
ﬁnd out two points regarding raster
bars.
1. Is a so-called 'vertically split raster
bar a genuine roster bar?
2. If the above question is 'yes', then
could you explain how such on
effect is done?
J. Summers, Scotland
Dear Mt, Summers,
Let me start by answering your ﬁrst
question: a vertically split raster
colour bar is a real raster colour bar,
and isn't done using some form of
bitmon or colour cheat. The way
that it is done is fairly simple but
involves extremely careful and
precise timing. After experimenting,
I found that the best method was to
blank out the screen by POKEing
53265 to O. The next procedure is
to latch onto the desired raster line
where you want the colour bar to
start.
Now read off a colour into the
accumulator and store at 53280.
You should be able to do this
around seven times, then there will
be one raster line with seven splits
of on. Keep doing this for the
amount of raster lines you wont to
cover.
The reason I turned off the
screen is becouse it allows you the
some amount of cycles to every
roster line (unlike when the screen is
on).
I am sorry that I can't give you a
listing, but it would take up most of
the page. I hope that the
information is of some help to you.
I hope that answers your
question. I checked an old routine I
had for doing the above and it
worked O.K., so you shouldn't have
any trouble doing o similar one
yourself.
If you have any programming
problems, hints and tips, then write

in showing off a bit of pixellated
ﬂesh or are the anti-sexism
campaigners just getting their
knickers in a twist?
If there's anything designed to
get people's blood boiling, its sex. It
gets more people uptight and
irritated than the National Health
Service and water privatisation put
together. Everybody's got an
opinion about it and given half a
chance they'll ram it down your
throat. Computers can't kiss or wear
a condom so you might think they
haven't got all that much to do with
it, but there you're wrong. Sex and
gender affect everyone and
everything - and games ore no
exception.
The main points of argument ore
easy to spot. For something to be
sexist it's got to discrimate against
women purely on the grounds of
their gender. That means that
anything which portrays women as
less intelligent or capable than men
simply because they are women is
a deﬁnite no-no. The some goes for
portraying them as if the only thing
that's interesting about them is the
way they look. You know the gen:
nice body, shame about the brain.
Start looking and a lot of game
packaging and advertising starts to
appear decidedly iffy. Flick through
a few back issues of Your
Commodore and you'll ﬁnd more
than a couple of ads sporting a
picture of a sexy blonde not overly
endowed in the clothes

department. More often than not
there's just a subtle hint of sexuality -
like the female tennis player's
undies peeking Out from beneath
Her skirt in the ad for Passing Shot -
but every now and again someone
releases an ad which is so overt it
causes something of a stir.
Remember Psycho Pigs IIXB? On the
strength of the gameplay nobody
would; the ad which featured on
almost topless model stretched out
on a billboard VVCIS far more
memorable. Or how about Corinne
Russell posing aggressively in
supposedly kinky mock-leopard skin
bikini plus leather whip on the cover
of Marrech's Vixen? Boots refused to
sell it with a full-size picture of
Corinne on the front. so Martech hod
to publish a special head and
shoulders version just for them.
Products like Sam Fox Strip Poker
of Mario's Christmas Box aren't
exactly aimed at furthering the
cause of women's lib either. On the
64 they don't even ﬂatter the eye
very much. However interesting you
might ﬁnd Sam Fox in the ﬂesh,
there hos to be a limit to the
titillation afforded by a pair of
blocky, low resolution breasts.
Even without bouncing breasts
and naughty knickers, a lot of
games hardly go our of their way to
show women in a positive light. For
example, have you ever thought
about the goals of games like
Vigilante or Savage? Some feeble
little girly totally incapable of
looking after herself has got into a
pickle and is just deperore for her
macho, hard-man boyfriend to
come and help her Out. Doesn't
reinforce your conﬁdence in the
independence of the 'fairer' sex,
does it?
Harmless fun? Well, it's unlikely to
harm anyone physically. The
argument that page 3 girls are
directly linked with the Violent
sexual abuse of women is pretty
tenuous. As long as you're a healthy
law-abiding individual in the ﬁrst
place, looking or a pic of Corinne
Russell topless or in a bikini isn't
going to make you go out and rape
someone. Even if you can establish
a deﬁnite connection between rape
and page 3 in a speciﬁc incident,
that wouldn't be a valid enough
reason for banning it. It's like saying
that because John Hinckley, the
man who tried to shoot Ronald
Reagan, was obsessed with Jodie
Foster, all her movies should be
scrapped.
Joyslicks and IP-
lipsticks.
A Ship by numbers.
That's obvious. But there are
more subtle ways in which games
can undermine the role of women.
Close your eyes for a second and
picture a page 3 girl. Ten to one, the
ﬁrst thing you think about isn't her
brainpower. If society placed men
and women on a totally equal
footing it wouldn't make the
blindesr bit of difference. For every
page 3 girl, there'd be a page 7
fella somewhere else. Nobody
would think the girl a slag for posing
in the nude any more than they'd
think badly of the bloke.
But right now that's nor the way
things work. Like it or not, society still
makes it harder for women to
succeed than men. There's still a
tendency to assume that women
are less capable of rational thought.
Girls aren't encouraged to do
sciences at school and employers
often discriminate against women
when they're handing our jobs, Most
of our MPs are men; over ar/c, of the
population they represent is female.
Anything which depicts women
in an inferior role reinforces that
inequality whether it's comics, TV,
ﬁlms or computer games. The
question is, should we be trying to
stop it? On the one hand, taking a
few bikinis off the front of a plastic
box isn't going to change people's
attitudes. But then, it just goes to
show how little respect one half of
the population has for the other if
Mono Whithker is on the lett. V
VC 6 3

they only ﬁnd them interesting when
they're wearing a g-string. You may
think the view that women belong
in the kitchen is outdated but every
time you buy a product with a sexist
slant, you're adding another link to
the chain which binds them to the
kitchen sink.
Whatever you think of the moral
argument there's another by-
product to all this. Nudge-nudge
advertising aimed at lads excludes
most girls from the games scene. At
school, computing is considered a
boys' subject at home the brothers
get the 64s and the sisters get the
prams; at wadi women use word
processors, blokes become the
engineers. If a girl ever gets to take
a look at a game or a magazine
everything about it is designed to
put them off.
Personally, I don't think there's
any reason why girls shouldn't enjoy
anything from shoot 'em ups to
adventure games just as much as
boys. The only reason they don't is
because they're conditioned to think
that a computer won't interest them
and all the game blurb they ever
encounter just works to reinforce
that. Maybe if some of the adverts
were less one-sided and the game
scenarios had a more uni-sex
approach women's attitudes could
change as well. It won't happen
overnight and it won't happen
without a change in women's
education. But if it does happen it
might actually bring a breath of
fresh air to software.
One of a minority of software
houses currently attempting to
encourage a non-sexist policy is
Audiogenic. The company's boss,
Peter Calvet, reckons that getting
women interested in software could
bring new life into games. If
publishers sold more units to all
those extra female customers they'd
make more money. 'That way you
could plough a lot of your proﬁt
back into development and design.
And anything that lets you spend
more time on game development
has to be good for the industry'.
There's only one reason some
publishers carry on using sexist
adverts and producing strip poker
games: money. It sells. Whether your
products's great or mediocre it
stands to shift a few more units if
there's a blonde in a mini-skirt on
the front. As for the cash - it comes
from you, the consumer. When you
pays your money, you makes your
choice- Pick a lot of licensed games
64 1 YC
and the publishers buy more
licences. Ask for more Sam Fox and
you'll probably get her. Reject
overtly sexual promotion and if
enough people do it, you'll
probably get a response. Whatever
you decide about sexism, this is one
issue about whch it's easy to make
your opinions know. If you've got
the cash you've got a vote. And
how you vote is up to you

camouﬂage tedious gameplay,
Mortech took a silly pic of Corinnne
Russell and plastered it everywhere
in a high proﬁle ad campaign. It
didn't improve the game.

CAMBERLY
Ashley Cotter-Cairns arrives
at Digital Integration in a
swathe of set stream and
afterburner, and discovers
certain manoeuvres before tW
boiling out
igital Integration is
a Camberly-based software
house which occupies
several ofﬁces on a small Out
of the way industrial area. It has
been in business since 1982 when it
produced Fighter Pilot on the
humble ZX-81. Since that
inauspiscious milestone, ID.I. has built
a sound reputation as producer of
the best simulations around.
Amongst its past titles ore
Tomahawk. TT Racer and Bobsleigh,
which, along with Fighter Pilot and F-
16 Combat Pilot, were all
simulations of their subject. In
amongst all of these simulations
there lurks a game which is more of
an arcade style and format. That
game is Advanced Tactical Fighter
(ATF), "A bit of a digression" for
- a(
YC 6 5

Digital Integration, who are currently
working on a 16-bit sequel, ATF2.
If you osk someone who Digital
Integration is, the chances are that
they won't know. This is not
surprising, as the company tends to
keep a low proﬁle. Its strategy tends
to be long term publicity campaign
during a game's development. This
is usually followed by a sudden
outburst of interest as the game
nears completion. On launch, the
game is widely acclaimed; then D.I.
seem to vanish into the background
whilst the sales start clocking up.
F-16 Combat Pilot has taken
nine-plus man years to complete. It
was developed over eighteen
months by a team of programmers
and designers, whose emphasis was
always on speeding up the
program. Dave Marshall, head of
Digital and project designer and
manager: "We consantly tried to
shave microseconds off of the
reaction and movement time to
create as realistic a simulation as
possible." The Commodore 64
version of I-16 was worked on by
Dove, with Chris Medley
programming and graphics by Les
Doughtey.
The team has worked long and
hard to cram as much detail into the
64 as possible. As a result, the 64
and Amiga versions are technically
almost identical. Of course, the 64
cannot match the Amigo's graphics
capability or speed, and the objects
are wire frame instead of solid 3D.
However most of the features of the
16-bit version are still represented.
The 16-bit version was acdaimed
as the best simulator available this
side of a 32-bit machine, generally
used by the Ministty of Defence for
training real combat pilots. The 64
version manages to capture the
some feel as its 16-bit counterpart
and uses the maximum amount of
available memory space. Despite
this, the graphics have not suffered
and the game still looks polished.
However, the future for D.I. in the 8-
bit market looks to be fairly limited.
The sixteen bit market is still
being explored. However ifs
deﬁnitely the future of DI, you can
do so much more within a more
powerful machine. It's not that we
wont to leave the eight bit market,
but more that the size of the
machine just won't take the
complexity of the projects any
mom. There's only so much that
eight bit machines can do. As it is, it
was a struggle to cram F-16 Combat
66 4YC
Pilot into the 64."
The initial sales hove hit around
17,000 units or so across the 16-bit
market. It's always hard to assess the
exact level of sales for a simulation
because its shelf-life is so long. But
the total sales overall ore expected
to top 100,000. Such is Digital
Integration's success after launching
a new product that they can survive
through eighteen months of
development without worrying
ﬁnancially. Now that F-16 Combat
Pilot has been released, the sales
will continue throughout
development of their next projects.
And so its success continues.
So much has changed during the
age of computer home
entertainment in a very short
and yet Digital Integration is still
going strong into the 1990's. Many
F-16 Fighter Pilot. A
companies hove tried to cope with
the recession in sales by changing its
image, its product or long term
strategy. But Digital has stuck to its
guns, obviously having found the
correct formula ﬁrst time around. In
the meantime, many of the smaller
companies have gone by the
wayside. But DI are now
expanding.
With the backing of Electronic
Ms, it is marketing F-16 Combat
Pilot in Americo This is a huge
market area into which many British
software houses fail to break. Digital
Integration's sortie into that lucrative
yet ﬁckle market is yet another
testament to its achivements as
software house.

It's purple rime again!!!

 loop. Oh dear ﬁsh friends,
though your Earthling
event of over indulgence,
namely Christmas, has come
and gone here on the aquatic
wonderworld of Czar, the time
difference means that our annual
celebrations of all things ﬁshy hove
yet to take place. And somehow,
thanks to communicating with the
witless YC boy Henderson by FL-
mail-kind link the fool has
transmitted what you earthlings call
a 'hangover to our entire
population. This outrage shall not go
unpunished dirt grubbers.. even now
the great war engines of Czar are
being prepared. But ﬁrst here is the
latest gossip brought to me by my
spies.
ACTIVISION
Amanda Barry, Activision's PR
supremo. is leaving the exciting
metropolis of Reading for dull old
London and a job at Lynne Franks
PR, infamous for its Zen Bhuddist
temple in the centre of the ofﬁce,
and its terrible coffee.
MIRRORSOFT
Following on from the Bloodwych
disaster, more bad news from
Mirrorsoft concerns Dynamic
Debugger. Apparently the
programmer was supposed to hove
ﬁnished the game by the beginning
of November, but has since
steadfastly refused to contact the
company. Our ﬁsh on the spot (in his
bowl of course) also reports
increasing levels of strife at the
company. While punter's calls about I
games not working echo around
the product deportment all day,
and personal callers are walled up
behind stacks of returned discs, the
two main girlies. Cathy in PR and
Charlie in Product ore striving for the -
title of Mirrorsoft Sex Symbol, The
ofﬁce is apparently awash with
blusher and eye shadow.

FOCUS
Well known publishing house Focus,
well known beacuse all the decent
people have left it thanks to the
'jobs for the boy5' management. has
inﬂicted a defeat on boy Henderson
and his plucky troops. Using such
nefarious tactics as 'passing the ball',
and a heady mixture of knuckle
butties and low alcohol lager at half
time the footballers of Argus were
unlucky losers in a tight game,
decided only when the referee
blew his whistle at the end.
Commented our Rik after the
game. 'they caught us by surprise,
they started the game ten minutes
before we arrived. It was the secret
tactic that ﬁnished us off though.
Who would have believed that they
could "pass" the ball'.
The ﬁnal score in this nail-biting
game was Focus 10, kgus 1. (I
thought I told you to forget about
this! Ed ).

buyers fo ACE, has been tarnished
recently. First the Deputy Editor of
ACE, Richard Haynes, or Dick as most
people fondly call him, humilated
himself and provided a good
watering spot for inﬁrm dogs by
falling over dead drunk at a press
bosh. It was touch and go for Dick,
but the soothing ministrations of NHS
nurses brought him back from the
brink and he was discharged the
next day.
Then there was a great furore
over a review of Ghostbusters II in
ACE, when it was given the
equivalent of 25%. A cowardly
pseudonym was used on the
review, which has all the hallmarks
of a writer working not a thousand
miles from Priory Court. Acrivision
were so incensed by the review,
which rumour has it was so damning
because the writer didn't get ther
review copy before anyone else,
that the US parent ﬁrm has advised
and lawyers informed. It also
resulted in Larry Sparks having a
clenched teeth meeting with Dick
Haynes of ACE and Terry Prow the
publisher.
That's all from I, the Purple Fish Lord,
for this Earth month. Until next rime,
may your bowl be forever clean.
