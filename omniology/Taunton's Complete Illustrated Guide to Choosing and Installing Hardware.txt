About Your Safety: Working with wood is inherently dangerous. Using hand or power tools
improperly or ignoring safety practices can lead to permanent injury or even death. Don’t try to
perform operations you learn about here (or elsewhere) unless you’re certain they are safe for
you. If something about an operation doesn’t feel right, don’t do it. Look for another way. We
want you to enjoy the craft, so please keep safety foremost in your mind whenever you’re in 
the shop.

get a panoramic view of your choices in that
hardware category, as well as tips on the key
quality points to seek when you’re choosing
hardware. In the photo essays, you’ll discover
how to successfully handle even complicated
installations step by easy step. Whenever
possible, I’ve included insights as to why
you’re following a certain procedure so that
you can apply the knowledge you gain to
other projects.
Combining these two approaches gives
you knowledge that is both extensive in
range and intensive in application. As a
result, you’ll be better prepared and more
confident in your approach to woodworking.
You’ll be able to maximize your time in the
shop, building projects that are sturdier, bet-
ter looking, and more functional. If you’re an
amateur, it can mean moving your abilities,
work, and satisfaction to the next level.

s one of the first research steps
for this book, I contacted a long
list of hardware manufacturers
and suppliers and requested cat-
alogs. As the catalogs arrived and filled one
shelf after another in my office, I began to
wonder how to compress all of that informa-
tion into a single book.
It was immediately apparent that a single
volume on the topic of hardware could not
pretend to be absolutely comprehensive in
scope—showing every piece of hardware
available on the planet—and also utterly
exhaustive in depth—demonstrating how to
install each example.
Fortunately, the Complete Illustrated Guide
format helped achieve a balance, delivering
useful information in a concise manner that
you can immediately put to practical use. In

overing every type and size of
fastener would fill a hefty book.
And frankly, that’s probably more
than you need or want to know. So this sec-
tion focuses on the information that’s most
useful for cabinetmakers and home wood-
workers: how to choose the right fastener for
the job, and tips that will help you build
stronger projects.
Choose Cut Nails 
for Historical Accuracy 
Cut nails are made by slicing wedge-shaped
pieces in alternating directions from a strip
of steel: The width of the strip determines
the length of the nails. Forming a head on
the nail is a separate operation.
Four popular cut-nail forms are the rose-
head common nail, available in sizes from 6d
to 20d; the box nail that ranges from 4d to
10d; fine finish nails in sizes from 3d to 8d;
and the brad, available only in 2d.
Because of their wedge shape, cut nails
can split lumber across its grain. To mini-
mize that, drive the nail so that the wedge
parallels the grain.
Wired for Fast Production 
Cut-nail technology represented a quantum
leap in speed, but today’s wire nail-making
machinery produces fasteners quicker than
your eye can see. Common nails are large-
gauge headed fasteners used for house fram-
ing and similar heavy-duty tasks. Box nails
have a similar design but are made from a

smaller wire gauge to reduce splitting. Both
casing and finishing nails are meant to be
countersunk with a nail set.
Galvanized Vs. Stainless 
Galvanizing is the usual cost-effective
approach to stopping rust, but under that
protective layer is a steel fastener that’s eager
to rust. If the zinc coating is damaged dur-
ing installation or by later chemical attack,
you’ll start seeing rusty streaks. Stainless
steel fasteners have rust resistance that isn’t
just skin deep. Stainless steel screws are a
relatively common hardware store item, but
stainless steel finishing nails and brads are
more difficult to find.
Brads and Escutcheon Pins 
Brads and escutcheon pins are the smallest
driven fasteners that you’re likely to
encounter. Brads look like miniaturized fin-
ishing nails, and you can find them in most
hardware stores in 1⁄2-in. to 11⁄2-in. sizes.
To minimize split-
ting, drive cut nails
with the wedge
shape parallel to the
wood’s grain. Four
cut-nail shapes are
(left to right): the
rose-head common
nail, box nail, fine
finish, and brad.
The usual diameter is 17 gauge (0.0540 in.)
to 18 gauge (0.0475 in.).
But even these small diameters can split
tiny molding, especially if you try to drive
the fastener too close to an edge. In some
cases, you’ll have to drill pilot holes, forming
a makeshift “bit” by snipping the head off a
same-gauge brad that’s 1 in. or longer, then
chucking it into your drill. This bit actually
burns a hole instead of drilling it in the
usual sense. You can use brads in a “hold-
and-remove” role in glued assemblies by
leaving the head proud of the surface, then
pulling out the brads after the glue dries.
Grab the brad with locking needle-nose pli-
ers and pull straight out.
Escutcheon pins are meant to be seen.
These little fasteners are usually round head-
ed and are often supplied when you purchase
hardware such as keyhole plates. Take a few
moments to drill pilot holes. The alternative
could be a frustrating search for an
escutcheon pin to replace one bent by a
glancing hammer blow.

Pneumatic Guns
Pneumatic tools can make your work faster,
easier, and more accurate. But they also add
an element of danger that demands respect.
In fact, you should treat every nail gun as
you would a loaded firearm. Never point it
at anyone, keep all body parts away from the
line of fire, and follow the manufacturer’s
directions for loading fasteners and clearing
jams. Obviously, keep your hands well away
from the muzzle of the gun.
Hammers and Nail Sets 
When you’re dealing with small moldings
and tiny fasteners like brads and escutcheon
pins, you need to change the scale of your
tools to match the task. The Warrington-
pattern hammer has a wedged head that hits
the steel nail instead of your fingernail. Get
the nail started with the finger-saving end,
then switch to the business end. A relatively
recent upgrade to the traditional nail set is
the addition of color-coded grips. This
seemingly small improvement adds several
benefits: The grip prevents rolling, absorbs

size. The Japanese-design nail set doesn’t set
small-diameter fasteners as well, but the off-
set design of its second point allows access
in tight quarters.
Screws 
You can buy screws with a variety of head
styles to meet specific project needs and can
often select the fastener with your favorite
drive system. Here’s a quick rundown on the
uses for the most popular types.
• Flat-head screws are probably the most
common style and are used in a wide vari-
ety of applications, from general construc-
tion to fastening tiny hinges. The head is
typically flat with the surface of the wood,
or it can be driven into the bottom of a
counterbore and concealed with a plug. It’s
Lighten up on your pounding tools to drive brads or
escutcheon pins. The 31⁄2-oz. Warrington hammer com-
bines ample power with plenty of control. The 3⁄4-in.-dia.
head of the midget hammer is another finger saver.
• Drive the fastener through the thinner
board into the thicker one.
• When possible, choose a fastener
that’s three times longer than the
thickness of the board being fastened.
For example, if you’re screwing on a
1⁄4-in. plywood cabinet back, use 3⁄4-in.
screws.
• Countersink nails 1⁄32 in. below the
wood’s surface; flat-head screws
should be flush with the surface of the
wood or set into counterbores and
plugged.

also the right choice to use with finishing
washers.
• Oval-head screws mount with their
smooth top just above the wood’s surface.
This gives a decorative look and also pre-
vents the snags produced by flat-head
screws that aren’t fully countersunk. The
oval head finds extensive use holding trim
to boats.
• Trim-head screws look like finishing nails
and can be used wherever you need the
holding power of a screw but also require
an unobtrusive look.
• Pan-head screws have a flat surface under
the head that improves holding power
when you mount hardware such as drawer
slides. Using a screw diameter smaller than
the mounting hole in the hardware gives
you some adjustability.
• Round-head screws have the same flat sur-
face under the head as a pan head but fea-
ture a higher domed profile that can be
used as a decorative feature.
• Washer-head screws give you the broad-
ened holding strength of a washer under a
screw head but without the inconvenience
of purchasing and handling a separate
piece of hardware. By spreading the pres-
sure, the washer-head screw avoids concen-
trated stresses that could crack plastics or
damage thin wood products.
• Truss-head screws feature an even larger
washer surface for improved holding power.
Truss heads are excellent for attaching false
drawer fronts—the large head hides an
oversized hole that permits adjustment.
Truss heads also provide excellent holding
power when driven through the thin ply-
wood backs of wall-mounted cabinets.
• Finishing washers give a neat appearance
and improved holding power when used in

Follow This Thread of Thought 
Here are some of the screw-thread patterns
that you’re likely to encounter, but you also
need to be aware that various companies
may use different terminology to describe
their products. View actual samples, if possi-
ble, or study catalog illustrations carefully to
make sure that you get the fastener you
want:
• Rolled thread (also called deep-thread pat-
tern): This style is manufactured by slim-
ming the screw’s shank (in comparison to
the cut-thread pattern wood screw).
Excellent all-purpose design for solid
wood, plywood, medium-density fiber-
board (MDF), and other manufactured
panels.
• Cut thread (also called tapered wood
thread): This is the traditional wood-screw
pattern, which mimics the old-fashioned
process of cutting the threads into a metal
rod. The unthreaded portion of the shank
is the same diameter as the major diameter
of the threaded portion, and the root diam-

eter tapers to the tip. The thread depth is
consistent along the length of the screw,
even in the tapered portion, accentuating
the pointed appearance. Good holding
power in solid wood.
• Wood-screw thread: The thread design is
similar to the deep-thread pattern but
formed on a thicker shank. This design is
often used on relatively soft materials such
as brass or silicon bronze screws. Use this
pattern instead of the deep thread when
your project requires brass or bronze screws.
• Double lead: This pattern uses two threads
around the shank for increased driving
speed, is commonly used on drywall screws,
and sometimes has a high/low design.
Pullout resistance is not as good as the
deep-thread design, but you’ll gain faster
assembly times, especially when you’re using
long screws.

When everything is working just right, driving
screws can be a fast and efficient assembly technique.
But when a bit chews a Phillips-drive recess into a
powdery mass, you’ve got trouble. And when a screw
refuses to budge from a rocking chair you want to
restore, you start to realize why the previous owner
put a bargain price tag on it. Here are four techniques
that back out stubborn screws and get your project
headed forward again.
If the head of the fastener is relatively intact, try
adding a drop or two of one of the liquids sold to
improve screw-to-driver traction (A). The thick formu-
lation puts a gritty substance
between the metal parts, filling gaps
and reducing slippage. You can use
this technique with any style of head
recess. If you can’t easily locate a
source for one of these specialty
products, try valve-grinding com-
pound purchased from an auto parts
store.
If you don’t use the right clutch
setting on your driver, overdriven
screw threads can act like the blades of a kitchen
blender, quickly turning softwood or MDF into a fluff
with nearly zero holding power. But when you put
your driver into reverse, you’ll also discover that you
can’t get any bite that will let you back out the screw.
When you find yourself in that situation, reach for a
spring steel tool (B) that will gently pull back on the
screw while you run the driver bit in reverse. You’ll
get enough lift to remove the screw completely or at
least grab it with another tool.
If the drive recess is chewed up, try a screw
remover. The type shown in photo C will work in a
hand driver with a 1⁄4-in. hex shank or in a variable-
speed driver set in reverse. Run the driver at an
extremely slow speed to maximize torque. At first, 
the remover may throw out tiny chips of metal as its
edges bite into the fastener. If the screw is stubborn,
apply more downward pressure, and tilt the tool 5 to
10 degrees off vertical.
Grabbing a screw with locking-grip pliers (D) may
not be an elegant solution, but it’s highly effective.
Anticipate that the pliers might slip, and keep your
knuckles out of harm’s way.

• Tapping thread: Although this is some-
times called a “wood-tapping” screw, it is
basically a sheet-metal design. Typically the
threads extend from tip to head. Sheet-
metal screws are generally manufactured to
a higher standard than ordinary wood
screws. Be sure to drill an adequate body
hole in the first board to prevent a jacked
joint.
Power Up for Screw Driving 
Driving screws with a regular drill, even one
with variable-speed control, can be an iffy
proposition. You have to get up enough
speed to turn the fastener, then shut down
and let the screw coast into place. If you
shut down too soon, the screw sits proud of
the surface; too late, and the driver snaps
your wrist or the fastener. A driver/drill with
a variable clutch is a much better solution:
The clutch stops driving the screw when it
reaches a preset torque level. The next step
up is the screw gun, a tool engineered
exclusively for driving screws with speed,
accuracy, and consistency. In addition to the
variable clutch, it has a second clutch system
that engages when you put pressure against
the bit, so you’re not constantly cycling the
motor on and off. It’s a tool that stands up
to the rigors of all-day use, even in a trade as
fastener intensive as hanging drywall.
When Good Fasteners Go Bad
Here’s a quick troubleshooting guide that
will help you overcome common problems
when driving screws.
• If a screw snaps when you’re driving it,
drill a larger pilot hole. Sometimes as little
as a 1⁄64-in. increase in bit size makes a big
difference in the ease of driving screws.
• To keep delicate brass screws from snap-
ping, drill the pilot hole, and drive a steel
screw that has the same diameter and
thread pattern as your brass fastener. Back
out the steel screw, and drive the brass one
into the threads you preformed in the
wood.
• If your driver chews up the fastener’s head,
inspect the drive bit. If it shows any signs
of wear, junk it. Also try a larger pilot hole.
• A common mistake is driving a fastener
too deeply. When you do that, you lose a
considerable amount of strength. For
example, if you drive a screw halfway
through a piece of 3⁄4-in. plywood, the
holding power at that point is equivalent
to a properly driven screw in 3⁄8-in.
plywood.
• Some people really like using lubricants on
screw threads, so if you’re in that group, I’d
recommend Lloyd’s Akempucky. It’s easy
to use and fun to pronounce. But person-
ally, I’ve always considered lubricants as a
The screw gun (top) can drive cabinet-assembly screws
all day without complaining, but it’s not designed to
drive hardware-attachment screws. The variable clutch
collar on the cordless drill (bottom) lets you dial the
right torque for a wide variety of tasks.

Pocket-hole assembly screws (first three from left) come in

Confirmat screw and its specialty bit are at right.
Compare the ordinary screw

and you’ll see the distinctive
undercut head design that can
help ensure better-fitting hinge
installations.
Preforming the threads in the wood with
a steel screw will prevent damage or
breakage to brass screws.

time-consuming nuisance. To me, it’s easi-
er to simply drill a pilot hole sized for easi-
er driving. If you insist on a lubricant, be
aware that it could cause problems when
you apply a finish to the wood.
Special Screws
Screws used for pocket-hole assembly are
typically a square-drive sheet-metal design
with a self-drilling tip. Choose the coarse-
thread design for softwoods and manufac-
tured panels, and use the fine-thread pattern
in hardwoods. The Spax screw is one brand
in a new style of  “do everything” screw that
is supposed to fasten solid lumber, manufac-
tured panels, drywall, sheet metal, and even
anchor masonry. The Confirmat screw,
shown in the bottom photo with its special
bit, is engineered for improved holding
power in plywood, MDF, and other manu-
factured panels. Precise drilling with the
Confirmat bit is mandatory.
I’m sure this has happened to you. You
check the fit of a screw into its countersink
in the hinge leaf and it looks fine. But when
you drive the screw into the pilot hole, the
head won’t pull down flush with the leaf as it
did during the test fit. You try cursing the
hinge for a while, but the screw still doesn’t
fit. The problem occurs under the head of
the screw, where you can’t see it. As shown
in the photo above left, a screw usually raises
a curl of wood fibers as the threads enter the
wood. The countersunk screw head was sup-
posed to completely fill the recess in the
hinge leaf, but the curl got there first. So the
screw sits higher than it should. But if you
switch to a specialty hinge screw, its under-
cut head leaves room for the raised wood, so
the screw’s surface is flush with the hinge.

DRILLING & COUNTERSINKING
Nails and Screws

Drilling Holes 
Drilling holes for screws can require a number of
bits and setups. You need the pilot hole for the
threads, a hole for the body of the screw, a coun-
tersink for a flat-head screw, plus a counterbore
if you want to cover the head of the screw with
a plug. You can speed and simplify your work by
using a bit that’s designed to handle all of these
operations. One style of bit (A) allows you to use
a setscrew to adjust the length of the drill to
match the screw. If you find that the setscrew
loosens during use, get some liquid thread-lock-
ing compound at your auto parts store.
The style of bit in the next photo (B) is more
sophisticated in several ways. The length of the
bit adjusts to match the screw, and you can set
the lower stop collar to limit the depth of a coun-
terbore to a specific measurement. In addition,
the drill itself is tapered to match the profile of
cut-thread wood screws. One additional benefit
of this style is that each locking collar has two
setscrews for added holding strength and
dependability.
Drill collars are made in inch and metric sizes to
fit many sizes of bits. Use a light touch as the
collar approaches the wood instead of forcing it
against the stock (C). Excessive pressure can
make the collar slip further upward at each hole
until you’ve lost the accuracy this accessory

is one of my personal favorites because it’s 
fast, easy to set, incredibly inexpensive, and it
even sweeps away the chips when I reach the
correct depth.

Rapid-change bit holders can be a real conven-
ience if you choose the right one, but to do that
you need to understand your options. Some
holders work strictly by magnetism, whereas 
collared varieties are typically designed to hold
either ball-detent drivers (top in D) or the wire-
detent style (bottom). Some drivers combine
mechanical holding with magnetic power that
holds both the bit and the screw you’re driving. 
If you put the wrong style of bit into some hold-
ers, the bit may either fall out or be trapped
almost permanently. To discover which style of
bit your driver will handle, look down its shaft.
The driver at left in photo (E) has a ball that
engages ball-detent bits and won’t hold the wire
style. You can clearly see the retracting wire
mechanism in the driver at right. This particular
driver will also hold ball-detent bits.

Countersinking 
The standard countersink angle for modern wood
screws and machine screws is 82 degrees (A),
and it’s no coincidence that this is the angle
you’ll find on most countersink bits. So the vast
majority of the time you’ll never have a problem
countersinking a fastener. But every so often
you’ll encounter a screw that’s engineered with a
different angle, such as 90 degrees, and if you
mismatch a fastener and countersink, you’ll have
trouble. 
You’ll find that hardware sometimes needs a bit
of modification to improve the fit of the fasten-
ers. For example, if the screws of a hinge stand
slightly proud of the leaf, you can use a counter-
sink to remove excess metal (B). The countersink
shown in photo A has a 5⁄8-in. diameter and seven
cutting flutes for rapid and smooth cutting in
wood or metal—the distributor calls it “chatter-
free.” Each flute is responsible for removing only
a tiny bit of material on each rotation, accounting
for its steady running. 
The next two styles of countersinks can also be
used on either wood or metal. The five-flute
countersink shown at left in photo C will cut a
countersink that’s up to 3⁄4 in. in diameter: big
enough for fasteners that you’d have to lift with
both hands. The next two countersinks use a
shearing cutting action that’s very smooth and
easy to control. One edge of the smaller hole in
this style of countersink has a honed edge that
cuts away the material. Shavings exit through the
larger hole. 
Using a single tool to drill the pilot, body hole,
countersink, and counterbore is a real conven-
ience. The two styles shown in photo D are fast
and accurate. The bit shown at right utilizes a

brad-point drill to give you pinpoint accuracy. In
addition, it snaps in and out of a ball-detent 
driver so you can quickly switch from drilling to
driving.
If you really want fine control, try a hand counter-
sink. The set shown in photo E is inexpensive but
rugged. It has a 90-degree angle, so it’s not your
everyday countersink, but it’s handy to have
around when you run across a fastener that
needs that angle.
Here’s a quick way to check whether you’ve
drilled the countersink deeply enough—without
driving the screw (F). Drill the body hole and
countersink, and invert a screw into the counter-
sink. When the countersink is the correct depth,
the rim of the screw head will be flush with the
wood, as shown by the screw on the right in the
photo.

Assembling a Face Frame
with Pocket Screws 
Begin by ripping your stock to width and cutting
all the pieces to length. For the best results, the
edges of the stock and the end cuts must be
square (A). I usually do most of the sanding prior
to assembly to minimize cross-grain sanding
scratches. Identify the face of each part with a
piece of masking tape, then mark the relation-
ship of the parts to each other on the tape. I like
to use the time-tested triangle marking system.
As a rule of thumb, always drive the screw
through the end grain of one piece and into the
long grain of the other piece because long grain
holds a screw better than end grain.
Adjust the stop collar on the drill bit to the cor-
rect length for the stock you’re using, and make
certain that the setscrew is snug (B). Clamp a
rail into the jig, and drill the pocket holes using a
corded drill running at full speed (C). This jig
offers the choice of three different hole locations
to suit various stock widths. I cover the unused
hole with a strip of tape to prevent mistakes. To
clear the chips, keep the drill running when you
exit the hole. Double-check the stop-collar depth
setting by driving a test screw into one hole and
gauging its projection against the thickness of
the rail (D). There should be a minimum of 1⁄8 in.
between the tip of the screw and the face of
the stile.
The assembly clamp supplied with the jig helps
to keep the faces of the rails flush, even if they
are slightly different in thickness (E). Position the
large pad on the face of the joint, and align the

edge of the rail flush with the end of the stile.
Using a driver with an adjustable clutch, drive the
assembly screws (F). You should also have a
hand driver available for small adjustments. The
joint may temporarily separate while you’re driv-
ing the first screw in each joint but should close
completely when that screw fully seats itself. If
you add a bar clamp along the joint, you’ll prevent
the temporary separation during assembly. 
When I’m working on a complex face frame, I
assemble its perimeter first, then add the inter-
mediate rails and stiles. To ensure precise dimen-
sions, I use a spacer block to set the distance
between a fixed part and the piece I’m adding
(G). With a little practice, you can make joints
that require no additional sanding. But if you do
have a slightly misaligned joint, you can quickly
erase minor misalignment on the face by using a
random-orbit sander (H). You’ll find wood plugs in
a variety of species and plastic plugs in several
colors to fill the pocket holes (I). The tip of the
mini jig has a small recess that helps you push a
glued plug into place. Let the glue dry for a wood
plug, trim it flush, and sand it smooth. If you’re
using a plastic plug, simply glue it in place after
applying the finish to the wood.
VARIATION To use the mini jig on stock
that is 3⁄4 in. thick, clamp its end flush with
the end of the rail and drill. Adapt it to
other stock thicknesses bby moving its end
forward or back and resetting the stop col-
lar on the drill bit. With the mini jig,, the
face clamp, and the drill bit, you have a
complete pocket-hole system that’s small
enough to fit iinto the corner of your tool-
box or even into a tool belt for job-site
work.

Removing Broken Screws 
Trying to dig a broken screw out of a board with
a chisel is an extremely efficient way to nick the
cutting edge and create a huge scar in the wood.
The next time you break a screw, save your chis-
els and your lumber by using a screw remover. 
Create a guide jig from 3⁄4-in.-thick scrap approxi-
mately 11⁄2 in. by 4 in. (A).
Position the guide jig over the broken screw so
that the guide is approximately centered around
the broken screw, and hold the guide firmly or
clamp it in place. Chuck the tubular screw extrac-
tor into your drill chuck, but be careful not to over-
tighten because that could crush the tool. If your
drill utilizes a chuck key, lightly tighten at all three
holes to equalize the pressure. Put the drill into
reverse, and drill 1⁄4 in. deep to establish a stable
groove, ensuring that the bit does not skate
across the surface (B).
Continue drilling without the drill guide to the full
depth of the screw. Withdraw the bit from the
hole often to clear away chips that could overheat
the tool. When you think you’ve gone far enough,
mark a line on the bit and withdraw it (C). Use
the broken screw as a guide to the necessary
depth of bit penetration. By subtracting the
amount of screw left from the original length, you
can determine how deeply to drill.
Use a small, slotted screwdriver to break free the
core containing the broken screw (D).
Glue a 3⁄8-in. dowel into the hole, wipe away
excess glue, and trim it flush. If the dowel fits too
tightly, crimp it with a pair of pliers (E).
When you drill the pilot hole for the replacement
screw, be sure to use a larger bit than you did the
first time.

f you’re the kind of person who has a
tough time deciding at the 31-flavor ice
cream store, then a first glance at the
number of available hinge choices could
send your brain into total overload. But
before you despair, consider the fact that
most hinges are engineered for very specific
applications. So in some ways, hinge selec-
tion is a process of elimination. By defining
the exact use for your hinge, you can ignore
entire categories.
Butt Hinges 
The butt hinge is probably the simplest and
most familiar type of hinge. But a closer
look reveals that even this most basic device
holds a surprising number of engineering
subtleties.
Referring to the drawing at right on the
facing page, you’ll see that the hinge consists
of two leaves that usually have countersunk
holes drilled for flat-head wood screws.
Along the center axis, the leaves bulge to
form interlocking knuckles. The row of
knuckles is called the barrel, and a hole
through the barrel accepts the pin. The paint
clearance slot keeps the knuckles from rub-
bing against each other and provides room
for a decorative coating or clear protective
finish. Pitch refers to the length of a pair of
mating knuckles.
End play isn’t the result of sloppy manu-
facturing—modern machinery allows facto-
ries to produce even inexpensive hinges with

astonishing precision. But generally, you’ll
find more end play in hinges designed for
utility-type applications because this clear-
ance allows a hinge to operate even if the
ends of the leaves are not perfectly flush.
In addition, end play allows you to easily
disassemble and reassemble hinges with
loose pins. In high-end hinges designed for
jewelry boxes, you’ll find absolutely minimal
end play.
The first thing you need to know about
butt hinge geometry is that its center of
rotation is located at the middle of its pin.
So it stands to reason that this point must
be located beyond the back edge of the box
or the face of a door. Anything past the tini-
est fraction of an inch will allow the hinge
to work, and adding more projection is a
matter of aesthetics and controlling the arc
of motion (see the drawing above).
Of course, when you mount hinges on the
surface of a box or door, you automatically
position the hinge pin in a location where it
can operate. But when you mortise a hinge,
you’ll need to make certain that the pin’s
centerpoint is always out in the open.

Preventing Bound Hinges
Bound hinges are those that prevent a box
lid or door from closing completely. This
condition often results from initially hinging
a lid so that the base and lid make contact
all around. But then the wood expands, and
the front edge of the box gapes open in an
ugly sneer. The drawing above shows a prac-
tical solution. Here it is recognized that the
lid may develop a gap, so its location is con-
trolled by concealing it at the rear of the box.
To prevent bound hinges when you use
surface-mounted hinges, simply place a
spacer between the base and lid at the back
of the box before fastening the hinges. You’ll
get the same result with mortised hinges by
making the mortise not quite as deep as the
diameter of the hinge’s barrel.
Setting the Mortise Depth 
Another useful fact about the geometry of a
butt hinge is that the depth of the mortise is
governed by the diameter of the barrel, not
by the thickness of the leaf. This assumes
that you’re working with hinges that have
flat (unswaged) leaves. Swaging alters the
relationship between leaf thickness and bar-
rel diameter, and that changes the mortise
depth required.
There are two different ways to mortise
the hinges—you can cut half-depth mortises
in both the base and lid, or a full-depth
mortise in the box’s base. Checking a test
cut for a full-depth mortise is as easy as veri-
fying that it is just short of burying the
hinge’s knuckle. For half-depth mortises,

make two test cuts, and hold them face to
face with the barrel of the hinge in the mid-
dle. If the test boards close completely, the
hinges will be bound—the front edge of the
lid won’t meet the base. Decrease the depth
and make another pair of test cuts.
Butt Hinge Variations 
The butt hinge has evolved into an extraor-
dinary number of forms to suit a wide range
of applications. With the leaves stretched in
width, the butt hinge becomes a strap hinge.
Stretched in length, it becomes a piano
hinge. The leaves can also be flanged—bent
around the back of a door, a face frame, or
the edge of a box to offer additional
strength. If you want a hinge that’s as easy
to install as a surface mount but hides nearly
as well as a mortised version, try a no-mor-
tise hinge. The thickness of the metal auto-
matically sets the reveal between the door
and its frame.
For reasons of both aesthetics and func-
tion, the shape of a hinge isn’t restricted to
the familiar rectangular shape. You’ll find
Three no-mortise hinge varieties meet spe-
cial applications. The hinge shown at left is

sion in center attaches to the edge and back
of a face frame; and the flanged hinge at

hinges with leaves in fanciful shapes, as
round as a bullet, or stretched with rounded
ends. An elongated double-pinned hinge is
often used for a folding card-table top, and
the familiar butler’s tray hinge has a built-in
spring.

The butt hinge shape has changed, but the
performance remains. This round hinge hits
a bull’s eye in both style and function.
Separating hinges can be very useful, and
they are scaled to handle a wide range of
jobs—whether you want to build a sturdy
toolbox or a dainty jewelry container. Either
way, you can make a removable lid that
allows unrestricted access to the contents.
The larger sizes can also be used on cabinet
doors or clock cases. Plan your project care-
fully because many of the hinge designs
require you to specify right- or left-hand
application when you order.
The barbed hinge is nearly an exact oppo-
site of the separating hinge. Once you install
a barbed hinge, removal is nearly impossible
without destroying the wood. The barbed
hinge is inexpensive, but installation requires
you to use a specialty sawblade chucked into
your drill press. The hinge is widely used for
production runs of small boxes.
Hinges That Hold Their Own 
Many box hinges require you to add a sepa-
rate support to hold the lid open for easy
access. Other hinges, though, build the sup-
port right into the body of the hinge, elimi-
nating the need for additional hardware. The
hinge usually holds the lid open at about a

hinges that you can surface mount or mor-
tise. Or choose from styles of butt hinges
that you put into a traditional mortise, let
into the back of the box and lid, or surface
mount for utility applications. Side rail
hinges and quadrant hinges are two other
lid-supporting choices. The quadrant hinge
requires a mortise in both the back and end
of the box’s lid and base. In addition, you’ll
need to excavate a channel into the base for
the quarter-circle stop arm that gives this
hinge style its name. You’ll have a much eas-
ier time installing the side rail hinge—sim-
ply rout mating mortises in the base and lid.
Specialty Hinges 
The barrel hinge is virtually invisible when
closed, and it also has the advantage of easy
installation because the mortise is simply a
hole drilled into each workpiece. But there
are a few disadvantages. A slight mismatch
in hole locations will make the hinge’s oper-
ation very difficult, while a larger error will
make installation itself downright impossi-
ble. But a more serious drawback is the fact
that it will not overclose—move past the
point where the axis of the lid hole meets
the axis of the base hole. As a result, you
can’t get the lid of a box to close firmly
against the base at the front. This drawback
is not as serious if you’re using the hinge to
swing an inset door.
To the right of the barrel hinge in the
bottom photo at right is another invisible
hinge that nearly everyone refers to by its
brand name: Soss. Installation requires a
two-level mortise, but a jig and bushing-
guided router make its production certain
and relatively fast. This hinge does overclose,
and it’s also self-revealing—a term I use to

consistent gap between the edge of a door
and its frame. You can purchase Soss hinges
in several sizes, and the largest one can be
used to hang architectural doors with no
hardware visible from either side when the
door is closed.
The miniature barrel hinge installs into a
5-mm hole drilled into the base and lid of
small boxes and pen presentation cases. You
then chamfer both pieces so the tip of each
cut meets the centerline of the holes. The
mating chamfers provide operating clearance
as well as a stop mechanism. A drop of
epoxy wiped onto the walls of the holes 
with a toothpick grips the hinges. It’s an
inexpensive hinge, a highly desirable virtue
for hardware used in producing large batches
of boxes.
The four-way hinge gets its name from
the number of door-positioning options it
offers: inset, half overlay, overlay, and mitered
corners. It opens 175 degrees to get the doors
well out of the way if you want to operate
pullout shelves. It’s a solid handful of steel
that’s suitable for heavy-duty applications.
Euro Hinges  
It wasn’t that long ago that the overlay hinge
was the undisputed king of kitchen and bath
cabinets. To order the hinges you needed,
you simply counted the number of doors and
multiplied by two. But the old hinge king
has lost his throne and been replaced by a
new group of hinges from Europe. Instead
of a single hinge, the new dynasty is actually
an extended family of hinges, each one engi-
neered for a specialized purpose. Even a
small kitchen may have a half-dozen or
more different hinge varieties.
Almost all Euro hinges are completely
concealed when the door is closed. That
makes a cabinet that’s cleaner, both physical-
ly and visually. And because the hinges are
hidden, their style or finish can’t go out of
fashion. Most hinges also have three-way
adjustability, a feature that transforms door
fitting from an exercise in “close enough” to
micrometer precision. The hinges have also
created new options that let the creative
designer unleash his imagination. You can
now select between face-frame or frameless
construction, inset or overlay doors, and cab-
inets that angle inward or out.

Despite all of the advantages of Euro
hinges, there a few lingering disadvantages.
Many home woodworkers fear that the sys-
tem will require the purchase of several
pieces of specialized machinery, each one the
size and cost of a car. And even small-shop
professionals who recognize the time-and
labor-saving potential are overwhelmed by
the enormous variety of hinges. But with
some knowledge and a few jigs, even a budget-
minded weekend woodworker can reap the
advantages of the Euro hinge system.
One caution—you can considerably com-
plicate matters for yourself if you choose
hinges from several different manufacturers.
Installation specifications will vary, and you’re
unlikely to find interchangeable mounting
plates—a fact that will transform the usual
nightmare of inventory into a true living hell.
Developing brand loyalty with a single man-
ufacturer’s line will simplify your life.
Install the hinge shown at left by drilling pilot holes for
two screws; the center hinge requires pressing bush-
ings into holes, then tightening the screws. Press in the
ringed plastic hinge cup at right, and then drill a screw
pilot hole through the flange at its lip.  
Hinge-mounting plates include (top left) a plate with
vertical adjustment slots; a plate (top right) with an inte-
gral screw that moves it up and down; a post plate
(lower left) that mounts to the rear of a face frame; and
a plate (lower right) with pins that expand as you press
down levers.

EURO HINGE CHOICES
Choices, Choices, Choices 
If you’re accustomed to having only a hand-
ful of hinge choices, you may be shocked
when you see the options offered by Euro
hinges. For example, take a fairly simple
hinge, such as a hinge that opens 125
degrees on a frameless cabinet. You can
choose whether you want the door to overlay
the cabinet’s edge, whether two doors are
hinged on the same cabinet support, or
whether the door is inset. Then you choose
between free-swinging or self-closing
hinges. Next, you select whether the hinge
clips onto the mounting plate or attaches
with screws. Then, there are up to four alter-
nate ways of attaching the hinge cup to
the door.

The design of each hinge sets its boring

to place the hinges relative to the top and

to use. There are no absolute answers to
either question, but you can use the fol-
lowing guidelines:
• Keep the top and bottom hinges close to

• Consult the chart at right for suggested

of any items stored on the door. When in
doubt, add another hinge.

SURFACE-MOUNTED HINGES

Simple Box Hinge 
If you like the idea of quick and easy hardware
installation, you’ll love using surface-mounted
hinges. There’s no complicated routing and chis-
eling—just great-looking results in a hurry. In this
example, I started with a vintage box that’s
nicely made but suffers from bound hinges so
that the front of the box gapes open (A).
Whether repairing an old box or hinging a new
one, the steps are the same.
Put four thicknesses of self-adhesive notepaper
(Post-It is one brand) between the base and lid,
positioning the spacers near the ends of the box
so they won’t interfere with hinge placement.
Carefully align the edges and ends of the base
and lid, and tape them together using package
sealing tape or masking tape (B).
Tip the box onto its front face so you can lay the
hinges in position. Move the hinges side to side
to let your eyes judge the best location. When
you’re satisfied with the placement, carefully
position one hinge, centering the barrel along the
gap at the back of the box (C). If you’re uncom-
fortable visually aligning the hinge, you can posi-
tion it with a try square. Drill the pilot holes and
drive the screws, but keep checking as you work
to make certain that the base and lid remain
flush. Repeat the process for the other hinge,

Strap Hinge
Strap hinges add authentic styling to rustic furni-
ture, and with a few installation tips, you’ll get
great results fast. I feel that the rustic look is
enhanced by relatively large hinge gaps instead
of the tight spacing you’d probably use on more
tailored furniture, so I put some 1⁄8-in. plywood
spacers between the pieces (A). Make a pencil
mark at the centerpoint of the end hole in one
leaf. Put a short piece of masking tape about
1⁄4-in. past the tip of each hinge leaf, and remove
the hinge. 
Place a framing square so that it aligns with the
pencil mark, and use a utility knife to scribe a line
between the pieces of masking tape (B). This
overshot cutline will mimic the mark a country
cabinetmaker might have used to align a hinge.
Replace the hinge, and use the pencil mark and
scribed line to position it.
There were no screws furnished with this hinge,
so I had to give some ordinary fasteners the
antique treatment. Temporarily drive slotted (not
Phillips) screws into the end of the scrap board to
hold them for filing and painting. The photo (C)
shows how an ordinary screw (left) is faceted
with a file (center) and then spray-painted flat
black (right) for a vintage look. Drill pilot holes for
the screws, and drive them to secure the hinge
(D). The installed hinge (E) is strong, functional,
and has the styling appropriate to its use.

No-Mortise Hinge 
A no-mortise hinge is a fast and efficient way to
hang inset cabinet doors, producing an even
reveal between carcase and door on the hinge
side. By using the easy jig shown in this demon-
stration, you’ll also help ensure consistent
reveals at the top and bottom of the door. As
you’ll see, the finished height of the door is
equal to the opening in the carcase minus the
thickness of two mending plates.
To make the jig, simply cut a block of scrap wood
that equals the length of the hinge, and screw a
1⁄16-in.-thick mending plate to one end. Of course,
you can cut the block any length you wish.
Making it equal the length of the hinge merely
follows a common rule of thumb for hinge place-
ment (A). Make sure that the screw is fully seat-
ed in the countersink. Hook the plate over the
end of the door, and register the barrel of the
hinge against the face of the door. Drill pilot
holes, and drive the screws into the holes in the
hinge leaf that have the countersinks visible.
Move the jig to the carcase, and set a spare
hinge atop it and with the barrel against the edge
of the carcase (B). The hinge will be backward in
this position, so drill pilot holes in the leaf that
has its countersunk holes toward the side of the
carcase. A self-centering bit makes this an easy
and accurate job. 
Move the hinged door to the carcase, and drive
the screws to complete the installation (C).
When the door is closed, you’ll enjoy the appear-
ance of even spaces surrounding the door (D).

Overlay Hinge 
When an overlay hinge spring is in an unloaded
position (before installation), the leaf that mounts
to the frame pulls the door leaf toward it. See
the end view in (A). So when you screw down
the hinge, the spring makes the door move away
from the mounting point. Inserting a small piece
of plastic laminate near the hinge loads up the
hinge enough so that the frame leaf is flat
against a reference surface. The installation
photo (B) indicates where the laminate is placed.
It also shows the traditional spacing for overlay
hinges: one leaf width from the end of the door.
Hold the hinge’s leaf against the pencil mark and
the knuckles against the edge of the door while
you drill pilot holes in two of the slots in the
leaf. Use two flat-head screws to attach the
hinge leaf. 
The usual overlay for kitchen cabinet doors is
3⁄8 in. The face frame of this cabinet has rails and
stiles that are 2 in. wide, so rip a plywood strip 
15⁄8 in. wide, and place it flush with the bottom rail
(C). That way, when you rest the doors atop the
strip, their lower ends will overhang the opening
by 3⁄8 in. I also wanted a 15⁄8-in. reveal along the
vertical edge of the door, but I set my adjustable
square about 1⁄32 in. larger than that to compen-
sate for a bit of springback when the laminate
shim was removed from the hinge. Drill pilot
holes and drive the pan-head screws to secure
the hinge leaf to the stile. If you need to adjust
the fit of the door side to side, simply loosen the
screws on the backside of the door. When you’re
satisfied (D), drive the third screw into the hinge,
positioning it near the end of the slot to ensure
that the door won’t wiggle out of place.

Mortised Butt Hinge 
A box hinged with mortised butts appears tidy
and effortless. And like many accomplishments,
it looks easy until you try it for yourself. But if
you have a basic knowledge of how a hinge’s
geometry works and then follow a systematic
approach, you’ll get good results with your first
try. Great results come after practice. 
This demonstration shows how to hinge a small
box, but you can adapt this same approach to
hanging a door onto a carcase. In that case, you
simply clamp the spacer between the side of the
carcase and the door.
To properly position the hinge, you need to make
sure that the centerpoint of the hinge pin will be
slightly past the rear edge of the box. To do that,
close the hinge, and measure the distance from
the barrel to the opposite side of the hinge pin
(A). Cut a spacer that is that thickness and at
least as long as the box.
To help ensure that you position the hinges
squarely, measure the distance from the edge of
the hinge’s leaf to the edge of the pin (B). Use a
pencil to transfer this line to masking tape on the
base and lid (C). Center the hinges between
these lines and they will be square. These lines
are for reference only—the spacer determines
the actual positioning of the hinges.
Clamp the spacer between the base and the lid
(D). You’ll probably need to block up the lid to
make it level with the base. Lay out the hinges so
that you’ll install each one identically—one hinge
leaf has an even number of knuckles, and the
other is odd. It doesn’t really matter how you ori-
ent them as long as they are the same.

Carefully position a hinge so that the barrel’s axis
is centered over the spacer, then drill a pilot hole
and screw down one leaf with a single screw. 
Double-check that the hinge is still square to the
box, and secure the other leaf. Secure the other
hinge using the same procedure, then finish
drilling the remaining pilot holes (E). Use a strik-
ing knife or crafts knife to score the wood fibers
along each hinge’s outline (F). Start with light
pressure for the first cut, then slice deeper in a
series of passes. 
Lettering the hinges and the lid lets you quickly
replace each hinge in its home (G).
Remove the hinges and unclamp the parts.
There are two different ways to mortise the
hinges—you can cut a full-depth mortise in the
box’s base, or cut half-depth mortises in both the
base and lid, as I did. When you set the router’s
depth of cut, you’ll also want to create a slight
clearance gap along the back edge of the lid. 
Clamp a scrap board to the box’s outer edge to
prevent tearout and to increase the bearing sur-
face for the router’s baseplate. Rout the mortises
in the base and lid (H). I used a 1⁄8-in. bit in a lami-
nate trimmer, a combination that provides ade-
quate power with excellent control. How close
you dare to rout to the layout lines depends on
your courage, experience, and whether you drink
espresso or decaf. 
To complete the mortises, begin with a vertical
chisel cut at each end (I). Next, put the chisel’s
bevel against the routed bottom of the mortise to
See “Preventing Bound Hinges” and
“Setting the Mortise Depth” on p. 22.

finish removing the waste at the ends. Now you’ll
change tactics because a vertical chisel cut along
the grain could split the delicate wall near the
inside of the box. Use a crafts or utility knife to
deepen that score line with repeated passes.
Finally, remove the waste with the chisel, slicing
along the grain with the bevel down. You already
drilled the pilot holes for the hinges, so the only
thing that remains is screwing the hinges into
place (J). The completed installation has an unob-
trusive look (K). 
You’ll need to install some kind of stop to keep
the box lid from falling over backward.
VARIATION If you want to skip the lid
support, you can use a hinge with a built-
in stop. The geometry of this hiinge is a bit
different from an ordinary butt hinge
because you have to leave the entire hinge
barrell proud of the back of the box so that
it will operate properly. In addition, you
can’t lay it flat to  utilize the method
described above, so you’ll have to rely
strictly on measuring and marking.

try, see “Fixing Hinge Mortise Problems”

Piano Hinge 
To create an easy mortise for a piano hinge, 
simply make the back of the box narrower than
the sides and front. To determine how much
narrower, measure the diameter of the closed
hinge’s knuckle, and subtract 1⁄16 in. (A). That
subtraction will help make sure that the front of
the box always closes neatly. 
When you assemble the box, the narrower back
makes a full-length mortise (B). In this example,
I knocked together a quick plywood carcase to
check the proportions of a blanket chest I’m
designing. 
Mark the cutline on the hinge, and cut it to
length by using a hacksaw with a blade that has
32 teeth per inch (C). Cutting the hinge about 
1⁄16 in. shorter than the mortise will help ensure
that the hinge will be able to move without scrap-
ing against the carcase. Screw the hinge to a
scrap block to ensure that it won’t flex while
you’re cutting. File away any cutting burrs. 
Keep construction simple by planning the size of
the top so that you can mount the hinge flush
with the top’s rear edge. That way, the only meas-
uring involved is centering the hinge end to end.

Template for 
Hinge Mortising 
It’s always a good idea to test the settings of a
jig on scrap stock instead of immediately routing
a completed door or carcase. Once you have the
adjustments dialed in, you’ll be able to move
through your project quickly and confidently.
To allow the hinge to fit easily into the adjustable
template, unscrew the finials (A) or withdraw a
removable pin. Clamp the vertical wood fence of
the jig to your door, and lightly tighten the knobs.
Put the hinge into the opening of the template,
slide the bar snugly against it, and tighten the
knobs (B). To set the width of the mortise, meas-
ure the hinge (C). With the finials on this hinge, I
could bury the hinge only up to the barrel. If your
hinge doesn’t have finials, you can go further.
Transfer this measurement to the edge of the
door (D).
Loosen the knobs under the fence, and move the
jig forward or back until its back edge touches the
width line you marked on the door. Tighten the
knobs, and check for square by measuring the
distance from the edge of the jig to the fence (E).
When the measurements are equal at both ends
of the jig, it is square to the fence and therefore
square to the door.
Loosen the clamps that hold the fence to the
door, and move the edge of the jig’s opening
where you want to install the first hinge. Use a
utility knife to score the wood fibers at each end
of the opening (F). This will help prevent tearout
when you rout the mortise. 
Put the piloted bit (supplied with the jig) into your
router, place the router atop the jig, and hold the

hinge under the jig to set the depth of cut (G).
I set the depth of cut at slightly less than half of
the hinge knuckle’s thickness so that the latch
side of the door would close snugly. 
When you rout the mortise, start with a light
pass along the edge of the door, rout clockwise
around the perimeter of the jig’s opening, and
finally clear out the waste in the center of the
mortise (H). The completed mortise is nearly
ready to receive the hinge (I).
If this test mortise isn’t long enough to accept
the hinge, you can easily fine-tune the fit. Simply
loosen the knobs that hold the sliding bar, and
again place the hinge in the opening. But this
time, add a piece or two of self-stick notepaper
between the end of the hinge and the jig. Try
another test mortise until you have the setting
perfect.
Routing mortises into a carcase follows the same
procedure described above. But bear in mind that
the length of the jig may create a clearance prob-
lem, requiring you to cut the mortises in the car-
case components before assembling them.
VARIATION With this jig from Rockler,
you can purchase inserts that match a
variety of hinges. The insert shown  in 
the photo matches the butler-tray hinge
resting on the jig.

Squaring a Routed 
Hinge Mortise 
Using a template to rout a mortise can be a great
convenience, and if the hinge has radiused cor-
ners, you can immediately install it. But if your
hinge has square corners, you’ll have to do a lit-
tle bit of chisel work. Interestingly, this is one of
the few cases where cutting corners means
making them square instead of rounded.
This technique is fast and easy if you have a razor-
sharp chisel but slow and difficult with a dull tool.
So the first job is to hone your chisel.
With your workpiece securely clamped, register
the backside of your chisel against the end of the
mortise, rock it to extend the line of the mortise,
but don’t overshoot the back wall of the mortise
(A). As the chisel approaches vertical, gently push
downward to deepen the mark. Repeat at the
other end of the mortise.
Switch your attention to the back wall of the mor-
tise. Again, use the register and rock motion to
extend the line (B). But be careful because too
much pressure could make the cut run with the
grain instead of in a straight line. Work back and
forth between the end of the mortise and the
back wall until the lines meet. Hold the chisel ver-
tical at the end of the mortise, and push down to
further deepen the line. Now you can turn the
chisel bevel down and clean out the waste (C). 
VARIATION If you need to clear a lot 
of mortises (or just want a cool tool),
consider a corner chisel. You simpply regis-
ter it against the routed mortise, and light-
ly tap with a hammer to mark a perfectly
squaare corner.Then you use your regular
chisel bevel down to clear the waste.
Some corner chisels are sppring-loaded, but
this one from Lee Valley uses rare earth
magnets to hold the cutter against the
registration block.

Fixing Hinge 
Mortise Problems
Sometimes, you’ll need to fine-tune a hinge mor-
tise to achieve a perfect fit. The lid of the box
shown in the photo (A) hangs over the base—
a dentist would call this an overbite problem.
There are two possible cures—either move the
hinge in the base backward, or move the hinge in
the lid forward. I figured that shimming the back
wall of the base mortise might be more visible,
so I opted to fix the lid.
The size of the overbite indicates the amount that
you’ll need to increase the mortise. Measure or
mentally note this dimension, and remove the lid
from the box. 
Set a cutting gauge to score a line indicating the
new width of the mortise (B) and remove the
waste with a chisel. By placing a sharp chisel on
its side, you can use it like a miniature cabinet
scraper to remove tiny shavings of wood (C). As
you work, you can check your progress by sliding
the lid onto the hinges that are still attached to
the base (D).
You’ll have to plug the old screw holes so you can
attach the hinges in their new positions (E). Cut
or split strips of wood, and glue them into the old
holes. Snap the strips sideways, and clean up any
splinters above the surface of the mortise with
your chisel. Drill new pilot holes, and attach the
hinges to complete the
installation.
VARIATION Sometimes you’ll need to
add a shim to change the depth, width, or
length of a mortise. The photo shows  a
wide range of shopmade and purchased
shim stock: masking tape, chipboard recy-
cled from a cereal boox, index cards, sheet
veneer, handplane shavings, veneer edge-
banding, aluminum foil, sheet brass from
a hobby shop, and metal flashing.

Installing a Passage Door 
The idea of hanging a passage door intimidates
some people, but it’s really not a scary project.
By using a mortising jig, you can set the hinges
quickly and accurately. The Porter-Cable 59370 jig
shown in the photo (A) works for hinges that
range from 21⁄2 in. to 41⁄2 in. in 1⁄2-in. increments.
You can use hinges that have square corners or a
5⁄8-in. radius. Move the spacers to match the size
of hinge you’ll use, and keep the spacers cen-
tered in the opening. For a square-cornered
hinge, you’d swap the spacers end for end. To
install a 41⁄2-in. hinge, you’d omit the spacers. If
you’re hanging a batch of doors, you’ll save time
and possible errors by purchasing three jigs and
attaching them to a 3⁄4-in. plywood upright.
Remove the washerlike plugs from the template,
and use them to secure the duplex (double-
headed) nails to the body of the template (B).
Without these plugs, you’d be constantly juggling
the nails every time you moved the jig.
The bit supplied with the jig has a 1⁄2-in. cutting
diameter and a 5⁄8-in. top bearing. Chuck it into
your router, turn it upside down, and place the
hinge on the jig atop the baseplate (C). Make cer-
tain that the bent (swaged) portions of the hinge
don’t interfere with setting the bit’s depth.
Tape a quarter (D) to the head jamb of the door
and measure downward for the position of the
hinge mortises—7 in. from the top, 11 in. from
the bottom, and the third centered between
those two. Measure all locations from the coin
taped to the head jamb. The quarter establishes
the reveal at the top of the door because when
you transfer the measurements to the door you
simply hook the tape over the end of the door. As
a result, each location will be automatically offset
by the thickness of the quarter.

The side-to-side position of the gauge on the
jamb is dictated by the thickness of the door (E).
Align the ends of the rectangular openings in the
gauge with the edge of the hinge jamb. Tap the
nails to hold the template to the jamb. Align the
top of the hinge opening with the mark on the
jamb, then drive the nails. The lower head of the
duplex nail secures the template firmly. 
To rout the hinge mortise, first make (F) a light
cut along the edge of the jamb. Rout clockwise
around the perimeter of the template, and clear
out the waste in the center. Be sure to hold the
router baseplate flat against the template as you
rout. When you remove the jig, you’ll notice that
the end of the mortise doesn’t meet the pencil
line because the router bit’s cutter is a smaller
diameter than its guide bearing. This doesn’t
make any practical difference as long as you
always position the jig consistently for each cut.
The completed mortise is a very good fit for the
radiused hinge. Simply drill the pilot holes and
drive the screws (G).
VARIATION To help prevent a door from

Knife Hinge 
A knife hinge consists of two leaves—you install
the leaf with the pin to the carcase, and the one
with the hole to the door. With the technique I
developed, you use the leaf with the hole to lay
out the hinge locations in both the door and
carcase. 
You’ll need to rout the hinge’s location in the car-
case before you assemble it. 
This hinge has a pin diameter of 3⁄16 in., and I
wanted to place the hinge’s center of rotation just
past the end of the door. To do that, tape a 7⁄64-in.-
dia. drill bit to the edge of the door, and place its
shank inside the hole of the hinge leaf (A). Hold
the leaf approximately centered in the width of
the door, and use a crafts knife to scribe its end.
Chuck a 3⁄8-in. straight bit into your router, and set
the height of the bit to match the thickness of a
leaf (B). Position your router’s edge guide to cen-
ter the bit in the thickness of the door, and rout
the mortise (C). Clamp a piece of scrap wood to
the edge of the door to help prevent chipout.
Always register the router’s edge guide against
the front of the door—you’ll see why in a
moment. Complete the mortise with a chisel (D).
Drill pilot holes, and attach the leaf (E).
Following the same layout technique you used on
the door, scribe a line on the carcase top and bot-
tom at the end of the leaf (F). You don’t need to
be concerned with the front-to-back position of

the leaf because the router’s edge guide will take
care of that. For a door that’s flush to the front
edge of the carcase, leave the edge guide posi-
tioned as it was when you routed the doors.
Even if it’s not perfectly centered in the door,
the same offset will be transferred to the
carcase, and you’ll get a flush fit. I wanted to set
the door back about 1⁄64 in., so that’s the amount
of distance I added between the router bit and
the edge guide. Rout the mortise into the
carcase (G).
Square the mortise, and screw the pinned hinge
leaf to the carcase (H). To install the door, screw
all of the leaves in place except the top one on
the door. Put the hole of the bottom door leaf
onto its mating pin, and hold the door in its open
position. Gently tilt the top of the door toward
you far enough that you can place the last leaf
onto its pin. Hold it in place with your finger while
you slide the leaf into its mortise.
When you’ve completed the installation (I), the
hinge is barely visible. 
VARIATION To hang an inset cabinet
door, use the L-shaped knife hinge to move
the center of rotation past the frront of the

Round Hinge 
Installing a round hinge requires a bit of careful
setup at the drill press, but once you’ve done
that, the rest of the steps are so fast and easy
you may almost feel guilty that you’ve finished
so quickly.
Begin by putting four thicknesses of self-
adhesive notepaper near the ends between the
base and lid so they won’t interfere with hinge
placement (A).
Carefully align the edges and ends of the base
and lid, and tape them together, using package-
sealing tape or masking tape. Clamp a high fence
to your drill-press table so that the base and lid
cannot move while you’re drilling them. Make
certain that the fence is square to the table.
Decide on the placement of the hinges, and cen-
ter the tip of a 35-mm Forstner bit in the middle
of the base-lid gap.
Drill the hole 1⁄32 in. shallower than the thickness
of the hinge so it will sit slightly proud of the
wood (B). Drop the hinge into the hole, and align
its pin with the joint between the base and lid
(C). Drilling pilot holes and driving the screws
completes the job. You can purchase an optional
stop for the hinge (it’s shown by itself in the cen-
ter and installed on both hinges in photo (E). Use
the longer screw supplied with the stop to install
it atop the bottom half of the hinge. When you
untape the box and open it, you’ll notice that the
tip of the Forstner bit made tiny V-shaped
notches in the base and lid (D). This adds an
interesting detail, and I mention it only so that
you’re not surprised by it.
The completed box (E) has a clean and sophisti-
cated look.

Installing Euro Hinges
Using a jig is a quick way to locate and drill hinge-
cup holes into doors without repetitive measuring.
This economical jig from Rockler is also great for
job-site work where you don’t have access to a drill
press. But a drill press is handy for initial setup of
the jig. Referring to the installation data supplied
by the hinge manufacturer, find the diameter and
depth of the hinge-cup hole, and use your drill
press to drill a hole of those specifications into a
scrap board. In this case, the hole’s diameter is 
35 mm and its depth is 13 mm. Take the scrap
board to your workbench, put the jig plate atop it,
and add the drill assembly. Loosen the stop collar
on the drill (A) and push the bit to the bottom of
the hole, fully compressing the spring. Tighten the
stop collar, and you’re ready to use the jig. Label
the hole in the scrap board, and save it for future
setup reference.
Mark the hinge positions on the door. Make certain
to screw the jig-plate assemblies to the wood
mounts so that you’ll get the required hole setback
from the edge of the door. Assemble the jig by slid-
ing two or more plate assemblies plus an end stop
onto the rail. Adjust the plate assemblies to coin-
cide with the hinge locations, and turn the knobs to
lock the plates and end stop in position. Use the
toggle clamp attached to the wood mount of the
plate assembly to lock the jig onto the door. Chuck
the drill assembly into your drill and engage its rim
onto the plate (B). If you have a substantial number
of holes to drill use a corded drill. Remove the jig
after you drill all the holes. Insert the hinge into the
hole and make certain that its arm is square to the
door (C). Drill pilot holes and drive screws to
secure the hinge.
[ TIP] To drill hinge-cup holes at the drill
press, you can establish the offset by
using a drill bit with a  diameter equal to
the offset. Simply place the bit between
the 35-mm drill bit and the fence (D).

Euro Hinge 
Mounting Plates
If you use a jig to help you drill holes for hinge-
mounting plates, be sure that the jig absolutely
matches the hole pattern in the plate. In addition,
you’ll need to pay attention to the different posi-
tions required for hanging a door in an inset posi-
tion compared to overlay. For example, the
Rockler jig shown in the photo (A) has two ways
that it can be attached to its wood baseplate,
depending on whether you’re using the inset or
overlay position. Strip the brown protective paper
off of the plastic, and position the plastic so that
the scored centerline will be against the cabinet
when the jig is in use. Insert the bolts, and
tighten them.
Mark the centerlines of the hinge locations onto
tape on the inside of the carcase, and place the
jig so its scored line is over the mark (B). Use a
self-centering drill bit to drill pilot holes for the
mounting screws. Strip away the masking tape,
and screw the hinge-mounting plates into posi-
tion (C). With this baseplate, an arrow points to
the front of the carcase to help avoid mistakes.
Snap the arm of the hinge onto the mounting
plate, and adjust the fit of the door. In the photo
(D), the screwdriver is in the screw that will
adjust the amount of overlay. 
By moving this screw by different amounts in the
upper and lower plates, you’ll set the overlay and
level the door. Next, adjust the screw at the top
of the mounting plate to raise or lower the door’s
position. Finally, adjust the screw at the rear end
of the hinge arm to move the door in or out.

VARIATION 1 The photo at right shows
an incredibly well-designed baseplate jig
from Blum. After you mark the centeerline
of the hinge’s location in the carcase, you
position the jig so that the line meets the
apex off the V-shape in the jig. Using a stop
collar to prevent the 5-mm bit from
drilling too deeply, you driill the first hole.
Rotate the jig toward you, and position
the metal pin into the first hole. This re--
centers the jig and ensures perfect hole-
to-hole spacing.
VARIATION 2 The Quick Fix is another
useful Blum jig. The vertical metal channel
holds as many of the orange jigs  as you
wish to use, and you can easily lock them
at any location. The pin at the bottom left
of the jiig registers against the inside 
bottom of the carcase, while the flange at
bottom right holds the dooor at any overlay
or inset you wish to set. Tap the point of
the supplied metal stylus through the jigg’s
holes, and you can mark hinge and mount-
ing-plate positions in doors,
carcases, or even in componeents before
assembly.
VARIATION 3 Yet one more Blum jig
uses screws to register the position of a
postlike mounting plate screwed to thhe
rear face of a face-frame cabinet. Use the

Pocket Door Slides 
Combining a Euro hinge with a door slide may
seem like a mixed marriage, but the result—a
pocket door slide—is one of the key components
in many home entertainment centers. The doors
swing open, then glide backward into the cabinet
to give a nearly unobstructed view of the televi-
sion as well as clear access to all of the intercon-
nected components. For this use, the slides usu-
ally handle vertical doors, but they can also be
mounted to the underside of a horizontal carcase
member for a retracting door like that used in
barrister bookcases. The slide used in this
demonstration requires a specific type of Euro
hinge for the inlay installation shown, although
you could choose a different hinge and achieve
an overlay fit. Be absolutely certain that the
hinges you select are one of the types recom-
mended by the slide’s manufacturer.
The slide has a detent that locks its motion when
the door is pulled fully forward. This mechanism
is the bent piece of metal engaging the roller in
the lower left portion of the photo (A). Use the
supplied tapping screws to attach the hinge’s
mounting plate to the plate of the slide. 
Measure the thickness of your door, add 1⁄8 in.,
and make a gauge block that length. Hold the
block against the detent roller (B) of the slide,
and drive a screw into a pilot hole drilled into the
slot near the back of the slide. (The slide manu-
facturer supplies black screws, but I temporarily
substituted bright ones for photographic clarity.)
Slide the plate mechanism backward, and drive
another screw into the slot at the front of the
slide. Attach the upper slide in the same manner,
butting it against the interior top of the carcase.
Rip a piece of stock 23⁄4 in. wide to serve as the
follower strip that unites the two slides. Screw
the follower strip to the plates of the upper and
lower slides (C). The follower strip ensures that
the slides move at the same speed to prevent

the door from racking. I chose edgebanded ply-
wood for this application because it’s more
dimensionally stable than solid wood. 
Drill the hinge-cup holes in the door at the loca-
tion dictated by the hinge model you selected.
Use a square to ensure that the hinge arm is per-
pendicular to the door (D), and drive the hinge
screws into pilot holes in the door. Snap the
hinges on their mounting plates (E), and adjust
the door in its opening. 
Install the plastic pivot block at the edge of the
door (F). By installing the center screw as shown
in the photo, you can slide the block slightly for-
ward and back until you have its location perfect.
When properly positioned, the block’s edge will
touch the door as it moves forward and back and
will also just contact the back of the door when
it’s closed. The pivot block prevents damage to
the door by preventing it from rotating before it’s
fully extended. Install a block to the carcase near
the top and bottom of each door. After you have
the block’s position settled, drive at least one
more screw through it to lock it in place. If your
slide doesn’t come with these blocks, you can
buy inexpensive plastic rollers that serve this
same function.
Snapping the cover plate onto the hinge arm
conceals the adjustment screws, giving the com-
pleted installation (G) a cleaner look. Drive
additional screws into holes in the slide’s track
to fix it in place. Clean any chips out of the slide
track because this debris can cause sluggish
operation or damage to the slide’s bearings.

Barbed Hinge
Barbed hinges are a good choice for production
work because you can perform the machining
steps quickly and accurately. And installation is
speedy because there are no pilot holes to drill
and no fasteners to drive. In fact, you can com-
plete the installation with your bare hands. 
But as with most labor-saving processes, you’ll
need to invest some time up front if you want to
save time later. Building a jig for your drill press is
one task, and patiently setting up the height and
depth of cut, as well as precisely positioning the
stops are other requirements.
Begin by installing the circular blade onto its
arbor (A). There are two different sizes of barbed
hinges, and you’ll need to make sure that you
purchase the correct diameter blade for the
hinges you’ve chosen. Make certain that the
blade’s teeth are pointing in the correct direction
to cut when you chuck the arbor into your
drill press.
Prepare the back edges of the box’s lid and base
by cutting or routing a 1/4-in.x 45-degree chamfer
(B). The exact size of the chamfer isn’t critical—1⁄4
in. is merely a convenient size that’s large enough
to function as a stop for the lid. For this demon-
stration, I used two pieces of 3⁄4-in.-thick stock to
make a box with a recess routed in it for a
micrometer. This is the same type of construction
you would use for making pen presentation
boxes. At this point, you should chamfer all of
your box parts plus a few extras to use in setting
up the location of the kerfs. This is also a good
time to apply the finish to all of the box
components.
Inserting the hinge into a kerf is a one-way trip
because the barbs will grab the wood and rip out
chunks of it if you try to remove the hinge. So for
the test-fitting, flatten the barbs of a couple of
hinges by tapping them flat on a metal surface

(C). Don’t get carried away with your hammering,
or you could warp the leaves, making the hinge
look like a potato chip.
Set the saw at its approximate height in your drill
press, and make the fence assembly shown in the
drawing at right. Attach only the left fence half to
the 2x2 base, leaving the other half loose while you
set the saw’s depth of cut. On a piece of scrap
stock, draw a line 1⁄16 in. farther from the edge than
the width of one of the hinge’s leaves (D). Position
the fence so that the blade’s projection meets the
line, then clamp the fence firmly in position. Attach
the right half of the fence, covering as much of the
blade as possible without touching it.
Put a box component near the blade, and adjust
the table so that the blade’s lower edge is about
1⁄16 in. above the tip of the chamfer (E). Clamp a
stop block to the left fence to cut the first set of
kerfs (F). To make the cut, hold the end of the
stock against the stop block, and rotate the box
part into the blade running at 250 rpm. After
you’ve made all of the cuts at this setting, rip a
kerfed test strip about 11⁄2 in. wide, and place it
upside down into the stationary blade so that you
can set the stop block at the next position (G).
Using the same technique as you used for the
first set of cuts, make this second slice into each
workpiece (H).

The blade has very little set, so it’s not efficient at
ejecting waste from the cut. Therefore you’ll need
to use compressed air or lung power to blow the
fine dust out of each kerf. Press the hinges into
the base of the box, using a piece of scrap wood
to save your thumb (I). Clamp a wood fence to
your workbench, and register the ends of the box
against it as you press the hinges home into the
box top (J). The halves of the completed box fit
together tightly (K). If you want to build some
clearance into the box, simply insert a pair of nar-
row spacers between the base and lid when you
press the parts together. 
VARIATION Another way of putting a
slight space between the base and lid at
the back end is by positioning the  kerf just
below the tip of the chamfer.This places
the knuckle of the installed hinge between
the base and lid.

Barrel Hinge 
The barrel hinge demands careful layout and
drilling because the only axis on which you can
shift the hinges after installation is up or down in
their holes. Begin by putting the hinged edges of
the box’s base and lid next to each other, and
block up the lid so it’s flush with the base (A).
Mark the centerpoints of the hinge locations on
strips of masking tape. I centered the holes in
the thickness of the box’s sides, but moving the
holes closer to the outside of the box would
have permitted a closer ultimate fit between the
lid and base.
Attach a high fence to your drill press, and make
sure that it’s square to the table. Position the tip
of the brad-point bit at the centerpoint, and drill
the hole (B). Note that you’ll position the blocking
under the lid so you can use one depth setting
for all of the holes. The depth of the hole
depends upon the diameter of the hinge you’ve
selected, so consult the hinge’s packaging for this
data. For some reason, neither of the 14-mm drill
bits I have produced a hole large enough to per-
mit insertion of these 14-mm hinges. Even
removing the tightening screws from the barrels
didn’t help. So I resorted to using a small carving
gouge and round file to enlarge the holes (C).
When you insert the hinges, place the base and
lid next to each other, and clamp on a straight

edge to keep the two parts aligned (D). Position
the end of the hinge barrel flush with the wood,
and tighten the screw that slightly expands the
barrel to firmly grip the wall of the hole (E). For
extra holding power, you can drive a screw along-
side each barrel (F). The countersink is partially
formed in the barrel, but you’ll need to use a coun-
tersink bit to extend the recess into the wood. 
One drawback of the hinge results from the fact
that its design prevents it from overclosing—mov-
ing past a zero position when closed. As you can
see in the finished box (G), leaving a large
enough space at the back of the box so that it
can open results in a gap all around the box.
While this “levitating lid” look is not what I had
planned, it is interesting. I’m considering running
chamfers along the mating edges of the base and
lid to accentuate the effect.

Soss Concealed Hinge 
The hinge manufacturer makes a jig that simpli-
fies making the two-level mortise. Having a sin-
gle jig means that you’ll need to install it at each
hinge location to rout at one level, then relocate
it to rout the second part of the mortise. If you
get into production involving these hinges, you’ll
save big blocks of time by ganging several jigs
onto a single fixture and having a router dedi-
cated to each mortise depth setting. 
To make the jig work, you’ll need a router guide
bushing: Porter-Cable No. 42024 (Lock Face
Routing) and nut. Depending on the hinge you’re
installing, you also need a specific diameter
router bit—verify the size when you order the jig.
Install the bushing in your router’s baseplate, and
chuck in the bit (A). Put the jig atop the inverted
router, and set the height of the bit to match the
flange of the hinge (B).
Flip down the spacer at the end of the jig, regis-
ter it against the end of the door, and hold the
locating pins against the outside face of the door
(C). Choose the smaller of the two pairs of nails
furnished with the jig, and tap them through the
jig into the edge of the door. Referring to the
chart supplied with the jig, drill a starter hole
approximately centered within the jig’s outline.
The diameter and depth of the hole will vary
depending on the hinge size you’ve selected. In
this case, it was a 3⁄8-in. hole 27⁄32 in. deep.
(Although the chart specifies hole depths to
1⁄64-in. tolerances, that degree of accuracy is not
actually necessary.)
If you use a fixed-base router, tip it on edge atop
the jig, start it, then angle the bit into the starter
hole. Rout two clockwise passes around the jig’s
perimeter (D), and make sure the router’s han-
dles don’t hit the nails. Shut off the router, and let
the bit stop before you remove it so you won’t
accidentally damage the jig.

Move the jig to each hinge location, and rout the
first mortise in all of them. When you position the
jig to rout the mortises in the stiles, turn the tab
at the end of the jig so it can rest flush on the
wood. The tab automatically sets the reveal at the
top and bottom of the door.
Put the jig atop the router again, and advance the
bit to set the depth of the second mortise that
accommodates the body of the hinge (E). I know
I probably should have routed this depth in a
series of shallower passes, but then I realized
that the surface quality of this cut was inconse-
quential and that the router simply needed to hog
out the waste. Use the remaining set of nails fur-
nished with the jig to confine the router’s travel
to the central portion of the jig (F). Reinstall the
jig on the door by fitting the nails into their origi-
nal holes and then tapping them slightly deeper.
Rout the second level of the mortise. 
The next photo (G) shows the hinge next to the
completed split-level mortise. The hinge fits per-
fectly if its surface is flush with the door. If the
shallow mortise is too deep, you can add shims
under the hinge. Drill pilot holes, and drive the
screws to secure the hinge (H). The completed
installation operates smoothly and is invisible
from both sides when the door is closed (I).
To make your router setup easy the next time you
install these hinges, cut a successful test mortise
in half (J). You can then use this gauge block to
quickly set the depth of the starter hole and both
levels of the mortise.
VARIATION If you don’t want to invest in
the jig, bushing, and bit, you can mortise
these hinges using a drill andd chisel. The
instruction sheet packed with the hinge
includes templates for the various sizes so
makee sure you use the template that
matches the hinge size you purchased.

Glass Door Hinge 
When you shop for glass door hinges, pay atten-
tion to the subtleties of design and installation.
Some hinges screw to the cabinet, while others
utilize bushings you insert into the carcase. You’ll
also find free-swinging designs and those with a
self-closing feature.
At first glance, this glass door hinge design
looked like a real winner—you simply tuck it into
the corner of a carcase, drive three screws, and
you’re finished. But when I turned the hinge over,
I discovered a shortcoming. The pivot rivet
extends beyond the base flange, so driving the
bottom screw would tilt the hinge backward. 
Fortunately, there’s an easy solution, as shown in
the photo (A). By adding a couple of no. 6 brass
washers between the flange and the bottom of
the carcase, you can keep the hinge level. Thread
the attachment screw through the base flange
and washers, and drive the screw into a pilot hole
in the bottom of the carcase (B). Note that the
front of the base flange is flush with the front
plane of the carcase. Visually check that the hinge
is level, and drive screws through the side flange
into the side of the carcase. Install the upper
hinge in the same manner.
Cut a piece of 1⁄4-in. plywood or hardboard to verify
the size of the glass you’ll need and to check
operating clearances (C). Take the pattern to the
glass shop, and order your glass. 
When you install the glass, use the metal plates
supplied with the hinge between the screws and
the glass (D). If you want to stick the plate to the
glass, peel the backing off the double-faced tape.
The completed installation (E) doesn’t draw much
attention to itself. Instead, it keeps the focus on
the contents of your cabinet.

Pivot Hinge 
A pivot hinge is the key piece of hardware that
puts indoor gliding rocking chairs and porch glid-
ers into motion. The pivot hinge shown here was
developed by Rockler and provides a sturdy,
weather resistant solution to this heavy-duty
application. The nylon sleeve for the pivot hinge
is 7⁄16 in. long and is designed to sit at the bottom
of a 1-in.-dia. counterbore. So the first step is to
drill this counterbore to a depth 7⁄16 in. less than
the thickness of the stock. The easiest way to do
this is to use the sleeve as a gauge against the
end of a Forstner bit in your drill press as shown
in the photo (A). To verify the setup, drill a coun-
terbore near the end of a scrap board (B). Once
you establish the setting, it will be accurate
regardless of the stock’s thickness. Drill the
counterbore at the desired location, and change
to a 1⁄2-in. bit in the drill press. Use this bit to drill
through the stock (C), centering the hole in the
counterbore.

Drill a 1⁄2-in. hole 9⁄16 in. deep in the other piece of
stock (D). Mix up some epoxy and use a nail to
wipe a small amount onto the wall of the hole.
Align the holes on the flange across the grain (E),
drill pilot holes, and drive the screws. For extra
strength, you may want to substitute longer
screws if your stock will accept them. Put the
washer with the large hole onto the shaft of the
bolt, add the other piece of stock with the nylon
sleeve, put the washer into the counterbore, and
tighten the nut with a 1⁄2-in. socket wrench (F).
Tighten enough to remove any play in the joint
while still allowing free motion.
VARIATION The Roto-Hinge has the
virtue of very easy installation—simply
drill holes in each piece of stock, andd glue
in the wood bushings for a virtually invisi-
ble pivot joint. On the downside, the shaft
is a sm
mall-diameter rivet that is adequate
for light-duty applications but may not
have the shear strength  required in large-
scale applications.

Rule Joint 
If a challenge makes you happy, the rule joint will
turn you positively ecstatic. Although none of the
individual installation steps are particularly com-
plex, it’s difficult to visualize the center of rota-
tion for this joint because it’s literally buried with-
in the tabletop. If you’ve never made this joint
before, I’d strongly recommend that you practice
on some scrap material until you understand the
processes. When you’ve produced a successful
joint, you can then use the practice pieces as
gauge blocks to duplicate the machine settings
for your good material.  
Rip and joint the boards for the tabletop, and check
that their mating edges are straight and square. If
you don’t start with a seamless joint, the following
steps will simply make the fit worse. Postpone any
shaping of the tabletop’s perimeter until after
you’ve successfully made the joint. 
Get a matched set of router bits to cut the halves
of the rule joint (A). For the 3⁄4-in.-thick material for
this tabletop, a set with 1⁄2-in. radius roundover
and cove is just right. Adjust the fence on your
router table so that it is flush with the edge of
the roundover bit’s bearing, and rout along the
edge of the piece that will be the stationary part
of the tabletop. The finished side of the top will
be against the router table. Of course, you’ll
advance the bit in steps to ensure a smooth cut.
For the final cut, leave just a sliver—1⁄16 in. or
less—along the stock (B). If you removed the
entire edge, there wouldn’t be enough support
along the outfeed portion of the fence, so you’d
end up with a cut that wasn’t straight. Plane
away the sliver by hand, and slightly round this
bottom edge of the joint so it won’t interfere with
the operation of the top.
Chuck the cove bit into your table-mounted
router, and place one of the table leaves face up
on the router table. Rout along its edge in steps
until the depth of the flat matches the fillet that is
next to the roundover on the top (C). Check your

progress until the two pieces of stock match.
Placing two thicknesses of self-adhesive notepa-
per simulates the clearance that you’ll build into
the joint. Use a striking knife and square to
extend the line of the top’s fillet down each end
of the board. 
Turn the top over, and connect the two end lines
by striking a line along the bottom. Cut the
notepaper into slim strips, and place them
between the fillet on the top and the flat on the
leaf. Position the hinge face up (countersinks
showing) and with the short hinge leaf on the top
(D). Make certain the centerline of the hinge pin
coincides with the line scribed on the bottom,
and trace the perimeter of the hinge with a strik-
ing knife. 
Mortising to the thickness of the hinge leaf won’t
be quite deep enough because you must also
allow for the sliver you planed off during the
roundover. Refer to the drawing at right to see
the geometry of the hinge placement. Set your
laminate trimmer’s depth setting by gauging
against the hinge, then add a little more depth to
match the thickness of the sliver (E). Rout close
to the outlines, then complete the waste removal
with a straight chisel. 
Draw parallel pencil lines indicating the position
of the hinge barrel, and use a small carving
gouge to excavate the recess. As long as you
bury the knuckle, the depth is not critical—just be
careful not to break through the top (F). Secure

try its action. If the movement isn’t perfect, refer
to the troubleshooting drawings at left, and
correct the position of the hinge. 
Resist the urge to simply sand the roundover or
cove to correct a poor fit. Instead, get the best
action possible by patiently adjusting the position
of the hinges. As you shift the hinge, you may
want to drill a new pilot hole in one of the unused
holes in the hinge leaf. When the joint fits as well
as you can make it, you can resort to sanding to
deal with any remaining high spots. There should
be no wood-to-wood contact as the joint moves,
and you should allow a bit of extra clearance for
the thickness of the finish.
The completed rule joint (H) is the result of per-
severance in fitting. Disassemble the compo-
nents for finishing, and then drive screws into
pilot holes to secure the hinges.

n many applications, hinging a cabi-
net door is only part of the challenge.
To finish the job, you must make certain
that the door won’t swing too widely, dam-
aging a wall or another portion of the cabi-
net. Although you may be tempted to rely
on the hinge to limit the maximum opening
angle, doing so will put strain on both the
hinge and your cabinet. Sooner or later, one
or the other will fail.
You have several choices for hardware
that will limit the opening angle of a door. A
simple chain stay is easy to install and is
effective on cabinet, wardrobe, and armoire
doors. Use a pair of wire cutters (also called
diagonals) to snip off unneeded links or
balls. If you use ball chain for a door, choose
the no. 10 size.
Rigid stays may be straight or curved, and
both types are easy to install. Simply screw
the hinged mounting plate to the back of
the door, open it to the desired angle, and
screw the small mounting plate to the
underside of the cabinet’s top. For small to
moderately scaled doors, you can use the
chains and stays that also serve as lid sup-
ports for boxes. For larger-scale applications,
choose hardware, such as the wardrobe stay,
that’s designed to handle the strain.
Mounting the wardrobe stay is similar to
installing its smaller cousins, and you use the
thumbscrew to hold the door open at any
desired angle.

The drop-front desk is a time-honored clas-
sic because of the quiet efficiency of its
design. Its writing surface takes up no space
when not in use and has the added virtue of
instantly hiding clutter when you raise it.
But the most fun of a drop-front desk is its
self-cleaning feature—when you raise the
flap, everything that was on the writing sur-
face tumbles into the desk.
Supports for drop-front desks range from
the simple to the sublime. At the low end of
the spectrum is a simple hinged arm that’s
typically reversible for right- or left-handed
Use door-restraint hardware to prevent damage to the cabinet itself
and its surroundings. The chain and downscale stay examples can
also be used on small to medium boxes. The wardrobe stay that’s
screwed to the door and face frame is designed for bigger doors
or boxes. 
Drop-front hardware includes (left to right):
a hinged arm, a vertical rod with an integral
magnetic catch, and a stay that’s a part of a
mortised hinge.

mechanism that keeps the lid shut.

mechanism becomes an important part of
the desk’s inner workings.
Supporting Hinged Lids 
A length of chain fastened to the lid and
side of a box is an easy and economical way
to limit the lid’s backward travel. For a small
box, you can choose no. 3 chain, which is
available in the familiar ball variety or in a
more decorative ball and bar style. The
larger no. 10 chain is more suitable for large
boxes or as a door restraint. A variety of end
anchors makes it easy to secure the chain to
the lid and side of boxes in virtually any
design. But chain often has the annoying
habit of getting caught between the lid
and base and may damage the wood when
it does.
You can choose a plain slotted arm sup-
port, but if you get one with a friction knob
you can lock the lid in an upright position.
A slotted arm with a notch is another way to
support a lid. Screw the hinged bracket to
the box’s lid so that the notch points upward
when the support arm is level. To install this
type, partially drive a screw through the slot
and into the box’s side so that the shank
engages the notch at the desired lid angle.
When a box’s limited depth prohibits the
use of a straight slot, choose a curved sup-
port—the shape provides increased travel
while reducing overall length. Another strat-
egy for shallow boxes is a folding lid stay.
Some folding stays use a detent mechanism
that clicks or snaps to hold the lid upright.
To disengage this type, you push at its
midpoint.
You’ll notice that some supports have a
mounting plate that’s fastened to the under-
side of the lid. Other stays are simply flat
pieces of metal that you attach to the inner
edges of the lid and base.
Of all the lid supports, the one that you
mortise into the side of the box is the most
difficult to install. But if you invest the
work, you’ll be rewarded with a very clean
look and dependable operation.

A hinge/support combination (far left) moves the chest’s lid farther
backward than the traditional cedar chest hinge (second from left).
The cedar chest hinge reinforces the rear corner and holds the lid
upright. The next mechanism to the right raises a till as you open
the lid. Select a self-balancing lid support (second from right) by
calculating the torque of the lid. The toy box support (far right) also

more information on computing torque.
chest, lidded bench, or hamper. Fortunately,
several of the supports are available in sizes
scaled up to the challenge of these larger
projects. One traditional solution is called a
cedar-chest hinge and lid support. Actually,
it’s a set of right- and left-handed hardware
that combines the hinge and support into
one unit. In its raised position, the surface of
the lid is about 3⁄8 in. inboard of the back of
the chest. Another piece of combination
hardware moves the lid further backward, up
to 1 in. past the rear of the chest.
Although technically not a lid support,
there’s a piece of specialty hardware that
raises the inner tray (also called a till) of a
cedar chest as you lift the lid. You’ll also find
this design in a downscaled version that lifts
a till inside a jewelry box. Another choice is
a spring-loaded support that prevents the lid
from slamming. This item is available in
right- or left-handed versions, and either
can be center mounted.
Overhead Door Supports
Designers of aircraft interiors have long rec-
ognized the enormous storage potential of
overhead bins. Now this hardworking style
of storage is finding its way into home
offices, kitchens, baths, and media rooms.
When you close the doors of overhead bins,
all of your disorganized belongings are hid-
den so you appear instantly organized.
That’s a real improvement over being disor-
ganized and looking disorganized.
There’s an incredible variety of lid stays
on the market, but understanding a few
basic types will guide you to one that’s right
for your project. The first type is a simple
mechanism that locks when you raise the
door to 75 degrees. Raise it slightly higher

to disengage the mechanism and lower the
door. This economical lid support is the kind
you’ll likely find in woodworking-supply
catalogs.
But if you search out specialty hardware
suppliers, you’ll find more complex (and
costlier) mechanisms. These may provide
stopping action (holding the door open at
any desired angle), braking action (a cush-
ioned descent to prevent slamming), or both
stopping and braking action. Seventy-five
degrees is a standard support angle, but you
can buy some styles of stays that open to
90 or 110 degrees. These greater angles are
helpful for eliminating interference with the
lid when accessing the cabinet’s contents or
for bins that are mounted lower on the wall.
The third type of lid support uses an
adjustable pneumatic (air) cylinder to pro-
vide lifting and holding action. If you have 
a vehicle with a hatchback, you’re already
familiar with the concept of pneumatic lift
cylinders.
If you’ve ever done any automotive work, you’ve encountered the concept of torque
as a measure of the turning force applied to a bolt. In a similar way, the hinged lid of a
wood box exerts force as it arcs downward to the box’s base. When you want to over-
come that torque with a self-balancing lid support, you need to calculate the amount 
of torque in a unit called inch-pounds (IP). To do this, simply multiply one-half of the
front-to-back dimension (in inches) of a lid by its weight (in pounds). For example, if a
cedar chest lid measures 20 in. and weighs 6 lb., then 10 in. x 6 lb. = 60 IP. If you’re
using a single support, purchase one that meets the full torque requirement. If you 
split the work between two supports, divide the total torque in half to get the rating for
each support.

Slotted-Bar Lid Stop 
There is a wide variety of lid stops: Some attach
to the bottom of a slab lid, whereas others are
fixed to the inner edge of a box lid. Regardless of
the exact setup, the installation basics are 
the same. 
Tilt the lid backward about 5 degrees past verti-
cal, and clamp or brace it into position. Test-fit the
hardware, holding it in position against the side
and lid, with the slotted bar at an angle of
30 to 45 degrees with the side (A). Mark the
position of the lid plate, drill pilot holes, and
attach it. Mark the location of the screw in the
side of the box, drill a pilot hole, and partially
drive the screw. To lower the lid, you’ll need to lift
the slotted bar to disengage the shank of the
screw from the notch (B).

Substituting a curved bar
gives you the same amount of travel with
reduced overall length. That means  you

Mortised Lid Support
When you mortise the lid support into the side
of the box, you virtually eliminate the possibility
of snagging the box’s contents and you also cre-
ate an unobstructed interior. You can then fill the
clear interior space with trays that slide or lift to
maximize the storage capacity. But those advan-
tages come with several disadvantages. First,
the support is pricey. Second, the installation
procedure is as unforgiving as an army drill ser-
geant. Third, you’ll do the installation into a box
that’s already been assembled and finished, so a
mistake transforms your project into kindling. 
This style of lid support is manufactured by
Brusso in two sizes: with a body that is 1⁄4 in.
wide by 27⁄8 in. long or 3⁄8 in. wide by 45⁄16 in. long.
Choosing between them is more a matter of the
scale of the box and aesthetics than holding
power. The supports are unhanded, meaning that
they can be installed into either side of a box. The
photos show the larger size being installed.
Hinge the lid onto the box, and prop up the lid so
that it’s level with the base. Apply a strip of mask-
ing tape along the lid and end of the base so you
can make your layout marks (A). First, draw on
the tape the key reference line, the centerline of
the hinge pin. Measure 11⁄2 in. from that center-
line onto the lid, and mark the centerpoint of the
hanger stud. Turn your attention to the end of the
box, measuring 3⁄4 in. from the hinge pin’s center-
line, and mark one end of the mortise. From that
point, measure and mark the other end of the
mortise 45⁄16 in. toward the front of the box. Draw
a centerline along the thickness of the box’s side
and lid. Remove the lid, take it to your drill press
to drill the 7⁄16-in. hole 7⁄16 in. deep (B), and strip off
the tape. Take the base of the box to your drill

press, chuck in a 3⁄8-in. Forstner bit, and drill a hole
at each end of the mortise (C).
Remember that the layout marks you made indi-
cate the end of the mortise, so the centerpoint of
your drill bit goes 3⁄16 in. toward the center of the
mortise. With a Forstner bit, you can drill a line of
overlapping holes to remove the bulk of the mor-
tise’s waste to its 3⁄4-in. depth. Remove the
remaining waste using a chisel (D). Test-fit the
support body into the mortise, aiming for a fit
that’s perfectly flush with the upper edge of the
box. Shim the mortise if it is too deep; continue
chiseling if it’s too shallow. 
Tap the support body into place with a deadblow
mallet (E) and screw it into the mortise. Reattach
the lid, put a few drops of epoxy onto the lid
stud, and push it into the hole in the lid (F). The
stud flares slightly, so resistance will increase as
you push it into the hole. Make certain that the
box closes easily: The pin on the end of the stud
should drop neatly into the hole of the support
body without binding. Add a lining to the interior
of the box, and you’re finished (G).

After drilling the end holes
of the mortise, you may want to plunge-
rout the mortise in three passes,, advanc-
ing the bit in steps 1⁄4 in. deep, until you
reach the completed depth. Photo H

but it would be safer to use a 1⁄4-in. bit to
remove most of the waste, and then use a

Toy Box Lid Support
Before purchasing a toy box lid support, you need
to figure the torque requirement for
your lid.
Next, you have to choose the mounting location:
left, center, or right. If you’re using a single sup-
port, positioning it in the center is the best
choice. Using a pair of right- and left-handed sup-
ports is another good strategy, especially for a
long or heavy lid. No matter what mounting posi-
tion you choose, the installation procedure is sim-
ilar. The following demonstration will install a left-
handed support.
Hinge the top of the toy box to the base.
The directions supplied with the support gave the
location of the upper hole in the side mounting
bracket at 1 in. from the centerpoint of the hinge
pin and 11⁄4 in. from the rear face of the back
(1⁄2 in. inboard from the 3⁄4-in.-thick back). Mark this
centerpoint on a strip of masking tape, position
the support, and use a scratch awl to mark the
centerpoint of the lower mounting hole (A). Drill
pilot holes, strip off the tape, and screw the
bracket to the side of the toy box’s base. Put a
strip of masking tape on the toy box lid, and mark
the centerpoint of the lower mounting hole for
that bracket, positioning it 3 in. above the hinge
pin’s centerpoint. Swing the support against the
lid, and mark the centerpoint of the other mount-
ing hole. Drill pilot holes (B), strip off the tape,
and screw the bracket in place. The support holds
the lid open at an 85-degree angle (C).
WARNING
Safe installation and
operation require that the mounting
screws have a solid target that’s at least
3⁄4 in. thick. Use the largest diameter of
screw in the greatest length that your
project will hold.

OVERHEAD DOOR SUPPORTS
Lid Supports and Stays
77
Support for an 
Overhead Door 
Even if your hardware comes with an instruction
sheet, I’d strongly suggest that you do the trial
installation suggested here to make sure that the
support will function without banging into the
bottom or back of your bin. The easiest time to
install a support on an overhead bin is before you
put it overhead and before adding the back. By
placing the hinged bin on its side on your work-
bench (A), you can position the fully extended
support without being concerned that the door
will smack your head or pinch your fingers. Rip a
4-in.-wide strip of plywood, and use your miter
saw to cut a 15-degree angle on one end to
gauge the 75-degree open angle of the lid. Nip
off the corner of the gauge so the tip doesn’t
interfere with the piano hinge that joins the lid to
the bin.
Position the support’s baseplate about 11⁄4 in. back
of the front edge of the bin and about 1 in. below
the vertical midpoint of the box. Extend the sup-
port until it locks, and place that baseplate against
the lid. To hold the hardware in place while run-
ning it through its cycle, add small pieces of dou-
ble-faced tape to each baseplate (B). The support
should never touch the back or bottom of the bin.
You can easily verify this by looking through the
open back of the box (C). (In the photo, the bot-
tom of the box is at the left.) If there is any inter-
ference, you merely reposition the baseplates
and test again. You can leave the tape on the
baseplates when you drill the pilot holes and
drive the screws to secure them. Add the back to
the bin, and hang it on the wall (D).

omewhere there may be a clever
student of word origins who could
explain the subtle differences in mean-
ing among the words clasp, catch, and latch.
But wherever that person is, you can be sure
that he doesn’t work for a hardware manu-
facturer or supplier because those sources use
those words almost interchangeably. So this
section will follow the same approach, using
the terms you’re most likely to encounter in
hardware catalogs and retail outlets.
Latching Methods 
Some latches are surface mounted and can
be a bold accent on your project or a barely
noticeable detail. Other catches are com-
pletely concealed when a cabinet’s doors are
closed. And locks range from traditional ele-
gance to no-nonsense security. But all of the
hardware in this section relies on three basic
technologies:
• Mechanical latching/locking is the most
basic system, and it is used with a wide
range of hasps, hooks, and latches.
• Spring pressure is the basis for ball catches,
bullet catches, and many other latches.
• Magnetism is a popular holding technolo-
gy for many inexpensive catches. Move up
the price line to the more powerful rare-
earth magnets, and you gain impressive
holding power.
Some latches combine two technologies.
Touch latches, for example, usually employ a
magnet at the end of a spring-loaded rod.

Catches and Latches for a
Single Door
The mechanical latches shown in the photo
at right represent only a few of the many
styles that are used for inset doors, those in
which the surface of the door is flush with
the cabinet’s carcase or face frame. All of the
latches shown are reversible, meaning that
they can be used for either right- or left-
handed doors. You can also use these types
of latches to secure one door of a pair, but
you’ll have to add a separate piece of hard-
ware to anchor the other door to the carcase.
Surface-mounted cabinet latches have
three dominant mechanisms: you can lift a
bar, press or slide a spring-loaded handle, or
twist a knob. Browse through hardware cata-
logs and you’ll find a wide range of available
shapes, metals, and finishes. Latches with 
a narrow baseplate permit mounting on a
cabinet stile.
Mention surface-mounted bolts, and
many woodworkers will think of the locking
mechanism employed on old-fashioned
screen doors. But this common mechanism
Surface-mounted mechanical
latches are a no-nonsense
way to keep a door closed.
Catalogs offer a wide range of
styles. 
Here are examples of the
three basic latching technolo-
gies (from left): mechanical,
spring, and magnetic. Some
other latches combine two of
these holding methods.

is also available in upgraded materials and
surface treatments: ornate work reminiscent
of the Victorian age, highly polished brass,
and sleekly contemporary. The quartet of
surface bolts shown in the bottom photo on
p. 79 only hints at the many styles that are
available. The two bolts on the left have an
almost identical action but completely dif-
ferent styling. The bolt at the upper right
could also be used on the upper back of a
left door to secure it to the carcase. The
bolt at lower right has a distinctly contem-
porary look.
The push-button catch shown in the
photo at left is a highly interactive piece of
hardware. Push the button once, and the
strike retracts as the button moves forward,
revealing a knob for easy gripping. Close 
the door and push the button again to
retract it and engage the strike. Its nearly
flush mounting gives it a sleek look and also
makes it ideal for use in tight walk-through
areas. For all those reasons, it’s a style that’s
often used in boat and recreational vehicle
cabinets.
Catches Mount Inside a 
Single Door 
Another category of catch mounts inside the
cabinet and uses spring pressure or magnet-
ism to grab and hold the door. When a cabi-
net door fits well, you can count on the light
force exerted by a small catch mounted near
the handle to hold it shut. But when you’re
faced with a door that twists, you’ll appreci-
ate the extra holding power of larger-scale
catches. For example, if you have a kitchen
cabinet door that gapes open at the top,
installing a spring or roller catch can pull the
door flat against the face frame.
The group of spring catches shown in the
top photo at left offers a wide range of meth-
ods to hold a door. You may see some spring
catches described as “friction catches.” The
plastic spring that captures the head of a bulb-
head screw is an inexpensive choice: A package
of 10 retails for a few dollars. The next two
items are spring catches. The spear-shaped
projection mounts on the door, and you need
to plan its location carefully to minimize the
risk of snagging clothing or ripping flesh. The
one with the larger spear has a baseplate with
heavier springs for increased holding power.
Single-door spring catches
are available in a range of
shapes and materials.
You’ll find spring pres-
sures that range from mild
to extra-strong.
Bullet catches can be pricey for the machined version (left)
or inexpensive for the hardware-store variety (right). 
In the closed position at
bottom, the push knob is
nearly flush with the
door’s surface. Push the
button once, and the knob
springs outward (middle)
so you can grab it.

Magnetic latches include the familiar standby at left, the
small alternative in the center, and the powerful rare-earth
variety at right.  
You’ll find touch latches in many styles,
shapes, and sizes. The one at top mounts on
the surface, whereas the other requires you
to drill a mounting hole for the press-in
insert. You then screw the threaded latch
body into the insert. 
Bullet catches (sometimes called ball
catches) are a popular and unobtrusive piece
of hardware. But you’ll have to tailor the
gap of the door to meet the geometry of the
catch or risk wearing a rut into the door’s
surround every time you open or shut
the door.
The photo above displays three styles of
magnetic catches. The type at left is widely
available at many hardware stores. Slots in
the plastic mounting plate allow you to
adjust its location fore and aft. You install
the magnetic catch at center by drilling the
body into the door, giving this style a more
discreet appearance. It’s a catalog item useful
for small doors that fit well. The powerful
rare-earth magnet at right gains even more
strength when installed in the optional and
very inexpensive mounting cup. Simply drill
a hole for the mounting cup, and secure it
with a screw driven through the hole in the
bottom. There’s no need to glue the magnet
in place—when you move it close to the cup,
the magnet will literally jump into position.
Of all the items covered in this book, this
one represents the only piece of self-
installing hardware. You can purchase a steel
washer to use as a target for the rare-earth
magnet, but you may find that you’ll get
enough holding strength by simply counter-
sinking the head of a steel screw flush with
the wood.
A word of caution about magnets in gen-
eral and the rare-earth variety in particular:
It’s a prudent idea to keep them away from
computers, cathode-ray tube monitors and
televisions, as well as magnetic data-storage
media such as diskettes and tapes. The mag-
nets could cause picture distortion and cor-
ruption or loss of data. Maybe you’ll be
lucky and not have a problem, but there are
so many latching choices that it’s easy to
pick another type to use near these sensitive
applications.
Touch latches shown in the photo above
offer good holding power and can completely
eliminate the necessity for knobs. These
latches are available in several different styles

You can use self-adhesive felt dots, but I like the look
of 3⁄8-in. shopmade leather dots. Buy a punch at the
hardware store or from a leatherwork supplier, and
within minutes you can hammer dozens of dots from
a piece of scrap leather or even an old belt. Use yel-
low woodworker’s glue to bond the leather to the
wood. 
You can easily make a stop for a single door by
slicing a 3⁄8-in. length from a 1⁄2-in.-dia. dowel (C). By
offsetting the hole from the center, you create a cam
action that allows you to fine-tune the fit of the door
to absolute perfection. A quick production tip: Drill
the mounting hole into a length of dowel immobi-
lized in a hand-
screw clamp, and
cut a batch of
stops to length.
Stops prevent inset doors from swinging too far
inside the cabinet. You can mount stops at the bottom
of the door, the top, or at both locations. Here are
several strategies for shopmade doorstops. In a face-
frame cabinet, simply glue or screw a block to the top
inner frame (A). 
At the top or bottom of the carcase, a 1⁄2-in. by 1⁄2-in.
by 3⁄4-in. block made from wood that matches the cab-
inet is a discreet but effective stop that’s large
enough for a pair of doors (B). Drilling a 1⁄4-in. hole
for the #8 x 11⁄4-in. washer-head screw permits adjust-
ment fore and aft as well as side to side. Adding tiny
bumper dots muffles the sound when the door closes.

Double-Door Catches
and Latches
Whenever two doors meet without a cabinet
stile between them, the traditional approach
is to secure the left door to the cabinet or a
fixed interior shelf using an elbow catch or
sliding bolt. Then you can install a surface-
mounted latch that secures the right door to
the left one. The elbow catch is a surface-
mount item, but some sliding bolts require
careful mortising into the rear face and top
of the door stile.
If you want to eliminate fumbling with a
piece of hardware every time you open the
(some employ a magnetic latch, whereas others
use a mechanical latch), but they all work on
the same principle: As you press inward on
the face of the door, the latch releases, and a
spring-loaded mechanism pushes the door
open far enough for you to grasp the edge of
the door. To close the door, you gently press
the face of the door until the latch engages.
Touch latches can give your cabinet project a
clean look, but at the same time, not-so-clean
hands will be touching your carefully crafted
doors. For that reason, touch latches are better
suited to an occasionally used buffet cabinet
than to a busy baking center in the kitchen.

ious mechanism forces a spring bolt into the
end of the left door when you close the right
one. You can mortise the library catch into
the carcase at the top or bottom of the
doors’ opening or at both locations for extra
security. As a bonus for left-handers, you can
even install the library catch so that the left
door opens first.
If you don’t need the security of rigidly
latching both doors of the pair, you can

and shut the doors in any sequence you wish.
Inventive minds have devised still other
ways to secure a pair of doors. The latch

one door when you close the other. Like the

these only where there is virtually no chance
of metal-to-flesh contact. The more benign

touch latches twinned into a single baseplate.
Surprisingly, this double mechanism costs
only slightly more than an individual latch.
Catches, Hooks, and Hasps 
Look through this grouping, and you’ll dis-
cover hardware that will secure lids from a
dainty trinket box all the way to a job site-
tough toolbox. The top photo at left shows
catches that hook, snap, and latch. As a gen-
eral rule, you fasten the smaller ones with
escutcheon pins (usually supplied) and the
larger ones with screws (sometimes you must
purchase the screws separately). The draw
latch, familiar from its use on toolboxes,
provides a more secure lid-to-base connec-
tion than the models that simply snap shut.

SECTION 4 OVERVIEW 
Locks 
Locks on small boxes and briefcases serve
more of a psychological role rather than a
practical purpose, but even a tiny lock makes
a big statement—the contents are valuable.
Although a briefcase may protect a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich instead of top-
secret documents, a pair of combination
locks is absolutely essential.
Other locks serve a more practical role,
securing the contents of desks, chests, and
file cabinets.
Miniature padlocks are an inexpensive
accessory for small boxes and can also pre-
vent unauthorized use of power tools.
Simply put the lock’s shackle through a hole
in the tool’s plug as shown in the photo
at left.
For larger-scale lock applications, consider
a new padlock that has the styling of an
antique. Nothing would ruin the look of a
vintage trunk faster than sealing it with the
combination lock you saved from your high
school gym locker. The examples shown in
the top photo on the facing page weigh in at
about 1 lb. each and offer serious security. The
lock with the square body is considered a trick
lock because the visible keyhole is a ruse—you
have to know the secret to reveal the true
entrance to the six-lever lock. The lock with
the ice shield that swings over the keyhole
offers no deceptions, but it more than com-
pensates by featuring an eight-lever mecha-
nism, complex enough to frustrate most lock
pickers less skilled than Harry Houdini.
While Houdini richly deserved his repu-
tation as an escape artist who could get out
of nearly anything, the average toddler has
an equal ability to get into things. One way to
protect youngsters from their own curiosity is
It’s easy to find a catch that matches the scale and style
of the boxes you build. Some hasps have an attached

the remarkably clever magnetic latch (bottom
right). The latch and its strike are completely
concealed by the door. When you bring the
knob up to the door, its super-strong magnet
retracts the latch and also attaches itself to
the door, allowing you to swing it open. The
magnet is powerful enough to work through
doors 3⁄4 in. thick, and you can recess the
latch into thicker doors. In addition to child-
proofing cabinet doors, you can also use this
latch to create secret compartments that are
safe from nosy adults.
Selecting a Lock 
Selecting a lock is a three-step process:
• Define the use of the lock. For example, do
you need a lock for a hinged door or one
that slides, a cedar chest, or a drawer?
• Choose the installation method you prefer:
surface mount, half mortise, or full mortise.
• Make certain that the lock and escutcheon
are compatible with the style of furniture
or cabinet you’re building.
Getting down to specifics, you’ll find two
broad categories of locking mechanisms.
One is a bolt that moves in and out of the
lock’s body, and the other is a cam that
rotates. Let’s start by looking at the bolt-
action locks.
The use of the lock determines the shape
of the bolt. For cabinets, clock cases, cup-
boards, drawers, and doors, all you need is a
straight-sided bolt that extends into a slot in
the carcase or into a strike plate (sometimes
simply called a “strike”). You’ll notice that
some locks have dual keyways, permitting
them to be used horizontally as a drawer
lock or vertically on a door. In almost all
double-door applications, the lock body
installs on the left stile of a right-hand door.
Catches, Latches, and Locks
These padlocks have an old-fashioned look but are
tough enough to defeat modern thieves. 
A magnet hidden in the knob is the “key” that unlocks
this childproof lock.

SECTION 4 OVERVIEW 
photo at left is particularly suited to installa-
tion on a tambour (rolltop) desk because it
has a spring-loaded strike that maintains a
smooth surface on the desktop and also keeps
debris out of the strike. The full-mortise
model (second from left) has a hook that
moves up and to the side. The next lock has
a bolt with a pair of hooks that move side-
ways into the strike. The half-mortise chest
lock (far right) uses another variation, put-
ting the hooks onto the strike plate.
The cedar chest lock and latch is in its
own subcategory. This surface-mounted lock
is sized for sides that are 7⁄8 in. thick. You
unlock the chest by turning the key and
pushing the button. The model shown in the
right photo below has a safety feature to
reduce the chance of self-entrapment: You
must also push the button to latch the chest.
Mortised and Surface-
Mounted Locks 
There is a wide range of locks that can be
grouped into the three installation categories
shown in the drawing at right: full mortise,
The lock shown at left is designed for full-
mortise installation into a right-hand door.
The half-mortise lock shown at right has
dual keyways so you can use it vertically or
horizontally for a door or drawer.
Locks suitable for chests, rolltop desks, and sliding doors have
hooked latches that expand inside the strike plate for a firm grip.
A product of hardware evolution, this lock
meets the specialized requirements of
securing a blanket or cedar chest.
Catches, Latches, and Locks
86
For chests, sliding doors, overhead bins,
and tambours such as a rolltop desk, you
need a bolt that has hook-shaped latches
that extend past the edges of the strike
plate’s opening to lock it. There are several
variations on this theme. One style of lock
has spring-actuated latches on the bolt. The
full-mortise model shown at far left in the

half mortise, and surface mounted. That
sequence also describes the degree of diffi-
culty involved in installation. Full-mortise
locks can be a bit finicky, and surface-
mounted locks are the easiest. On the other
hand, a full-mortise lock can be a bit less
expensive because it has less exposed metal
that requires polishing at the factory.
From the outside of a solid cabinet, you
can’t tell the difference among these three
types because all you see is the keyhole or
escutcheon. However, if you’re building a
curio cabinet with glass sides, a half-mortise
or surface-mounted housing will be visible,
so you’ll want to be sure that its metal and
finish are compatible with the rest of your
hardware.
Escutcheons 
Escutcheons serve both functional and deco-
rative roles. They protect the wood surround-
ing the keyhole from accidental key scratches
and also provide a metallic contrast to the
wood. As you can see in the photo at right,
escutcheons range from starkly plain to wildly
extravagant. Installation of a flush-fitting
extruded escutcheon is an exacting task, but
plate escutcheons can involve nothing more
complicated than a couple of screws or some
tiny nails called, appropriately enough,
escutcheon pins.
Cam Locks 
Cam locks get their name from the tailpiece
that rotates to secure a door or drawer.
Many locks come with both a straight and
an offset cam (sometimes called a “tail”) that
can be mounted with the bend toward the
front or back of the lock’s housing. These
arrangements create a choice of three offsets.
LOCK-MOUNTING METHODS

(Offset is the distance from the back of the
housing to the cam’s surface.) These options
allow you to suit the lock to a variety of
applications, whether your door is lipped,
flush, or overlay. A square hole on the cam
engages with a matching projection on the
lock, so you can mount the cam in four posi-
tions: 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock.
When you order a cam lock, pay attention
to the thickness of stock in which you can
mount it. Hardware catalogs typically have
locks sized for 3⁄4-in. and 11⁄2-in. stock. But
some catalogs and nearly any local lock shop
can supply cam locks for thin material, such
as 1⁄4-in. plywood or acrylic or even sheet
metal.
Hardware catalogs sometimes refer to
cam locks as “cylinder locks” because of the
shape of the housing. But to a locksmith, the
cylinder or plug is the key-actuated mecha-
nism that’s inside the housing.
• If you choose a full-mortise lock, care-
fully note the mortise size listed in the
catalog description to make certain
that your stock is thick enough to
house it.
• Pay close attention to what’s included
with the lock you purchase. Some
locks include a strike and escutcheon;
others require that you purchase the
items à la carte.
LOCK-BUYING TIPS 
➤
From thick to thin, you can find cam locks that secure a
variety of doors and drawers. The lock shown at left has a
mounting bracket that adjusts for panels that range from
3⁄4 in. up to 13⁄8 in. thick. 

CATCHES & BOLTS
Catches, Latches, and Locks
89
Elbow Catch 
The elbow catch consists of two parts: the plate
that attaches to the cabinet’s carcase or a fixed
shelf, and the spring-loaded hook that attaches to
the door. If you’re able to turn the cabinet upside
down, you won’t be fighting gravity during the
installation process. Cut a piece of cloth double-
faced tape, and attach it to the hook’s baseplate
(A). Engage the hook with the plate, and position
them inside the carcase and against the closed
door (B). Note that the hook doesn’t bottom out
into the carcase-mounted plate—hooking about
two-thirds of the plate provides plenty of holding
power while still allowing the door to close easi-
ly. Mark the centerpoint of the plate’s mounting
hole with a pencil. Drill a pilot hole, and screw
the plate into position (C). Swing the door open,
drill pilot holes, and screw the hook to the door
(D). If you need to adjust the catch, loosen the
plate’s screw so you can move it forward or
back. The completed installation (E) has a clean
appearance and provides dependable perform-
ance.

Hook Catch 
A hook catch is uncomplicated, but knowing a
few tricks will help you achieve rattle-free doors.
Begin by holding the hook against the side of the
carcase and the edge of the door, positioning it
so that the hole in the hook is centered on the
door’s edge. Use a scratch awl to mark the cen-
ter of the hook (A). Drill a pilot hole, and partially
drive a screw at this point (B). Select a screw
with a body diameter that matches the hook’s
slot. You’ll notice in this photo that I like to have
the door overhang the carcase about 1⁄16 in. at the
latch side because it creates a shadow line on
the carcase when viewed from the side. Engage
the hook onto the screw, and mark the center-
point of the pivot screw (C).
Drill the pilot hole, and place a pair of brass wash-
ers onto the screw before screwing it in place
(D). The washers provide clearance to keep the
hook from rubbing the finish off of your project.
The properly fitted hook doesn’t touch any
wood—at the carcase or on the door (E). If the
hook doesn’t seat fully, use a needle file to
slightly reduce the diameter of the screw on the
carcase (F). Masking tape protects the carcase
from scratches while you file. The completed
hook installation (G) is neat, attractive, and
absolutely efficient.

Magnetic Catch 
To install a magnetic catch, put the flat plate onto
the magnet, positioning its edge about 1⁄16 in.
above the lower end of the base. Hold the
assembly inside the carcase, with the base
against a fixed carcase member, usually the
underside of the top or a fixed shelf (A).
Incidentally, positioning the carcase upside down
during this installation procedure puts gravity on
your side. Use a scratch awl to mark the position
of the mounting screws, centering them in the
length of the base’s grooves. Drill pilot holes and
mount the base about 1⁄8 in. forward of its cen-
tered position. 
With the plate still adhered to the base, firmly
close the door to make an impression of the dim-
ple in the plate into the door (B). Open the door,
remove the plate from the magnet, and slide the
plate lightly on the door until you feel the dimple
fit into the hole it made in the door. Drill a pilot
hole, and screw the plate into position (C). Turn
the cabinet right side up. Loosen the mounting
screws in the base, and adjust it until you’re sat-
isfied with the closed position of the door and
the amount of magnetic pull (D).
VARIATION A touch latch, which has a
spring-loaded catch in its base, is an evo-
lutionary development of the bassic mag-
netic catch, and installation is virtually
identical until you get to the adjustment
step. Youu’ll have to do a little trial and
error fussing with the position of the base
until you achieve a goood balance between
easy opening action and good holding
power.

Bullet Catch
At first glance, the bullet catch looks like a sim-
ple piece of hardware: It appears that you would
simply drill a couple of holes, drop in the parts,
and walk away. But anything named after ammu-
nition can’t be entirely innocent. The catch actual-
ly requires quite careful installation because it’s
virtually impossible to adjust after you insert the
components. And installation is usually a one-
way trip—removal involves damage to the sur-
rounding wood. In addition, the design of the
catch dictates the clearance from the bottom of
the door to the carcase. For the catch I installed,
the ball extends about 0.15 in. (slightly more than
9⁄64 in.) from the shoulder of the cylinder (A). That
means you need to provide at least 5⁄32 in. of
clearance between the bottom of the door and
the carcase or the ball will drag across the wood
and wear a rut into it. But you can’t increase the
clearance by much, or the ball won’t engage the
strike. When you use a bullet catch, you’ll need
to utilize a cabinet design with a built-in door
stop or add a separate stop to limit the inward
swing of the door. 
I installed the catch into the bottom of the door,
but you can locate it at the top or at both loca-
tions. Hang the door onto the carcase, and adjust
the clearance to 5⁄32 in. where you’ll install the
catch. Remove the door, apply finish to it and the
carcase, and put the door in your vise. Measure
the barrel of the catch with a caliper and drill an
exactly matching hole (7⁄16 in. for this particular
catch) centered in the width and thickness of the
door’s stile (B). A doweling jig will help you drill
straight. Insert a brad-point bit into the jig, and
lightly tap its end with a hammer to set the tip
into the wood. You can then use masking tape to

fairly accurately gauge the depth of the hole
directly from the cylinder of the bullet. 
As you near the marked depth, double-check the
hole with an accurate depth gauge, such as the
end of a vernier caliper. If the bullet is a snug fit,
you can simply press it into the hole, but for extra
security, use glue. I chose yellow woodworking
glue (aliphatic resin) instead of messing with
epoxy, although epoxy would certainly give a
much stronger wood-to-metal bond. The shoulder
of the installed cylinder should be flush with the
end of the stile (C). Rehang the door onto the
carcase and swing it shut. Mark the center of the
stile’s width onto tape applied to its front, and
transfer that centerline onto tape on the
carcase (D).
Open the door and transfer the line again, this
time onto the base that is the target location for
the strike. By measurement, mark the centerline
of the door’s thickness. At the crossmark you’ve
created, drill a 7⁄16-in. hole to bury the strike up to
its shoulder (E). If the construction of your cabi-
net permits it, switch to a 1⁄4-in. bit to continue the
hole through the carcase. This access hole will
permit you to use a hammer and punch to drive
out the strike if it ever needs to be replaced (F). If
you drill the hole for the bullet or strike too
deeply, you can drop a washer into the hole
before gluing the hardware into place (G). The
completed installation is barely visible but holds
the door securely (H).

Double-Ball Catch
This little catch is one of my personal favorites for a
number of reasons: It’s small, inexpensive, easy to
install, can be used horizontally or vertically, and
also acts as its own stop. But the best feature is
that it’s so easy to adjust the latching pressure. You
can get a firm grip for a stubborn door or light hold-
ing power for a clock case door. 
Back off the adjustment screws on the female half
of the base to minimize latching pressure (A). Attach
double-faced tape to the base of the female half of
the catch, trimming it to size with a crafts knife (B).
Join both halves of the catch, and slide it into posi-
tion until the tape on the base grabs the carcase (C).
Taping a piece of index card to the inner face of the
door positions the female baseplate so there will be
a slight amount of tension between it and the male
portion of the catch. Separate the catch, drill pilot
holes, and screw the female half to the carcase (D).
Apply double-faced tape to the base of the male por-
tion, join it to the female half, and close the door.
Push on the male portion to adhere it to the door
(E). If you can’t reach inside the cabinet, reduce the
catch’s pressure by completely removing the upper
ball and backing off the adjustment as far as possi-
ble on the lower ball. Screw the male baseplate to
the door (F). Advance the adjustment screws until
you get the amount of holding power you want (G).
You can roughly judge for equal pressure at the top
and bottom by noting the position of the setscrews
relative to the housing. The completed installation is
neat, functional, and adjustable (H).

Flush Bolt
Installing a flush bolt into the edge or back side
of a cabinet door is not an easy task because
there’s nowhere to hide any imperfections in the
wood-to-metal fit. To make it even more difficult,
you also need to cut a mortise into the end grain
of the door’s stile. And if you go through all the
steps to achieve a great fit, you then hide your
careful craftsmanship—literally behind a locked
door. Whenever possible, I’ll choose another
method of securing a door. But sometimes, you
simply have to install a flush bolt, so here’s how
to do it. 
Before you order a flush bolt, check its dimen-
sions carefully. The bolt in this demonstration has
a maximum thickness of 3⁄4 in. at the top mortise,
so that part would have poked through the front
of a 3⁄4-in.-thick door. Fortunately, I was working
with a 1-in.-thick door (A). Place the bolt on its
side on the stile. Using a square, ensure that the
end of the bolt is flush with the end of the stile,
and mark the lower end of the bolt. Looking at
the bolt from the side (B), you’ll see that when 
I set the router bit deep enough for the groove 
to house the spring, the mounting post for the
screw would lose contact with the bottom of 
the mortise. To make up the difference, I figured
that I’d have to add several no. 8 washers below
the post. 
Set the fence on your router, and cut the mortise
to final depth by making several shallow passes
(C). Use a chisel to square the end of the mortise
(D). Test-fit the bolt into the mortise, chiseling
the mortise wider, if necessary, until the surface
of the bolt is flush with the rear face of the door.
At this point, the end of the bolt can’t reach the
lower end of the mortise because you need to

cut the mortise into the top of the door. Use a
sharp crafts or utility knife to scribe the end of
the bolt into the top of the door (E). Chisel the
mortise to fit the top end of the bolt (F). You’ll
need an extremely sharp chisel to make smooth
cuts into the end grain. 
Place the bolt into position, mark the center-
points of the attachment screws (G), and drill
pilot holes. Remove the bolt, add washers under
the screw post if necessary, and fasten it (H).
After hanging the door, mark the end of the bolt
with correction fluid (I) and press the bolt against
the carcase to transfer the hole location to the
cabinet (J). Drill a hole that’s about 1⁄16 in. larger
than the diameter of the bolt. Position the strike
plate around the hole, drill pilot holes for the
screws, and drive them. Trace the perimeter of
the strike plate with a crafts knife to scribe its
location onto the carcase. Using a chisel, mortise
the strike plate flush with the wood.

Cam Lock 
When you buy a cam lock, make certain that its
body length suits the thickness of the door stock
you’re using. The lock in this installation is
adjustable for panels 3⁄4 in. through 13⁄8 in. thick,
so the first step is to screw the flange in or out
to match the thickness of your door (A). The
spring-loaded black detents ride up and over the
threaded part of the barrel as you rotate the
flange. Make sure that the detents rest on the
flats of the barrel when you’ve completed the
adjustment. For the 3⁄4-in.-thick door I used, I had
to move the flange to the full forward position. I
chose to use the straight cam (also called the
tail) for this installation instead of the cranked
cam that the factory attached to the lock. 
Use a nutdriver (B) to swap the cams. At this
point, don’t worry about which of the four possi-
ble cam-mounting positions to use—lightly snug
the nut with the cam seated in any position. To
determine the mounting position on the door,
measure the distance from the center of the
mounting bolt to the tip of the cam (C). With
this measurement, you can finalize the design
of your door. The drawing at right shows how I
positioned the lock in relation to the side of the
carcase. 
To accommodate the lock body plus the
escutcheon for this lock, use your drill press and
a Forstner bit to drill a 3⁄4-in. hole into the stile of
your door (D). Remove the cam so it won’t be in
your way as you center the lock body in the hole.
I like to position the lock so the teeth on the key
point downward as the key goes into the lock,
but it will function just as well if inverted. Partially
insert the press-fit escutcheon, and use a

self-centering punch to mark the centerpoints of
the mounting holes (E). Drill pilot holes and drive
screws into the rear face of the stile to fasten the
flange to the stile. Positioning the lock over the
open vise on your workbench is an easy way to
provide clearance for the lock and escutcheon
while you drive the screws (F).
As a rule of thumb, you want to position the cam
so that turning the key counterclockwise engages
the cam (G). I wanted a carcase-to-stile gap of
approximately 1⁄16 in., so I taped samples of plastic
laminate to the carcase to establish this spacing.
If you can access the interior of the cabinet with
the door in place, you can directly mark the posi-
tion where the upper end of the cam contacts
the carcase (H). If you can’t mark directly, paint
the tip of the cam with correction fluid purchased
from an office-supply store. Also make a mark on
the carcase to indicate the lower end of the cam.

slot. Check the action of the lock to ensure that
the cam easily engages the slot (J). Finger pres-
sure is enough to press the escutcheon onto the

Full-Mortise Lock
To make it easy to center your router bit across
the thickness of the chest’s upper front edge,
draw the centerline onto a piece of white mask-
ing tape. Chuck a centering tool into your router
and adjust the router’s edge guide until the tool’s
tip perfectly matches the centerline (A). Remove
the tape, and mark the ends of the lock’s selvage
onto the chest’s edge. (Selvage is the edge of
the lock that’s visible after installation.) Change to
a bit that equals the width of the selvage
(3⁄8 in. in this case), and rout the mortise (B).
Clamping a piece of scrap wood to the rear edge
of the chest’s front stabilizes the router’s base by
giving it a larger bearing surface. (The next photo
gives you a clearer view of this scrap wood sup-
port.) Turn the lock upside down, and test-fit it to
check the length and depth of the mortise (C).
Carefully measure to the centerpoint of the lock’s
keyhole (D), and transfer that point to the front of
the chest. Drill a hole (5⁄16 in. for this lock) halfway
through the chest’s front (E). Put a piece of mask-
ing tape onto the lock, and use a crafts knife with
a new blade to cut the outline of the keyway (F).
Carefully transfer the masking tape to the front of
the chest, aligning the cutout with the hole you
already drilled and making sure that the taped
shape is vertical. Drill a hole (9⁄32 in. for this lock) at
the lower end of the keyway to remove the
majority of the waste, then chisel away the
remainder and discard the tape (G).

Drilling out the mortise for the lock’s body is easy
when you use a self-centering doweling jig (this
one is manufactured by Dowl-It) (H). The jig helps
you drill overlapping holes that are vertical and a
consistent depth. Drill holes (5⁄16 in. for this lock) at
the ends of the mortise first, then work toward
the center. Clear out the remaining waste with a
chisel (I), and test-fit the lock body into the mor-
tise. Aim for an easy sliding entry without any
binding. Drill pilot holes, and screw the lock body
into position (J). Use the key to move the bolt
into the locked position, and put small pieces of
double-faced tape onto the selvage to hold the
strike plate and its screws in position. Make cer-
tain that the strike plate is centered front to back
and fully engaged under the bolt’s hook (K).
Lower the chest’s lid until the tips of the screws
mark their location on the underside of the lid (L).
Remove the lid from the chest, and put it onto
your workbench. Draw a centerline between the
two screw tip marks, put the strike into position,
and mark the ends of its opening. To create clear-
ance for the bolt’s hook, make secondary marks
1⁄4 in. beyond the strike plate’s opening (M).
Technically speaking, you need clearance only at
one end of the strike for this lock, but it’s faster
to mark both ends than to figure out the correct
one. Attach an edge guide to your laminate trim-
mer or router to cut the 1⁄4-in. slot 3⁄8 in. deep for
the strike (N). Drill pilot holes, and fasten the
strike in place. For a chest, I prefer not to mortise
the strike because the metal’s thickness creates
a single contact area between the strike in the lid
and the body of the lock. This helps ensure
secure locking action even if the lid slightly

Surface-Mounted
Escutcheon 
Driving a couple of escutcheon pins sounds like
no big deal until you realize that these delicate
small-gauge fasteners are no match for many
hardwoods. Get around this problem by installing
softwood plugs to accept the escutcheon pins.
The first important step is to make gravity your
working partner by placing a chest onto its back
when you install an escutcheon. Put the key
through the escutcheon and into the lock (A).
Carefully center the escutcheon around the key’s
shaft, and make sure that the keyway’s centerline
is perpendicular to the edge of the chest’s front.
Use a scratch awl through the escutcheon’s holes
to mark the chest, and use a pencil to mark the
area of the wood that’s visible through the key-
way. Blacken inside the penciled outline with a
fine-tipped permanent marker (Sanford’s Sharpie
is one brand) to give the escutcheon a neater
appearance (B).
Drill holes at the centerpoints you marked, and
glue in 1⁄4-in. lengths of a wood kitchen matchstick
(C). A 7⁄64-in. bit produced a snug fit for the match
I used, a toothpick was the right scale as a glue
applicator, and a tack hammer drove in the plugs.
Use a scratch awl to mark the centerpoints of the
softwood plugs (D). Put the escutcheon back into
position. You’ll be able to feel when the tip of the
escutcheon mates with the dimpled centerpoint.
Holding the pin with miniature long-nose pliers
saves your fingers from taps of the tack hammer
(E). The completed escutcheon protects the front
of the chest from key damage (F). Compare this
photo to photo A and you’ll see how blackening
the wood behind the keyway gives the
escutcheon a sharper look.

Flush Escutcheon
Inlaying a flush escutcheon is an exercise in care-
ful workmanship that will reward the patient
woodworker with a precise wood-to-metal fit.
This demonstration will show how to install an
escutcheon into a drawer front that later receives
a surface-mounted lock behind it. Whether work-
ing on drawers or doors, I like to cut all of the
joints and test-fit the assembly, then inlay the
escutcheon before glue-up. It’s much easier to
work with an individual component rather than to
struggle with the bulk of a completed assembly.
To make the layout marks easy to see, put a
piece of white masking tape at the installation
site. I pack the interior of the escutcheon with
Plasti-Tak to keep it from slipping while marking
the outline with a fine mechanical pencil (A).
Plasti-Tak is the brand name of a rubbery low-tack
plastic adhesive sold in office-supply stores and
crafts shops. It’s generally used for no-mark
mounting of posters onto walls and similar hold-
ing tasks. 
Drill a pilot hole through your workpiece, and
insert a scrollsaw or fretsaw blade through the
opening (B). I used a no. 9 scrollsaw blade and
cut about one blade width to the waste side of
the pencil line. To check your progress as you fit
the metal, position the escutcheon and hold the
wood up to a light (C). Use a file to remove wood
where the light doesn’t show. A round and trian-
gular file will let you follow the keyhole shape
(D). Keep the walls of the cutout vertical if possi-
ble, or undercut only a couple of degrees. When
the cutout matches the escutcheon, file a 1⁄16-in.
chamfer along the rear perimeter of the
escutcheon to ease its entry into the wood.
Remove the masking tape so it doesn’t get
caught between the escutcheon and the wood.

Start the escutcheon by hand squarely into its
opening, and press it flush with a handscrew
clamp or wood-faced vise (E). If there are any
gaps between the wood and metal, mix up a
slurry of sawdust and glue (or epoxy), and pack it
firmly into the gaps with a plastic putty knife (F).
Let the glue dry before moving to the next step.
Using 100-grit sandpaper in a block, sand the
wood and brass escutcheon until they are flush.
Repeat with 220- and 400-grit sandpaper to mini-
mize the appearance of scratches (G). Thoroughly
dust or vacuum the drawer front to remove all
dust. Apply finish to the metal and wood after
assembling the drawer, being careful that liquid
doesn’t pool in the keyway. The
completed installation is a seamless wood-to-
metal fit (H).

T
he sight of a collapsing table
and chairs with arms, legs, and food
going in every direction is an
absolutely hilarious gag—in the movies. But
replay the scene in your home in the middle
of Thanksgiving dinner, and the humor
drains out of it very quickly.
Safety and strength are only two of the
reasons you need to know about the wide
range of choices in table, chair, and leg hard-
ware. With the innovative hardware on the
market today, you can build function and
versatility into your furniture: tables that rise,
expand, or level themselves. Or you can make
chairs that swivel, rock, or simply stand rock-
steady. In addition, choosing the right hard-
ware can save you time and money.
For example, shopmade wood “buttons”
are a traditional way of holding a tabletop
firmly to the apron while still permitting sea-
sonal expansion and contraction of the top
across the grain. Even though these buttons
look quite simple, making them involves two
setups at the table saw, one at the miter saw,
and another at the drill press. Unless you like
to impress your customers or yourself with
how little metal you put into your projects,
you could better use your time by crafting a
detail that’s visible without crawling under
the table with a flashlight in hand. The photo
at left on the facing page shows wood but-
tons and inexpensive metal alternatives that
also permit movement in solid-wood tops.

SECTION 5 OVERVIEW
Manufactured panels such as plywood and
MDF have such excellent dimensional sta-
bility that you don’t really need the figure-8
fasteners or Z-clips for their ability to adapt
to movement. In tabletop sizes, these mate-
rials move such a small amount that you can
ignore it. But you can still use tabletop fas-
teners with these materials and enjoy the
benefits of speed, economy, and convenience.
Folding-Leg Hardware 
Legs that fold are handy for a wide variety of
tables. Folding tubular-leg assemblies are easy
to install and let you quickly build a ban-
quet/utility table and matching benches from
plywood or solid stock. If you prefer the look
of folding individual legs, you can choose
tubular steel or brackets that accommodate
square wood legs that you make. The bracket
shown at right below handles wood legs that
range from 11⁄4 in. to 13⁄4 in. square.
Expanding-Table Hardware 
Making a table is a good idea. Making a
table that can get bigger is an even better
idea. One familiar mechanism is made for a
four-legged table, and its operation typically
You can attach a tabletop with (from left)
shopmade wood buttons, figure-8
fasteners, or tabletop Z-clips.
Whether you need a table or
bench indoors or outside,

involves a person at each end of the table,
dragging the legs across the floor as the cen-
ter of the table opens to accept a leaf or two.
But when you have a pedestal table, you need
an equalizer slide. One person can operate
this type because pulling on one end of the
table pushes the opposite side open so that
the table doesn’t tip. But beyond these two
familiar types of slides, you’ll find a number
of other extension devices. Buy a geared alu-
minum table slide, and you can expand a
four-legged table without dragging the feet.
The apron of the table also stays intact as the
equalizer mechanism simultaneously pulls
and pushes to divide the tabletop.
There are two more extensions that are
little known but highly useful. Instead of
splitting the table in the center, both of
these mechanisms add space at the ends of
the table. The parson’s table extension stores
a leaf below each end. Simply pull on the
leaf and it extends, then moves upward, flush

you the time and uncertainty of engineering
and making your own slides. Walter of
Wabash is one company that offers custom
extensions.
If you build an extension table, you’ll also
need hardware to keep the halves aligned
and locked when closed as well as pins that
join the leaves to the top. You can choose
table pins in plastic, wood, and brass, and
that sequence also describes the upward
price progression. Tabletop eveners are
another product that can be used instead of
pins or in addition to them. Personally, I
prefer table pins, especially for removable
leaves because the metal edges of the eveners
could cause cuts. But the eveners are handy
as a corrective measure to help cure align-
ment of a sagging leaf.
Most people install a lock to keep the
table latched in the closed position, but you
can also attach locks to the leaf so that the
top is also secured in the open position.
When you shop for a table lock, the most
important question you need to ask is how
easy it is to operate strictly by feel. The fork
design with the U-shaped keeper is pro-
moted as extremely traditional and very
British. But I wonder how long you’re sup-
posed to fumble around trying to insert the
loose piece into both catches before you give
up and crawl under the table.
Drop-Leaf Supports 
Drop leaves are another popular way to
expand the size of a tabletop. But to be cer-
tain that the leaf doesn’t drop unexpectedly,
choose a pair of sturdy supports for each

with the rest of the tabletop. Depending on
the model you choose, you’ll gain 11 in. or
16 in. at each end. The final slide is gener-
ally used with trestle tables that have false
breadboard ends connected to the main table
surface by the slides. You then insert a leaf
between the breadboard end and the table.
You can solve most expanding-table prob-
lems with off-the-shelf solutions, but if you
run into the need for special extensions, you
can have them custom manufactured, saving

leaf. If there’s no apron, you can choose a
pullout support that has great strength and
reliability. Purchase an all-metal pullout, or a
bracket that lets you add your own wood
support. You can also purchase folding sup-
ports for a table with or without an apron.
The supports come in a variety of sizes, with
extended lengths of 6 in. to 12 in.
Tables That Tilt and Rise 
If you’re one of the millions of people who
hunch over the coffee table to eat dinner in

closer to you. Then you can eat without
banging your knees or bending over.
Tilt-top tables have always been a favorite
among draftsmen, artists, and architects. The
traditional support features a rod that’s
locked by turning a knurled knob. The usual
mounting spot is one-third of the distance
from the back of the tabletop. Moving it
further forward increases the maximum lift
angle. The lift-up ratchet support allows you
the advantages of a tilting top without the
hassle of running back and forth between
the ends of the table to adjust the hardware.
Simply lift and release the top to select any
of 13 positions. To close the top, lift slightly
to disengage the mechanism. Choose the
range of motion you want by moving the
support toward or away from the pivot
point. Other uses for the ratcheting support
include adjustable bookstands and backs for
reclining chairs. If you build a chaise lounge
for outdoor use, be sure to secure the sup-
port with galvanized or stainless steel screws.
The latch shown at top has a
built-in alignment feature; the
lock at center is another no-look
fastener. The forked design
shown at bottom is long on
tradition but short on user-
friendliness.
You can use the first three supports shown for a table without an
apron. If your table has an apron, choose the support shown at
far right.

SECTION 5 OVERVIEW
Corner Leg Braces 
Corner braces do an amazing job of
strengthening apron-to-leg joints in both
tables and chairs. The 3-in.-wide kerf-
mount variety is primarily used in new con-
struction, and the 21⁄2-in. surface-mounted
type is easier to use for retrofits and repairs.
Corner braces are often shown in catalogs
with wing nuts, but I prefer to use standard
hex nuts unless I’m building a piece with
removable legs. You’ll also find corner braces
that are 17⁄16 in. wide, a handy size for build-
ing or reinforcing chairs.
Leg Tips 
Before you can truly say that you’ve com-
pleted a table, chair, or other furniture proj-
ect, you need to attach a tip, glide, or cush-
ion to the legs. These little pieces serve two
principal purposes: protecting your furniture
from the floor and the floor from your furni-
ture. Use a soft tip, typically thick felt, on
hard floor surfaces such as wood, ceramic
tile, and sheet vinyl. But when you place fur-
niture on carpet or rugs, use a hard tip such

drafting table support (left) or the ratcheting mechanism.
Corner braces are inexpensive, easy to install, and

as metal or nylon. Some people advocate
slippery Teflon glides for use on both hard
and soft surfaces, but I feel more confident
about the guideline of hard-on-soft and
soft-on-hard.
Putting nylon glides on outdoor furniture
serves another important purpose: By keep-
ing the end grain of legs out of standing
water, you help prevent water from wicking
into the wood to cause premature decay.
Leveling Tips 
Physicists merely theorize about the curva-
ture of space and time, but some of the
floors in my house serve as absolute proof.
That’s why leveling furniture tips are such
useful products. One choice is a simple lev-
eler that threads into a teenut or insert in
the bottom of the leg. To use these, you get
down on the floor and manually advance or
retract each leveler until all of them touch
the floor and the table is level. A more elab-
orate adaptation is the somewhat misnamed
self-leveling table glide. Its spring-loaded
mechanism automatically maintains contact
with the floor, while you keep your hands
and knees off the floor. Although this may
keep the table from rocking, these “levelers”
don’t actually level the table.
Glides screw on or thread into the bottom
of the leg. The self-leveling glide installed
on the leg is furnished with teenuts; with
the other glides you purchase the teenuts
separately.
Complete a table leg by screwing in a Teflon
glide, sticking on a heavy felt cushion, or
nailing in a nylon glide.

LEG-MOUNTING HARDWARE

Utility Table Legs 
Attaching fold-up legs for a utility table is an
extremely easy process. The following demon-
stration shows the construction of a plywood-
topped table that can be used for a variety of
tasks: as an assembly bench in the shop, as a
picnic table or potting bench in the backyard, or
as a fabric-cutting center or game table in a
hobby room. Add a tablecloth, and you instantly
have a buffet or dining table. Of course, you
don’t have to limit yourself to ordinary fir ply-
wood. With hardwood plywood or plastic lami-
nate, you can add durability and good looks. 
Begin by laying the plywood top face down on
your work surface, and center the folded-leg
assemblies side to side and 4 in. from each end
(A). To provide knee room for a person to sit at
the end of the table, you’ll need to make a table
that’s 8 ft. long, and position each leg bracket
16 in. from the plywood’s end.

screws through the brackets into the top (B).
Raise the legs to check that they work smoothly,
then lower them. Complete the ends of the legs
by adding the supplied plastic tips. Alternatively,
you can purchase plastic inserts and stem casters
to make your table mobile (C). You can use a hack-
saw to easily shorten the tubular metal legs to
compensate for the height added by the casters.

Corner Braces 
Place the tabletop face down on your work-
bench. After attaching the table aprons to the
legs, turn the assembly upside down on the
tabletop. Fold a 3-in. by 5-in. index card in half,
and place it between the brace and tabletop.
When you remove the card later, it creates a
small amount of clearance that ensures that
screws driven through the brace into the table-
top will pull the assembly together tightly. Mark
the centerpoints of the mounting holes on the
aprons, drill pilot holes, and drive screws to fas-
ten the brace (A).
Place one of the hanger bolts next to the drill bit
you’ll use to drill its pilot hole. Use masking tape
to make a depth-gauge flag on the bit (B). Put the
bit through the hole in the brace, and stop drilling
when the flag touches the brace (C). Next, put
two nuts onto the machine-threaded portion of
the hanger bolt, jamming them against each
other. Using a wrench on the uppermost nut,
drive the hanger bolt into the leg (D). When
you’ve finished driving the hanger bolt, remove
the top nut and tighten the remaining one against
the brace. Don’t overdo the torque or you’ll sim-
ply create unnecessary strain in the joint. This
step completes a joint that will keep your table
solid for generations (E). If you used a plywood
top, you can drive screws through the brace into
the tabletop to add one more element of
strength to the assembly.

Stem-Mounted Casters 
It’s easiest to install the housings for stem cast-
ers before you assemble the piece of furniture.
Draw diagonal lines on the end of your leg stock
to locate the centerpoint. Using a self-centering
doweling jig will help ensure that the hole is cen-
tered and vertical (A). Drill the hole 1⁄4 in. deeper
than the caster’s stem, not merely the insert.
The cutaway view (B) shows how the bulge on
the caster’s stem goes beyond the end of the
insert. Insert the housing into the hole, and bury
the prongs into the end of the leg with a sharp
hammer blow (C). Put masking tape over the
end of the insert to keep out chips, sawdust, and
finish that could affect the fit and function of the
caster (D). After you’ve assembled the furniture
and applied the finish, push on the caster to
snap it into place (E).
VARIATION Some people mount a roller
ball as if it were a caster, with all of the
workings visible. Other woodworrkers like
to partially conceal it in a counterbore. I
prefer to bury virtually the entire piece of
haardware into an extremely deep counter-
bore in the end of the leg. That way, the
table or cart seems tto mysteriously glide
over the floor without any visible means
of support. To do this, drill a counterbbore

Figure-8 Tabletop Fasteners 
Depending on the hardware catalog you’re using,
you’ll find that this piece of hardware uses a
number of aliases: desktop fasteners, figure-8
fasteners, or tabletop fasteners. But no matter
what they’re named, you’ll call them extremely
handy. You’ll attach one end of the fastener to
the top and the other end to the rail. Anchored at
these two points, the figure 8 can rotate to
accommodate the changing width of a solid-
wood top as it expands and contracts in
response to changes in humidity.
Most of the time, you’ll use hardware straight out
of the package. But every so often you’ll run into
items, like this batch of tabletop fasteners, that
you need to modify. In this case, the countersink
was poorly formed, and that would have affected
the function of the fastener. Rather than waste
the time returning the figure-8 fasteners, you can
complete the machining the factory should have
done (A).
Mark the inside center of the table’s end aprons,
and use a pocket-hole jig to drill an angled hole
and counterbore at each centerpoint (B). When
you drive these screws later, they will help to
keep the tabletop flat, firmly attached, and they
also equalize the expansion of a solid-wood top
on both sides of its centerline. With a top made
from a manufactured panel, such as plywood or
MDF, you can skip the pocket-hole step. 
Before you can drive the pocket-hole screws, you
need to create counterbores for the tabletop fas-
teners. Stand the base assembly on its feet, and
mark the location for the fasteners on the upper
edge of the aprons. For a top the size of a kitchen
WARNING
Don’t try to hold a

table, you’ll use 10 fasteners. Mark for two on
each end apron, 2 in. from the inner corner of the
leg, and three on each side apron, again 2 in.
from the leg and one centered on the apron’s
length. You’ll need to drill some test counterbores
in scrap stock to determine the distance of the
centerpoint from the inner edge of the apron
stock that gives the figure-8 fastener a wide
range of rotation. Using a Forstner bit, drill a
counterbore at each location on the apron, drilling
1⁄32 in. deeper than the thickness of the fastener
(C). This slight bit of extra depth will help pull the
tabletop down snugly. By the way, if your table
has extremely thin aprons, you can counterbore
the smaller portion of the figure-8 fastener and
still get the same range of motion. 
[TIP]
Before you install the figure-8 
fasteners, give them and the counterbores
a quick coat of paste wax. TThis will help
the fasteners move freely as the top
expands and contracts.
Drill pilot holes for the mounting screws centered
in the counterbores, and screw the figure-8 fas-
teners in place (D). You need to torque the flat-
head screws very carefully: snug enough that the
fastener doesn’t rattle up and down but loose
enough so that it can rotate freely. Put the table-
top face down on your workbench, center the
table’s base on it, and drive the pocket-hole
screws (E). Align the fasteners perpendicular to
the end apron and at a 45-degree angle to the
side aprons (F). The fasteners on the side apron
should make a V-shape with the fasteners on the
opposite apron. Drill pilot holes into the top, and
drive the round-head screws, but do not over-
tighten them.

Z-Clip Tabletop Fasteners 
This little piece of hardware does a better job of
accommodating wood movement than figure-8
fasteners and requires only half as many pilot
holes and screws, so it’s also a time and money
saver. The fastener, also called a Z-clip because
of its shape, fits into a 1⁄8--in. groove that’s 3⁄8 in.
deep along the top inner edge of the aprons. To
locate the groove on the apron, temporarily
screw a clip to a piece of scrap wood and meas-
ure the distance to the top of the fastener (A).
Set your rip fence at this distance from the inner
edge of the blade and cut the groove (B). This
procedure positions the groove slightly lower (by
the thickness of the metal) than the offset of the
fastener, and that creates a bit of tension to pull
the tabletop flush against the apron when you
drive the screws later. 
After assembling the table’s aprons and base,
mark the inside center of the table’s end aprons,
and use a pocket-hole jig to drill an angled hole
and counterbore at each centerpoint. Pocket-hole
screws at these points help to keep the tabletop
flat and firmly attached, and their placement
equalizes the expansion of a solid-wood top on
both sides of its centerline. If you have a top
made from a manufactured panel, such as ply-
wood or MDF, you can skip the pocket-hole step. 
The standard setup of a pocket-hole jig can make
the angled counterbore break through the groove
in the apron (C). That could mean that the tip of
your pocket-hole screw would reach through the
tabletop. Avoid that problem by drilling a shallower
counterbore. Holding a strip of 1⁄4-in. hardboard

between the drill’s depth collar and the jig’s body
is a fast fix that raises the counterbore (D). Put
the tabletop face down on your workbench, cen-
ter the table’s base on it, and drive the pocket-
hole screws (E). On the end aprons, position a
fastener about 2 in. from the inner edge of each
leg. Slide the fastener into the groove in the
apron, mark and drill the pilot hole, then drive the
round-head screw (F). Don’t overdo the torque on
the screw or the fastener won’t slide easily from
side to side. 
For the side aprons, position a fastener 2 in. from
each leg and in the center. The fasteners in the
side aprons work on a completely different basis:
Instead of gliding from side to side, they move in
and out of the groove. Based on that knowledge,
position these fasteners so that they will have
space to move in the groove. If the moisture con-
tent of the wood is high, as in spring and sum-
mer in the northern hemisphere, place the fasten-
er so that it grips two-thirds of the depth of the
groove. As the wood contracts, the fastener will
still have a grip in the groove. Reverse your think-
ing if the wood is drier, which usually occurs in
heated shops during the fall and winter. In that
case, screw in the fastener so that it grips only
one-third the depth of the groove. Again, don’t
apply too much muscle when you tighten the
round-head screw—just enough to hold the fas-
tener in the groove.

There’s no absolute rule that governs how far
you should place the slide from the edge of the
tabletop, but 4 in. to 6 in. is a reasonable range.
Wood extension slides are typically shipped from
the factory already lubricated with tallow. You’ll
want to be sure to keep this greasy stuff away
from unfinished wood to avoid potential finishing
problems. And because there’s no need to apply
finish to wood extension slides anyway, you’ll
avoid difficulties by installing the slides after
you’ve applied the finish to the top.
You can install extension slides before or after
joining the leg structures to the tabletop halves.
To make things easier for you to see, this demon-
stration will show installation before adding the
legs. If you follow a similar path for your table,
draw the outline of the aprons and pedestals or
legs on the underside of the tabletop (A). By fol-
lowing this simple precaution, you’ll eliminate
guesswork and potential mistakes. 
Another potential error you’ll want to avoid is
using the wrong screw size to fasten the exten-
sions: too short, and you’ll sacrifice strength; too
long, and you’ll have to make a new tabletop. The
slides I used are drilled and counterbored to use
#10 x 11⁄2-in. screws for proper penetration into a
3⁄4-in.-thick top (B). In the photo, you’ll notice in
the end view of the slide that the manufacturer
cut a shallow groove along the edge of the slide
that meets the underside of the top. This is called
a back-out groove, and it provides clearance for
wood fibers raised from the top when you drive
the screws. Otherwise, the fibers would lift the
slide, creating a jacked joint.
Begin by butting together the two halves of your
tabletop face down on your workbench. To make
sure that they don’t move, use wood handscrew
clamps to hold the edges flush. Use a framing
square to position the slide at a right angle to the
joint line. Drive the screw in the hole nearest the

joint first, then skip to the hole at the far end of
that same strip (C). You’ll drive screws in the
remaining holes later, after you’ve checked that
the slide works perfectly. Fully close this first
slide, then open it about 1⁄2 in. That will ensure
that the slide won’t bottom out before it is fully
closed. Drive two screws through this strip of the
slide into the opposite half of the tabletop (D).
To ensure that the second slide is parallel to the
first, roughly position it by measurement, then rip
a plywood spacer to fit between the slides (E).
By butting the second slide against the spacer,
you eliminate tedious measuring and ensure that
the slides are parallel to each other. After you’ve
installed two screws into each of the two mount-
ing strips of the second slide, check the action of
the top. When you’re satisfied with the motion,
drive the remaining screws. Although you could
consider the job complete at this point, makers of
better-quality tables reinforce the slides with rub
blocks that you can make from 3-in. lengths of
3⁄4-in. quarter-round molding (F). They’re called rub
blocks because you coat their edges with glue,
then rub them back and forth until the glue grabs,
eliminating the need for clamping. Using a self-
centering doweling jig and dowel centers simpli-
fies the process of installing table pins into the
top halves and the leaf (G).

POP-UP TABLE HARDWARE

Pop-Up Table Mechanism
The manufacturer states that the spring-
counterbalanced mechanism is designed for a 
top with an optimum weight of 20 lb. To choose
between a top of birch plywood or MDF, I weighed
a 1-ft. square of each material and calculated the
weight of the top (A). At 3 pounds per square foot
(psf), the MDF would have been considerably over-
weight. The birch plywood, weighing about 1.75 psf,
would make a top about 5 lb. too light, but I figured
that I could add an MDF square under the birch to
increase the total weight if necessary. 
The mechanism is reversible, so you can screw
either side to the top, centering it side to side and
end to end (C). Calculate the size of any additional
weight needed, and screw it to the top within the
perimeter of the mechanism. Drive two screws
through the mechanism into the base, and test the
action of the hardware (D). You’ll notice in the photo
that I mounted the mechanism onto riser strips. The
extra storage room in my base design made the
strips necessary because its depth exceeded the
33⁄4 in. needed by the mechanism. If you don’t use
riser strips in your design, you may want to anchor
the mechanism by driving machine screws into
teenuts inserted in the base. If the top descends so
rapidly that it slams, cut down the size of the coun-
terweight. If the top doesn’t want to stay fully
closed, add weight to the top.
CAUTION
Get a firm grip on 
the mechanism before you cut the 
shipping strap holding it closed (B).
Otherwisee, the spring tension will 
make it jump open.

ome woodworking catalogs will
have a section devoted to knockdown
(KD) fittings, while other catalogs will
call identical hardware ready to assemble
(RTA). In reality, there seems to be less real
difference between these categories than in
the debate over whether the glass is half
empty or half full. If there is a subtle distinc-
tion, “ready to assemble” gives a slightly
more positive marketing connotation to a
box of boards.
On a more practical side, the furniture
designer and builder should base hardware
decisions on the structural requirements of
the project, the tooling required to make and
assemble the joints, and whether the hard-
ware will be used for one-time construction
or repeated setup and dismantling. In addi-
tion, some hardware is completely concealed
within the carcase, whereas fittings that are
visible from the outside can be—depending
on your viewpoint—either decorative or
distracting.
Threaded Inserts and Teenuts
When you put metal threads into wood, you
create a firm anchor point for hardware or
provide an easy way to quickly assemble a
project and take it apart. You can select from
a wide range of threaded inserts and teenuts,
and each style comes in a variety of internal
thread sizes. Install barbed inserts by press-
ing with a clamp or tapping with a hammer.
The standard style is installed flush with the
121

SECTION 6 OVERVIEW
surface, whereas the collared variety, which
offers additional pull-through resistance, will
stand proud of the surface unless you drill a
counterbore. You’ll find threaded inserts in
both steel and brass. Although brass is
softer, it’s a must to prevent rust in outdoor
projects and also helps prevent fastener
stains due to chemical reaction with the
wood in both interior and exterior projects.
The barbed teenut is easy to install,
although you may need to drill pilots for the
barbs in hardwoods. Again, you can counter-
bore for a flush installation. The screw-on
teenut provides a solid anchoring point for a
leveling glide in the bottom of a leg.
When you shop for threaded inserts,
you’ll discover that they are designated by
the size of the internal machine screw
thread. That tells you what size fastener you
can attach to it. But you also need to know
the hole size to drill into the wood. Refer to
the chart on p. 127 for that information.
The recommended hole sizes are the
engineering ideal to provide maximum pull-
out resistance. However, you may find that
cheating up 1⁄64 in. to the next larger drill
size may make installation considerably
easier, especially in end-grain applications.
Cross Bolts, Chicago Bolts, and
Knockdown Panel Connectors 
Installing a cross bolt is an easy way to make
a knockdown joint with excellent shear
strength. Ask an engineer, and he’ll define
shear as the force that is parallel to the plane
of connection of two parts. For example, if
the connections between the ends of a shelf
and the sides of a bookcase have inadequate
shear strength, the fasteners will bend or
break (literally shear apart) and the loaded
shelf will crash to the bottom of the case.
It’s easy to put metal threads into wood with this lineup
of threaded inserts and teenuts. The size designation for
these fasteners refers to the internal thread.
When you need a strong panel-to-shelf connection,
choose a cross bolt (left) for a joint that relies on
threads to secure it, or knockdown fasteners (center
and right) that tighten as you turn a cam.
Assembly, Knockdown, and Mounting Hardware
122

SECTION 6 OVERVIEW
You’ll also find knockdown fittings that
are variations of the cross-dowel concept,
using a connector with an internal cam to
capture the head of a bolt and pull it snug.
A panel connector is specifically made for
joining bookcases and cabinets with 3⁄4-in.-
thick sides. A hammer tap seats the knurled
end of the shaft to resist rotation as you
tighten the screw. Chicago bolts, sometimes
known as threaded bolts, also provide excel-
lent shear strength for face-joined panels
and come in a variety of lengths. The bolts
fit in 1⁄4-in. holes and are available in six
length increments to handle connection
chores from 13⁄16 in. to 29⁄16 in. Each bolt has
a range of adjustment of 6 mm (about 1⁄4
in.). Both the Chicago bolt and the panel
connectors have a large-diameter unthreaded
shaft spanning the joint, and that’s what
provides outstanding shear strength.
Connector bolts are available in a variety
of metric lengths from approximately
13⁄16 in. to slightly more than 31⁄2 in., all
of which work with a cap nut.
A knockdown panel connector is an
extremely useful piece of hardware for mak-
ing joints that hold securely but come apart
easily by removing a screw. An additional
advantage over many other knockdown
fasteners is that this piece of hardware dis-
creetly hides inside the cabinet. Both parts
are surface mounted, so installation is quick
and easy. If you need one more reason to try
this tough plastic fastener, you can also use a
pair of them as rustproof pivots or hinges.
Cabinet-Hanging Hardware 
Hanging cabinets onto a wall can be an
experience that makes you wish you knew
how to grow another hand or two. But if
your walls are reasonably straight and plumb,
there are a couple of pieces of hardware that
can make the process very easy. One solution
is a pair of interlocking steel cleats—screw
one level on the wall, and bolt the other
The panel connector (top), Chicago bolt
(second from top), and connector bolts (the
two fasteners at bottom) may look similar
at first glance, but not all knockdown fas-
teners are created equal. 
This tough plastic panel connector provides
a knockdown joint that’s concealed inside
the cabinet.

you to align the faces of a series of cabinets.
The second type of cabinet hanger mounts
to the top of the cabinet and provides an
impressive amount of adjustment in three
axes: 1⁄2 in. side to side, 1⁄4 in. up and down,
and 1 in. toward or away from the wall.
More Wall-Mounting Choices 
After you’ve invested time into the construc-
tion of a wall-mounted project, you want 
to make certain that it doesn’t crash to the
floor. For light-duty applications, such as 
a small picture frame, you can select a saw-
tooth hanger that gives you lateral adjust-
ment on a nail in the wall. Upholstery tacks
are a fast way to attach these hangers. But 
to gain more security for larger frames as
well as shelves and cabinets, choose a hanger
that will let you drive a screw or two deeply
into the carcase. Whenever possible, attach
the hangers to the rear edge of the sides and
not merely to the top.
Interlocking Connectors 
There’s a group of interlocking connectors
that relies on wedging action to join cabinet
components to each other or to mount them
onto a wall. Attach a keyhole fitting to one
piece, and it will capture a screw that slightly
projects from the other part. Taper connec-
tors are strong enough to hang a cabinet on
a wall or to interlock parts, such as a rail-to-
post connection for a bed frame. The more
weight you apply to a taper connector, the
tighter it becomes. Another style of inter-
locking connector utilizes pieces of sheet
metal that mate together to invisibly and
securely hang curio cabinets, speakers, mir-
rors, and many other items. A right-angle 
Two helpers for wall-cabinet installation are shown.
One type uses a metal bracket and plastic cam to 
provide three-axis adjustment, and the other uses 
interlocking cleats to make cabinet hanging as easy 
as putting a picture on the wall.
The triangle-shaped wire hanger is strong and versatile.
Use the sawtooth hanger for small picture frames and
the larger hangers for wall-mounted clocks, shelves, and

through the cabinet back, which should be
recessed 3⁄8 in. to provide clearance for the
hardware. Then you simply lift the cabinet,
lower it onto the cleat, and let gravity take
over from there. This system is very useful
for an individual cabinet, but the irregulari-
ties in most walls would make it difficult for

version of this style can be used for light-
duty shelves.
Hanger Bolts and
Dowel Screws 
Hanger bolts and dowel screws appear simi-
lar at first glance, but a closer look shows
you that a dowel screw has wood threads on
both ends, whereas the hanger bolt has
wood threads on one end and machine screw
threading on the other. Some typical uses for
the dowel screw include creating a large col-
umn, such as a bedpost, from a number of
shorter pieces or adding a wood finial to the
top of an assembly.
You’ll use a hanger bolt for applications
where you need a machine thread connection
to add a nut or other threaded fastener. One
typical application is a corner block that’s
used to reinforce table and chair construction.
You can drive hanger bolts with a wrench and
two nuts jammed against each other, but a
hanger bolt driver that fits your drill is much
faster. A specialized knob hanger bolt has 8 to

32 threads on one end to match most cabinet
knobs. Locking-grip pliers enable you to
drive a dowel screw into the first piece of
your assembly, and you can then screw the
first piece into the second part by hand.
You’ll need to drill pilot holes for the
wood threaded portions of both types of 
fastener. Referring to the drawing below,
select a pilot drill bit that equals or is slightly
larger than the fastener’s root diameter.

The hanger bolt driver in the drill speeds installation of
hanger bolts. Machine screw threads on these fasteners
enable you to use a hex, square, or wing nut. The tiny
fastener shown in the center is a knob hanger bolt. The
dowel screws shown at right excel at wood-to-wood
joinery. 
Knockdown Molding
Connectors
Sometimes you’d like to be able to add infill
strips or moldings to a knockdown assembly,
but you’d also prefer that these pieces not
require on-site carpentry. If you use Klick
knockdown fasteners, you’ll be able to add
moldings with your bare hands. A dovetail
slot routed into the back of the molding
securely clips onto the fasteners mounted on
the carcase. One type of fitting is simply
screwed to the surface of the carcase, where-
as the other mounts in a groove routed into
the carcase. This dovetail groove may be
continuous or individual stopped slots.
Klick knockdown
fasteners allow you
to simply snap
moldings into place,
giving knockdown
furniture an addi-
tional element of
style without visible
fasteners.

Countertop Seam Connectors 
Sometimes it’s actually true that an item isn’t
really heavy; it’s simply awkward to handle.
But in the case of plastic-laminate counter-
tops, the pieces have an extra helping of
both heavy and awkward. Traditional clamp-
ing techniques aren’t much help when it
comes to joining runs of countertops, espe-
cially along a miter joint. So several specialty
connectors evolved to fit this need. One type
requires you to drill holes into both the
edges and bottom face of the countertop. At
assembly, you must then thread the bolts as
you align the countertop sections. As a mat-
ter of personal preference, I choose a differ-
ent style: one that fits into recesses milled in
the bottom surface by the countertop fabri-
cator. It saves the hassle of drilling the holes
and there are also fewer individual hardware
components to juggle.

Knockdown Corner Fitting 
Blum manufactures this style of knockdown fit-
ting in two sizes, for installation into panels that
have a thickness of 16 mm (5⁄8 in.) or 19 mm
(3⁄4 in.). Installing both sizes involves the same
steps but slightly different dimensions. This
demonstration will show you how to use the
19-mm size to make a simple carcase.
At the top and bottom inner edges of the vertical
carcase members, strike a layout line 11⁄2 in. from
the front and back edges (A). Putting these
marks onto masking tape eliminates the chore of
erasing stray lines later. When you strip off the
tape after drilling, the marks disappear. Set up a
fence on your drill press, and drill 25 mm holes
that are13 mm (1⁄2 in.) deep and located 17.5 mm
(11⁄16 in.) from the end at each layout line. Start the
nylon press-in fitting into each hole by hand, mak-
ing sure that the line on it is parallel to the end of
the panel (B). Put the panel into your bench vise,
and tighten the screw until the insert is flush with
the surface of the panel (C).

Cross Dowels
The cross-dowel installation method shown here
is accurate and fast because it eliminates tedious
measurements and the errors that can creep in
when transferring dimensions from one part to
another. I’ll make a small carcase to illustrate
both corner and T-joints. 
Begin by cutting all of the carcase pieces to size,
making certain that the parts are identical in
width and have square ends. Onto the outside
faces of the sides mark the centerlines of the
top, bottom, and shelves. Mark a centerpoint
2 in. from the front and back edges, plus at any
intermediate points you want to add, and drill the
7⁄32-in. (or 6-mm) holes (A). Use your drill press to
ensure that the holes are perpendicular to the
face of the sides. Make the clamping jig shown in
the drawing at left. 
Using the jig, clamp one side and the bottom
together (B), making certain that the ends and
edges are flush and square. Using the holes in
the sides as guides, drill a 7⁄32-in. (or 6-mm) hole
into the edge of the bottom for the 5.4-mm-dia.
bolt. Be sure to drill at least 1⁄8 in. deeper than the
length of the bolt you’ll use so that the fastener
doesn’t bottom out in the hole before the joint is
tight. For the 50-mm bolt length used here, drill a
hole 21⁄8 in. deep. Before unclamping the pieces,
mark the lower face of the bottom with a piece of
masking tape. In addition, identify the parts so
that you’ll reassemble them in the same position. 
For an assembly that will always be against a
wall, simply write the part name or make your
identifying marks on the back edge of the parts
with a permanent marker. This identification is
necessary because you don’t have the huge
industrial machinery to crank out absolutely inter-
changeable pieces. As an advantage of this sys-
tem, though, your project is likely to fit together
much better than a piece of commercial knock-
down furniture. That’s because you are able to

custom-fit each part into its exact assembled
position when you mark and drill for the fasten-
ers, and you don’t have to hope that all of the
manufacturing tolerances will balance each other
to permit a perfect fit. Draw the centerline of the
stock’s thickness on the edges of fixed shelves,
and extend the centerlines of the shelves’ loca-
tions that you earlier marked on the carcase sides
to their edges. Match up these centerlines when
you use the clamping jig (C).
Transferring the cross-dowel location to the face
of the shelf board is quick and accurate when you
use the easy jig shown in the drawing at right. To
use the jig, simply insert the projecting bolt into
the hole in the end of the top, bottom, or shelf,
and use a scratch awl to mark the cross dowel’s
centerpoint (D). Set up a fence on your drill
press, and drill these 10-mm holes 5⁄8 in. deep (E).
As a note of caution, drill a test hole first because
you’re drilling most of the way through when
using 3⁄4-in. stock. Press the cross dowels into
their holes and reassemble the parts, threading
the bolt into the cross dowel. The line on the
cross dowel is parallel to the hole through it.
Use a hex key to tighten the fasteners (F). A
T-handle hex driver is easier on the hands than
an L-shaped key, but for real speed, you can
chuck a hex driver into your variable-speed drill.
Using a drill with adjustable clutch settings pre-
vents excessive torque and also is much easier
on your wrist. 
You’ll find cross dowels in a variety of sizes,
some large enough to securely hold a bed frame.

Minifix Fittings 
One of the advantages of Minifix fittings is the
absence of any visible hardware on the exterior
of the carcase. And with a jig you can purchase
from Rockler, installing the fittings into 3⁄4-in.-thick
stock is a quick and accurate process.
After you assemble the jig, hold it against the top
end of the side, positioning the edge of the jig
with the edge of the side (A). Use a pencil to
make a mark through the hole in the jig identified
“for 8-mm hole.” Repeat at each corner of the
sides. For a T-joint, such as for a fixed shelf, mark
the centerline of the shelf location on the inner
face of the side. Align the edge of the jig with the
centerline, and make a mark by putting your pen-
cil into the notch in the jig (B).
Adjust the jig’s clamp to the thickness of your car-
case components, and clamp it to the end of the
carcase’s bottom, with the edge of the jig flush
with the bottom’s edge. Make a pencil mark
through the hole in the jig identified “for 15-mm
hole” (C). The face with the mark on it is the
lower surface. To prevent mistakes as you mark
the horizontal members, identify this face with a
piece of masking tape. Put an 8-mm bit into the
bushing in the jig, and give it a few turns with
your drill so that the brad point enters the carcase
stock. Remove the drill and add a stop collar to
the bit so that the hole will be 11⁄32 in. deep.
Instead of juggling the collar and a rule at the
same time, I cut a spacer and put it between the
bushing and collar while I tightened the setscrew
(D). Drill the holes into the ends of the top, bot-
tom, and fixed shelves (E).

Chuck the 8-mm bit into your drill press, and set
the fence against the edge of the side so that the
bit is centered over one of the hole centerpoints.
Drill all of the holes for the bolts (F). Without
changing the position of the fence or drill-press
table, remove the 8-mm bit and chuck in the
15-mm bit. Drill holes for the cams at the marked
centerpoints in the top, bottom, and fixed shelves
(G). Lightly tap the bolts into the sides so that
the plastic collar is flush with the side (H). This
step engages plastic barbs against the walls of
the hole for a firm grip. Don’t drive the bolt past
the collar, or its bulb head may not engage the
cam at assembly. Push the cams into their holes,
and use a no. 3 Phillips screwdriver to turn the
cam so that the arrowhead on it points to the end
of the carcase member. (I highlighted the arrow-
head in the photo with white paint so you can
see it more clearly.) Insert the bolts into the end
of the board, and turn the cam to lock it against
the head of the bolt (I). As an optional finishing
touch, you can snap a plastic cap into the drive
slot to conceal the cam (J).

COUNTERTOP CONNECTORS

Countertop 
Joint Connector 
The countertop sections in this demonstration
were purchased at a home center with the
miters already cut and the substrate machined
for the joint connectors. Transport the sections
carefully to avoid damage. Begin by test-fitting
your countertop sections to make certain that
there are no gaps along the joint line and that the
surfaces of the pieces are reasonably flush. If
necessary, place shims under your countertop to
correct the alignment and give your countertop a
firm foundation. The assembly of this joint works
best with a two-person team: one working top-
side to keep the pieces aligned and flush, and
the other person working below to tighten the
connectors. 
Use a 1⁄2-in. acid brush to brush water-resistant
glue (Franklin’s Titebond II is one brand) onto both
sides of the joint (A), and push them
together by hand, carefully aligning the ends.
You’re using the glue primarily for its ability to
protect the substrate from swelling due to water
penetration. Although the glue provides some
holding power, you’re really counting on the fas-
teners to provide mechanical strength to the joint.
The person working from below snugs each of
the fasteners a little at a time (B). The strips of
masking tape prevent the connectors from falling
until they get a good grip into the recesses in the
countertop. The person working below can’t 
necessarily judge the alignment of the pieces by
the match of the recesses machined into the sub-
strate. The person working topside is responsible
for front-to-back alignment and a flush fit, and can
tap near the seam line with a deadblow mallet to
gently urge the pieces into perfect adjustment
(C).
As the joint tightens, glue will begin to squeeze
out. Simply scrape it away with a plastic putty
knife. Clean up any residue with a paper towel
that’s barely damp, then follow with a dry paper

towel (D). Use the connectors to bring the sec-
tions firmly together, but resist the urge to over-
tighten. That could produce a weak, glue-starved
joint. Moving your fingertips gently along the
seam will reveal irregularities that are difficult to
see. Strange as it may seem, wearing a light-
weight cotton glove (from a photo-supply shop)
actually increases your sensitivity (E). Inspectors
at automobile factories use this glove technique
to check sheet metal before painting.
Even after you’ve tightened the connectors, the
joint can slide out of position slightly due to a
phenomenon known as “glue creep.” Avoid this
problem by bridging the seam with mending
plates (F). The thicker the plates, the better: I use
ones made from 1⁄8-in.-thick steel. But even with
the mending plates, check the joint frequently
during the first hour after assembly to make cer-
tain that it stays in place. After the glue dries, you
can add seam filler to the joint to make it less
noticeable (G). Purchasing seam filler made by
the laminate manufacturer ensures a close color
match. Be sure to knead the tube before opening
it to make certain that the ingredients are thor-
oughly mixed. Squeeze a small bead of filler
along the seam, and gently scrape away the
excess with a plastic putty knife.  
If you want to use this style of hardware with
your own shopmade countertops—with either
mitered or butt joints—you’ll need to make a
template to help you rout the recesses for the
fasteners. To design your template, take a pencil,
paper, and tape measure to a home center to
record the dimensions of the recess in a factory-
made countertop, and buy the fasteners. Your
recess doesn’t require the sloped end of the fac-
tory version, but you should make a test joint in
scrap stock before routing your countertop.

THREADED INSERTS & TEENUTS
Threaded Inserts 
Although threaded inserts have a screwdriver slot
across one end, that slot would be more useful for
removal than installation. In fact, you should install
the slot upward only in softwoods. In that applica-
tion, the insert is thread forming. In most wood
applications, you’ll get better results by installing the
insert slot first into the wood. The slightly reduced
thread diameter at the slot end produces a cutting
action to make installation easier and also to reduce
radial stresses that could cause the wood to split.
Drill the hole for the threaded fastener, and use a
countersink tool to create a slight chamfer along the
edge of the hole (A).This chamfer will prevent wood
from erupting as you drive the insert. Make an instal-
lation tool by jamming two nuts together near the
end of a 4-in. bolt (B). Hold the insertion tool perpen-
dicular to the hole (C), using a small square to help
you judge the vertical positioning. Use a wrench to
drive the insert until it is 1⁄32 in. below the surface of
the wood. Simply turn the tool counterclockwise to
release it. Lightly rubbing your finger over the insert
will tell you if you need to drive it further (D).
VARIATION 1 You can purchase a driver
that uses the power of your variable-speed
drill to speed the process of innstalling
threaded inserts. The only drawback is
that the tool relies on the slot in the
insert, so yoou can’t use it to install the fas-
tener’s slot first into the wood. But this
tool is still very helppful for installations
into softwood or plywood.
VARIATION 2
Install hex-drive threaded
inserts with the inexpensive L-shaped
wrench shown or use a T-handled verssion.
As an alternative, you can get a power
assist by chucking a hex driver into your
drill. In this ccase, a variable-speed drill
with adjustable clutch settings helps pre-
vent overdriving the insert.

THREADED INSERTS & TEENUTS
Teenuts 
To install a teenut flush to the surface of your
wood, begin by drilling a counterbore slightly
larger than the overall diameter of the fastener.
For this 3⁄8-16 teenut, drill a 1-in. counterbore
1⁄32 in. deeper than the thickness of the top plate
of the teenut (A). Check the diameter and depth
by placing the teenut upside down in the coun-
terbore. Centered in the counterbore, drill a hole
that’s the diameter of the teenut’s shank: 15⁄32 in.
in this case (B). Position the teenut, and drive
the barbs into the wood with a sharp rap or two
with your hammer. Using a socket wrench as a
driver will minimize the risk of hammer tracks on
your wood (C). In extremely hard woods, you
may need to tap the teenut lightly to transfer the
barbs’ location to the wood, then drill small pilot
holes to ease their entry (D).
VARIATION1 The screw-on teenut is
very useful for applications where the
threaded fastener wouldn’t pull the barrbs
of a teenut into the wood. One typical
installation is in the bottom of a table leg
to provide a  mounting point for a leveling
glide. Simply drill for the shank of the
teenut, and drill pilot holes for the screws.
VARIATION 2 The riveting teenut elimi-
nates the problem of teenuts that push
out or fall out. It’s available withh 1⁄4-20
internal threads in three shank lengths: for
stock that’s 1⁄2 in., 5⁄8 in., or 3⁄4 in. thick, with-
out the necessity of counterboring. Insert
the teenut in the conventional
manner, and tuurn the stock over. Chuck the
inserting tool into your drill, and you’ll quickly
and neatly spin the projecting metal dow
wn-
ward into a finished collar that locks the
teenut in place.

Invisible Shelf Hangers 
When you need to hang a curio shelf or other
small project on your wall, you often must
choose between the security of hardware that’s
bulky and visible, or hidden hardware that’s
flimsy and insecure. I like to combine an inex-
pensive triangular-shaped hanger with an easy
and secure mounting method. The following
demonstration shows you how to mount a shelf
with typical 3⁄4-in.-thick sides.
Drill a 7⁄64-in. pilot hole centered in the width of the
rear edge of the side near the top, and drive a #8
x 3⁄4-in. pan-head screw to secure the hanger to
the shelf (A). Use your scratch awl to make a
mark at the inner tip of the triangle (B). Flip the
triangle out of the way, and drill a 1⁄2-in. hole 1⁄2 in.
deep at that centerpoint (C). This hole creates
clearance for the head of the hanging screw.
Repeat the process on the other side. Attach a
self-adhesive cork pad near the bottom of each
side of the shelf to match the thickness of the
hanger and to prevent the shelf from rubbing
against the wall (D). When you flip the triangles
back, you’re ready to hang the shelf onto
flat-head screws secured to the wall (E).

hile price is certainly one of
the factors to consider when
choosing drawer slides, it’s not
the only one. In fact, there’s such an interde-
pendent relationship among the carcase,
slide, and drawer that successful drawer-slide
selection begins in the design phase of a
project. As you make certain design deci-
sions, you’ll eliminate some types of slides—
or you may like a particular slide’s features so
well that you’ll find yourself designing your
cabinet around its specifications. If you’re
doing a kitchen, remember that there’s no
rule that says all of the drawer slides must be
identical. Some drawers may work fine with
3/4 extension slides, while you may prefer to
use full-extension or even overextension
slides in other drawers or install pullout trays
to maximize accessibility.
If you’re replacing slides as part of a reno-
vation project, you’re not obligated to use the
same type of slides the original cabinetmaker
did. But you do need to understand how the
construction of the carcase and drawer limits
your options. The first step in that direction
is becoming reasonably fluent in the design
language of drawers and slides.
The Vocabulary of Drawers 
Drawers and slides have their own special-
ized jargon, so take a look at the two
“Drawer Anatomy” drawings on p. 140 to
familiarize yourself with the terminology.
The top drawer is an overextension style,
and you can see that the drawer’s back
extends past the front plane of the carcase,
making it easy to reach items in the back,

SECTION 7 OVERVIEW
DRAWER ANATOMY 
(SIDE SECTION VIEW)
even when there’s an overhanging counter-
top. The design of the slide and the method
of installation influence the amount of
overextension.
The drawer thickness refers to the thickness
of the stock used to make the sides, back,
and front of the drawer box. This excludes
the thickness of an applied (false) front. Most
wood drawers have sides that are 1⁄2 in. thick,
but this is somewhat arbitrary because it usu-
ally doesn’t affect the operation of the drawer
or the attachment of the slides.
The bottom recess is the distance from the
underside of the drawer bottom to the lower
edge of the drawer side. This dimension can
be critical for the installation of bottom-
mounted or center-mounted slides.
A drawer slide consists of two parts that
usually separate from each other for installa-
tion. The cabinet profile, also called the cabi-
net member, is the portion that you screw to
the carcase, and the drawer profile, or drawer
member, is the one you fasten to the drawer
box. Setback is the distance from the front
plane of the carcase to the forward end of
the cabinet member. The manufacturer’s
installation specification sheet will tell you
the correct amount of setback to utilize for
each style of slide. There also may be a set-
back from the front plane of the drawer to

the forward end of the drawer member, but
many drawer members simply mount flush
with the front of the drawer box.
A rear-mounting bracket or rear-mounting
socket may be a plastic or metal piece that
attaches the rear end of the cabinet profile to
the back of the carcase.
A full-extension drawer slide is designed
to bring the rear of the drawer back flush
with the front plane of the carcase.
The specification sheet for a drawer slide
will state the minimum dimensions for the
bottom clearance and the top clearance. You
can usually make these clearances (especially
the top one) larger than the specified mini-
mums but never smaller. The drawer height
refers to the height of the drawer box, not to
the applied front.
The drawer length is the overall front-to-
back measurement of the drawer box.
The drawer opening is a crucial dimension
in a face-frame cabinet. For a given vertical
drawer opening, subtract the top and bottom
clearances to obtain the maximum drawer
height. The drawer you make for that open-
ing can have a shorter drawer height than
this maximum dimension.
The drawer gap is the distance from the
front plane of the carcase to the rear plane of
the applied drawer front. You may want to
establish this gap to keep the applied front
from slapping the carcase every time you
close a drawer. Another reason for the gap is
so you can apply bumpers to silence the
closing action.
A single-extension drawer slide brings only
a portion of the drawer’s total length past
the front plane of the carcase; the remainder
is the extension loss. A single-extension slide
is usually specified by the proportion of
extension to the drawer’s length. For exam-
ple, a 3/4 single-extension slide that’s 12 in.
long will have a forward motion of 9 in. Two
common single-extension ratios are 2/3 and
3/4. The amount of extension is sometimes
called travel.
Referring to the front view drawing on
the facing page, you’ll see the side clearance, a
critical dimension for side-mounted drawer
slides. The cabinet profile mounting position is
another important measurement. One usual
method of specifying this location is from a
fixed reference, such as the top of a face-
frame rail, to the centerpoint of the mount-
ing screws.
The Weight and 
Measure of Drawer Design 
Catalogs often list the load rating for slides
of a particular design. To determine the
weight rating that’s appropriate for a cabinet
you’re designing, knock together a drawer
box of the size you have in mind, load it up
with the contents you expect to put into it,
A kitchen scale will weigh small drawers and their con-
tents, but you’ll need the bathroom scale to figure load
ratings for file drawers.

A manufactured center-mount slide in wood
is a classic style that’s easy to install and
can give years of dependable service.
Choose a center-mount slide with ball-
bearing action, and you’ll have a quiet
drawer with hidden hardware.
The single-track drawer slide utilizes a three-point sus-
pension—two nylon rollers attach to the face frame,
and the center roller rides the rail.
and put it on a scale. As a rule of thumb, I’d
suggest adding a 50 percent  overload factor.
Catalogs will sometimes list only the
length of the slide, which is the closed
length of the two members when assembled.
As a general rule, you want to use the
longest slide that will fit on the drawer box
to maximize its range of motion.
The overall depth required by the slide is
another essential dimension you need when
designing cabinets, especially when you’re
considering slides that attach to the back
wall of the cabinet with sockets. The sockets
usually provide a certain range of motion for
you to fine-tune the fit, but you must make
certain that your design works around the
specifications of the slides.
Center-Mounted Slides 
Your choice of the basic construction
method for the cabinet’s carcase influences
the range of available drawer slides. For
example, the traditional center-mount slide
requires face-frame cabinet construction.
Although you could mill a slide like this in
your own shop, it requires quite a number of
machine setups. This style of slide is better
suited for use in a bedroom dresser rather
than in a busy kitchen. For extra-wide draw-
ers, consider using two slides, each spaced at
one-third of the drawer’s width.
The three-roller design (also called a single-
track slide) is another style that requires
face-frame construction. In my experience
they are invariably squeaky and I’ve never
had any long-term success with these slides.
The Accuride 1029 series is one more
center-mount design that requires face-
frame construction, but its ball-bearing

action is very smooth. Coupled with the
supplied nylon tack glides you attach to the
face-frame rail, the hardware produces a
drawer that doesn’t wobble or shimmy. The
load rating is light—only 35 lb.—but it
somewhat offsets that liability with the asset
that you can’t see the slide from the side.
That’s an important consideration when
you’ve worked hard to produce good-looking
joinery to hold together the drawer box.
Epoxy-Coated Slides 
Some catalogs refer to this type of slide as 
a “Euro slide” because it easily attaches 
with screws into the holes drilled in typical
32-mm system cabinets. Another widespread
description is “epoxy coated” because of its
durable low-friction coating. One other
name you might see is “low-profile” slide.
Although it’s classified here as a side-mounted
slide, the drawer member is actually an angle
that also fits around the bottom edge of the
drawer box’s side. As a result, it can be
attached to the bottom of the drawer box,
its side, or both. You’ll find a variety of
installation jigs that speed the installation 
of the cabinet members inside your cabinet’s
carcase.
This slide design is extremely versatile,
one that you can mount in frameless or face-
frame cabinets, or team it with right-angle
brackets to make pullout trays inside a cabi-
net or to hang a drawer from the underside
of a counter or table. Like all side-mounted
slides, the drawer or pullout must be a spe-
cific width in relation to the carcase width
for good operation.
Match the Socket and Slide 
Sometimes, a cabinet’s design doesn’t per-
mit you to mount slides to the sides of the
Some drawer slides are unhanded, meaning that you can
use them on either side of the drawer. But other slides have
members that are mirror images of each other. You determine
the handedness of a drawer as you look at the front of the cabi-
net. The left-hand drawer member and cabinet member install
to your left. Some manufacturers stamp the hand designation
onto each piece of the drawer slide, which can be a time-saving
feature during installation.

because it’s

After you’ve

you’ll wonder how
you survived with-
out them.

SECTION 7 OVERVIEW
To make sure that sockets will stay put,
you need to create a secure mounting loca-
tion where you can drive screws that are at
least 3⁄4 in. long. You can use several different
strategies to accomplish that. Use a thicker
back for the entire cabinet, or simply add
strips of plywood in the front or rear of the
standard 1⁄4-in.-thick back. If you add strips
inside the cabinet, make certain that you’ll
still have enough interior cabinet depth for
the slide and socket combo that you’re using.
Side-Mounted Slides 
A full-extension or overextension slide is
often a side-mounted unit with impressive
load ratings: from 90 lb. to a truly astonish-
ing 500 lb. per drawer. Steel ball bearings
enable the slide to carry heavy weight with
smooth action. Whether you want to craft a

carcase—the nearest support surface is the
back of the cabinet. In that case, you’ll need
to find out whether the slides you want to
use have rear-mounting sockets available.
Many types of slides offer the rear-
mounting option, but you still need to shop
carefully to make sure you end up with a
slide and socket team that works together. I
found three different sockets from the same
manufacturer next to each other at a local
home center. I then had to match their
numbers against the drawer-slide packaging
to ensure compatibility.

lingerie drawer or create a slide-out tool
storage unit for your work truck, these are
slides that combine full access with durability.
File cabinets and office furniture are other
popular uses for heavy-duty full-extension
slides. If you’re building lateral files—with
drawers that are wider than they are deep—
look for slides that are specifically rated for
that application, and respect the stated limits
on drawer dimensions and weight.
To prevent file cabinets from tipping or
falling, you can purchase an interlock system
that allows only one drawer to open at a
time. The lock bar fits in the front of the
cabinet, and the system can be retrofitted
into existing cabinets.
Not surprisingly, side clearances are a criti-
cal dimension for side-mounted slides.
Typical full-extension slides require a 1⁄2-in.
clearance on each side, so the overall drawer
box width is 1 in. less than its target opening.
You can cheat the size of the opening slightly
larger, perhaps as much as 1⁄16 in. per side
depending on the slide’s manufacturer, but you
simply can’t make the slides fit into anything
smaller than 1⁄2 in. per side. I usually make the
drawer 11⁄16 in. narrower than its opening to
avoid binding without introducing sloppiness.
Bottom-Mounted Slides 
Drawer slides that hide under the box let you
show off fancy traditional joinery and still
have the convenience and smooth operation of
modern hardware. The Tandem model from
Blum can be used on face-frame or frameless
cabinets, and with a drawer that’s inset (its
finished face flush with the front plane of the
carcase) or with an applied front that overlays
the carcase. The bottom recess and the bottom
clearance are critical dimensions.
Drawers to Go 
When you want to add a pencil drawer to a
table or work counter, buy a ready-made unit,
and you’ll have it installed faster than you
could even clear off your workbench to begin
to make your own drawer. If you can adapt
one of these to your kitchen table, you’ll mul-
tiply its usefulness as a temporary home
office, homework station, or crafts center.
You’ll notice that
the parts of a drawer
slide typically have
both slots and holes.
For initial installa-
tion, it’s usually best
to first drive the
screws at the mid-
point of the slots.
That way, you can
adjust the hard-
ware’s position by merely loosening the screw to permit move-
ment fore and aft or up and down. But after you have the slide
positioned perfectly, fix its location by driving screws through
the holes. This slide by Blum has two different hole sizes—the
smaller one accepts a no. 6 screw, and the larger takes a no. 7.
Both holes have ample countersinks to fully seat flat-head
screws—a sign of a high-quality slide. Other slides that look
similar at first glance lack this refinement, so that the flat-head
screws sit proud of the hardware, reducing their bearing sur-
face and becoming a potential obstruction.

You also can purchase ready-made metal
drawer sides with the slide already built into
them. Buy the length you want, then cut the
front, back, and bottom from your own
wood to make the exact width you need.
This drawer assembled quickly, but I wasn’t
impressed with the less than snug fit where
the plywood bottom meets the sides. If it
were used as a kitchen drawer, that area
would quickly fill with crumbs and other
bits that spill out of boxes or leap from the
countertop. Check out the designs from a
variety of manufacturers.
Choose a slide that’s concealed under the box, and
nothing distracts from the craftsmanship of the 
drawer’s joinery.
If you want nearly instant storage and 
organizational satisfaction, install a 
molded plastic drawer below a table 
or work counter.
Metal box sides with built-in slides can be a quick
route to building durable drawers.

Center-Mount Slide 
in a Face-Frame Cabinet 
One of the first things that you need to know
about this drawer slide has to do with the con-
struction of the drawer itself. The Accuride model
1029 slide requires that the drawer bottom
extends all the way to the front of the
drawer (flush with the front plane of the car-
case). There are many different ways to accom-
plish this, but the simple construction method I
used involves identical sides and identical pieces
for the front and back (see the drawing at right).
You then add an applied front to the drawer box.
This particular slide also requires a 1⁄4-in. bottom
recess: the distance from the lower surface of
the drawer bottom to the lower edge of the
drawer side. I used a clearance of 1⁄8 in. on each
side of the drawer box, making it 1⁄4 in. narrower
than the face-frame opening.
After you build the drawer, turn it upside down on
your workbench and draw a centerline from the
front of the bottom to the back. Separate the
drawer-slide pieces by extending the parts and
then pull them apart hard enough to overcome
the friction resistance that holds them together.
Center the drawer member on the bottom, and
drive a screw through one of the holes into a pilot
hole in the back of the drawer (A). The holes did-
n’t match with the center of the back, so I drilled
an extra hole in the slide so I wouldn’t split the
back. I also upgraded from the supplied
#8 x 1⁄2-in. screw to a 3⁄4-in. screw for additional
holding power.
Secure the front of the slide by driving the screw
through the angled slot into the drawer bottom
and front (B). Add a clamp from the front of the
drawer to the back so that driving the screw
won’t separate the parts.

By measurement, determine the side-to-side cen-
terline of the drawer opening, and mark this line
on the face-frame rail (C). Measure from this cen-
terline to the side of the cabinet, and make a
note of the measurement. Transfer this dimension
to the cabinet’s back, and mark a vertical center-
line (D). In this cabinet, I had enough room to add
a 3⁄4-in.-thick plywood strip, gluing it to the back
and driving screws through the back into the
strip. Adding this strip allowed me to drive longer
screws through the rear bracket of the slide,
strengthening the assembly.
Engage the rear-mounting bracket by sliding it
onto the cabinet member, and drive a screw to
attach the front end of the cabinet member to the
center of the drawer rail (E). Notice that the
member is set back about 1⁄8 in. from the front of
the rail to avoid interference with the drawer box.
Use a level on the slide to position the rear-
mounting bracket (F). It’s a simple matter of
matching the center of the bracket with the
marked centerline on the back while the slide is
level. Attach the bracket with a screw. 
Use a hammer to tap the nylon glide tacks into
the front rail (G). Make sure that you position
them so they will support the bottom edges of
the drawer sides to prevent the drawer box from
rocking. Engage the two halves of the drawer
slide, and the installation is complete (H).

DRAWER SLIDES

Some drawer slides, like this set from Blum,
have each component clearly marked to avoid
possible confusion (A). The first letter indicates
whether it is the cabinet or drawer member,
while the second identifies left and right. (For
photographic purposes, I darkened the marks.)
Position the drawer members flush with the
front end of the box, and drive screws through
the slide into the bottom of the drawer, the side,
or both (B). Driving screws into the bottom
edges of boxes made from some plywoods
requires carefully matching the pilot bit with the
screw to avoid splitting the laminations. Driving
screws into the sides of plywood boxes is
usually less risky. 
With Blum slides, you can use a jig the company
makes to simplify installation (C). (The jig accom-
modates several models of Blum slides, and the
following directions apply to the Model 230 slides
I installed.) Simply snap a cabinet member into
the gun-shaped jig, making certain that its front
end butts against the nubs that automatically pro-
duce a 2-mm setback. Following the pictorial
instructions packed with the jig, mark the front
edge of the cabinet with lines indicating the top
and bottom of each drawer. Aligning the 20-mm
mark on the jig with the drawer bottom mark
positions the slide perfectly inside the cabinet
(D). The mark at 22 mm indicates the top of the
next drawer.
Drill pilot holes, and drive screws to secure the
cabinet member to the carcase (E). When you’ve
driven all the screws, simply twist the jig to sepa-
rate it from the drawer slide. All that remains is to
test-fit the drawer and apply its false front. The
photo (F) shows the upsweep at the front of the
drawer member that serves as a self-closing fea-
ture for this slide.

(B), you simply snap in a cabinet member and the
jig automatically produces the correct setback on
the face frame’s stile. If you don’t have a jig, you
can position the cabinet member by
measurement.
Visually check that the slide is straight, and drive
screws to fasten it to the cabinet’s back (C). I made
this cabinet with a 1⁄2-in. back and added a second
thickness behind the cabinet in the target location of
the drawer sockets so that I could use 3⁄4-in. screws.
The fully threaded shank of a sheet-metal screw pro-
vides excellent holding power in this application.
Fasten the drawer members by driving screws into
the sides of the drawer box (D).
Install the drawer, and check that it moves freely
without binding. The photo (E) shows the clearances
between the drawer box and the opening in the face
frame. Looking along the length of the drawer slide,
you can see the socket in the back of the cabinet.
VARIATION You’ll sometimes run into situ-
ations where using a rear socket isn’t practi-
cal. In that case, you ccan usually add block-
ing to the side of the carcase so you can
screw on the cabinet member. For job--site
work, consider using the plastic block shown
in the photo at left. It’s available in three
thicknness ranges—from 5⁄16 in. to 1 in. thick.
By adding the supplied 1⁄16-in. or 1⁄8-in. shims,
you fine-tune the fit.

[TIP]
Substitute #6 x 3⁄4-in. screws instead
of the 1⁄2-in. screws furnished 
with the slides.
Using the metric machine screws furnished with
the brackets, attach the cabinet members to the
brackets (B). Set up the hardware on a flat sur-
face to ensure that the assemblies are square.
Rip a scrap piece of plywood to serve as a spacer
between the carcase side and the bracket to pro-
duce the clearance you need. Insert the slide 
on one edge of the tray into its mating piece on
the brackets, and slide the brackets against the
spacer (C).
Use a small try square to establish a clearance at
the front end of the tray (I used 1⁄4 in.) so that the
doors won’t make contact. When you have the
bracket situated, carefully remove the tray, and
drive #10 x 3⁄4-in. screws through a pair of the
slots. The pair of slots I chose in the photo (D)
will permit adjustment forward and back. Select
the other pair of slots if you want side-to-side
adjustability. Install the other bracket, and test-fit
the tray.

a nylon insert locking nut or separate lock washer
with a plain nut. The fender washer shown has a
3⁄16-in. center hole and 11⁄2-in. overall outside diame-
ter. This washer helps spread the bearing stress
of the slide assembly when the tray is pulled for-
ward. With a heavily loaded tray, this can be a
considerable force, so the bigger the washer the
better. If you can’t access the underside of the
shelf to install a fender washer, drive screws
through all of the bracket’s slots and center hole.

electing hardware is all about
achieving balance and focusing atten-
tion where it belongs. When you
choose the right hardware for a project—
especially a period reproduction—the hard-
ware will be the third or fourth thing that
people notice. That’s because tastefully cho-
sen and appropriate hardware becomes part
of the furniture, not merely a piece of metal
tacked on as an afterthought.
On the other hand, contemporary cabi-
nets and furniture sometimes cry out for a
piece of hardware that will give them a
design accent or a splash of color. A wall
of stark white melamine frameless cabinets
can make a kitchen look like a sensory-
deprivation ward. But add bright nylon pulls
in bold shapes, and you’ll take a giant step
toward creating a warm and inviting area.
Wood Knobs, Handles,
and Pulls 
Some furniture styles, such as Shaker, utilize
wood for virtually all knobs and pulls. You’ll
even find movable Shaker latches whose
only metal content is a tiny pin that secures
the cam to the shaft. Other styles, such as
Arts and Crafts, may use either metal hard-
ware or wood knobs and pulls with a pyram-
idal face. One word of caution—just because
a manufacturer has the machinery to pro-
duce pulls in a particular style doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that it will always use the wood

SECTION 8 OVERVIEW

that’s exactly right. For example, genuine
Arts and Crafts furniture used white oak
almost exclusively, but you’ll find pulls and
knobs made today that are correct in form
but in other species, such as red oak.
Contemporary knob makers are always
turning out fresh shapes as well as new
designs that meet current needs. You’ll dis-
cover, for example, a selection of wood han-
dles that are used in conjunction with wood-
cladding kits to transform a metal refrigera-
tor to look like a built-in cabinet.
Continuous Wood Pulls 
If you want to add a wood feature to
laminate-covered cabinets, you’ll appreciate
the continuous wood pull that’s usually
installed along the bottom end of wall cabi-
net doors and the upper end of lower doors.
Of course, this technique will give a set of
cabinets strong horizontal lines. If you’d
rather accentuate the height of the installa-
tion, attach the continuous pulls along the
vertical edge of the door. Although the pull
is often used with laminate cabinets, you can
certainly add it to plywood doors as well.
Naming Names 
A knob has a single attachment point, which
is sometimes a wood tenon but more fre-
quently a wood screw or machine screw. The
words “handle” and “pull” generally refer to
items with two attachment points. The
terms are used almost interchangeably,
although it’s interesting to note that a piece
of hardware on a cabinet door is usually
called a handle, while the identical item on a
drawer is called a pull. The center-to-center
spacing between the attachment points is
sometimes called boring or centers. For

example, “handles with 3-in. boring” or
“pulls with 4-in. centers.”
A pull with a movable grip has a definite
name for each of its components. The back-
plate (sometimes simply called the plate) is
the flat piece of metal that lies on the drawer
front. The threaded machine screw with a
hole at the end is a post, and the movable
part that you grip is called the bail. This
multicomponent construction is the tradi-
tional method of making pulls, but some
less-expensive modern pretenders join the
tips of the posts and the backplate into a
single unit. In this case, the factory perma-
nently crimps the bail into position.
If the posts are too long, you can easily
cut them, but if they are too short to reach
through a thick drawer, drill a counterbore
as shown in the drawing at right above.
When you install a traditional type of pull
with separate posts, be careful that tighten-
ing the nuts doesn’t twist the posts and bind
the bail.
Pulls and Bin Hardware 
If you’re building a cabinet full of small
drawers to organize your home or shop,
you’ll reach for the bin pull with a built-in
cardholder. When you need a beefier pull for
larger-scale applications, such as file draw-
ers, purchase the cardholder and pull sepa-
rately. If you need only a small pull, consider
a sash lift. You can pair them on a drawer or
let one work solo. For bins or drawers, check
out the selection of rectangular and shell-
shaped pulls that are available in either
smooth-stamped profiles or with ornate cast
designs. If you look closely at the top photo
on p. 156, you may be able to tell that the
screw heads visible in the center and right
examples in the bottom row are part of the
pull itself, not separate fasteners. The real
attachment occurs via screws driven from
inside the drawer.
A traditional pull is a set of components:
The threaded posts and nuts flank the base-
plate, and the bail is at the bottom.

When you buy pulls for a kitchen full
of cabinets, buy at least two spares.
Wrap them in paper and put them in a
kitchen drawer so that you or your cus-
tomer will be able to find them when
one of the originals breaks. That way,
you’ll spare yourself the trouble of try-
ing to find a replacement.
SPARE YOURSELF
SOME TROUBLE
➤
Backing plates are useful in new construc-
tion but really excel at covering up old
holes during renovation work, letting you
shift to pulls with a different boring.
consuming nuisance. So it’s a good idea to
buy a jig for its dependable accuracy. But
even if an extremely tight budget prohibits
the purchase of a factory-made jig, you can
get far better results from a shopmade jig
that you quickly knock together than you’d
obtain by juggling a tape measure and sub-
tracting fractions in your head.
One Word of Advice: Plastics 
Plastics have come a long way in recent
years and have arrived as a tough and stable
hardware medium. HEWI is one company
that combines function with fun in a line of
pulls that can add style and color to contem-
porary furniture. Even if you scratch the
rugged nylon hardware, the color goes all the
way through the piece, so damage is barely
noticeable.
The Backing Plate Cover-Up 
Changing the pulls in a kitchen is an inex-
pensive way to give the cabinets a facelift. If
you add a backing plate, you’ll cover up
scratches in the old door and also be able to
switch to pulls that have a different center-
to-center distance from the old hardware. In
new construction, the plates add more
metallic gleam, prevent scratches, and cover
the sin of misdrilled holes.

Mounting Pulls 
You’ll find a number of marking jigs on the mar-
ket that range in price from economical to astro-
nomical. The jig from Rockler (A) is very afford-
able, easily adjustable, and allows you to select
from six different mounting-center dimensions.
To set up the jig, draw a line parallel to the edge
of a piece of scrap stock at the desired mounting
distance from the drawer’s top edge. Find the
setting on the jig that corresponds to the center-
to-center distance of the pulls you’re installing,
match the marks on the jig to the line, and
tighten the locking knobs to secure the wood 
bar that rests on the top edge of the drawer. 
To mark the drawer, put a vertical strip of mask-
ing tape at the approximate center of the drawer
front, then draw the precise centerline on the
tape. Match the centerline of the jig to the draw-
er’s centerline, and you’re ready to mark (B). You
can use the spring-loaded punch like a scratch
awl, gently pushing on it to make a small mark.
But pushing harder on the punch loads up the
spring mechanism, which then trips and makes a
deeper impression into the wood. Turning the
punch’s barrel adjusts the amount of pressure
that triggers the punch.
A shopmade version of the drawer-mounting jig is
easy to build from a piece of 1/8-in.-thick hard-
board or plywood. Simply lay out a vertical center-
line, accurately mark the mounting centerpoints,
and drill 1⁄8-in. holes to admit the point of your
scratch awl (C). Calibrate the jig by using the
method shown in photo A, and attach a wood
handscrew clamp to act as the top stop.
To use either a purchased or shopmade jig on a
drawer that uses two pulls, you simply mark a
centerline at each pull’s location. As an alterna-
tive, you can purchase a marking jig that has an
adjustable end stop (D). To mark for the pull at
the opposite end of the drawer, you simply rotate

the jig 180 degrees. Cover the unused holes with
masking tape to ensure that you get the correct
spacing.
Once you have marked the drawers, use a guide
for your portable drill to ensure that the holes are
perpendicular to the drawer’s face (E). Clamping
a piece of scrap stock inside the drawer prevents
tearout where the bit exits the wood.
Marking a door for a single knob is an easy job
with a plastic jig that reverses to mark both right-
and left-hand doors (F). To avoid mistakes, cover
the unused holes with strips of masking tape. You
also can use this jig to mark for pulls that use
two mounting holes.
If you want to skip the marking and jump right to
drilling, make a guide like the one shown in the
drawing (G), tailoring the dimensions to center
the hardware in the stile’s width and matching
the mounting centers of your pulls. The inserts
shown (Lee Valley is one source) have ribbed
sides that tightly grip the sides of a 5⁄8-in. hole to
resist turning. Use a hammer to tap the insert

from a wrench set atop the insert, and sank it
with a couple of light hammer taps. Screw in a
bushing with a 3⁄16-in. hole, and you’re ready to
drill. Use a clamp to secure the jig to the front of
the door and a scrap board behind the door to
prevent tearout (H). Drill all of the right-hand
doors, and then screw the bushings into the

Installing a Wood Knob
with a Tenon 
Securing a wood knob by gluing a tapered
wedge into its tenon is a traditional and secure
technique. In fact, it’s so secure that if you
ever need to replace the knob, you’ll need to
drill it out.
Using a V-block at your drill press, drill a 1⁄8-in. hole
centered in the tenon and 1⁄4 in. from the shoulder
of the knob. A brad-point bit helps to ensure
accuracy (A). To have a strong connection, you’ll
need a close fit between the hole and the tenon.
Drill a test hole in a piece of scrap stock. If the fit
is too loose, use a smaller bit for the hole in the
door stile, and then shave the tenon to fit snugly
into the hole (B). Using a pencil, draw a straight
line connecting the hole and the end of the
tenon. Then draw a line on the end of the tenon
through the center, meeting the line along the
length. 
To give your saw a starting place, use your utility
knife to cut a small notch at this intersection of
these lines. With a dovetail saw, cut a kerf from
the end of the knob to the hole, using the
marked lines as a guide (C). Tilting the knob in
your vise and starting your cut at an angle makes
it surprisingly easy to make a freehand cut that
follows both lines. Rip a square strip of stock,
matching its end to the diameter of the tenon.
For example, I ripped a 3⁄8-in. by 3⁄8-in. walnut strip
to match the size of the 3⁄8-in.-dia. tenon and to
contrast with its pale tone. 
Use a scrollsaw to cut wedges into the end of
the stock, tapering from 3⁄32 in. to zero over the
length of the tenon’s slot (D). To do this, mark the
length of the wedge onto the stock, and cut a
number of wedges until you make one that will
fit into the tenon’s kerf. Apply glue to the tenon,

and place it through the stile with the kerf per-
pendicular to the grain (E). Driving a wedge paral-
lel to the grain could split the stile. Dip the
wedge into glue and quickly tap it into place,
making certain that the shoulder of the knob
stays snug against the opposite face of the stile.
Wipe away excess glue, and cut and sand the
end of the tenon flush with the stile (F). The off-
set backsaw I used does a good job of flush trim-
ming, but its teeth can scratch the wood. To pre-
vent that, I cut a hole through an index card and
put it over the tenon to shield the stile. The com-
pleted installation utilizes traditional methods but
has a clean, modern look (G).
VARIATION 1 I sometimes file the back
of the hole slightly oblong to give the
tenon room to expand into a dovetaiil
shape, creating a powerful wedging
action. See the drawing at right for the
details.
VARIATION 2
Driving a 1⁄2-in. screw
through a 1⁄2-in. fender washer and into the
back of a flush-cut 3⁄8-in. tenon creates a
joint that’s quick and mechanically sound.
To give the round-head screw an antiquue
look, I temporarily drove it into the end of
a board and filed facets that simulate a
hand-wrought  look. A quick mist coat of
flat black paint on the screw and washer
completes the illusion.

Shortening Screws 
You’ll use 8-32 machine screws to fasten the
vast majority of knobs and handles on the mar-
ket. But no matter what length the manufacturer
furnishes, it always seems that you need a differ-
ent size. When you’re installing a whole kitchen
full of cabinet handles, it’s worth a trip to the
hardware store to buy a box in the right length.
But if you need to shorten only a few screws,
there’s more than one way to do it, and you’ll be
finished with the job before you could make the
round trip to the hardware store.
Before you hacksaw a screw to length (A), spin
on a nut, and then grab the waste end of the
screw with a pair of locking-grip pliers. Snug the
pliers into a vise, and you’ll be able to saw easily.
After you make the cut, removing the nut will
restore the threads at the end of the screw.
A quicker method utilizes the holes in an electri-
cian’s wire stripper (B). You simply thread the
screw into the hole, and squeeze the handles to
cut the screw. As you withdraw the screw, the
tapped hole reshapes the threads. When I have
to cut more than a few screws, I’ll gain leverage
by putting one handle onto the workbench and
pushing down on the other handle.
You can purchase 13⁄4-in.-long screws that have
score marks that allow you to easily break them
into shorter lengths (C). Some hardware distribu-
tors now furnish this type of screw with their
knobs and handles. Spin a nut onto the screw,
and position it just under the break point you
want to use. Grab the nut with locking-grip pliers,
and grip the waste end with pliers—locking grip
or an ordinary slip-joint pair—and wiggle the
screw back and forth until the metal fatigues 
and breaks.

Continuous Wood Pulls 
As you can see in the drawing at right, the
tongue of a continuous pull fits into a groove that
you cut into the bottom end of the door. In this
demonstration, I’ll work with a kitchen cabinet
door made from melamine-clad stock. First you
need to carefully measure the dimensions of the
pull stock (A). The tongue is a nominal 1⁄4 in. by
1⁄4 in., but you will probably find that the actual
measurement is different. In this case, the height
of the tongue was 0.26 in., a very reasonable
variation, but the width was only 0.22 in., repre-
senting 12% undersized. To handle this width, I
decided to make two cuts with my standard
table-saw blade.
Attach an auxiliary fence at least 6 in. tall to your
table saw’s rip fence to help hold the door panel
vertical while it’s being cut. Mark the inside face
of the door panel with a piece of masking tape,
and run a test panel over the blade (B). Check
that the back of the pull will be flush with the
rear of the panel and that the test cut’s depth
matches the height of the tongue. When you’re
satisfied with the setup, make this cut in all your
doors. Move the rip fence to widen the cut the
required amount, and run the test panel over the
blade again (C). Using a hooked push block on 
its side keeps the stock tight against the fence
and helps prevent chipout where the blade exits 
the stock. 
Cut a 11⁄2-in.-long piece of the pull stock to check
its fit in the groove (D). Cut each pull, matching is
length to the width of the door. Identify each pull

by writing an identifying number onto the tongue
(E). Mask off the portions of the tongue that will
be glued into the groove (not the ends of the
tongue), and apply finish to the pulls. Glue and
clamp each pull into its door (F). Don’t be too
generous with the glue, or you’ll simply create a
difficult mess to clean. Watch carefully for glue
buildup between the lip and panel.
VARIATION 1 If you don’t like the
appearance of the tongue and groove on
the edge of the door, here’s one way to
hide it. Use a router to cut a stopped
groove into the bottom of the door, and
then trim the tongue to ffit. With this
method, the depth of the groove is far less
critical, so you can rout 5⁄16 in. deep to
ensure that the tongue does not bottom
out in the groove before the shoulders are
flush wiith the end of the door. When you
cut off the tongue, be careful that you
don’t nick the lip.
VARIATION 2 Here’s another way to 
eliminate the appearance of the tongue
and groove on the edge of the door.
Completely cut the lip and tongue off of
the pull and you can then glue the pull
directly to the raw end of the door panel.

hen you incorporate glass
into a woodworking project,
you’ll want one of two opposites:
either easy movement or no motion at all. If
you’re building a cabinet with bypass sliding
doors, your goal will be smooth and silent
sliding. But if you’re putting a glass panel
into a wood-framed door, you’ll want solid
and stationary stability. Either way, you’ll
find a good selection of hardware to help
you complete your project.
Fixed-Panel Hardware 
The traditional method of holding a piece of
glass in a door frame is with molding strips
made from the same wood species as the
door itself. For high-end work, this is the
only method because plastic strips or clips
would cheapen the appearance of your work.
For an absolute match of wood color and
figure, or if you simply insist upon making
everything yourself, you can mill square or
quarter-round moldings in your own shop.
WARNING
To make small
quarter-round moldings, round over the
edge of a wide board at your router
table, then riip the strip on your table
saw. Plan your rip cut so that the strip is
on the outboard side of the blaade at the
end of the cut, not trapped between the
blade and fence. A trapped strip can kick
back with  the speed and injury power of
an arrow.

SECTION 9 OVERVIEW
brads to nail the strips into place, it’s a good
idea to drill pilot holes to help prevent split-
ting. Personally, I prefer to screw the strips
into place. It’s less nerve-wracking than
swinging a hammer near glass, plus it makes
removal of the strips extremely easy.
There are two basic types of plastic panel-
retainer strips: one you staple into position
and the other fits into a groove. Both come
in 25-ft. rolls, and you can easily cut them to
length using a utility knife or heavy-duty
scissors. The staple-in variety installs fast
with either a manual or electric-powered
staple gun but doesn’t look quite as neat as
the groove type. The groove type has the
added advantage of easy removal, simplifying
replacement of broken glass or allowing you
to create reversible or replaceable panels that
quickly change the look of a cabinet.
Panel Retainers 
You can purchase several types of metal and
plastic screw-in retainers to hold glass or
wood panels. To select a retainer, you first
need to know the relationship between the
rear surface of the panel and the back face of
the door. When the panel is in its rabbet, is
its rear surface above the back face of the
door, flush, or below? The S-shaped glass
retainer with the threaded post covers the
greatest range: above, flush, and below. On
the negative side, this retainer is quite bulky
in appearance. Plastic retainers come in sev-
eral shapes and handle panels that are flush
or recessed either 1⁄8 in. or 1⁄4 in. When you

Plastic panel-retainer strips staple on or fit into a
groove. You’ll find the plastic strips in several wood
tones, and the groove type is also available in clear, an
especially good choice for installing glass panes.
The large retainer covers a wide range of panel thickness-
es, from single-strength glass through leaded-glass pan-
els. Select the smaller retainers based on whether the
panel is flush or recessed.
This sliding-door hardware rides in discreet
1⁄8-in. grooves cut into the carcase top and
bottom.
Sliding Doors 
Bypass wood doors are very space efficient
because they don’t require any room for the
door to swing. Made from edge-banded ply-
wood or with a solid panel, they are also
excellent at hiding clutter. The hardware
shown in the photo at right below lets you
make sliding doors up to 26 lb. in weight.
Installation is easy—cut 1⁄8-in. grooves into
the carcase, and drill 30-mm mounting holes
into the backs of the doors. The upper
guides have spring-loaded tabs, and an
eccentric cam on the lower rollers allows you
to fine-tune the fit.
The following types of sliding door hard-
ware are shown with 1⁄4-in. plate glass, but
you could substitute plywood or hardboard
panels to conceal the contents of your cabi-
net. Sliding glass mirrors—clear, smoked, or
tinted—are another choice.
The least-expensive sliding door-guide
system is a pair of plastic tracks sized for
1⁄4-in. plate glass. This system relies upon the
slippery nature of the plastic to help over-
come the friction generated by the weight of
the glass. And you may find that it works
well enough, as long as each door doesn’t
exceed a few square feet and provided that
you don’t need to slide the doors too often.
But the economy approach will definitely
lose its appeal as the size of the doors and
the frequency of access increase.

The metal-track system is considerably
more expensive—in bright aluminum, it’s
about four times the cost of the plastic
guides; in bronze-finished aluminum, figure
five times the cost of plastic. But your
money goes a long way in eliminating fric-
tion. If you need to frequently access the
contents of a cabinet, the convenience of
easy sliding quickly outweighs the extra
expense. The nylon rollers slide almost
effortlessly along the metal-base track.

Installing a Panel Retainer
in a Groove
Begin by cutting a rabbet that’s deep enough to
accommodate the thickness of the glass and the
retainer—the rabbet in this demonstration is 3⁄8 in.
by 3⁄8 in., cut with a dado head in a table saw (A).
Get ready to cut the groove for the retainer by
putting a 1⁄8-in.-wide blade into your table saw.
(I used one of the outer dado blades from a
stack dado set.) The easiest way to position this
groove for the retainer is by using a spacer that
matches the thickness of the panel you’re using.
Place the spacer into the rabbet, and slide the rip
fence until the spacer just touches the blade (B).
Lock the fence into position, and raise the blade
to cut a groove 1⁄4 in. deep (C). Miter the frame,
and assemble it. Cut the retainer to length with a
pair of scissors, and use the rounded end of a
marking pen or 1⁄2-in. dowel to push the retainer
into its groove (D). It isn’t essential to take the
retainer all the way into the corner; stopping
each strip about 1⁄2 in. from the corner will give a
neat look.
VARIATION If you’re making doors or
panel assemblies with butt or mortise-
and-tenon joints, you’ll need to folllow a
different sequence of cuts so that the rab-
bets and grooves don’t show through the
ends of thee stiles. Do a series of test cuts
to establish the relationship between the
rabbet and groove, then usse a table-
mounted router to cut the groove in the
assembled frame. Switch to a rabbeting
bit to cut the rabbet.

Plastic Door-Tracks 
Use a dado head in your table saw (or a router
for stopped cuts) to cut grooves to house the
plastic track in the carcase members (A). Make
test cuts to ensure that the groove is wide
enough to accept the track without pinching it
out of shape, which could affect the fit of the
glass. You’ll have to cut a deeper groove for the
upper track. 
After assembling the carcase and applying the
finish, cut the tracks to length with a miter saw
(B). Mix up some epoxy, and use a few drops of
it to secure the tracks into the grooves (C). To
determine the width of the glass doors, measure
the overall opening, divide by two, and add half of
the desired overlap. For example, if the opening
is 36 in. wide and you want a 3⁄4-in. overlap, each
door would be 183⁄8 in. wide. Cut 1⁄4-in. plywood as
a pattern for the glass to be absolutely certain
that vertical size is correct. Test-fit the plywood by
first inserting it into the upper track, and then
lowering it into the bottom one (D). Be sure to
check that the pattern slides easily along each
groove of the track. Take the plywood pattern
with you to the glass shop to eliminate any dis-
putes over size.
WARNING
Don’t assume that
the upper and lower tracks are identical
in width. With the set I got, the upper
tracck was nearly 1⁄16 in. wider.Test cuts in
scrap stock will ensure that you get the
right fit.

Aluminum 
Door-Track System
Like the plastic tracks, this system is designed
for use with 1⁄4-in.-thick doors. After assembling
the carcase, measure the width of the opening,
and use a hacksaw to cut the upper and lower
tracks to length (A). Use a hacksaw blade with at
least 24 teeth per inch (tpi) for a smooth cut.
Remove any cutting burrs with a fine file. Using
the supplied round-head screws, attach the
tracks to the carcase. Drive the first screw 2 in.
from each end, and then space the screws about
every 8 in. along the track (B). Be sure to care-
fully align the tracks so that they are in the
same plane. 
To determine the width of the glass doors, meas-
ure the overall opening, divide by two, and add
half of the desired overlap. For example, if the
opening is 36 in. wide and you want a 1-in. over-
lap, each door would be 181⁄2 in. wide. Hacksaw
the runners to length (C). Use the tip of a screw-
driver to press the rollers into the smaller groove
in the runners, positioning them about 1 in. from
each end (D).
Next, determine the height of the glass doors.
The instructions supplied with this set of hard-
ware gave the following formula: rough opening
height minus 17⁄32 in. Cut a piece of 1⁄4-in. plywood
as a pattern for the glass. Cut 1⁄4-in. lengths of the
rubber channel, position one near each edge on
the plywood, and press the runner

to the plywood (F). Test-fit the assembly into the
rear channel and then in the front to make certain
that it slides easily. Make any adjustments neces-
sary to the plywood pattern, and take it with you
to the glass shop. 
Cut the rubber channel 1⁄2 in. shorter than the
width of the door, and center it on the edge of
the glass. Press the runner into position (G). You
can add an extruded aluminum pull to the front
glass door. Use the 1⁄4-in. lengths of rubber chan-
nel to cushion the grip of the metal on the glass,
and tap the handle into place (H). If the channel
of the pull is too tight to go onto the glass, widen
the opening by gently twisting a screwdriver
inside the channel (I). To slightly close the open-
ing, remove the pull from the glass, and give it a
gentle tap with a deadblow mallet.

uilding strong shelves requires
careful material selection plus a
knowledge of strengthening strate-
gies. Generally speaking, panels manufac-
tured from little bits of wood pressed
together, like MDF and particleboard, lack
significant spanning ability on their own, but
they are satisfactory for short, lightly loaded
shelves. Plywood is a stronger structural
choice, especially when you add a 3⁄4-in. by
11⁄2-in. hardwood strip along the front edge.
For a heavyweight contender, add strips to
both the front and rear edges. Solid wood is
a good choice, although it can get pricey and
still sag over time. The strength ranking
shown in the top left photo on p. 174 is
intended as a general guide only.
Another way to make a shelf stronger is
by shortening it—design a bookcase with
several short spans instead of a single long
shelf. And when you start to fill your book-
case, concentrate stacks of books near the
ends of shelves, placing lightweight items in
the middle of the span.
For safety’s sake, use glass shelves for
supporting only lightweight decorative
items, and consider using products such as
tempered or laminated glass to further
reduce risk.
Follow Up with Strong
Supports

building strong shelves, it doesn’t make sense
to trust them to the world’s cheapest support

system. Economics and aesthetics certainly
play important roles in the decision-making
process, but for the moment, consider the
engineering realities behind your choices.
Without a doubt, steel clips that fit into
steel standards make the strongest combina-
tion. Neither component is likely to wear
out, bend, or break.
Shelf Pins: From Hardy to
Hardly Enough 
If you opt for pins that fit into line-bored
holes, metal is obviously superior to plastic.
And you can improve the performance of
either metal or plastic pins by placing them
into metal inserts that spread the bearing
stress. Inserts that have a rolled lip have the
added virtue of hiding chipout at the
perimeter of the hole.
One other engineering reality is the larger
the diameter of the pin, the stronger it will
be. The selection of shelf pins in the top
photo on the facing page merely hints at the
wide range of styles, materials, and finishes
available. Some of the special features you’ll
find are screw-in pins that banish the
dropout problem and pins that cushion or
capture glass shelves. An L-shaped support
with a hole in it lets you drive a screw into
the shelf so it won’t slide. A small paddle-
shaped plastic support is designed for com-
pletely invisible service—it fits into kerfs cut
into the ends of each shelf board.
Drilling for Shelf Pins 
There are plenty of ways in which you can
drill accurate lines of holes without investing
in designated machines that do the job.
Some woodworkers favor a jig that clamps
to the workpiece and indexes a carriage with
a plunge router at set intervals. The router
can make cleaner holes than a drill, but it is
also several times noisier, so be sure to wear
hearing protection if you choose this method.
Combine a drill press or hand-held drill
with either commercial or shopmade jigs,
and you can produce columns of equally
spaced holes quickly and efficiently. Some

SECTION 10 OVERVIEW
jigs must be clamped to unassembled com-
ponents, whereas hand-held versions allow
you to drill holes even after the cabinet has
been hung on the wall. For clean holes, use a
brad-point bit whenever possible. When you
drill for a shelf-pin insert, carefully measure
its outside diameter (O.D.), and choose a bit
that will give a snug fit in the material
you’re using.
Utility Shelving 
When you need utilitarian shelving in a
hurry, consider brawny standards and sup-
ports that can even offer no-tool installation.
End-join the standards with special connec-
tors to create floor-to-ceiling shelves, make
sturdy lumber racks, or even build a work
surface as quickly as you can lift a sheet of
material onto the 22-in. brackets with out-
rigger supports. Click hooked ends onto the
standards, and you can hang them from the
edge of a foundation or the top plate of a
stud wall. With another style of end fitting,
you can screw the standards to studs or hang
them from joists.
Hang the standards
from a foundation
wall, and you’ll rack
up yards of utility
shelf space without
breaking a sweat.

Wall-Mounted Shelves 
You’ll find plenty of choices in wall-mounted
shelves, from individual glass units for light-
weight displays to standards strong enough
for your heaviest books and collectibles.
Hardware stores and home centers stock
glass-shelf kits that include an extruded
metal support that you screw to the wall
through holes in the channel. Slip the glass
shelf into the channel, and the fasteners dis-
appear. Some kits cushion the glass with a
continuous rubber U-channel, whereas oth-
ers rely on short wedges of clear silicone.
You’ll discover other styles of brackets for
single shelves that range from purely practi-
cal to stunningly sculptural. To mount the
bracket shown in the photo at left, you
install a dowel screw into the wall, then spin
on a threaded stud that has a groove milled
around it. Slip the stud into a hole in the
back of the upper part of the bracket, then
tighten a setscrew into the groove to secure
the shelf.
When you want to set up an office in a
hurry, consider using giant brackets that are
strong enough to support a countertop.
Projecting 181⁄2 in. from the wall and made
from 3⁄16-in.-thick steel, these brackets are
something you’ll probably never be able to
overload. The companion 8-in. bracket can
be mounted as shown to cradle the end of a
shelf in its flange or in the same posture as
the big bracket for a long run of shelving.
Screw steel standards to wood studs, and
you have the basis for a powerful shelving
system. Choose from arms that have plain
ends or with upturned hooks that restrain
the edge of a shelf or fit into holes you drill
in the bottom of the shelf. Standards that
have a double row of holes accept arms with

Installing Metal 
Shelf Standards 
If you’re simply building a storage cabinet for the
shop, you may choose to surface-mount these
standards, but housing them in a groove is an
easy job that makes the completed project look
much better. 
Use a dado blade to cut a groove that matches
the width of the shelf-support standard (A). The
standards I used are 5⁄8 in. wide, but my initial test
groove was about 1⁄32 in. too narrow, so I added
dado shims between the chippers to widen the
cut. (You can make your own dado shims, but a
purchased set is inexpensive and highly accu-
rate.) You have the width right when the standard
goes into the groove without forcing but also
without any sideways play. The standard is 3⁄16 in.
thick, but I cut the groove only 1⁄8 in. deep so that
the metal is 1⁄16 in. proud of the side panel—the
offset helps prevent the ends of the shelves from
scraping the inside of the carcase. (Of course
your shelves have to be cut to length accordingly.)
Carefully align the lower factory end of each stan-
dard flush with the bottom end of the carcase
side, and mark your cutline at the top. Positioning
each standard so that the numbers stamped on
them are right side up will help ensure that all of
the shelf-clip holes will be level, and that means
shelves that don’t rock. Using a hacksaw, cut the
standard to length (B). Be sure to clamp the stan-
dard close to the cut to prevent the metal from
bending. Choose a fine-toothed hacksaw blade,
one with at least 24 tpi or even 32 tpi. If the
teeth are too coarse, the blade can catch, bend-
ing the standard. 
Next, apply the finish to the carcase. After it
dries, drive nails through the standards to hold
them in place (C). The nails, which have annular
rings to increase their holding power, are usually

These fasteners are a hefty gauge, so you may
need to drill pilot holes prior to driving them in
tough materials. For maximum strength, drive a

After you install the shelf clips (D), you’re ready

VARIATION If you’re installing low-
profile standards, apply the finish to the
wood before cutting the grooves.
OOtherwise, finish could pool inside the

toothed handsaw or power miter  saw. If
you are using a power miter saw, cut very
slowly to keep the plastic from shattering.

Shelf-Pin Drilling Jig
The Rockler jig in this demonstration has a 
simple appearance but is surprisingly versatile.
You can use it on components or drill the shelf-
pin holes after assembling or even after mount-
ing the cabinet on the wall. The large holes in the
jig capture the end of special self-centering bits
that drill either 1⁄4-in. or 5-mm holes and stop the
holes at the correct depth for the shelf pins. 
Assemble the jig by installing the wood strip
along the edge of the jig. When placed along one
edge, you can drill holes with a 32-mm offset,
whereas switching to the opposite side produces
a 64-mm offset. In this case, the offset is meas-
ured to the edge of the hole, not its centerpoint.
Choose the holes you wish to use, and cover the
other column with a strip of masking tape to pre-
vent accidental use. Carefully place the jig at its
starting position, and hold it firmly while you
engage the tip of the bit into the holes in the jig
and drill (A). When the jig is brand new, you may
have to push onto your drill to get the self-
centering lip on the bit flush against the jig. To
make sure that the jig doesn’t shift while you’re
drilling, clamp or tape it securely to the carcase
member.
To drill a line of holes longer than the jig, use the
indexing holes near the ends of the jig (B).
Simply slide the jig in the desired direction, and
insert a shelf pin through the jig and into a hole
you already drilled.

Clamp-On Commercial
Drilling Jig 
This jig from Veritas does an excellent job of
eliminating uncertainty because it ensures that
the holes are exactly opposite each other, per-
pendicular, and equally spaced. 
Assemble the jig and clamp one end flush with
the end of a carcase side (A). Position the two
rails (with the holes) parallel to the edges of the
carcase to establish the offset you want. I used a
gauge block to set the rails so that the shelf-pin
centerpoints are 2 in. from the edge (B).
Whatever dimension you choose, it must be iden-
tical for each rail. That’s because you’ll turn the jig
to drill the mirror-image carcase side. Tighten the
thumbscrews to secure the rails.
Select a guide bushing, and install it in the bush-
ing carrier by tightening the setscrew with an
Allen wrench (C). The jig comes with a wide
selection of hardened bushings: 5 mm, 6 mm,
6.75 mm, 7 mm 7.5 mm, 8 mm, and 9 mm, as
well as 7⁄32 in., 1⁄4 in. and 3⁄8 in. (You can use the 
8-mm bushing to guide a 5⁄16-in. bit.) In addition,
you also receive an unhardened bushing (silver
colored in the photo) that you can drill to virtually
any size you need. 
Set the guide bushing into one of the holes in the
rail, and use your portable electric drill to make
the parallel columns of holes (D). Use masking
tape to blank out any holes you don’t want to drill.
A masking-tape flag can also serve as a makeshift
depth indicator if you have only a few holes to
drill. If you need to continue the chain of holes for
a long carcase side, simply loosen the clamping
nuts and slide the jig forward. Slip a registration
pin through each rail and into a hole you have
already drilled, and tighten the clamping nuts.

Shopmade Shelf-Hole Jigs 
One of the primary advantages of making your
own shelf-drilling jig is that you can easily create
groupings of holes where they will be most use-
ful. Another plus of the two-bushing jig I
designed is that it’s small enough to fit into your
toolbox for job-site work. When you’re working in
the shop on a large project, you can use the
same jig or scale it up to any desired size by sim-
ply adding more inserts and bushings. 
To make the jig, cut the plate and fence from
3⁄4-in. plywood to the dimensions shown in the
drawing at left. Drill 5⁄8-in. holes through the plate,
making their center-to-center distance any dimen-
sion you wish. Place the tapered end of the
insert into one of the holes, and tap it with a
hammer until it is nearly flush. To make the jig
reversible, you need to sink the insert 1⁄16 in.
below the surface of the plate. A couple of taps
on the end of a socket from a wrench set will do
the job quickly (A). After you glue and screw the
fence to the plate, screw the 1⁄4-in. bushings into
the inserts (B).
To use the jig, first lay out the location of a start-
ing hole near each edge of a cabinet side. Use a
framing square to make certain that they are
aligned. Place the line so that it coincides with
the top of the jig; it is difficult to accurately judge
the location looking through the hole. Hold the jig
flat and firmly against the edge and drill the top
hole (C). Insert a bit into the hole to lock the jig
into position, and drill the second hole (D). To drill
the third hole in the series, remove the bit, slide
the jig down, place the bit into the second hole,
and drill. You can continue this process—called
step and repeat—for as many holes as you need.

To drill the line of holes on the opposite side,
unscrew the bushings from the jig and turn it
over. You will want to swap the top and bottom
bushings to equalize the wear. The top bushing is
used to drill only the first hole, and after that it’s
used just for alignment. However, the bottom
bushing is used for drilling every hole in the
series except the first. As it gets more wear, the
hole size increases, and that decreases accuracy. 
The completed line of holes (E) shows proves that
even a small jig can produce accurate results.

xcept on moving day, most people
don’t give their bed hardware any
attention. In some ways, that’s appro-
priate, because a properly built bed does
absolutely nothing: no shaking, no rattling,
and no rolling. One exception to the
absolutely stationary bed is a category that
folds against the wall to give you extra space
when you’re awake, but even this type has
sturdy hardware to prevent unwanted motion.
To attain dependability when you build a
bed, you need to thoroughly understand all
your options. After all, you certainly don’t
want to lose any sleep wondering whether
you’ve made the right choice.
Post-to-Rail Connectors 
When you build a bed, you can choose
between two general construction tech-
niques. In the first method, you build four
bedposts, two side rails, a head rail, and a
foot rail. In this case, you need two sets of
rail-to-post fasteners for each post. The sec-
ond method involves the same parts, but this
time you permanently join two posts with
the head rail, creating the headboard assem-
bly, and the other two posts with the foot
rail, making the footboard. For this con-
struction method, you need only one set of
post-to-rail fasteners for each post.
You’ll find two styles of bed bolts. The
traditional type has a square head that
requires a special wrench. The bolt mates
with a square nut mortised into the rail. The
more modern version of the bed bolt has a

SECTION 11 OVERVIEW
hex head that allows you to use a standard
socket wrench. It couples with a threaded
steel dowel that you insert into the rail.
Although both styles of bed bolts make
strong joints, neither fastener is particularly
good looking. The usual solution is to hide
the bed bolt’s head under a cover made from
stamped or cast metal.
Bed-Rail Fasteners 
The photo at right below shows three styles
of interlocking fasteners, each available in
two sizes, that give you additional ways to
assemble a wood bed frame that has a head-
board, footboard, and two rails. Although all
of the fasteners appear different, they share
two virtues—putting more weight on the
bed tends to draw the joint tighter, and they
are completely concealed when the bed is
assembled.
In the first style, you simply screw mating
halves of the fasteners to the rail and head-
board and footboard. Position the tab
upward on the headboard and footboard,
and the tab downward on the rails. This
style is available in two sizes, 33⁄4 in. or
511⁄16 in. long. Choose the larger size if your
bed rails are wide enough. Select the largest-
diameter and longest screws your hardware
and lumber will hold.
The second design requires you to cut
mortises into both the bedposts and the
rails. Mortise the female plate into the bed-
post and the hooked plate into the end of
the rail.
The third style of fastener utilizes a bed-
lock, which is mortised into the bedpost,
and a hooked plate that is surface mounted
to the rail. The long bedlock is specifically
designed for a sleigh bed. The extended
mounting plate helps to strengthen the joint.
Bed Irons 
To support the box spring, you can attach a
wood cleat along the lower edge of each rail
and span between the rails with individual
wood slats or pieces of plywood. Another
choice is the bed iron, which looks like a
corner reinforcement bracket that took mas-
sive doses of steroids. Mortise three irons
into each rail, and you’ll have a strong sup-
port for the box spring. You also can add an
iron or two to the head and foot rails for
extra security. If you’re wearing both a belt

Beds That Disappear 
Most people sleep only eight hours a day,
but the bed consumes a large amount of
space all the time. By making a bed disap-
pear into an enclosure, you’ll suddenly gain
more usable space within the same number
of square feet.
Among the various styles of self-storing
beds, you’ll discover a full range of sizes and
styles: from single to king, beds that fold
vertically or horizontally, beds that hold only
a mattress, those that also accommodate a
special thin box spring, and even those that
utilize a standard mattress and box spring
set. Each of those choices influences the
height of the mattress above the floor as well
as the depth of the enclosure required. In
addition, you’ll base part of your decision on
whether you’re shopping for personal com-
fort or whether you want to give houseguests
a subtle motivation to move on.
Some manufacturers of folding-bed hard-
ware offer an extensive line of prefinished
surround kits, many of which include book-
cases and lighting options. Other suppliers
provide plans so that you can build your own
cabinetry.
Murphy-Type Beds 
One type of folding bed utilizes a piston-lift
system similar to the type that holds open
the rear liftgate on a car or van. Choose
between a double or queen bed, mounted
either vertically or horizontally, as shown in
the drawing on the facing page. One manu-
facturer includes extensive construction
notes with the hardware so you can build the
framing from plywood or particleboard—
solid wood isn’t recommended.
Making a bed disappear has more to
do with physics than wizardry. But
you’ll enjoy the extra living space that
magically appears. (Photos courtesy

TWO STYLES OF BED
MOUNTING
SECTION 11 OVERVIEW
The Murphy bed is designed to fold against the wall when
not in use, freeing up the floor space for other uses. By utilizing
a Murphy-bed mechanism, you can transform a little-used
guest bedroom into a home office or hobby room. Over the
years, the Murphy name has also been used to describe com-
petitors’ products, in the same way that many people refer to
all brands of plastic laminate as “Formica.” So when you shop
for a folding-bed mechanism, you’ll find Murphy beds and
Murphy-type beds. Some mechanisms, including the genuine
Murphy, attach to the floor, and the surrounding cabinetry is
completely independent of the hardware. However, floor
mounting is impractical in most apartments, unless you have a
very understanding landlord who will allow you to cut away
carpeting and drill holes into the floor. Other folding-bed mech-
anisms attach to wood studs in the wall and utilize either
springs or piston power to raise the bed.

Still another type of disappearing-bed
mechanism consists of a pair of spring
boxes. As shown in the drawing on p. 188,
each box has two parts: a spring mechanism
that you attach to the bed frame, and a
heavy-duty sheet-metal socket that you
screw to the wall-mounted frame. When you
slide the spring mechanism into the socket,
it securely clips into place. A screw on the
spring mechanism lets you adjust the tension
to match the weight of your mattress. These
boxes are substantial pieces of hardware—
each pair weighs more than 23 lb.

Baby’s Crib Demands Careful
Thought and Work 
Some enthusiastic woodworking fathers and
grandfathers can’t resist the urge to build a
crib for their offspring. But before you suc-
cumb to that temptation, do a quick reality
check. You need to understand that today’s

helpless little armful will soon unleash a
relentless destructive force to escape the con-
fines of your workmanship: kicking, jumping,
screaming, and even gnawing at the wood
like a giant termite. Every child, regardless of
gender, has an aptitude for damage that
makes Attila the Hun look like a sissy.
That said, a handcrafted crib can be more
than a satisfying project; it can even become
a treasured family heirloom.
When you’re ready to build a crib, you
can purchase several different woodworking
plans and hardware kits. One hardware style
allows both sides of the crib to lower. This
feature simplifies construction, but the
design is not as sturdy as the type with one
fixed side. Another kit lets you convert the
crib into a youth bed, then into the head-
board and footboard of a full-sized bed.
Whatever style you choose, absolutely insist
that the hardware and design meet the regu-
lations of the United States Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC). As
you assemble the hardware, look for oppor-
tunities to substitute longer screws whenever
possible to increase the strength of your
project. When the crib is in use, periodically
check that all fasteners remain snug. See the
sidebar on the facing page on safety.

People say that there
are only three important
things in real estate: loca-
tion, location, and loca-
tion. With a baby’s crib,
the only three important
factors are safety, safety,
and more safety. 
When you’re shopping
for crib plans and compo-
nents, you’ll find some
variations, such as
whether one or both sides can be lowered. But many other
items, such as the height of the mattress, the design of the
posts, and the spacing of the slats, are covered by guidelines
issued by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), an independent Federal regulatory
agency. Be sure to ask the supplier whether its product and
design meet current CPSC regulations. And unless you’re
absolutely familiar with the regulations yourself, don’t alter the
woodworking plans you purchase. If you have any doubts, con-
tact the agency directly: U.S. Consumer Product Safety

Keep a bunk-bed ladder firmly

style (left) or an adjustable hook

Beds for Older Children 
Some people believe that moving a child from
a crib to an adult-sized bed is too abrupt a
change, so they opt for a juvenile-sized bed.
You can find plans to build a bed in this size,
but it’s always prudent to buy the mattress and
box spring before you start cutting lumber.
Bunk beds are a perennial favorite. For chil-
dren, they satisfy the urge to climb, and for
parents, they fulfill the need to save space. The
ladder on a bunk bed is a potential problem
area, but there are several pieces of hardware
that firmly anchor it to help prevent accidents.
Whether you’re building a bunk bed from
scratch or adding a ladder to an existing bed,
inexpensive hardware simplifies construction
and makes a sturdy connection to the safety
rail. The fixed-hook bunk-bed-ladder connec-
tor can adapt to rails of various thicknesses and
widths, but once you’ve attached it to the rail,
you’re committed to that spot. The adjustable-
hook style requires a 7⁄8-in. by 41⁄2-in. safety
rail, but you can move it to a new location on
the rail by simply loosening the lower clamp.
Welcome an addition to the family by build-
ing a crib. But before you buy hardware or
plans, make certain that they meet the lat-

Bed Bolts 
In the demonstration shown here, you’ll learn
how to use two types of bed bolts. The old-
fashioned style of bed bolt has an integral
washer below the square head and requires a
special wrench. The tapered tip of the bolt makes
it somewhat easier to locate the square nut cap-
tured in a recess in the rail. The modern version
of the bed bolt has a separate washer and a hex-
head bolt that you drive with an ordinary socket
wrench. It mates with a threaded dowel that fits
into a hole drilled into the rail. Except for the size
of the hole for the nut, the installation steps for
both types of bed bolts are identical.

router is my weapon of choice for forming the
mortises (B), and I cut them 9⁄16 in. deep to ensure
that the tip of the tenon doesn’t bottom out in
the mortise and prevent the tenon’s shoulders
from drawing up snugly to the post. Wood hand-
screws clamped to the post serve as stops that

The hardwood rails are 8/4 stock, milled to a fin-

your table saw to cut a tenon that’s 1⁄2 in. long,
1 in. wide, and 5 in. high centered on each end of
the rails (D). Use a square to transfer the horizon-
tal centerline of the mortises to the opposite
faces of the bedpost. Draw the vertical center-
lines on these faces, then mark the bolts’ center-

Bed-Bolt Covers 
To conceal the counterbored bed bolts, install a

to remove one of the screws. Base your choice
on aesthetics and whether you need quick bolt

Bed-Rail Fasteners 
Lay out the location of the mortise for the bed-
lock onto the posts of the headboard and foot-
board (A). With the 23⁄4-in.-square posts and
1-in.-thick rails I used for this bed, I positioned
the edge of the rail flush with the post to pro-
duce a 1⁄2-in. reveal on the outer edge of the rail.
As you can see in the photo, the mortise is 1 in.
longer than the length of the bedlock’s body to
allow entry of the hook plate you’ll later attach to
the side rail. 
Plunge-rout the 3⁄8-in.-wide mortise (B). I posi-
tioned handscrew clamps on the post to stop the
travel of the router at the ends of the mortise.
Drive a 1-in.-wide chisel straight down along the
lines at the upper and lower ends of the bedlock’s
location (C). At this point, you don’t need to chis-
el away any wood near these lines—you’re sim-
ply using the chisel to mark the lines into the
wood. Use a 1⁄4-in. chisel to square up the bottom
end of the mortise so that the bedlock will rest
solidly (D). You don’t need to square the upper
end of the mortise. Strip away the masking tape. 
Next, mortise the plate of the bedlock into the
post. To do this, set the depth of your router bit
1⁄32 in. deeper than the thickness of the plate (E).
I used a 1⁄4-in. bit in a laminate trimmer because
it’s easier to handle than a big router for a small-
scale cut like this. Rout the mortise freehand, cut-
ting as close as you dare to the chiseled end
lines, and remove the remaining waste with a
1-in. chisel (F). The bedlock curves from the plate
into the mortise, so you need to chisel a radius

along the edge of the mortise (G). An exact fit
isn’t necessary—simply shave away enough
wood to allow the bedlock’s plate to fit into its
mortise. For a neat fit, check that the plate doesn’t
project above the surface of the bedpost. 
Drill pilot holes, and drive screws to fasten the
bedlock to the post (H). To maximize holding
power, I used #10 x 2-in. sheet-metal screws. Lay
the bedpost onto your workbench, and insert the
hooked plate into the bedlock. To position the bed
rail flush against the hooked plate, put a
1⁄2-in. spacer (equaling the reveal) under the rail (I).
Double-check that the hooks are fully engaged in
the bedlock, and mark the centerline of the two
large mounting holes parallel to the rail’s length.
Mark the intersecting line for the centerpoint
along the edge of the mounting hole that’s away
from the hook. This procedure moves the hooked
plate toward the center of the rail, ensuring a
strong joint because the hooks can’t bottom out
in the bedlock. Drill 3⁄16-in. pilot holes 7⁄8 in. deep
into the rail for the 1⁄4 x 1-in. lag screws, and drive
them (J). To make certain that the tip of the
screws would not penetrate too far, I used a flat
washer under the head of each screw. With
installation of the hardware complete on both the
post and the rail, you’re ready to assemble the
joint (K).

Bed Irons 
Bed irons resemble corner braces, but they are
11⁄4 in. wide and 1⁄4 in. thick. Lay out the location
of three irons on each side rail, positioning an
iron 12 in. from each end and centering the final
iron (A). In this demonstration, I’m installing the
irons flush with the lower edge of the rail, but
you can move the iron up or down to expose
more or less of the box spring to alter the fin-
ished height of the bed’s surface. 
Here are a couple of quick tricks that will help
prevent tearout when you rout the mortise for
the bed iron. Before routing, use a backsaw to
make cuts at each end of the mortise, angling
them to the 1⁄4-in. mortise depth (B). Using a
router or laminate trimmer, make a light cut no
more than 1⁄8 in. wide, moving from right to left
along the lower edge of the mortise (C). This
technique, called climb cutting, reduces the risk
of blowing out chunks of wood.  
Clear out the rest of the mortise, freehanding
your cuts as close to the layout lines as your con-
fidence takes you (D). If you’re making a batch of
beds, you can save time by making a jig that will
guide your router to produce a mortise the pre-
cise size of the bed iron. But if you’re crafting
only one bed, you can probably rough-rout and
chisel faster than you could make the jig. Finish
the mortises with a chisel, then drive the screws
(E). For maximum holding power, use the largest-
diameter and longest screws your iron and rail
will hold: #12 x 11⁄4 in. is typical.

Murphy Folding Bed
Begin with the base assembly. Bolt the angle
iron, with its spring holes facing upward, to the L-
shaped base brackets (A). I added split-lock
washers under the nuts to keep the joints solid.
Position the base assembly with the legs of the
base brackets pointed toward the wall. For this
particular model, the standard mounting distance
puts the vertical angle iron supports 19 in. from
the wall. This position provides enough clearance
for an 8-in.-thick mattress and a wall-mounted
headboard up to 2 in. thick. If you have a thicker
mattress or if the headboard is more than 2 in.
thick, move the base assembly 1 in. away from
the wall for every inch of additional thickness. I
used a 10-in.-thick mattress, so I moved the base
assembly 21 in. from the wall. 
Drill 3⁄16-in. pilot holes, and screw the base assem-
bly to the subfloor using the 10 1⁄4 x 2-in. lag
screws furnished (B). If you can easily access the
underside of the floor, you can gain holding
power by adding blocking as a target for the
screws or by substituting bolts. For installation to
a concrete floor, drill holes for plugs with a
hammer drill, and drive the screws. (There also
are screws available that you can drive directly
into the concrete, but the hole you drill must be
a specific diameter in relation to the screw’s
diameter.) 
Attach the U-shaped mattress holder to the frame
with 1⁄4-in. nuts (C). This photo also gives you a
good view of the 3-in.-thick foundation that sub-
stitutes for a box spring in this model. Set the
factory-assembled bed frame onto the base
assembly (D). The pins on the frame simply slide
onto the slots on the base brackets. Pivot the
frame into its upright position, and attach the leg
control bars to the base brackets. The control bars
automatically open the legs as you lower the bed
and close them when you raise it. Be sure to
position the nylon bushing where shown (E). The
manufacturer supplied 1⁄4 x 1-in. machine screws

for this purpose, but my addition of a flat washer
under the head plus the substitution of a nylon-
insert locking nut meant that I had to switch to a
machine screw 11⁄4 in. long. 
Don’t overtighten the fasteners—this is a pivot
point that must rotate smoothly. Bolt the metal
bar with plastic feet between the two leg control
bars (F). The Murphy name on the bar plus the
word “Pull” instantly tells you which way this bar
attaches. Have your helper make sure that the
frame stays upright against the wall while you
attach the springs. 
Hook one end of a spring through a hole in the
angle iron of the base assembly, then use the
shank of a long and strong screwdriver to work
the other end of the spring to the mating hole in
the angle iron of the bed frame (G). Putting the
tip of the screwdriver into an adjacent hole helps
you get the leverage you need. Place an equal
number of springs on each side of the frame.
Twin and double beds usually require four
springs, whereas a queen bed will balance with
six springs. Add the mattress and linens, and
you’re ready for a well-deserved nap. Before you
raise the bed, secure the bedding with the strap
attached to the frame (H). The counterbalanced

BUNK-BED ACCESSORIES

Bunk-Bed Ladders 
Securing a ladder to the safety rail of a bunk bed
can help prevent accidents. The fixed-hook style
gets its name from the fact that it’s secured to a
stationary location on the rail. The hooks can be
shimmed to fit a variety of rail thicknesses, and
the width of the rail is not a critical factor. For
those reasons, it’s a good choice for retrofitting
an existing bed. 
Tape the U-shaped hook flush with the top end of
the ladder, and put a scratch awl through the
large-diameter clearance holes to mark the cen-
terpoints of the smaller mounting holes (A). Drill
pilot holes, and screw the hook to the ladder (B).
I used #6 x 2-in. screws. Choose the location on
the rail for the ladder, and then secure it by
screwing on the horizontal strap (C). The dimple
in the strap fits into the upper clearance hole to
immobilize the hook.
VARIATION The adjustable-hook style
can be easily moved to a new location
along a 7⁄8-in. by 41⁄2-in. safety rail by loosen-
ing the lower bracket. It is not designed to
allow a child to slide the ladder along the
rail, so choose a location, then tighten the
cllamp. For added security, the larger hook
style fits over both the upper and lower
edges of a 7⁄8-in.-thick rail that’s
41⁄2 in. wide. Because this style is not
adaptable to other rail sizes, it is typically
used for new bed consstruction rather
than retrofits.

Fortunately, hardware manufacturers have
been hard at work on the problem of organ-

products to support, swivel, hold, slide, stack,
power, rack, clip, bundle, route, cool, hide,
and clamp away your problems.
Wiring Solutions 
One of my favorite wire organizers doesn’t

The printed markers go all the way through
the alphabet and then up to 15 in digits, so
you can hook up a complete home-theater

take apart any of the connections and hook
them back without consulting a single manu-
al. Simply wrap a lettered strip around a
cord, and cover it with a length of clear tape
for security. Identify its terminal on the
equipment with a matching individual letter.

life, you can create problems if you’re wired
too tightly.
You can purchase a plastic trough to cap-
ture wires at the rear of your work surface
and a channel that can attach inconspicuously
to a table leg to route them down to the
floor. In both cases, double-faced tape is a
quick and inexpensive attachment method.
One of my favorite low-tech methods of
accommodating wiring in a cabinet involves
a simple miter cut at a rear corner of the
shelves. It’s small enough that’s it barely
noticeable but large enough to handle
speaker cables and even power cords. Best
of all is its price tag of zero. One caution—
be sure that you don’t cut away the bearing
surface for a shelf pin. A three-point landing
is great if you’re in an airplane, but it’s an
unstable setup for shelves.
Powerful Solutions 
Tracing extension cords all over the work-
place creates tripping hazards and is unsightly.
Organize your power needs by choosing a
power outlet that you can conceal in a desk-
top or on a conference table. The model
shown in the right photo on the facing page
has four grounded outlets and a power cord
that can supply 15 amps. The gently domed
lid sits nearly flush with the table when you
don’t need power, but turn it 180 degrees,
and it elevates itself 3⁄8 in.—high enough to
prevent pinching the cords that are plugged
in but low enough to conceal the plugs. The
enclosure can also handle up to three data
ports in an add-on panel.
If you need both power and a data port in
a compact package, consider a pop-up that

Grommets and 
More Grommets 
Grommets used to be like Model T cars:
available in any color you want, as long as
you want black. Now you’ll find grommets
that color-match trendy computers, sport
metallic finishes, blend almost invisibly into
your laminate work surface, or showcase nat-
ural wood species. In addition, brush grom-
mets let you literally drop plugs through the
opening, and the bristles instantly close
around the wire for a neat look.
Some grommets have an opening that can
snap shut when it’s not needed, and others
have a wire retainer on their rim to prevent
an unplugged cord from disappearing down
the hole.
Keep Cool with Vents 
All electronic equipment generates heat
when in use, so you’ll need to perforate
equipment enclosures with vents.
Some plastic vents pop into round holes
from the outside, whereas while the square
version shown in the middle photo on
p. 202 presents a finished look on both the
inside and outside of your cabinet. The
unfinished wood grille adds a traditional look
and admits a generous amount of cooling air.
It’s a good idea always to use at least two
vents in an enclosure. Position one vent low
on the cabinet to inhale cool air and another
vent up high to exhaust the heated air.
Another approach is changing the ventilation
system from passive to active by purchasing
an equipment-cooling fan.
Home-Office Hardware 
Working at home can be a delight or dread-
ful. If you set up your office to achieve effi-
ciency and comfort, you’ll improve the odds
in your favor.
A good place to start is with a keyboard
support that can fully retract under the work
surface to free up precious desk space when
it’s not needed. You’ll actually find two cate-
gories of supports—one is essentially a drawer
and the other is a fully articulated arm.
The drawer type of support is economical,
and although the lack of adjustability can

limit your choice of work postures, it may be
more stable than some of the arm types.
You’ll find some keyboard drawers that are
ready to install, or you can purchase drawer
slides and brackets to mount below your
work surface, allowing you to make your own
tray. If you want to conceal every vestige of
technology when the drawer is closed, look
for slides that also incorporate a hinge at the
front end. These allow you to add a flip-down
front to hide the contents of the drawer.
Carefully check the depth required by the
drawer to make sure that you’ll still have
enough knee room.
You can purchase the slide and support as
a “package” system or purchase the compo-
nents individually. If you purchase only the
slide hardware, you can design and craft your
own support tray.
The drawer type may be a good choice if
you use a home office to pay bills and to
occasionally access the Internet, but if you
work full time at home, you should seriously
consider the advantages of a keyboard arm.
The variety of working positions you can
choose with a fully adjustable arm does more
than offer relief from monotony—the change
may also help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome
or other ailments caused by repetitive stress.

The tiny fan (sometimes several of them)

borne dust, dirt, and other things so strange
that they would stump even the forensic

Some of this fuzzy gunk blows into your
workspace where you can inhale it, and some
settles on components inside the CPU where
it may reduce cooling efficiency to the point
that circuit boards can fry themselves to
death. Another danger from the buildup is
the potential for creating alternate current
paths—these are called short circuits.
Lifting your CPU off the floor may not

It’s also a good idea to secure the monitor to

Organized Media Storage 
The compact disc (CD) may be the hardest-
working medium in show business but it also
performs a variety of jobs around the modern
office, storing programs and data.
Fortunately, there are a number of CD stor-
age racks that let you create custom systems
that are either freestanding or an integral
part of office furniture or an entertainment
center. Choose from units that store single or
double CDs in tracks that lock the case until
you push in with your finger. The plastic

The heavy-duty slide shown in the bottom
photo on p. 205 can handle a television that
weighs up to 225 pounds. But the strength 
of the hardware itself won’t be your biggest
concern. Cantilevering the center of gravity
of the television past the edge of the cabinet
creates a powerful levering action that will
attempt to rip the rear edge of the shelf out
of the cabinet or tip over the entire enter-
tainment center. For those reasons, I wouldn’t
suggest using a television slide in any cabinet
that isn’t securely fastened to the house.
Downscaled lazy Susan bearings, such as
the 3-in. and 6-in. sizes, are too small to
safely hold a regular-sized television, but
you’ll find them handy for making rotary
storage units.
A swivel that also pulls the television out
of the recesses of your entertainment center
is a helpful accessory that makes any seat in
the room a great place for viewing.
In addition, you can swivel the television
90 degrees to make it easy to hook up acces-
sories such as a DVD player and auxiliary
speakers.
This simple mounting technique
works for both square and round lazy
Susan bearings.
After you’ve shaped and applied fin-
ish to both the base and top, lay out the
location of the pilot holes in both parts
and drill them. If you have a square
bearing, screw it to the base, and rotate
it 90 degrees. Put a scratch awl through
the mounting hole in the top plate, and
mark its position on the base. Create the
access hole by drilling through the base
at that centerpoint with a 5⁄8-in. Forstner
bit. Referring to the drawing at right,
you can now place the base on the top
and use the access hole to drive screws
into the top. Don’t torque down on the
screws until you have them all started.
Complete the assembly by adding a cork
or nonslip rubber foot at each corner of the base.
When you’re mounting a round bearing, simply
position the bearing on the base and mark the 
centerpoint of the access hole. Remove the bearing 
to drill the hole, then complete the procedure
described above.

Laminate-Covered
Grommet 
With a special grommet, you can cover its cap
with plastic laminate, matching your work sur-
face for a virtually invisible installation. When you
adhere the laminate to the work-surface sub-
strate, also put some adhesive on the top of the
cap and an oversized piece of laminate (A). If you
use solvent-based contact cement, be sure to
work in a well-ventilated area. 
After you’ve adhered the laminate, place the trim
ring onto the cap, and use a flush-trim bit in your
table-mounted router to cut the laminate to size
(B). I use a rubber-covered grout float (from the
ceramic tile department of a home center) to
keep my fingers away from the bit. Use a 1⁄2-in.
drill to power a 3-in.-dia. hole through the work
surface (C). You may want to test-drill in a piece
of scrap to ensure a good fit. While drilling, be
sure to remove the bit periodically and clean the
teeth using a brass wire brush. Once the pilot bit
penetrates the work surface, complete the hole
by drilling from the underside of the work sur-
face. If necessary, use 100-grit sandpaper in a
block to fine-tune the edge of the cap so it fits. I
held the block steady on its edge and lightly
rolled the cap. Use household cement or epoxy
to adhere the liner into the hole (D). Be sure to
adjust the liner to the proper depth so that the
cap is flush with the work surface (E).

hole through the work surface. If you’re able to
get the surface to your drill press, you can drill
the hole with an adjustable fly cutter (A). Make
certain that the tip of the cutter is positioned as
shown in the photo. If you have it reversed, you’ll
get a straight-walled plug, but the hole through
the work surface will have a tapered ridge at the
bottom.
[TIP] If you can’t maneuver the work sur-
face to the drill press, you can still use a
fly cutter to make aa router template. To do
that, drill the 27⁄8-in. hole through a piece of
scrap 3⁄4-in. plywood, and clamp it to the
desired location on the work surface. Use
a spade bit to drill a 1-in.. starter hole with-
in the template’s opening and through the
work surface. Chuck a flush-trimming bitt
with a top-mounted bearing into your
router, and rout the hole.
Press the housing into the work surface, making
certain that the rectangular slot faces the direc-
tion that you want for plug and port access (B). If
you need to slightly enlarge the size of the hole,
use a rasp, but don’t let its teeth drag across the
edge of the laminate on the upstroke because
that could cause chipout. If the fit is too loose,
glue the housing in place with household cement
(Duco is one brand).

out the Allen screws in the bottom of the extru-
sion, and put the end of a data cable through the
hole in the bottom (I cut one end from a factory-
made data cable). Do not put the wires through
the housing in the work surface. You wire up the
data port first, then push it up into the housing
from below the work surface. Strip the jacket off
of the cable, and attach the individual color-coded
wires to the matching terminals on the data port
by using a push-down tool. The blue plastic item
shown in the photo doubles as a wire jacket strip-
per and its notched metal part is the push-down
tool. 
Attaching the wires is a quick and easy proce-
dure, but if you are unsure about the process,
take the cable and data-port assembly to an elec-
tronics-supply store or a computer retailer, and
the people there can either show you how to
make the connections or do the job for you.
When you’ve completed the hookup, snap the
connector covers (not shown in photo) over the
wired terminals, and position the data port side-
ways inside the extrusion. Snap on the retaining
bezel to hold the port in position. Replace the
Allen screws to secure the bottom onto the
extrusion.
Reach under the work surface, and push the
completed assembly into the housing. Using an

these screws too much, or you’ll risk stripping
the tiny threads.

certain that the track is square to the front edge
of the countertop, and drive the supplied screws
into pilot holes to fasten it. Install the stop
bumper in the center rear hole of the track (B),
but omit the screw in the front center hole

Television 
Pullout and Swivel 
If you’re designing an entertainment center, I’d
suggest that you do an initial test installation on a
mock-up shelf on the workbench instead of inside
a cabinet. That way, you don’t have to
calculate clearances—you can measure them
directly to make absolutely certain that you’ll
avoid embarrassing and costly mistakes.
The manufacturer of this swivel suggests that you
place the center of gravity of the television over
the center of rotation or rearward. In many cases,
though, you’ll find that following the manufac-
turer’s recommendation will place the television
unacceptably far back on the swivel, so you’ll
need to cheat its position forward. To find your
television’s front-to-back center of balance, place a
1⁄2-in. square rod on your workbench, and rest the
television on the wood strip (A). When the set
balances, you’ve found that center of balance. As
you can see in the photo, I went one step further
and also found the center of balance with the tele-
vision resting on its back. The intersection of the
two balance lines is the center of gravity, repre-
sented by the circle divided into quadrants. 
I’m not really recommending that you need to find
the center of gravity of your own television, but I
did it with mine to make a point about the neces-
sity of anchoring the TV to the platform. As you
can tell, the center of gravity is only about 41⁄2 in.
back from the front of the screen and at nearly 
60 percent of its height. The design becomes
quite unstable when you put it into motion on a
slide, or more correctly, when you try to stop it at
the end of a sliding motion. The 80-lb. television
will want to stay in motion, and its high center of
gravity makes it a likely candidate to drop face
first onto your floor. You’ll find out more about the
anchoring process later in the demonstration.

WARNING
Any hardware that
moves equipment forward in an enter-
tainment center can exert tremendous
leverage  upon the shelf, so make certain
that it is strong enough and fastened
extremely well. In addition, moviing a
television forward changes the center of
gravity of the cabinet and could cause a
freestanding  cabinet to topple forward.
To prevent this, bolt the cabinet to the
floor, or use lag screws to anchor  the
cabinet to wood wall studs.

Next, you’ll need to determine the size of the
wood platform that you’ll make and attach to the
swivel plate. Although you could make the plat-
form’s length just slightly more than the actual
contact surface of your television, that could pro-
duce an unnerving barely balanced appearance. I
made the front-to-back depth of the platform 1 in.
greater than the contact surface. (Some people
make the platform much deeper, then chop off the
corners for swinging clearance.) 
Cut a piece of 3⁄4-in. plywood to size for the plat-
form, and cover the plywood’s exposed core on
the two ends (B). I used iron-on edgebanding, but
you could glue on thin solid-wood strips. Hold
your utility knife blade flat against the end of the
plywood and push down to cut the overhanging
ends of the banding. Scrape and sand the edges
of the banding flush with the plywood. Temporarily
place the plywood on top of the swivel plate,
measure to the shelf, and subtract 1⁄4 in. to deter-
mine the width of the fascia board (C).
Rip the fascia board to width, and crosscut it to
length. Referring to the drawing on the facing
page, lay out the centerpoints of the holes. After
you drill the holes with a Forstner bit, draw lines
tangent to their rims to complete the shape. Cut
along the lines with a scrollsaw or bandsaw, and
sand smooth (D). Chuck a 1⁄4-in. roundover bit into
your table-mounted router, and round over the
inner and outer lower edges and the outer upper
edge. Do any touch-up sanding necessary (E).
Use glue and pocket-hole screws to attach the
fascia board to the platform (F).
Place the completed platform upside down on
your workbench, and place a 1⁄2-in. square spacer
rod between the centered swivel and the fascia.
Make sure that the slides are fully retracted to the
hold-in position, and measure from the front end
of the slide to the front of the fascia (G). Add 1⁄4 in.
