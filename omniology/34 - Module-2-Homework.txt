Module 2 – Homework 
 
• Read Module 2 handouts  
• Install Virtual box on your PC 
• Create your first new VM (The specification is below) 
• Download and Install Linux CentOS on your virtual box (PLEASE NOTE:  
During installation you will get the option to turn Ethernet ON or OFF.  Please 
keep the Ethernet ON for your installation) 
• I would highly recommend that you install Linux OS the first time and then 
delete it.  Then install the 2nd time and keep it.  This will be a good practice for 
the OS installation 
• After the installation familiarize yourself with GNOME desktop environment.  
Most likely you will not be working a lot on the GUI but I would still 
recommend to know a few features of desktop GUI 
  
Specification for Linux VM is as follow: 
CPU = 1 
Memory = 2G 
Disk Space = 10G
