circuits and systems. Each Lecture is self-contained and focuses on the background information
required to understand the subject matter and practical case studies that illustrate applications. e
format of a Lecture is structured such that each will be devoted to a speciﬁc topic in digital circuits
and systems rather than a larger overview of several topics such as that found in a comprehensive
handbook. e Lectures cover both well-established areas as well as newly developed or emerging
material in digital circuits and systems design and analysis.

ABSTRACT
is book, Electronic Devices and Circuit Application, is the ﬁrst of four books of a larger work,
Fundamentals of Electronics. It is comprised of four chapters describing the basic operation of each
of the four fundamental building blocks of modern electronics: operational ampliﬁers, semicon-
ductor diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and ﬁeld eﬀect transistors. Attention is focused on the
reader obtaining a clear understanding of each of the devices when it is operated in equilibrium.
Ideas fundamental to the study of electronic circuits are also developed in the book at a basic level
to lessen the possibility of misunderstandings at a higher level. e diﬀerence between linear and
non-linear operation is explored through the use of a variety of circuit examples including am-
pliﬁers constructed with operational ampliﬁers as the fundamental component and elementary
digital logic gates constructed with various transistor types.
Fundamentals of Electronics has been designed primarily for use in an upper division course
in electronics for electrical engineering students. Typically such a course spans a full academic
years consisting of two semesters or three quarters. As such, Electronic Devices and Circuit Ap-
plications, and the following two books, Ampliﬁers: Analysis and Design and Active Filters and
Ampliﬁer Frequency Response, form an appropriate body of material for such a course. Secondary
applications include the use in a one-semester electronics course for engineers or as a reference
for practicing engineers.

Preface
It is expected that the reader of this text is familiar with the common passive elements of linear
circuit analysis (resistors, inductors, capacitors, and transformers) as well as the idealized linear
active elements (independent and dependent voltage and current sources). Unfortunately, the ﬁeld
of electronics makes great use of active elements that do not necessarily fall into either of the above
categories. ese active elements may behave in either a linear or non-linear fashion depending
on their circuit application.
e study of electronic circuit behavior traditionally begins with three active semiconductor
electronic elements:
• e Semiconductor Diode
• e Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)
• e Field Eﬀect Transistor (FET)
To this trio of fundamental devices has been added an additional electronic circuit building
block, the Operational Ampliﬁer (OpAmp). While the OpAmp is composed of tens of transistors
(usually either BJTs or FETs, but sometimes a mixture of both types) and often a few diodes, its
easily understood terminal properties, high use in industry, and commercial availability make it a
good companion for study with the other devices.
Quasistatic analysis explores the potentially non-linear action of each of these four elements
(or any other similar element) in a variety of applications. e fundamental assumption in this
exploration is that voltage and current transitions take place slowly and that the circuit is always
in equilibrium: hence the term quasistatic.
e authors have chosen to begin the study of electronics with a chapter on the operational
ampliﬁer for several reasons, among which are:
• in most simple applications, the OpAmp behaves in a near-ideal fashion.

While many readers will ﬁnd much in this chapter on OpAmps a review, the chapter
presents several concepts fundamental to the study of electronic circuitry. Most signiﬁcant among
these concepts are:

PREFACE
• undistorted ampliﬁcation
• gain
• device modeling
• conditions under which device models, particularly linear models, fail
Of particular importance is the concept that a device with extremely complex interior work-
ing mechanisms can be modeled simply by its terminal characteristics.
e remaining three chapters in this book present the semiconductor diode, the BJT and
the FET. Each chapter follows the same basic framework and has the same goals:
• To present each device through real experimental data and through theoretical functional
relationships.
• To use the above presented relationships to observe the action of the device in relatively
simple circuits.
• To devise a progression of realistic piecewise-linear models for the devices. e theoretical
basis for each model is presented and the appropriate use of these models is explored. Only
when a model fails to properly predict device behavior will new, more complex, models be
introduced. is simple-to-complex route provides for progressively more detailed analysis
using the newly introduced models.
• To use realistic applications to demonstrate the usefulness of the device models.
• To provide a solid foundation for the linear and non-linear modeling and applications found
in later books of this series.
Upon completing Book 1, the reader will have a good foundation in the operation of these
four basic active, non-linear devices. e fundamental regions of operation for each device will
have been explored: both linear and non-linear device models will be available for further inves-
tigations.

Operational Ampliﬁers and
Applications
e Operational Ampliﬁer (commonly referred to as the OpAmp) is one of the primary active
devices used to design low and intermediate frequency analog electronic circuitry: its importance
is surpassed only by the transistor. OpAmps have gained wide acceptance as electronic building
blocks that are useful, predictable, and economical. Understanding OpAmp operation is funda-
mental to the study of electronics.
e name, operational ampliﬁer, is derived from the ease with which this fundamental
building block can be conﬁgured, with the addition of minimal external circuitry, to perform
a wide variety of linear and non-linear circuit functions. Originally implemented with vacuum
tubes and now as small, transistorized integrated circuits, OpAmps can be found in applications
such as: signal processors (ﬁlters, limiters, synthesizers, etc.), communication circuits (oscillators,
modulators, demodulators, phase-locked loops, etc.), Analog/Digital converters (both A to D
and D to A), and circuitry performing a variety of mathematical operations (multipliers, dividers,
adders, etc.).
e study of OpAmps as circuit building blocks is an excellent starting point in the study
of electronics. e art of electronics circuit and system design and analysis is founded on circuit
realizations created by interfacing building block elements that have speciﬁc terminal character-
istics. OpAmps, with near-ideal behavior and electrically good interconnection properties, are
relatively simple to describe as circuit building blocks.
Circuit building blocks, such as the OpAmp, are primarily described by their terminal char-
acteristics. Often this level of modeling complexity is suﬃcient and appropriately uncomplicated
for electronic circuit design and analysis. However, it is often necessary to increase the complexity
of the model to simplify the analysis and design procedures. ese models are constructed from
basic circuit elements so that they match the terminal characteristics of the device. Resistors, ca-
pacitors, and voltage and current sources are the most common elements used to create such a
model: an OpAmp can be described at a basic level with two resistors and a voltage-controlled
voltage source.
OpAmp circuit analysis also oﬀers a good review of fundamental circuit analysis techniques.
From this solid foundation, the building block concept is explored and expanded throughout this
text. With the building block concept, all active devices are treated as functional blocks with spec-
iﬁed input and output characteristics derived from the device terminal behavior. Circuit design is

the process of interconnecting active building blocks with passive components to produce a wide
variety of desired electronic functions.
1.1
BASIC AMPLIFIER CHARACTERISTICS
One of the fundamental characteristics of an ampliﬁer is its gain.¹ Gain is deﬁned as the factor
that relates the output to the input signal intensities. As shown in Figure 1.1, a time dependent
input signal, x.t/, is introduced to the “black box” which represents an ampliﬁer and another time
dependent signal, y.t/, appears at the output.
x.t/
A
y.t/
Figure 1.1: “Black box” representation of an ampliﬁer with input x.t/ and output y.t/.
In actuality, x.t/ can represent either a time dependent or time independent signal. e
output of a good ampliﬁer, y.t/, is of the same functional form as the input with two signiﬁcant
diﬀerences: the magnitude of the output is scaled by a constant factor, A, and the output is delayed
by a time, td. is input-output relationship can be expressed as:
y.t/ D Ax.t   td/C˛
(1.1)
where
A is the gain of the ampliﬁer,
˛ is the output DC oﬀset, and
td is the time delay between the input and output signals.
e signal is “ampliﬁed” by a factor of A. Ampliﬁcation is a ratio of output signal level to
the input signal level. e output signal is ampliﬁed when jAj is greater than 1. For jAj less than
1, the output signal is said to be attenuated. If A is a negative value, the ampliﬁer is said to invert
the input. Should x.t/ be sinusoidal, inversion of a signal is equivalent to a phase shift of 180ı:
negative A implies the output signal is ˙180ı out of phase with the input signal.
For time-varying signals, it may be convenient to ﬁnd the ampliﬁcation (ratio) by com-
paring either the root-mean-squared (RMS) values or the peak values of the input and output
signals. Good measurement technique dictates that ampliﬁcation is found by measuring the in-
put and output RMS values since peak values may, in many instances, be ambiguous and diﬃcult
to quantify.² Unfortunately, in many practical instances, RMS or power meters are not available
dictating the measurement of peak amplitudes. e delay time is an important quantity that is
¹Other ampliﬁer speciﬁcations of interest include input and output impedances, power consumption, frequency response,
noise factor, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), and operational temperature range. An understanding of the basis for these
speciﬁcations and their impact on design will be developed in the chapters that follow. e discussion in this chapter will, for
the most part, be restricted to gain and time-domain eﬀects.
²Peak values are also strongly aﬀected by the presence of noise.

often overlooked in electronic circuit analysis and design.³ e signal encounters delay between
the input and output of an ampliﬁer simply because it must propagate through a number of the
internal components of the amplifying block.
In Figure 1.1, x.t/ and y.t/ are time dependent signals. Depending on the ampliﬁer, x.t/
and y.t/ can be either current or voltage signals. Every ampliﬁer draws power from a power supply,
typically in the form of current from a DC voltage source. As will be shown in later sections of
this text, the maximum possible output signal level is determined largely by the power supply
voltage and current limitations. For instance, assume that the ampliﬁer in Figure 1.1 is powered
by a DC voltage source with output equal to VCC. If the output signal, y.t/, is a voltage signal,
the maximum output voltage attainable under ideal conditions for the gain block is VCC.⁴ e
phenomenon of limiting output voltage levels to lie within the limits set by the power supplies
is called saturation. Should the power supply be unable to provide suﬃcient current to the gain
block, the output will also be limited, although in a manner that is not as simple as in saturation.
In order to discuss terminal characteristics of commercially available OpAmps, a speciﬁc
ampliﬁer must be selected. e A741 (or LM741, MC1741) is a good choice since it is the most
commonly used and studied OpAmp available. e preﬁxes {A, OP, LM, MC} designate the
manufacturer of the integrated circuit (IC): A represents Fairchild Semiconductor, OP is used
by Linear Technologies, LM by National Semiconductor, and MC by Motorola Semiconductors.
e speciﬁcation sheets for the three OpAmps listed above can be found on the internet. In many
instances, one or two letters follow the numerical designation of the IC. ese letters indicate the
package type or size and package material. For example, a A741CP is a 741 IC manufactured
by National Semiconductor that is in a commercial grade plastic standard eight lead dual-in-line
package (DIP) or MINI DIP. Other manufacturers, such as Texas Instruments, manufacture the
A741CP using the Fairchild part designation.
Other common OpAmps include the OP-27, LF411, and LM324. e OP-27 and LF411
OpAmps have speciﬁcations that are similar to the A741 and come in selected packages. e
OP-27 and LF411 OpAmps are, like the A741, dual power rail ampliﬁers; that is, the ampliﬁer
usually operates with both a positive and negative power supply voltages. e LM324, on the
other hand, is a single supply ampliﬁer; it requires a positive voltage and a common reference
(ground).
Figure 1.2 shows a top view of a A741CP package with the terminal designations. e
terminals of interest are:
• the inverting input (pin 2),
• the non-inverting input (pin 3),
³e implication of delay time is addressed in the transistor ampliﬁer time domain analysis portion of the third book of this
series.
⁴Note that upper case letters are used for DC signals and lower case letters for time-varying signals. Lower case letters with
lower case subscripts is used for AC signals. Lower case letters with upper case subscripts are used for AC signals with DC
components.

• the output (pin 6),
• the positive power supply (designated CVcc, pin 7), and
• the negative power supply (designated  Vcc, pin 4).
e oﬀset null pins (1 and 5) are used to compensate for minor fabrication imperfections as
well as degradation due to aging. Although commonly left disconnected by the circuit designer,
these pins are sometimes utilized in applications that require the ampliﬁcation of very small level
signals. e A741 OpAmp is a compensated ampliﬁer. e performance implications of com-
pensated and uncompensated ampliﬁers are related to frequency response and stability: they will
be discussed in detail in the third book of this series.

Notice that the schematic symbol of the OpAmp does not have a ground pin. In many ways,
the lack of a ground pin on the OpAmp is the key to its operation. Ideally, only the diﬀerential
voltage between the two input pins aﬀects the output voltage of an OpAmp. A ground reference
is provided external to the chip package.

MODELING THE OPAMP
Terminal voltages and currents are used to characterize OpAmp behavior. In order to unify all
discussions of OpAmp circuitry, it is necessary to deﬁne appropriate descriptive conventions. All
voltages are measured relative to a common reference node (or ground) which is external to the
chip as is shown in Figure 1.4. e voltage between the inverting pin and ground is denoted as
v1: the voltage between the non-inverting pin and ground is v2. e output voltage referenced
to ground is denoted as vo. Power is typically applied to an OpAmp in the form of two equal-
magnitude supplies, denoted VCC and  VCC, which are connected to the VC and V  terminals of
the OpAmp, respectively.
e reference current directions are shown in Figure 1.4. e direction of current ﬂow is
always into the nodes of the Op Amp. e current into the inverting input terminal is i1; current
into the non-inverting input terminal is i2; current into the output terminal is io; and the currents
into the positive and negative power supply terminals are IC  and ICC, respectively.

e voltage and current constraints inherent to the input and output terminals of an
OpAmp must be understood prior to connecting external circuit elements. e OpAmp is con-
sidered as a building block element with speciﬁc rules of operation. A short discussion of these
rules of operation follows.
e terminal voltages are constrained by the following relationships⁵

ference between the non-inverting and inverting terminal inputs, v2 and v1, respectively. e

at length in the third book of this series.

proportionality constant A is the called the open loop gain, whose signiﬁcance will be detailed
later. e second voltage constraint states that the output voltage is limited to the power supply
rails.⁶ at is, vo must lie between ˙VCC. If the output reaches the limiting values, the ampliﬁer
is said to be saturated. In reality, the ampliﬁer saturates at voltages slightly shy of ˙VCC due to
device characteristics within the OpAmp. So long as jvoj < VCC, the ampliﬁer is operating in
the linear region. Between the limiting values lies the “linear region” where the output voltage
is related to the input voltage by the proportionality constant A. Figure 1.5a shows an idealized
voltage transfer characteristic⁷ of an OpAmp. A more realistic voltage transfer characteristic is
shown in Figure 1.5b where the ampliﬁer response gradually tapers toward saturation at higher
input voltages due to the characteristics of the circuit design internal to the chip.
From the data sheet for the A741C, the typical open loop gain (designated as Large Signal
Voltage Gain), A, is 200k. It is reasonable to assume that all OpAmps have very large voltage gain
and that a ﬁrst-order approximation of the voltage gain is:

In the 741 OpAmp, the absolute maximum supply voltages (VCC and  VCC) are ˙18V.

input.

In most OpAmp applications this voltage level can be considered negligible. erefore, in
the linear region of operation, the input voltages are assumed to be equal:
v1  v2:

e input terminals of an OpAmp exhibit high input resistance: the A741 typically has an input
resistance of 2 M. e input resistance of an ideal OpAmp is approximated as inﬁnite.

e input currents, i1 and i2, are extremely small and are considered to be approximately zero:
i1 D i2  0:
(1.5b)
e two relationships given in Equations (1.5a) and (1.5b) together form what is referred
to as a “virtual short” between the inverting and non-inverting input terminals of the OpAmp. A
virtual short implies that two terminals act in a voltage sense as if they were shorted, but no current
ﬂows between the terminals.
Kirchhoﬀ’s current law (KCL) can be used to sum the currents of an OpAmp. Since the
input currents are very small, the resulting relationship is,
io D  .ICC C IC /:

Equation (1.7) indicates that although the input currents are negligible, the output current is
substantial. at is, io ¤ 0.
For completeness, the typical output resistance of a 741 OpAmp is 75 . All OpAmps
have low output resistance: Ideal OpAmps are considered to have zero-value output resistance.

components. erefore, using either speciﬁcation will yield acceptable results when designing a
circuit using the A741C.
e voltage and current constraints given are the parameters used to describe an ideal
OpAmp model. By attaching external components to an OpAmp, a functional circuit can be
designed. e signiﬁcance of this exercise is to demonstrate the power of modelling active ele-
ments (in this case, an OpAmp) in terms of its current and voltage characteristics at the input and
output ports. Although an understanding of the internal operation of the active device is desir-
able, circuits can be designed using the device’s input and output port parameters. e terminal
characteristics of the active device in conjunction with the Kirchhoﬀ’s current and voltage laws
are used to analyze the circuit.
A simple application of an OpAmp is the unity gain buﬀer, which is primarily used to
isolate electronic signals. A unity gain buﬀer or voltage follower is shown in Figure 1.6. e circuit
can be analyzed using the voltage and current constraints given by Equations (1.5a) and (1.5b),
respectively,

and
i1 D i2  0:
e input signal voltage vi is equal to v2 since negligible current ﬂows into the positive input
terminal of the OpAmp (i2 D 0): there is no voltage drop across Rs. Owing to the virtual short
between the inverting and non-inverting terminals, the non-inverting terminal voltage is also at
the same voltage level, vi, that is,
vi D v2 D v1:

e voltage follower is called a unity gain buﬀer since it is an ideal impedance transformer. e
input impedance of the voltage follower is very high and its output impedance is, for all practical
purposes, zero. Veriﬁcation of these impedance characteristics provides a useful exercise in the
study of OpAmp properties.
e input and output resistances of the voltage follower can be found by using the simpliﬁed
equivalent circuit for the OpAmp. e simpliﬁed equivalent circuit, shown in Figure 1.7, diﬀers
from the ideal OpAmp model in that the equivalent circuit is a lumped parameter (resistors and
sources) model of the OpAmp in the linear region of operation. It is a functional equivalent of
the OpAmp which is not the actual circuitry in the OpAmp chip, but behaves functionally as an
OpAmp to external circuitry (the principle is much the same as évenin or Norton equivalent
circuits). e simpliﬁed OpAmp equivalent model shown here assumes frequency independent
behavior: that is, the response of the ampliﬁer is independent of signal frequency.⁹
e current and voltage constraints in Equations (1.5a) and (1.5b) assumed in the ideal
OpAmp model must be discarded when using the simpliﬁed equivalent model. Equation (1.2) is
no longer valid due to the non-zero output resistance, Ro.

is found to be 375  which in most circuit applications can be considered essentially zero.
A SPICE simulation to determine the output resistance of a unity gain buﬀer using the
circuit of Figure 1.10 is shown in Example 1.2. Solution #1 of Example 1.2 uses a SPICE-engine
simulator (National Instruments MultiSim) solution using the Transfer Function Analysis com-
mand in conjunction with a source voltage to yield the gain and input and output resistances. Al-
though the Transfer Function Analysis command is adequate for this particular example, a more
general approach is to use a test source at the output as shown in Solution #2. is is particularly
important when the input and output resistances are complex and are dependent on frequency.
For instance, the input and output impedances of real OpAmps are complex and frequency de-
pendent.
Example 1.2
Find the output resistance for a unity gain buﬀer using SPICE and the simpliﬁed OpAmp equiv-
alent circuit.
Solution #1:
e National Instruments MultiSim solution using the Transfer Function Analysis com-
mand with a source voltage.
e Transfer Function Analysis command yields¹¹ Rin D 400 G and Rout D 0 . e
input resistance found here exactly matches the calculations using Equation (1.20). e output
resistance is functionally the same value as found in Example 1.1.
¹¹Many SPICE-based circuit simulators, as a default, insert a shunt resistance from analog nodes to ground [RSHUNT] to
help eliminate problems such as “singular matrix” errors. Multisim™uses a default value of 1012 for RSHUNT: that value
is not large enough to produce correct results for the circuit under consideration in this example. RSHUNT was removed
from the list of default parameters in order to produce the results shown here.

Solution #2:

source at the output of the equivalent model yields Rout D 375  which exactly matches the
hand-calculated results of Example 1.1 and is, for all practical purposes, zero.

BASIC APPLICATIONS OF THE OPAMP
Although the OpAmp can be used in inﬁnite circuit conﬁgurations, several conﬁgurations have
become basic electronic building blocks. ese commonly-found OpAmp circuit conﬁgurations

are the inverting ampliﬁer, summing ampliﬁer, non-inverting ampliﬁer, diﬀerence ampliﬁer, in-
tegrator, and diﬀerentiator. All ﬁve conﬁgurations can be analyzed using the voltage and current
constraints, and the ideal model of the OpAmp discussed in Sections 1.1 and 1.2.
1.3.1
INVERTING AMPLIFIER
e inverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration shown in Figure 1.11 ampliﬁes and inverts the input signal
in the linear region of operation. e circuit consists of a resistor RS in series with the voltage
source vi connected to the inverting input of the OpAmp. e non-inverting input of the OpAmp
is short circuited to ground (common). A resistor Rf is connected to the output and provides
a negative feedback path to the inverting input terminal.¹² Because the output resistance of the
OpAmp is nearly zero, the output voltage vo will not depend on the current that might be supplied
to a load resistor connected between the output and ground.
For most OpAmps, it is appropriate to assume that their characteristics are approximated
closely by the ideal OpAmp model of Section 1.2. erefore, analysis of the inverting ampliﬁer
can proceed using the voltage and current constraints of Equations (1.5a) and (1.5b),

Node 1 is said to be a virtual ground due to the virtual short circuit between the inverting and
non-inverting terminals (which is grounded) as deﬁned by the voltage constraint,

Notice that the voltage gain is dependent only on the ratio of the resistors external to the OpAmp,
Rf and RS. e ampliﬁer increases the amplitude of the input signal by this ratio. e negative
sign in the voltage gain indicates an inversion in the signal.
e output voltage is also constrained by the supply voltages VCC and  VCC,
jvoj < VCC:
Using Equation (1.28), the maximum resistor ratio Rf =Rs for a given input voltage vi is

(1.29)
e input resistance of the inverting ampliﬁer can be readily determined by applying the voltage
constraint: v1 D v2 D 0. erefore, the resistance that the signal source vi encounters is simply
RS due to the virtual short to ground at the inverting terminal. en RS must be large for a
high input resistance. If RS is large, Rf must be very large to achieve large gain, Rf =Rs. In some
instances, Rf may be prohibitively high.¹³ erefore, in most applications, the input resistance of
the inverting ampliﬁer is low to moderate.
¹³e non-ideal characteristics of OpAmps place constraints on externally connected elements. A discussion of these constraints
is found in Section 1.5 of this chapter.

SUMMING AMPLIFIER
e output voltage of a summing ampliﬁer is an inverted, ampliﬁed sum of the input voltages. A
summing ampliﬁer can theoretically have a large number of input voltages. Figure 1.13 shows a
summing ampliﬁer with three inputs, vi1; vi2, and vi3.

A non-inverting ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 1.15 where the source is represented by vS and a

DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIERS
A diﬀerential ampliﬁer is any two-input ampliﬁer that has an output proportional to the diﬀerence
of the inputs. e deﬁning equation for a diﬀerential ampliﬁer is then:
yo D A .xi1   xi2/ ;
(1.51)
where the output, yo, and the inputs fxig could be either voltages or currents. Previous discus-
sions in this chapter have explored two diﬀerential ampliﬁers: the diﬀerence ampliﬁer (shown in
Figure 1.20) and the basic OpAmp itself. Each of these two examples has an output voltage that
is proportional to the diﬀerence of two input voltages. In the case of the diﬀerence ampliﬁer, the

if the diﬀerence in inputs remains constant, the output should not vary if the average value of the
two inputs changes. Unfortunately, a diﬀerential ampliﬁer rarely meets this goal, and the output
has a slight dependence on the average of the input signals. e output for this type of imperfect

e quality of a diﬀerential ampliﬁer is displayed in its ability to amplify the diﬀerential signal
while suppressing the common signal. A measure of this quality is the ratio of the diﬀerential
gain to the ampliﬁcation of the average (or common) part of the input signals. e measure of

ample, the A741 OpAmp has a typical CMRR of 90 dB with a guaranteed minimum CMRR
of 70 dB.¹⁵
Example 1.6
e diﬀerence ampliﬁer of Figure 1.20 is constructed with an ideal OpAmp and 1% tolerance

e ratio of diﬀerential-mode gain to common-mode gain is about 160: this is only a moderately
good diﬀerential ampliﬁer. A good circuit designer would notice that the resistors in this example
were paired in the worst possible manner. If the physical resistors used for RA and RC were
exchanged, the resistor ratios in each gain path would be more nearly exact: 0:4305  0:4317.

Rearranging the resistors has brought an improvement in the CMRR of almost 18 dB:
the ratio of gains has been improved by a factor of about 7.8. Obviously care must be
taken in the choice and placement of element values to provide the optimum ampliﬁer.
Diﬀerential ampliﬁers are not restricted to circuits with single OpAmps. It is possible to
construct a diﬀerential ampliﬁer without any OpAmps, while many diﬀerential ampliﬁers have
three or more OpAmps as essential elements. Figure 1.21 shows the basic schematic represen-
tation of an instrumentation ampliﬁer using two OpAmps. Instrumentation ampliﬁers are high
performance voltage ampliﬁers that are primarily used for the initial ampliﬁcation of signals from
a variety of types of transducers. ey are available packaged as a single item in a DIP package

or can be realized with discreet components. Packaged instrumentation ampliﬁers usually have
greater control on the factors contributing to CMRR and are often the advantageous choice for
the circuit designer.
e basic topology of this particular instrumentation ampliﬁer is that of an inverting am-
pliﬁer connected in series with a summing ampliﬁer. e extra resistors at the positive terminals
of each OpAmp, R2 and R0
2, serve no obvious function if the OpAmps are considered to be ideal:
their function is to reduce the eﬀects of input parameter variations which are non-ideal properties
of OpAmps.¹⁶ e inversion of vi1 prior to summation allows for the output of the ampliﬁer to
be a multiple of the diﬀerence of the two inputs. is particular circuit topology also allows, with
appropriate external resistor choices, for large (on the order of 100 V) input voltages.

Figure 1.21: An instrumentation ampliﬁer with high input voltage capability.
Analysis of this ampliﬁer begins, as usual, with the assumption that each OpAmp is near-
ideal: the input are virtually-shorted, the gain is inﬁnite, the input resistance is inﬁnite, and the
output resistance is zero. Since no current ﬂows into the inputs of either OpAmp, there is no
voltage drop across the resistors, R2 and R0
2. e OpAmp positive input terminals are therefore
at ground potential: each OpAmp circuit acts in the same manner as if its positive terminal were
directly connected to ground. e zero output resistance of the ﬁrst OpAmp implies that the

NON-IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OPAMPS
In this section the most signiﬁcant limitations of the non-ideal Operational Ampliﬁer are dis-
cussed. A fundamental understanding of these non-ideal properties allows the electronics designer
to choose circuit topologies and parameter values so that the performance of real, practical cir-
cuitry closely approximates the ideal case. e concept of an ideal OpAmp has allowed the use
of simpliﬁed circuit analysis techniques to determine the performance of OpAmp circuits and
concentration on the design philosophy behind the various OpAmp circuit topologies. e ideal
OpAmp was deﬁned with the following properties:
• Inﬁnite Voltage Gain
• Inﬁnite Input Resistance
• Zero Output Resistance
• Output Independent of Power Source Characteristics
• Properties Independent of Input Frequency
A number of non-ideal characteristics have been considered brieﬂy in prior sections of this chap-
ter:
• Output Saturation
• Finite Input Resistance
• Finite Voltage Gain
• Non-zero Output Resistance
ese characteristics will be further discussed along with the following additional non-ideal char-
acteristics:
• Input Parameter Variations
• Output Parameter Limitations
• Supply and Package Related Parameters

34
1. OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS AND APPLICATIONS
In addition, the performance of an OpAmp is dependent on the frequency of the input signals.
In many low-frequency applications this frequency dependence is not signiﬁcant: OpAmps are
commonly used in the audio frequency range and beyond without signiﬁcant distortion. A dis-
cussion of frequency dependent behavior and its close relative, slew rate, is beyond the scope of
this section: a discussion of the frequency dependence of OpAmp circuit performance can be
found in Section 9.9 (Book 3).
1.5.1
FINITE GAIN, FINITE INPUT RESISTANCE AND NON-ZERO
OUTPUT RESISTANCE
e properties of ﬁnite gain, ﬁnite input resistance and non-zero output resistance were observed
in previous discussions concerning using an OpAmp to create a unity gain buﬀer in Section 1.2.
e eﬀect of these non-ideal properties was approached through a simple equivalent model of
the OpAmp as shown in Figure 1.7: that approach will be continued here. While the eﬀects due
to these properties may vary slightly with OpAmp application, a demonstration of their typical
eﬀects on circuit performance will be illustrated using the basic inverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration.
An inverting ampliﬁer can be constructed using an OpAmp as shown in Figure 1.22. While
the power supply, ˙VCC, is not shown in this ﬁgure, its presence is assumed.

Consideration of the non-ideal characteristics of an OpAmp has added complexity to the gain
function and increases the magnitude of the denominator of the expression: the overall gain is
reduced. Good circuit design practices imply that near-ideal performance is the desired goal. With
appropriate external element choices, the gain function can approach the ideal. A ﬁrst obvious
design choice to decrease the size of the additional term in the denominator of Equation (1.68)

36

is to make the parallel combination of Rl and Rf large with respect to the output impedance of
the OpAmp, Ro. is choice of resistors is equivalent to making Go  .Gl C Gf /, which allows

Rf < 1 C A :

Calculation of the output resistance of an inverting ampliﬁer using a non-ideal OpAmp
is accomplished using évenin techniques. e input source is set to zero, the load is removed
(output resistance calculations rarely include the load), and the output is driven by a voltage source
as shown in Figure 1.25. e ratio of the driving voltage, vt, to the driving current, it, gives the

e external resistor simpliﬁcation parameters the use of Equation (1.85) have been met, there-
fore,
Rout  0:00214 :
e idealized value of Rout D 0 seems justiﬁed for practical circuitry given appropriate choices of
external components.
It has been shown that ﬁnite input impedance, ﬁnite gain, and non-zero output resistance
do have an eﬀect on the performance of an inverting ampliﬁer. Still, it is possible to have near-
ideal performance if appropriate choices on the external circuitry are imposed. A reasonable set
of restrictions on the external components has been shown to be:
• R==Rf  Ro
• Rf < .1 C A/ 
If resistances connected to the inputs and output of an OpAmp circuit obey these general
restrictions, the OpAmp circuit performance will be near-ideal. Any non-ideal variations can be
detected with a computer simulation: good circuit design practice always includes simulation.
1.5.2
INPUT PARAMETER VARIATIONS
When an ideal OpAmp has zero output, one expects that the input will have the following prop-
erties:
• the voltage diﬀerence at the input will be zero, and
• each input current will be zero.
Real OpAmps have input voltage diﬀerences and currents that vary from the ideal. ese diﬀer-
ences are described by the quantities Input Oﬀset Voltage, Input Bias Current, and Input Oﬀset
Current.
Input Oﬀset Voltage
e input oﬀset voltage, VOS, is deﬁned as the diﬀerence in voltage between the OpAmp input
terminals when the output voltage is zero.¹⁸ is voltage diﬀerence is due to slightly diﬀerent
properties of the input circuitry at each of the input terminals.
For typical OpAmps the oﬀset voltage is a few millivolts or less, and can often be nulled
with an external three-terminal potentiometer connected between the oﬀset null terminals of the
OpAmp with the middle terminal of the potentiometer connected either to ground or one of
the supply voltage terminals (the connections vary with OpAmp type and manufacturer). If the
¹⁸An alternate (but entirely equivalent) deﬁnition is: VOS is the diﬀerential input voltage which must be applied to drive the
output voltage to zero.

1.5. NON-IDEAL CHARACTERISTICS OF OPAMPS
41
oﬀset voltage is not nulled, it appears as an additional input voltage in series with the true inputs
to the OpAmp (See Figure 1.26). e input oﬀset voltage is also a function of temperature: the
nulling circuitry may need to be adjusted as OpAmp temperature varies. e oﬀset voltage and
its variation with temperature place a lower limit on the magnitude of DC voltages that can act
as inputs to an OpAmp without erroneous circuit operation.

current, ﬁnite input and non-zero output resistance, and ﬁnite voltage gain.
Input Bias and Oﬀset Current
e input circuitry of an OpAmp also draws a small amount of current: this non-zero input current
is in variation to the ideal OpAmp assumptions. Input bias current is deﬁned as the average of
the two input currents when the output of the OpAmp is zero volts:
Ibias D Iin1 C Iin2
2
:
(1.86)
e magnitudes of the input bias current of an OpAmp lies in the range of a few picoamperes to
tens of nanoamperes depending on the type of input circuitry. Bipolar Junction Transistor input
stages tend to have larger bias currents while Field Eﬀect Transistor input stages have smaller bias
currents. In many applications the eﬀect of a balanced bias current (both input currents equal)
can be eliminated through the use of external circuit elements. Slightly diﬀerent properties of the
input circuitry at each of the input terminals, particularly due to random manufacturing variations,
create a more serious problem. Input oﬀset current is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the input

1. OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS AND APPLICATIONS
currents:
IOS D Iin1   Iin2:
(1.87)
Typical variation of input circuitry bias current is approximately 5% of the mean value. is means
that the mismatch in the two currents is random (among OpAmps) and cannot be compensated
by a ﬁxed external resistor.
An equivalent circuit diagram of an OpAmp including input oﬀset voltage and current,
input bias current, ﬁnite input and non-zero output resistance, and ﬁnite voltage gain is shown in
Figure 1.26. e eﬀects of ﬁnite input and non-zero output resistance and ﬁnite voltage gain have
been discussed at length: the eﬀects of Input bias current, input oﬀset current, and input oﬀset
voltage can be analyzed in a similar fashion. It should be noted that manufacturer speciﬁcations
on these parameters denote the maximum magnitude of the parameter—the parameter can be
either positive or negative for a particular OpAmp.
1.5.3
OUTPUT PARAMETER LIMITATIONS
e maximum output voltage swing was described in Section 1.2 as “slightly shy of ˙VCC due to
device characteristics within the OpAmp.” Manufacturers guarantee the minimum value of this
parameter using a graph of output voltage swing as a function of supply voltage for a speciﬁed
load resistance (often 2 k or 10 k/. Variation in the load resistance will also alter the maximum
output voltage swing: manufacturers often provide a graph of this variation as well.
e maximum output current is often speciﬁed through a graph. For protection purposes,
many OpAmps have a current-limiting circuit in the output stage that will limit the maximum
output current to a speciﬁed value. A A741 OpAmp (which has a current-limiting output stage)
can source, or sink, approximately 25 mA.
1.5.4
PACKAGE AND SUPPLY RELATED PARAMETERS
ere are several other limitations on the operation of OpAmps that relate to the manufacturer’s
package and the power supply to which the OpAmp is connected. e limitations can be found
in OpAmp data sheets. e primary limitations are:
• Power Dissipation
• Operating Temperature Range
• Supply Voltage Range
• Supply Current
• Power Supply Rejection Ratio
All OpAmps have a limitation on the maximum amount of power that can be dissipated safely
on a continuous basis. Power dissipation is package dependent with ceramic packages having the

1.6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
43
highest rating. Metal and plastic packages have lower ratings with plastic the lowest. Typical
values are in the 100–500 mW range.
OpAmps are guaranteed to operate within speciﬁcations provided the temperature of the
package is within the operating temperature range speciﬁcation. Commercial grade devices have
a temperature range of 0ıC to C70ı C, the range for industrial grade devices is  25ıC to C85ıC,
and military grade devices operate from  55ıC to C125ıC.
e supply voltages VCC have maximum and minimum values for proper operation of the
OpAmp. Typical maxima are in the range of ˙18 V to ˙22 V, but specialized units may operate at
much higher levels. Minima are typically about ˙5 V but may range as low as ˙2 V. As has been
mentioned before, the output voltage swing must lie within the rails set by the supply voltage.
Specialized OpAmps can operate with a one-sided supply: typically the negative power supply
terminal is grounded and the other power supply terminal is connected to CVCC.
e supply current is deﬁned as the current that an OpAmp draws from the power supply
when the OpAmp output is zero. is is a particularly important parameter in battery-operated
applications.
Variations in the supply voltage, ˙VCC, can feed through to the output—typically through
oﬀset voltage variation. e ratio of the change in oﬀset voltage to the change in power supply
voltage is deﬁned as the power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR):
PSRR D VOS
VCC
PSRR can be expressed in V/V or in decibels, where
PSRRjdB D 20 log VOS
VCC
:
If OpAmps are used with a high-performance voltage regulator, the error due to PSRR can
essentially be eliminated in OpAmp applications.
While the list of non-ideal OpAmp properties may seem large, each property contributes
but a small error that, with careful choices of circuit topology and circuit element value, can be
nearly eliminated. ere is insuﬃcient space in a text of this nature to investigate all eﬀects in all
possible circuits. While the demonstrations have been kept to a minimum, it is hoped that the
reader has developed a “feel” for the most important eﬀects and a sense of how to compensate for
them. e good circuit Designer should keep all of these second-order eﬀects in mind and act
appropriately.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e Operational Ampliﬁer has been described in this chapter as a highly useful device with near-
ideal terminal characteristics, summarized in Table 1.2. Many of common OpAmp applications
can be described using only these characteristics and simple circuit analysis techniques.

In well-designed OpAmp applications, the properties of the application depend most
strongly on the circuit elements external to the OpAmp rather than on the OpAmp itself. In
order to preserve this primary dependence on the external circuit elements, certain design restric-
tions have been presented. In general, these restrictions relate to the resistance values connected
to the terminals of the OpAmp:
• Resistors connected to the output should be large with respect to the output impedance,
and
• resistors connected to the input should be less than .1 C A/  .
Additional design restrictions concerning frequency response will be discussed in 9 (Book 3).
While a variety of linear applications have been examined in this chapter, the possibilities
for circuitry using OpAmps extend far beyond what has been shown here. Additional OpAmp
linear applications and many non-linear applications will be examined in later chapters. Later
chapters will also investigate components used in the internal design of several OpAmp types
and will shed light on non-ideal characteristics and the limitations these characteristics impose
on OpAmp usage.
SUMMARY DESIGN EXAMPLE
In order to investigate the low-frequency volt-ampere (V-I) relationship of a two-terminal elec-
tronic device, it is often desirable to display the V-I relationship on the screen of an oscilloscope.
A typical experimental circuit diagram for such a display is shown below: it consists of the series
connection of a low-frequency function generator, a resistor, and the device under test (DUT).

1.6. CONCLUDING REMARKS
45
e voltage across the DUT is given by VB and will serve as one of the inputs to the oscilloscope.
e other input to the oscilloscope is the loop current. e most economical method for measuring
this current is given by (current probes are quite expensive):
I D
VAB
R :
e location of the ground node in this circuit presents a problem. Safety regulations require
that one terminal of the output of most function generators be at ground potential: similarly, one
terminal of the input to most oscilloscopes is at ground potential. ese ground connections do
not pose a problem in measuring the voltage, VB, but measuring the voltage, VAB, is diﬃcult. e
diﬀerential input mode to most oscilloscopes can solve this diﬃculty in measurement, but this
mode cannot usually be invoked simultaneously with the required x-y display mode.
e obvious solution to the measurement problem is an external diﬀerential ampliﬁer with
inputs at nodes A and B and an output to one of the oscilloscope channels. Design such a diﬀer-
ential ampliﬁer.
Solution:
A list of speciﬁcations is necessary for good design. e connection of the diﬀerential am-
pliﬁer across the resistor, R, must not signiﬁcantly disturb the measurements: It should have very
high input resistance: Rin > 1 M matches the input resistance of most oscilloscopes. Similarly,
the output of the diﬀerential ampliﬁer should have low output resistance so that an accurate mea-
surement can be made, Rout < 100  is adequate. e ampliﬁer diﬀerential gain should be either
unity or ten (10) so that a mix of oscilloscope probes can be utilized. CMRR should be high.
If a low-frequency function generator is used, OpAmps can be used for the realization of
the diﬀerential ampliﬁer. e diﬀerential ampliﬁer of Figure 1.20 can easily be designed to meet
all the speciﬁcations except input resistance. If the resistors are chosen to be suﬃciently large to
meet input resistance requirements, the ideal OpAmp approximations will fail. erefore, it is
necessary connect unity-gain buﬀers in series with each input. e circuit topology (next page) is
therefore chosen.
e input and output resistance of this circuit automatically meets speciﬁcations using all
common, commercial OpAmps. e requirement for two distinct values of the diﬀerential gain
is accomplished with a double-pole, single-throw switch. When both indicated switches (each
is a pole of the actual switch) are open, the diﬀerential gain is unity: when both are closed the
diﬀerential gain is ten. After these topological design decisions, all that remains in the design is
the choice of resistor values.
For unity magnitude gain in the vB path, RA D RB (Equation 1.42). For a gain magnitude
of ten in that path,
RA==Ra D 0:1RB D 0:1RA
)
RA D 9Ra:

Assuming the above results, unity magnitude gain in the vA path implies RC D RD (Equa-
tion 1.43). Similarly, a gain magnitude of ten in that path implies,
RC==Rc D 0:1RD D 0:1RC
)
RC D 9Rc
While many choices will fulﬁll these ratios with adequate accuracy, one reasonable choice is:
RA D RB D RC D RD D 90:9 k
Ra D Rc D 10:1 k:
Both these resistor values are available as 0.5% resistors. Resistors with such small tolerances will
ensure high CMRR.

Diode Characteristics and
Circuits
Simple electronic circuit elements can be divided into two fundamental groups by their terminal
characteristics:
• Linear devices – devices that can be described by linear algebraic equations or linear diﬀer-
ential equations;
• Non-linear devices – those devices that are described by non-linear equations.
Resistors, capacitors, and inductors are examples of passive circuit elements that are basically lin-
ear.¹ Operational ampliﬁers, when functioning within certain operational constraints (as described
in Chapter 1), are linear, active devices.
e diode is the most basic of the non-linear electronic circuit elements. It is a simple
two-terminal device whose name is derived from the vacuum tube technology device with sim-
ilar characteristics: a tube with two electrodes (di - two; ode - path), the anode and the cathode.
Vacuum tube devices have largely been superseded in electronic applications by semiconductor
junction diodes. is chapter will restrict its discussion to semiconductor diodes, diode charac-
teristics, and simple electronic diode applications.
2.1
BASIC FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF AN IDEAL
DIODE
ere are many applications in electronic circuitry for a one-way device: that is, a device that pro-
vides zero resistance to current ﬂowing in one direction, but inﬁnite resistance to current ﬂowing
the opposite direction. Protection against misapplied currents or voltages, converting alternating
current (AC) into direct current (DC), demodulating Amplitude Modulated (AM) radio signals,
and limiting voltages to speciﬁed maxima or minima are but a few of the many possible applica-
tions. While a device with such ideal characteristics may be impossible to manufacture, its study
is still instructive and, in many applications, ideal devices closely approximate real devices and
provide insight into real-device circuit operation.
¹All linear electronic devices can become non-linear if input currents or voltages are allowed to become too large. ermal
eﬀects, dielectric breakdown, magnetic saturation, and other physical phenomena can cause non-linearities in device transfer
characteristics. Still, devices that are categorized as linear have a region of operation, usually speciﬁed by the manufacturer, in
which the transfer characteristics are extremely linear.

An ideal diode is a true one-way electronic device. Its volt-ampere (V-I) transfer relation-
ship is shown in Figure 2.1.² e two terminals of such a diode retain the names ﬁrst used in the

A - the anode (Greek, ana up C hodos way)
K - the cathode (Greek, kata down C hodos way).

Figure 2.1: e Volt-ampere transfer relationship for an ideal diode.
It is important to notice that the deﬁnition of the sign convention of Figure 2.1 is extremely
important. For many devices that are linear (for example, a resistor), reversing the polarity of both
the voltage and current yields the same V-I relationship (Ohm’s Law) as long as the passive sign
convention³ is followed. Reversing the polarity of the voltage and current (still keeping the passive
sign convention) can yield, in general, a drastically diﬀerent V-I relationship for a non-linear
devices: thus the sign convention takes special signiﬁcance.
e functional relationships of Equation (2.1) are a piece-wise linearization of the V-I
transfer relationship for an ideal diode and lead to two piece-wise linear models that are often
used to replace a diode for analysis purposes:
A ——— K
I  0
A –
– K
V < 0
e two linear models are:
²Ideal diodes will symbolically be shown using the symbol in Figure 2.1: the triangle portion of the symbol will be empty. Real
diodes will be shown with a triangle that is ﬁlled as seen in Figure 2.4.
³e passive sign convention allows consistent equations to be written to characterize electronic devices. In two terminal devices,
it simply states that, when describing the device, positive reference current enters the positive voltage reference node and exits
the negative voltage node.

• a short circuit when the applied current is positive, and
• an open circuit when the applied voltage is negative.
While at ﬁrst it is not always obvious which model will accurately predict the state of a
diode in an electronic circuit, analysis using one model will produce results consistent with model
assumptions: the other model will produce a result that contradicts the assumptions upon which
that model is based.

Solution:
a) VS D 1
Choosing the short circuit model to replace the diode, the current, I, is found to be:
I D 1=100 D 10 mA
If the open circuit model is used to replace the diode, the current is found to be:
I D 1=.100 C 1/ D 0 mA
In the ﬁrst case (the short circuit) the diode current (here, the same as I) is within the restrictions
of the model assumptions (I  0) and there is no contradiction to that model’s assumptions. In
the second case the diode voltage violates the second model assumptions (V D 1 violates the
model assumption, V < 0). us, the diode appears to act as a short circuit and the true value of
the current given by:
I D 10 mA:
b) If the diode is replaced by its short-circuit model, the current is calculated to be:
I D  1=100 D  10 mA

Here the voltage across the diode is  1 V which fulﬁlls the deﬁning assumption for the
model. Consequently, the diode current is zero valued.
While the studying the action of an ideal diode often provides useful insight into the op-
eration of many electronic circuits, real diodes have a more complex V-I relationship. e funda-
mental operation of a real semiconductor diode in its conducting and the non-conducting regions
is discussed in Section 2.2. When large reverse voltages are applied to a real diode (in what should
be the far extremes of non-conducting region) the diode will enter a region of reverse conduction
(the Zener region) due to one or more of several mechanisms. is sometimes useful - sometimes
destructive region of reverse conduction is discussed in Section 2.7.
2.2
SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE VOLT-AMPERE
RELATIONSHIP
Semiconductor Diodes are formed with the creation of a p-n junction. is junction is a transi-
tion region between a semiconductor region that has been injected (doped) with acceptor atoms
(a p-region) and one that has been injected with donor atoms (an n-region).⁴ e p-region be-
comes the anode and the n-region becomes the cathode of a semiconductor diode. Semiconductor
diodes are real diodes and have volt-ampere relationships that are in many ways similar to the V-I
relationship for an ideal diode. ere are, however, distinct diﬀerences:
• In the non-conducting region (when the p-n junction is reverse biased) the diode current is
not exactly zero: the diode exhibits a small reverse leakage current.
• e diode requires a small positive voltage to be applied before it enters the conducting
region (when the p-n junction is forward biased). When in the conducting region the diode
has a non-zero dynamic resistance.
• For large input voltages and/or currents the diode enters breakdown regions. In the for-
ward direction, power dissipation restrictions leads to thermal destruction of the diode. In
the reverse direction, the diode will ﬁrst enter a Zener region of conduction then thermal
destruction.
e similarities between the semiconductor diode and the ideal diode allow the semicon-
ductor diode to be used for the applications mentioned in Section 2.1. e diﬀerences mean
circuit designers and engineers must be careful to avoid an oversimpliﬁcation of the analysis of
diode circuitry. Other diﬀerences allow for a few applications not possible with an ideal diode.
⁴Discussions of the atomic semiconductor physics that lead to a p-n junction forming a diode are not within the scope of this
electronics text. e authors suggest several texts in semiconductor physics and electronic engineering materials at the end of
this chapter for those readers interested in these aspects of physical electronics.

Vt D voltage equivalent temperature of the diode
D kT=q  T=11600  26 mV @ room temperature. 300 ıK/
It is diﬃcult to describe the non-linear behavior of this mathematical expression for the diode V-I
relationship throughout the entire range of possible values, however discussion of the behavior in
its two extremes is useful. In the strongly reverse-biased region, i.e., when
V   Vt;
the exponential term of Equation (2.2) is much smaller than unity and the diode current is very
nearly constant with the value:
I   IS:
e non-zero value of the current implies that a reverse leakage current of value IS is present for
the diode when it is in its non-conducting region. is leakage is very small: typically in the range
of a few hundredths of a nanoampere to several nanoamperes.
When the diode is in its strongly forward biased region, V  Vt, the current experiences
an exponential growth and the diode appears to have near-zero dynamic resistance. Dynamic re-
sistance is deﬁned as the incremental change in voltage with respect to an incremental change in
current. For the diode the dynamic resistance is given by:

ese dynamic resistance values are, asymptotically, the values for forward and reverse resistance
of an ideal diode. us, the behavior of a real diode is similar to that of an ideal diode.
A plot of the V-I relationship for a typical diode with IS D 1 nA and  D 1 & 2 at a
temperature of 300ıK appears in Figure 2.2. Notice that the basic shape of this relationship is
similar to that of the ideal diode with the following exceptions:
• In the reverse-biased region, the current is not exactly zero, it is instead a small leakage
value, IS.
• e forward-biased region exhibits real, non-zero resistance. e vertical portion of the
curve is displaced to the right. ere appears to be a voltage at which the diode begins to
conduct. is voltage is often called a threshold voltage which for silicon diodes lies in the
range of 0.6 V to 0.9 V. reshold voltage will be more thoroughly discussed in Section 2.5.

through basic principles of semiconductor physics that IS is strongly temperature dependent. In

dissipating 0.38 W while the cool diode dissipates only 0.059 W in the same circumstances. Heat-
ing leads to increased power dissipation which, in turn, leads to heating: this cyclic process can
lead to thermal run-away and eventual destruction of the diode.
2.3
THE DIODE AS A CIRCUIT ELEMENT
Due to the non-linear nature of the V-I relationship for a semiconductor diode, analysis tech-
niques for circuits containing diodes are complex. is section deals with exact analytical solu-
tions and lays the foundation for the graphical techniques of Section 2.4. Simpliﬁed piece-wise
linear modeling techniques that allow for the use of linear analysis techniques are discussed in
Section 2.5.
One of the simplest circuits involving a diode is shown in Figure 2.4. is circuit consists of
an independent voltage source, a resistor, and a diode in series. Simple évenin extensions of this
circuit show that the discussion presented here can be extended to any linear circuit connected in
series with a single diode.

NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS
A simple closed-form solution for Equation (2.7) does not exist. e best technique for solu-
tion is usually a structured numerical search. Structured searches can be easily performed using
mathematical software packages such as Mathcad, Matlab or similar programs. Another common
technique uses programmable calculators with a built-in numerical equation solver (root-ﬁnder).

SIMULATION SOLUTIONS
In addition to mathematical equation solving computer programs, there exists a variety of elec-
tronic circuit simulators that perform similar solutions more eﬃciently. Most common among
these simulators is SPICE⁵ and its many derivatives. ese simulation programs easily solve the
type of problem described in Example 2.3 and with little eﬀort can provide solutions to more
complex problems. A simple extension to Example 2.3 with a time-varying voltage source is de-
scribed below.

developed by National Instruments.

LOAD LINES
While numerical techniques are often quite useful to solve electronic circuit problems, they require
the use of calculators or computers and in many circumstances provide no insight into the oper-
ation of the circuit. It is also necessary to know the parameters of the non-linear circuit elements
with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Diode V-I curves are often obtained through experimental
procedures and only then are the parameters derived from the experimental data. A more di-
rect approach to working with non-linear elements that has traditionally been taken is the use of
graphical techniques. e process of constructing solutions through these graphical techniques
often provides useful insight into the operation of the circuit.
2.4.1
GRAPHICAL SOLUTIONS TO STATIC CIRCUITS
Graphical Solutions to the simple diode circuit of Figure 2.4 involve the use of the graphical
representation of the diode V-I relationship. e graph of the V-I relationship can be obtained
from Equation (2.6) or determined experimentally. e other elements in the circuit are then
combined to create another relationship between the diode current and voltage. In the simple
case of a DC évenin equivalent source driving a single diode, this additional relationship can
be easily obtained by rewriting Equation (2.5) to become:
Vd D V   I R:
(2.8)
Equation (2.8) is called a load line and gives its name to this type of graphical analysis: load
line analysis. Notice that a plot of the load line crosses the horizontal (Vd) axis at the value of
the évenin voltage source and the vertical (I) axis at Vd=R. e slope of the load line is the
negative of the inverse of the évenin resistance . 1=R/.
e two relationships involving the diode current and voltage (the diode V-I relationship
and the load line) can now be plotted on the same set of axes. e intersection of the two curves
yields the value of the diode current and voltage for the particular values of the évenin source.

74
2. DIODE CHARACTERISTICS AND CIRCUITS
For circuits involving static (DC) sources the intersection set of values is called the quiescent point
or Q-point of the circuit. Figure 2.5 demonstrates the load line technique applied to the circuit of
Figure 2.4 using the diode V-I relationship using diode and circuit parameters of Example 2.3.
e Q-point for this example appears to be:
Vd  0:76 V
I  0:0042 A
which compares nicely with the analytic solution previously obtained.
Figure 2.5: Load-line analysis applied to Example 2.3.
If the évenin source voltage, V , is changed, a new load line must be plotted. is new
load line will have the same slope ( 1=R) and intersects the Vd axis at the new value of the
évenin voltage. e diode current and voltage, a new Q-point, can be obtained by ﬁnding the
intersection of this new load line and the diode V-I characteristic.
2.4.2
GRAPHICAL SOLUTIONS TO CIRCUITS WITH TIME VARYING
SOURCES
e load line technique outlined above can be expanded to provide solutions to circuits with time
varying sources. Here the évenin equivalent voltage source will be time varying. Graphical load
line analysis is performed as above for several instants of time {ti}. At each instant of time the
évenin voltage {vi} is known, a load line can be plotted and values for the diode voltage and/or

the diode voltage axis and the time axis parallel to the diode current axis. e time varying voltage
is sampled and a load line is created for each sample value. e Q-point for each of these lines is
determined and a plot of current as a function of time is created. e graphical representation of
these steps is shown in Figure 2.6.

same load line principles can be applied to other non-linear devices and circuits.

SIMPLIFIED PIECEWISE LINEAR MODELS OF THE
DIODE
e previous sections of this chapter have treated a diode as either an extremely simple device
(the ideal diode) or as a complex non-linear device represented by non-linear equations or curves.
While each of these treatments has its place in the analysis of electronic circuits, it is often useful to

76
2. DIODE CHARACTERISTICS AND CIRCUITS

ﬁnd a technique in the middle ground between these two extremes. One such technique involves
the regional linearization of circuit element V-I characteristics.
When this technique is applied to a diode there are two basic regions.
• the region when the diode is basically conducting (Forward Bias)
• the region when the diode is basically non-conducting (Reverse Bias)
In Example 2.1 the ground work for the two-region linearization was laid with the bound-
ary between the two regions being at the origin of the ideal diode V-I transfer relationship. With
real diodes the transition between the two regions lies at a positive diode voltage, hereafter called
the threshold voltage, V.
2.5.1
FORWARD BIAS MODELING
In the region where the diode is conducting, a good linear model of the diode is a straight line
tangent to the diode V-I relationship at a Q-point. e slope of this line is the dynamic resistance

e linear forward-bias model of the diode therefore has a V-I relationship:

as is shown in Figure 2.7.
e linear model of a forward-biased diode can simply be modeled with linear circuit ele-
ments as a voltage source (typically shown as a battery) in series with a resistor. e voltage source
takes the value V and the resistor becomes rd. e approximate model is shown in Figure 2.8.
Care should be taken as to the polarity of the voltage source: forward biased diodes experience a
voltage drop as is shown in the ﬁgure.
While this technique gives an accurate approximation of the diode V-I characteristic about
a Q-point, it is not always clear what Q-point should be chosen. In practice, one usually chooses
a Q-point by:
• using an ideal diode model to get an approximate Q-point for static cases, or
• choosing a Q-point that approximately bisects the expected range of diode currents within
the application of interest.

create an error in the calculation of solutions, but allow for the use of simple linear algebraic

(a) Calculate the diode current with an approximate diode model.
(b) Calculate the diode current and voltage using the model derived in Example 2.6.
Solution:
(a) Using an ideal model for the diode, one would expect the diode current to be somewhat less

choose V D 0:74 V. Again, since these curves exist, Figure 2.10 implies a diode resistance,

When accuracy of the order seen in Example 2.7 is not necessary, a diode can be represented
as simply a voltage drop of approximately V. is model assumes that the small series resistance
is assumed to be negligible with respect to the circuit évenin resistance as seen by the diode, and
forms an intermediate linear model between the ideal diode model and the two-element linear
model. Use of this model leads to inaccuracies much larger than seen in previous linear models.
It does, however, simplify circuit analysis greatly.

REVERSE BIAS MODELING
In the region where the diode is basically not conducting there are several possible linear models
from which to choose. Each of these is based on the principle that the diode has a small leakage
current that is fairly constant in the reverse bias region: that is when the diode voltage is between
a few negative multiples of Vt and the Zener breakdown voltage⁶ the diode current is constant at
 IS. e two common models are: a current source of value  IS; or a large resistor. ese models
are shown in Figure 2.12.

e value of the reverse resistance, rr, for the second model can be approximated using
one of two techniques: (a) using Equation (2.9) to determine the dynamic resistance about some
Q-point, or (b) assuming that the diode achieves its true reverse saturation current at the Zener
breakdown voltage. While method (a) allows for an exact dynamic resistance at some point, it
is often diﬃcult to choose the proper Qpoint for a particular application. Method (b) is easier
to calculate, but is less accurate at any point and underestimates the dynamic resistance for large
reverse voltages.

connected in series with a 4 V source and a resistance of 820  so that the diode is reverse biased.
Calculate the diode current and voltage using:
(a) the current source model for a reverse biased diode
(b) the resistor model for a reverse biased diode
⁶When a large negative voltage is applied to a semiconductor diode (i.e., a voltage that exceeds some reverse threshold voltage
called the Zener voltage), the diode enters a region of reverse conduction. e Zener conduction region of semiconductor
diodes is discussed thoroughly in Section 2.7.

Comments: Each solution yields diode voltage solutions that are extremely close - essentially all
the source voltage appears across the reverse biased diode. e current values vary by more than
a factor of 6, but it must be remembered that these are extremely small values that are diﬃcult to
verify experimentally. Qualitatively, the two solutions are the same.
Numerical solutions of the type outlined in Example 2.3 suﬀer from lack of precision capa-
bility and, due to the almost zero slope of the V-I relationship, often cannot converge to a solution.
In this particular problem, MathCAD is unable to eﬀectively ﬁnd solutions if the source voltage
is more negative than about  1 V.

DIODE APPLICATIONS
Typical applications of diodes are considered in this section. e diode circuits studied are:
• Limiter or Clipping Circuit
• Full- and Half-Wave Rectiﬁers
• Peak Detector
• Clamping or DC Restoring Circuit
• Voltage Multiplier

84
2. DIODE CHARACTERISTICS AND CIRCUITS
• Diode Logic Gates
• “Superdiode”
All of the circuits analyzed in this section perform some form of wave shaping operation
on the input signal to yield a desired output. e clipping circuit “truncates” the input to some
desired value beyond which the signal is not to exceed. Full- and half-wave rectiﬁers pass only
the signals of the desired polarity (positive or negative amplitude) and are commonly used in DC
power supply designs. e peak detector follows only the maximum amplitudes of an incoming
signal and is commonly used in amplitude modulation (AM) radio receivers in communications
applications. Clamping circuits perform a level shifting operation on the input waveform, and
are used to measure the duty cycle of a pulse waveform. Clamping circuits are commonly used to
detect information carried on pulse-width modulated signals (i.e., the information of interest is
represented by increasing or decreasing the pulse-width of a pulse waveform) by retrieving the DC
component of the modulated signal. Voltage multipliers perform an integer multiplication on the
input signal to yield a higher output voltage. Diode logic gates are simple circuits for performing
Boolean operations. e “Superdiode” is a combination of an OpAmp and diode which eliminates
the undesirable diode threshold voltage and dynamic resistance characteristics. Diodes in a circuit
can, in most instances, be replaced by Superdiodes to design precision circuits.
2.6.1
LIMITER OR CLIPPING CIRCUIT
Diodes are often used in waveshaping applications. In particular, when used with a DC voltage
in series with the diode, the output signal can be limited to the reference voltage level of the DC
voltage source. Examples of clipping circuits are shown in Figure 2.13.
e simpliﬁed forward bias diode model of Figure 2.11 can be used to analyze clipping
circuits.
e circuit of Figure 2.13a will be used as an example of this analysis. When the input
voltage vi  Vd C Vref, the diode is reverse biased (or OFF).⁷ erefore, the diode can be thought
of as an open circuit. e output voltage in this case follows the input voltage,
vo D vi:
When the voltage vi > Vd C Vref, the diode is forward biased (or ON). Using the piece-wise
linear model of the forward biased diode, a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit of the clipping circuit of
Figure 2.13a is developed in Figure 2.14.
e output voltage vo of the clipping circuit when the diode is forward biased is found by

HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS
One of the most common diode applications is the conversion of power from AC to DC for
use as power supplies. Today’s power supplies involve sophisticated design principles that will be
detailed in Chapter 14 (Book 4) in the fourth book of this series. However, the basic principles
of converting from AC to DC power can be explored in this section.
Figure 2.18 shows a half-wave rectiﬁer circuit. e circuit is so named because it only allows
current from the positive half cycle of the input to ﬂow through the load resistor, R. Figure 2.18
is identical to the clipping circuit of Figure 2.13d with zero reference voltage.
If vi is a sinusoidal voltage with peak voltage Vm and radian frequency !,

Recall that the “eﬀective” or root-mean-squared (RMS) voltage quantiﬁes the amount of energy

e result of Equation (2.20) is for an ideal half-wave rectiﬁer and represents the maximum
eﬃciency attainable. In real systems, the eﬃciency will be lower due to power losses in the resistor
and diode.
In order to produce a DC voltage from a half-wave rectiﬁer, a large capacitor is placed in
parallel to the load resistor. e capacitor must be large enough so that the RC time constant of
the capacitor and load resistor is large compared to the period of the output waveform. is has
the eﬀect of “smoothing” the output waveform. Clearly, and eﬃcient ﬁlter is required to eliminate
any ripple in the output waveform.

2.6. DIODE APPLICATIONS
91
In many rectiﬁer applications, it is desirable to transformer couple the input voltage source
to the rectiﬁer circuit. is method is commonly used in the design of power supplies where there
is a requirement to “step-down” the AC input voltage to a lower DC voltage. For example, a 15 V
peak half-wave rectiﬁed voltage can be derived from a 120 VAC (household power is deﬁned in
RMS volts) source through the use of a transformer. Transformers also provide isolation of the
circuit from the household power line, providing protection from the possibility of shock from
those lines.
e turns ratio Np=Ns (primary winding over the secondary windings) determines the
“step-down” ratio. For example, if the voltage input at the primary is 120 VAC (RMS) which
is approximately 170 V peak, a transformer turns ratio of 11:1 (actually 11.3 : 1) is required to
yield a 15 V peak half-wave rectiﬁed signal. If the coeﬃcient of coupling is nearly 1.0, implying
no loss occurs in the transformer, the inductance ratio of the primary coil Lp and the secondary
coil Ls is,

FULL-WAVE RECTIFIERS
To remove the ripple from the output of a half-wave rectiﬁer may require a very large capacitance.
In many instances, the capacitor required to reduce the ripple on the half-wave rectiﬁed output
voltage to the desired design speciﬁcation may be prohibitively large.
A full-wave rectiﬁer circuit can be used as a more eﬃcient way to reduce ripple on the
output voltage. A center-tapped input transformer-coupled full-wave rectiﬁer is shown in Fig-
ure 2.21. Each half of the transformer with the associated diode acts as a half-wave rectiﬁer. e
diode D1 conducts when the input vi > V and D2 conducts when the input vi < V. Note that
the secondary winding is capable of providing twice the voltage drop across the load resistor.
Additionally, the input to the diodes and the output share a common ground between the load
resistor and the center-tap.
An isolation transformer is not required to design a full-wave rectiﬁer. If ground isolation
is not required, only a center-tapped well coupled coil is required as shown in Figure 2.22.
An alternate conﬁguration for a full-wave rectiﬁer exists with an addition of two diodes. In
the alternate conﬁguration, called the bridge rectiﬁer shown in Figure 2.23, the source and load
do not share an essential common terminal. Additionally, the secondary transformer does not

Figure 2.21.
In the bridge rectiﬁer circuit, diodes D2 and D4 are ON for the positive half cycle of the
voltage across the secondary of the transformer. Diodes D1 and D3 are oﬀin the positive half
cycle since their anode voltages are less than the cathode voltages. is is due to the voltage drop
across the ON diodes and the load resistor. In the negative half cycle of the voltage across the
secondary of the transformer, diodes D1 and D3 are ON, with D2 and D4 OFF. In both half
cycles, the current through the load resistor is in the same direction. erefore, each half cycle,
the output voltage appears in the same polarity.
From Equation (2.13), the output DC voltage of a full-wave rectiﬁer circuit is twice that

time constant is approximately the same as the period of the carrier so that the output voltage can
follow the variation in amplitude of the input.

Diode circuits may be used as voltage doublers as shown in Figure 2.29. e circuit is a clamper

clamping section yields the waveforms shown in Figure 2.30. e positive voltage is clamped to
zero volts. Across diode D1, the negative peak reaches  Vm due to the charge stored in capacitor
C1. e voltage stored in C1 is VC1 D Vm corresponding to the maximum negative input voltage.

2.7
ZENER DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
Diodes that at designed with adequate power dissipation capabilities to operate in breakdown are
called Zener diodes and are commonly used as voltage reference or constant voltage devices.
e two mechanisms responsible for the breakdown characteristics of a diode are avalanche
breakdown and Zener breakdown. Avalanche breakdown occurs at high voltages ( 10 V) where
the charge carriers acquire enough energy to create secondary hole-electron pairs which act as
secondary carriers. is chain reaction causes and avalanche breakdown of the diode junction
and a rapid increase in current at the breakdown voltage. Zener breakdown occurs in the heavily
doped p- and n-regions on both sides of the diode junction and occurs when the externally applied
potential is large enough to create a large electric ﬁeld across the junction to force bound electrons
from the p-type material to tunnel across to the n-type region. A sudden increase in current is
observed when suﬃcient external potential is applied to produce the required ionization energy
for tunneling.
Regardless of the mechanism for breakdown, the breakdown diodes are usually called Zener
diodes. e symbol and characteristic curve of a low voltage (referring to the breakdown voltage)
Zener diode are shown in Figure 2.33. e forward bias characteristic is similar to conventional
p-n junction diodes. e reverse bias region depicts the breakdown occurring at VZ which is
nearly independent of diode current. A wide range of Zener diodes are commercially available
over a wide range of breakdown voltages and power ratings to 100 W.

Changes in temperature generally cause a shift in the breakdown voltage. e tempera-
ture coeﬃcient is approximately C2 mV=ıC for Zener breakdown. For avalanche breakdown,
the temperature coeﬃcient is negative.
e simpliﬁed SPICE model of a Zener diode is identical to that of the conventional diode
with the addition of the reverse breakdown “knee” voltage BV and the corresponding reverse
breakdown “knee” current IBV . e relationship between BV and IBV is shown in the reverse-
bias portion of the Zener diode characteristic curve of the Zener diode in Figure 2.34. To obtain
a steeper reverse breakdown characteristic, a higher breakdown current IBV may, in general, be
used without incurring signiﬁcant errors. e Zener diode model statement for Figure 2.34 uses
BV D 5 and IBV D 10 m for a Zener voltage of 5 V at 10 mA. Both BV and IBV are positive
quantities. If IBV is large, the reverse breakdown curve is steeper.
e dynamic resistance of the Zener diode in the reverse breakdown region, rZ , is the
slope of the diode curve at the operating reverse bias current. Since the reverse current increases
rapidly with small changes in the diode voltage drop, rZ is small (typically 1 to 15 ). e Zener
diode piece-wise linear model and its simpliﬁed version are shown in Figure 2.35.

Another typical application of Zener diodes occurs in AC-DC conversion. Recall that the
output of a ﬁltered rectiﬁer has residual voltage ripple. By adding a Zener diode voltage reference
circuit at the output of a rectiﬁer and ﬁlter circuit, as shown in Figure 2.38, the residual voltage
ripple at the output can be eliminated. e resistors R1 and RL must be carefully selected to yield
the desired voltage output. If R1 is chosen to be much less than RL, and if the voltage across the
capacitor is greater than VZ, then the output voltage will be clamped at VZ.

A design trade-oﬀexists between using a large capacitor ﬁlter to remove the output voltage
ripple or a smaller capacitor and a Zener diode clamp. Large capacitors require large “real-estate”
or space on a printed circuit board and height above the circuit board. However, capacitor ﬁlters
only dissipate energy when in the charging or discharging cycles.
Although the Zener diode is small in size and requires substantially less circuit volume than
large capacitors, the diode must be able to dissipate from zero to the maximum current delivered
to the load. If the Zener diode is to carry large currents over much of the operating cycle, the
power dissipation is high and a large capacitor ﬁlter may be preferred. e Zener diode may be
preferred if the power dissipation in the diode can be limited.

OTHER COMMON DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
In the previous sections of this chapter, the conventional p-n junction diode and the Zener diode
and their applications were introduced. Although the conventional p-n junction diode and the
Zener diode are the most common diode types used in electronic design, other types of diodes
are designed into certain electronic applications. Some of the diﬀerent types of diode include the
tunnel diode, backward diode, Schottky barrier diode, Varactor Diode, p-i-n diode, IMPATT
diode, TRAPATT diode, BARRITT diode, solar cell, photodiode, light-emitting diode, and
semiconductor laser diode.
Unfortunately, it is far beyond the scope of this book to discuss all of the diﬀerent types
listed above. However, four common types of diodes from the above list are presented in this
section for discussion. ey are the
• Tunnel diode
• Schottky barrier diode
• Photodiode
• Light-Emitting Diode

TUNNEL DIODE
e tunnel diode (also called the Esaki diode after the L. Esaki who announced the new diode
in 1958) voltage-current characteristic is shown in Figure 2.39. e ﬁgure shows that the tunnel
diode is an excellent conductor in the reverse direction. Figure 2.40 is the circuit symbol for the

curve is zero. As the voltage increases beyond VP , the current also decreases. e tunnel diode
characteristic curve in this region exhibits a negative dynamic resistance between the peak current
IP and the minimum or valley current IP . At the valley voltage, VV , corresponding to the valley
current IV , the slope of the characteristic curve is again zero. Beyond VV , the curve remains
positive. At the peak forward voltage, VF , the current again reaches the value of IP .
Since it is diﬃcult to manufacture silicon tunnel diodes with a high ratio of peak-to-valley
current IP =IV , most commercially available tunnel diodes are made from germanium (Ge) or
gallium arsenide (GaAs). Table 2.2 is a summary of some of the static characteristics of these
devices.
e operating characteristics of the tunnel diode are highly dependent on the load line
of the circuit in which the diode is operating. Some load lines may intersect the tunnel diode
characteristic curve in three places: the region between 0 and VP , between VP and VV , and beyond
VV . is multi-valued feature makes the tunnel diode useful in high speed pulse circuit design.
High frequency (microwave) oscillators are often designed so that the tunnel diode is biased in
its negative dynamic resistance region.

2.8.2
SCHOTTKY BARRIER DIODE
e Schottky barrier diode (or simply Schottky diode) is a metal-semiconductor diode. e circuit
symbol of the Schottky diode is shown in Figure 2.41. Metal-semiconductor diodes are formed
by bonding a metal (usually aluminum or platinum) to n- or p-type silicon. Metal-semiconductor
diode voltage-current characteristics are very similar to conventional p-n junction diodes and can
be described by the diode equation with the exception that the threshold voltage V is in the range
from 0.3 V to 0.6 V. e physical mechanisms of operation of the conventional p-n junction diode
and the metal-semiconductor diode are not the same.

2.8. OTHER COMMON DIODES AND APPLICATIONS
111
Figure 2.41: Schottky diode symbol.
e primary diﬀerence between metal-semiconductor and p-n junction diodes is in the
charge storage mechanism. In the Schottky diode, the current through the diode is the result of
the drift of majority carriers. e Schottky diode switching time from forward to reverse bias is
very short compared to the p-n junction diode.
erefore, Schottky diodes are often used in integrated circuits for high speed switching
applications. e Schottky diode is easy to fabricate on integrated circuits because of its construc-
tion. e low noise characteristics of the Schottky diode is ideal for the detection of low-level
signals like those encountered in radio frequency electronics and radar detection applications.
2.8.3
PHOTODIODE
e photodiode converts optical energy to electric current. e circuit symbol of the photodiode
is shown in Figure 2.42.
Figure 2.42: Photodiode symbol.
In order to make this energy conversion, the photodiode is reverse biased. Intensifying
the light on the photodiode induces hole-electron pairs that increase the magnitude of the diode
reverse saturation current. e useful output of the photodiode its photocurrent which, for all prac-
tical purposes, is proportional to the light intensity (in Watts) on the device. e proportionality
constant is called the Responsivity, R, which is usually given in amperes per watt and is dependent
on the wavelength of the light. Figure 2.43 shows a photodiode characteristic curve.
If the intensity of the light on the photodiode is constant, the photodiode can be mod-
eled as a constant current source so long as the voltage does not exceed the avalanche voltage.
Naturally, the photocurrent will vary with varying input light intensity. Since the photocurrent
can be very small, an electronic ampliﬁer is used in many applications to both boost the signal
level and to convert from a current to a voltage output. For example, in optical ﬁber commu-
nication receivers, the average intensity of a time varying infrared light on the photodiode can
be signiﬁcantly less than 1 W. Taking a typical photodiode responsivity for ﬁber optic appli-
cation of 0:7 A=W, 1 W of light will produce 0:7 A of average current. is low level signal
must be ampliﬁed by electronic ampliﬁers for processing by other electronic circuits to retrieve
the transmitted information.

LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE
e light-emitting diode (LED) converts electric energy to optical energy (light). LEDs are used
for displays and are used as the light source for low cost ﬁber optic communication transmitters.
By appropriate doping, the emission wavelength of the LED can be varied from the near-infrared
(< 2 m) to the visible (400 nm to 780 nm). e symbol for the LED, shown in Figure 2.44, is
similar to that of the photodiode except for the direction of the arrows representing light being
emitted.
Figure 2.44: LED symbol.
When the LED is conducting, its diode voltage drop can be about 1.7 V although like
small-signal diodes, they can vary due to materials used to fabricate the LED. e intensity of the
light emitted from the LED is proportional to the current through the diode and is characterized
by the so called light intensity-current (L-I) curve shown in Figure 2.45a. e LED also has a
current-voltage relationship depicted in Figure 2.45b.
When using the LED in a circuit, a series current-limiting resistor is used to prevent de-
struction should large currents ﬂow through the LED. e magnitude of the current-limiting
resistor is calculated by limiting the current though the LED to a desired level IOP, less than the
maximum operating current with a diode threshold voltage of V. For example, in Figure 2.46, if
the diode threshold voltage is 1.7 V and IOP D 10 mA provides a satisfactory optical output, the

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e semiconductor diode has been described in this chapter as the most basic non-linear electronic
device. It is a two terminal device that provides small resistance when currents ﬂow through the
diode from the anode to the cathode and extremely large resistance to currents in the reverse
direction. Large reverse voltages force the diode into breakdown and the dynamic resistance again
becomes small. Diode applications utilize the characteristic properties of the diode in one or more
of these three regions of operation:
• the forward bias region (V  V),

114
2. DIODE CHARACTERISTICS AND CIRCUITS
• the reverse bias region (V > V  Vz), and
• the zener region (V < Vz).
While nearly-exact, all-region, analytic expressions for the diode V-I relationship were pre-
sented, it was shown that piece-wise linear approximate expressions for the diode V-I relationship
can, in many cases, provide an adequate representation of the performance of the diode. Other ap-
plications allow for even further simpliﬁcation. ese linear models and their simpliﬁed versions
are summarized in Table 2.3.

e diode was shown to be useful in a number of applications determined by the sur-
rounding circuitry. e Zener diode, tunnel diode, Schottky diode, photodiode, and the LED
were introduced as diodes with properties that necessary for specialized electronic applications.
In later chapters, additional linear and non-linear diode applications will be examined.
Summary Design Example
Many electronic applications have a need for backup electrical power when there is a primary
power failure. is backup may come in the form of very large-value capacitors (1 F or greater),
battery systems, or generators powered by an internal combustion engine. One such electronic
application operates with the following power requirements:
• Allowable input voltage — 5 V < VCC < 9 V
• Current draw — 100 mA < I < 500 mA.

2.9. CONCLUDING REMARKS
115
e primary power source, VCC, provides a nominal voltage of 8 V ˙ 1 V. Design a backup
power system that will provide adequate auxiliary power when the primary power source fails (i.e.,
VCC D 0). e maximum duration of primary power failure is 2 hours.
Solution:
e total power requirement for this system lies in the range:
0:5 W < PT < 4:5 W:
Capacitive backup is a poor choice for this system: even if the largest available capacitors are used,
it will only last a few seconds. Conversely, motorized generators are inappropriately large for this
system: a 0.04 Hp motor would be more than adequate to power a 5 W generator. Of the three
given choices, the best for this application is a rechargeable battery backup.
e design goals for the backup system include:
• the battery backup powers the system only during primary power failure
• the battery backup is recharged at a controlled rate during normal operation
• the battery backup is protected against excessive recharging .
All design goals can be met with a network composed of diodes and a resistor. e proposed
design is as shown. During normal operation the system state is:
• D1 - ON, D2 - OFF, & Dz either OFF or in the Zener region. Resistor, R, controls the
rate of charging of the battery and Dz prevents overcharging the battery.
During backup operation the system state is:
• D1 - OFF, D2 - ON, & Dz OFF. D1 blocks current discharge to the primary power source
and D2 provides a low-impedance path to the load.
e properties of the system components must be speciﬁed.
1. e battery voltage must lie within acceptable ranges for both providing auxiliary power and
receiving current for recharge. Auxiliary power voltage must be greater than the minimum
voltage required by the load plus V and smaller than the minimum voltage provided by the
primary power source minus V:

capable of carrying a minimum of 500 mA continuously.
3. Battery recharging current must be limited. Every battery type has a recommended rate
of charge in order to maintain proper operation for a long life. A typical value for a small
battery such as the one speciﬁed here is approximately 20 mA. e resistor, R, can then be

4. e Zener diode provides protection against over charging the battery. As batteries are over-
charged, the battery voltage increases. Depending on the type of battery chosen, a maximum
voltage will determine the Zener voltage. Maximum recharging current determines the ca-
pacity of the Zener diode. A typical overvoltage for small batteries is approximately 0.2 V,
which leads to:
VZ D 6:2 V:
e maximum recharging current is 30 mA. is corresponds to a maximum power dissi-
pation in the Zener diode of 0.19 W. A 1/4 W diode will suﬃce.

Bipolar Junction Transistor
Characteristic
e Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is perhaps the most basic of three-terminal semiconductor
devices. It can be found, for example, as a vital component in digital and analog integrated circuits,
audio and other frequency range ampliﬁers, radio electronics, and electronic control devices with
a wide range of applications. e BJT is an active device that is highly non-linear, and, along with
applications in non-linear circuitry, plays an important part in many linear electronic applications.
e apparent contradiction of a non-linear device being useful in linear applications is placated
by a region of BJT operation that is nearly linear. Non-linear BJT operation typically involves a
transition between BJT operating regions.
BJTs are constructed with two p-n junctions sharing a common region, identiﬁed as the
base region. is common region, lying between two regions of the complementary doping, causes
the two diode-like p-n junctions to become coupled.¹ e base region may be doped as either a
p-region or an n-region: the two types of BJT formed are identiﬁed as npn or pnp respectively.
Before proceeding with technical descriptions of the operation of a BJT, it is necessary
to deﬁne appropriate descriptive conventions. e two circuit symbols for BJTs are shown in
Figure 3.1.

¹Extensive discussions of the semiconductor physics that lead to coupled p-n junctions forming a bipolar junction transistor
are not within the scope of this electronics text. e authors suggest several texts in semiconductor physics and electronic
engineering materials at the end of this chapter for those readers interested in these aspects of physical electronics.

134
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
e three terminals of a BJT are uniquely deﬁned by the circuit symbols and are identiﬁed
as:
• C—the Collector
• B—the Base
• E—the Emitter
e ordering of the characterizing letters npn or pnp indicates the doping type of the Col-
lector, Base, and Emitter regions, respectively. e two types of BJT have unique symbolic rep-
resentation characterized by the direction of the arrow on the Emitter terminal, which indicates
the direction current would ﬂow if the base-emitter junction were forward biased. e current
entering each terminal is identiﬁed with the subscript of the terminal: the positive direction for
all currents is into the device (i.e., IB is the current entering the base of the transistor as is drawn in
Figure 3.1). e BJT terminal voltage diﬀerences will be identiﬁed with standard double-subscript
notation: voltage at ﬁrst subscript with the second subscript as reference. For example, VBE is the
voltage at the base terminal with the emitter terminal taken as reference (VBE D VB   VE).
As is true of all chapters in this book, the focus of this chapter is on quasistatic (low-
frequency), large-signal analysis. Book 2 of the series will focus on small-signal linear applications
(ampliﬁers, etc.) of BJTs. Book 3 will explore the higher frequency ranges.
is chapter begins with discussion of the principles of BJT operation: the non-linear char-
acteristics of BJT operation are explored through the non-linear Ebers-Moll equations. Quanti-
tative results are obtained through graphic techniques and analytic characterization using SPICE
and MathCAD. In order to simplify the analysis of BJT operation, four simple, linear models for
the BJT, one for each of its four regions of operation, are derived. Digital logic gates provide a
good example of circuitry eﬀectively using BJT regional transitions: the operational characteristics
of three BJT logic gate families are explored.
In order to use the BJT as a linear device, operation must be restricted to single region
operation. Ampliﬁers, the most common BJT linear devices, operate with BJTs biased into a
linear region using a variety of circuit topologies. ese bias circuits are explored with close interest
on two signiﬁcant design criteria: the establishment of a ﬁxed quiescent operating point and the
stability of that operating point to variation in the BJT characteristic parameters.
e summary design example explores a non-linear use of a BJT as a controlled switch in
a Zener diode voltage regulator circuit. Such usage can greatly increase circuit eﬃciency while
reducing component cost.
3.1
BJT V-I RELATIONSHIPS
Much like the semiconductor diode, the Bipolar Junction Transistor can be described empirically
by a set of experimentally derived curves or theoretically by a set of equations. Because there are

3.1. BJT V-I RELATIONSHIPS
135
three terminals and the action of the two p-n junctions are coupled, a single V-I relationship (as
was possible for the diode) is not applicable to the BJT: a set of curves or equations is necessary.
A set of empirical curves for a typical npn BJT is shown in Figure 3.2(a–d). While only the
ﬁrst (a & b) or last (c & d) pair of curves are necessary for complete description of the BJT, both
pairs are shown for completeness. ese characteristic curves are grouped into two categories:

One of the most accurate and simple theoretical characterizations of the BJT are the Ebers-

3.1. BJT V-I RELATIONSHIPS

where Vt is the voltage equivalent temperature deﬁned in Chapter 2,  is an empirical scaling
constant that depends on geometry, material, and doping levels,⁴ and IES and ICS are the emitter
and collector p-n junction saturation currents for a speciﬁed temperature. As with diode leakage
currents, IES and ICS have temperature variation similar to p-n junction temperature variation
(described in Section 2.1): the saturation currents roughly double with every 6ıK increase in
temperature.
e quantities ˛F and ˛R have particular signiﬁcance. In order to understand this signiﬁ-
cance, it is best to mentally perform two mental experiments upon the equations. As a ﬁrst test,
set VBD  Vt and VBC   Vt, that is strongly forward bias the base-emitter junction while the
base-collector junction is strongly reverse biased. e terms with IES in Equations (3.3) become
negligible and IE and IC are related by ˛F :
IC   ˛F IE
(3.4)
˛F is therefore identiﬁed as the DC collector-emitter current gain.
Figure 3.2b & d graphically demonstrate this relationship for two diﬀerent circuit connec-
tions of a BJT. It can be seen from the curves that the quantity ˛F is very close to, but slightly
smaller than, unity. Equation (3.1) can be substituted into Equation (3.4) to get the ratio of the
collector current to the base current.

Figure 3.2d graphically demonstrates this relationship. It can be seen that these bias conditions
lead to a region where an approximate linear relationship exists among the BJT currents, this linear
region is identiﬁed as the forward-active region and is deﬁned by forward biased base-emitter and
reverse biased base-collector junctions.
If the opposite biasing scheme is used: set VBC  Vt and VBE   Vt, that is strongly
forward bias the base-collector junction while the base-emitter junction is strongly reverse biased.
e terms with ICS in Equations (3.3) become negligible and IE and IC are now related by ˛R:
IE   ˛RIC

˛R is identiﬁed as the DC collector-emitter reverse current gain.

⁴e Ebers-Moll equations are written here with a single value of . In fact, it is possible for each of the p-n junctions to have
an individual value of this scaling constant. In practice, the values are nearly identical: hence the use of a single value here.
SPICE and most other circuit emulators allow for the possibility of individual junction values of  and require the user to
input both values should a change from the default value of unity be desired.

138
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
Figure 3.2d also demonstrates this relationship (VCE < 0). Here the bias conditions again lead
to an approximate linear relationship among the BJT currents. is linear region is identiﬁed as
the inverse-active region and is deﬁned by forward biased base-collector and reverse biased base-
emitter junctions. Notice that ˇR is typically much smaller than ˇF . While it is possible for a
BJT to have the forward and reverse values of ˇ to be nearly identical, bipolar junction transistors
are typically designed for optimal performance in the forward-active region: this design process
leads to the signiﬁcantly larger value for ˇF than for ˇR. Manufacturing conditions lead to a
relationship between the forward and reverse current gain expressions:
˛RICS D ˛F IES D IS:

Where IS, the transistor saturation current, is a constant for any particular BJT. It should be noted
that Equations (3.4) & (3.5) and (3.5) & (3.7) apply to diﬀerent biasing conditions and cannot be
valid simultaneously: each set of bias conditions has its own application.
ere are two other regions of particular interest in the operation of a BJT. e ﬁrst of these
occurs when both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are reverse-biased. Under these bias
conditions the emitter and collector currents become (simplifying Equation (3.3))
IE  IES   ˛RICS
(3.9)
and
IC  ICS   ˛F IES:
(3.10)
e currents become basically junction leakage currents. is region of BJT operation corresponds
to two p-n junctions that are reverse biased or turned oﬀ. e region is called the cutoﬀregion.
e ﬁnal region of interest occurs when both p-n junctions are forward-biased. is region
is highly non-linear and is shown in Figure 3.2b & d by the convergence of curves near the origin of
the horizontal axis. In this region the relationships between the BJT currents is not clear, however
the terminal base-emitter and base-collector voltages correspond to voltage across forward biased
p-n junctions and therefore lie in the range of approximately 0.6 V to 0.9 V. is region is called
the saturation region.
e Ebers-Moll equations can be easily converted into a circuit model consisting of a pair
of diodes and a pair of dependent current-controlled current sources. is highly useful model is
shown for an npn BJT⁵ in Figure 3.3.
Notice that Kirchhoﬀ’s current law applied to the emitter and collector nodes produces the fol-
lowing equations:
IE D  IF C ˛RIR
(3.11)
IC D  IR C ˛F IF
(3.12)
⁵e Ebers-Moll model for a pnp Bipolar Junction Transistor takes exactly the same form as that of an npn BJT except the
two diodes are reversed in direction. e dependent current sources and their controlling currents keep the same polarity even though
forward-biased and reverse-biased now imply currents in the opposite direction.

Substitution of these diode equations, as derived in Chapter 2, into Kirchhoﬀ’s equations at the
nodes produces the usual form of the Ebers-Moll equations as seen in Equation (3.3) (exercise
left to the reader).
e Ebers-Moll model and the related Ebers-Moll equations accurately predict the behav-
ior of a BJT throughout its regions of operation at low frequencies. e model does not include
power dissipation restrictions or the possibility of the reverse breakdown of either junction due to
excessive reverse voltages being applied. Addition of capacitors across the junctions as described
in Chapter 10 (Book 3), of the series, expands the model to include high frequency eﬀects.
3.2
THE BJT AS A CIRCUIT ELEMENT
e operation of a BJT in a simple circuit can be derived in much the same manner as the operation
of a diode in a simple circuit. ere are several choices, among the most obvious are:
• Use the Ebers-Moll set of equations and obtain a numerical solution
• Use the empirical V-I curves and obtain a graphical solution

140
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
• Use computer simulation to obtain a solution
e choice of solution technique depends strongly on the complexity of the circuit in which
the BJT is operating.

Determine the collector, base, and emitter currents for the following values of the source
voltage, VS: 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 V.
Solution:
e simple connection of the voltage sources leads directly to the determination of the
base-emitter and base-collector junction voltages: thus, using the Ebers-Moll Equations seems
the most direct method of solution. e Ebers-Moll equations are:

Notice that when VS is small (i.e., VS  0:4 V) the collector current is very small. When
VS increases by 50% to 0.6 V, the current jumps by a factor of more than 2000: the base-emitter
junction of the BJT has become forward biased while the base-collector junction has remained
reverse-biased: the BJT has transitioned from the cut-oﬀregion to the forward-active region.
For 0:6 V  VS  1:2 V, the BJT remains in the forward-active region and the base and collector
currents are related by:

3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
Solution #1 (Ebers-Moll Equations):
Here the Ebers-Moll Equations are not suﬃcient to determine the currents. Two additional
equations, dependent on the circuit topology and parameters, are needed. Loop equations around
base-emitter and base-collector loops yield:
VBE D VS   IBRb
VBC D VS   IBRb   .1:0   ICRC/:
Combining these two equations with the Ebers-Moll Equations and searching for solutions is,
by hand, quite complex. Realistically, a computer search for solutions is the only practical method
of solution. A Computer search solution using MathCAD for the above circuit can be performed
as shown in Figure 3.4:
Repeated use of this MathCAD program (changing the value of VS) yields a set of results
for the various input voltage values (Table 3.2).

Notice that the addition of a resistor on the collector of the BJT creates a transition from
the forward-active region to the saturation region. In the saturation region of a BJT the base and
collector currents no longer have a constant linear relationship. For example, in this circuit the
collector-to-base current relationships are shown in Table 3.3.

e transition to the saturation region is signaled by a change in the ratio of the collector
current to the base current. Saturation occurs when

which appears to occur in this circuit application when VS increases to a value larger than some-
thing slightly less than 0.9 V.
e last column in the table reports the voltage at the collector of the BJT. Notice that
for small values of the input voltage (VS  0:6), the collector voltage is essentially the collec-
tor supply voltage (1.0 V): for large values of the input voltage (VS > 0:9), the collector voltage
nears zero. is property of a near-constant output voltage value for a range of input values has
special signiﬁcance in digital applications circuitry. ese applications are discussed at length in
Section 3.5.
Solution #2 (Graphical Techniques):
e empirical curves for the BJT coupled with load line techniques provide a more direct
form of solution. e two supplemental equations derived in the ﬁrst solution are actually the

144
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
equations for load lines: one in the base-emitter loop and one in the collector-emitter loop.
VBE D VS   IBRb
(3.15)
VBC D VS   IBRB   .1:0   ICRC/:

Solution takes the form of plotting the load lines on the transistor curves: Equation (3.15) is
plotted on the output curves (Figure 3.5b), and Equation (3.16) is plotted as a series of parallel
lines on the input transistor curves (Figure 3.5a), one line for each of the speciﬁed values of VS.
Unfortunately, the load lines cross several of the transistor parameter curves. It is the task of
the circuit analyst/designer to obtain a solution that is consistent with all constraints. e V-I
relationships for this BJT are shown in Figure 3.5a & b.
(a)
(b)
Figure 3.5: Transistor curve traces for Example 3.2.
For example, take the case where VS D 0:9 V. Looking at the input curves, one concludes
that the base current must approximately lie in the range:
20 A  IB  40 A:
From the output curves, using those values of IB, one then concludes that VCE must lie in
the range:
0:08 V  VCE  0:15 V:
is set of restrictions reduces the range of allowable base currents to:
23 A  IB  27 A;
which, in turn, reduces the range of VCE to:
0:09 V  VCE  0:11 V:

3.3. REGIONS OF OPERATION IN BJTS
145
Continuing along this path, one progresses to a ﬁnal solution for VS D 0:9. is solution takes
the form of the following voltage and current values:

IB  25 A;
IC D 1:0   VCE

D 4:1 mA:
While reading values oﬀgraphs will introduce some margin of error, this result is very close to
that of Solution #1: other values of VS will similarly produce results equivalent to those previously
obtained.
Solution #3 (SPICE Simulation):
is problem is particularly suited for DC analysis using SPICE. Of particular importance
is the modeling of the BJT to suit the Ebers-Moll parameters given. SPICE uses a model for BJTs
that in its most simple formulation becomes the Ebers-Moll model. e parameters necessary for
input for this problem are shown in Table 3.4.

When comparing simulation techniques, it is also necessary to make sure all other equa-
tion parameters are identical. e MathCAD simulation used the common approximation:
Vt D 0:026 V. is approximation is quite valid for room temperature  300ıK – it corresponds
to  28:6ıC  301:7ıK. e output values for the SPICE simulation are shown in Figure 3.6.
Notice the results are within ˙0:11% of those calculated using the Ebers-Moll equations solved
directly with MathCAD.
3.3
REGIONS OF OPERATION IN BJTS
BJT operation has been seen to fall into four basic regions of useful operation. e regions are
described by the state of bias of the two p-n junctions within the transistor. e four possible com-
binations and the corresponding region names are shown in Figure 3.7. Brieﬂy, the four regions
of operation are:

146
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
1. e cutoﬀregion is deﬁned by both base-emitter and base-collector junctions being reverse
biased. Reverse biasing both junctions reduces all currents in a BJT to small leakage values
in the picoampere to nanoampere range: the BJT essentially looks like an open circuit.
Applications for this region are primarily in the switching and digital logic areas.
2. e saturation region is deﬁned by both junctions being forward biased. Here the possibility
exists for large current ﬂow between the collector and emitter terminals with minimal dy-
namic resistance (VCE  0). Applications again fall in the switching and digital logic areas.
3. e forward-active region. is region is deﬁned as a forward biased base-emitter junction
and a reverse biases base-collector junction. BJTs operating in this region are characterized
by a relatively constant collector current to base current ratio. e region is most commonly
used for ampliﬁcation with the parameters ˛F and ˇF describing the ampliﬁcation.

4. e inverse-active region. is region is the direct opposite of the forward-active region:
the base-collector junction is forward biased and the base-emitter junction is reverse bi-
ased. Here emitter current is a multiple of base current with ˛R and ˇR describing the
ampliﬁcation. While it is certainly possible to manufacture a BJT with ampliﬁcation in
the inverse-active region as large as that of the forward-active region, most BJTs are opti-
mized for forward ampliﬁcation resulting in much smaller values for ˛ and ˇ in this region.
e region is rarely used with the notable exception of the input stages of the transistor-
transistor-logic (TTL) family of digital logic gates.
In addition to these four regions, there is an additional region of severe consequences: the
breakdown region. A BJT enters the breakdown region when one or both of the p-n junctions are
suﬃciently reverse biased so that a Zener-like breakdown occurs. Transistors are not manufac-
tured to withstand extended use in the breakdown region and typically will exhibit catastrophic
thermal run-away and destruction. Manufacturers list maximum voltages that can be safely ap-

MODELING THE BJT IN ITS REGIONS OF OPERATION
e Ebers-Moll model for Bipolar Junction Transistors is a ﬂexible, but rather complex, model
that can be used in all four useful regions of operation. It can, however, be simpliﬁed within each
region to provide a set of elementary BJT models: one for each region. e derivation of each of
the individual models is described below and a summary table listing each model and conditions
to test the validity of each model appears in Figure 3.8.⁶
1. e cutoﬀregion is deﬁned by both base-emitter an base-collector junctions being reverse
biased. Reverse biased p-n junctions provide extremely high impedance and low leakage
currents; the low currents in the junctions reduce the dependent current sources of the
Ebers-Moll model to near-zero value. erefore, a simple model of a BJT in cutoﬀis three
terminals with open circuits between. e typical turn-on voltage (the voltage at which a
junction becomes forward biased) for a Silicon BJT p-n junction is:
VBE.on/ D VBC.on/ D 0:6 V:
2. e saturation region is deﬁned by both p-n junctions being forward biased. Forward biased
junctions can be modeled by a voltage source in series with a small resistance. e model
most commonly used ignores this small resistance and models the BJT with two constant
⁶In Figure 3.8 the voltage source polarities are correct for npn BJTs. e circuit diagrams for pnp BJTs are identical with the
polarity of the voltage sources reversed. One common error in making this change involves the polarity of the dependent
current sources: the polarity (or direction) of the dependent current sources stays the same for both types of BJT. e currents
ﬂow in opposite directions, but the ratio, as indicated by the direction of the dependent current sources, does not change
polarity.

voltage sources. Rather than show a voltage source connected from the base to each of the
other terminals, it is most common to model the BJT with a voltage source from the base
to the emitter and another from the emitter to the collector: this second voltage source will
be a small value source since it models the diﬀerence in forward bias voltage for the two
junctions. Typically, one junction will tend to be more forward biased than the other (i.e.,
the base-emitter junction is often more forward biased than the base-collector junction)
due to the diﬀerent currents passing through each junction. For Silicon transistors typical
model values are:
VBE.sat/ D 0:8 V
and
VCE.sat/ D 0:2 V:
3. e forward-active region is deﬁned as a forward biased base-emitter junction and a reverse
biased base-collector junction. Here the forward biased base-emitter junction is modeled
by a voltage source and the reverse biased junction by an open circuit. e current through
the forward biased base-emitter junction activates the dependent current source between
the collector and base in the Ebers-Moll model while the other current source is inactive
(its controlling current is near zero value). e typical value for Silicon BJTs is:
V D 0:7 V:
4. e inverse-active region is the opposite of the forward-active region. e base-collector
junction is modeled by a voltage source and a dependent current source is connected between
the emitter and base.
When one complex model is separated into a group of simple models, several diﬃculties
can occur. e most prevalent of these diﬃculties is the choice of the proper model for the cir-
cumstances in question. Whenever a circuit element is replaced by a model that is only correct for
one region of operation of the circuit element, the assumptions upon which the model must be
tested in order to verify the validity of the replacement. Experience leads to the proper choice of
correct model on the ﬁrst guess: incorrect guesses, when tested for validity, give clues as to which
is the correct model to choose next.

Determine the region of operation for the BJT and the base and collector currents.
Solution:
First a region of operation must be chosen. It seems clear that the inverse-active region
can clearly be eliminated — the base must be at higher voltage than the collector with positive
base and negative collector currents. Also easily eliminated is the cutoﬀregion — with no current
ﬂowing in the BJT, the base-emitter and base-collector junctions would clearly be forward biased
(a violation of the assumptions for that region). e choice clearly lies between the forward-active
region and the saturation region. e correct choice is not obvious.
As a ﬁrst try, assume the BJT is operating in the saturation region.
Attempt #1 (saturation)
Replace the BJT with its saturation region model (indicated in Figure 3.8) and then calcu-

DIGITAL ELECTRONICS APPLICATIONS
Many digital electronics applications are based upon a BJT changing from one region of operation
to another. e simple regional models of BJT operation are suﬃcient to understand the basic
operation of several logic gate types.⁷
In digital systems there are only a few basic logic operations which must typically be per-
formed. e most common of these operations are: NOT, AND, and OR. A common property
of these operations is that a variety of inputs produce an output in binary form: that is, an output
that exists in one of two possible states. Typical electronic circuitry assigns to each logic value
(i.e., “1” or “0,” “HIGH” or “LOW,” “ON” or “OFF”) a speciﬁc range of voltage values. As an
example, the transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuit family, one of the basic logic circuit families
that will be discussed in this section, assigns two logic voltage ranges:
low voltage range —
0 V  VL  0:8 V
high voltage range — 2:0 V  VH  5:5 V:
One of the major goals of an electronic circuit that will perform a logic operation is to
provide a constant value output that is invariant to this form of voltage variation on the input.
e simple circuit of Example 3.2 showed this property of virtually invariant output voltage to a
range of input voltage values. A circuit with similar properties is shown in Figure 3.9.
⁷Gate speed and some of the more advanced digital circuitry topics will be discussed in Chapter 16 (Book 4).

A LOGIC INVERTER CIRCUIT
If one assumes that VCC is a positive voltage, the operation of the circuit of Figure 3.9 can be
described as:
1. For small values of Vin, the BJT is in the cut-oﬀregion. e base and collector currents are
near zero, and the output voltage, Vo, is basically the same value as VCC.
2. As Vin increases, the base-emitter voltage on the BJT will increase until the BJT turns on
and the BJT enters the forward-active region. is transition of regions will occur at an
input voltage,

:
3. When the output voltage reaches Vce.sat/, the BJT will enter the saturation region, further
increases in the input voltage will result in negligible changes in the output voltage.
is simple circuit forms the basis of a “NOT” gate (also known as a logic inverter): low
value input voltages become high output voltages and vice versa. e BJT switches between the

154
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
cut-oﬀand the saturation regions to form the two logic levels. e high output region (BJT
in cut-oﬀ) is described as #1 above, and the low region (BJT in saturation) is described as #3.
A transition region (BJT in forward-active region) is described as #2, and serves as a buﬀer to
isolate the two regions.
Example 3.4
e circuit of Figure 3.9 has the following circuit element values
VCC D 5 V
Rin D 5:6 k
Rb D 15 k
Rc D 2:2 k
and a Silicon BJT with ˇF D 50.
Determine the voltage transfer relationship for 0 V  Vin  5 V.
Solution:
e voltage transfer relationship is best shown with a plot Vo as a function of Vin as the
desired result.
It is best to begin at one end of the input range, for example begin at Vin D 0. Clearly, both
BJT p-n junctions are reverse biased and the transistor is in the cut-oﬀregion. With the transistor
oﬀ, Vo D 5 V. As the input voltage increases, the BJT will remain in the cut-oﬀregion until the
base-emitter voltage becomes suﬃciently large to turn the BJT on. Equation (3.17) yields the
transition input voltage:

or

e input-output transfer relationship for this region of operation is of particular interest. Notice
that the output voltage is multiple of the input voltage (in this case,  19:65) with a DC oﬀset (in
this case, 23.88 V). Small variations of the input voltage create larger variations at the output!
is important property, known as ampliﬁcation, often associated with the forward-active region
of a BJT is discussed thoroughly in Chapter 5 (Book 2), of the series.
e BJT forward-active portion of the transfer relationship is valid until the BJT enters
the saturation region: that is, when Vo D VCE.sat/ D 0:2 V. Solving for the input voltage that cor-
responds to the transition to the BJT saturation region yields:

Section “2” of the transfer relationship can be plotted (shown in Figure 3.10) using the above
relationships.
For Vin > Vin.2/ D 1:205 V, the BJT is in saturation and Vo  0:2 V. at result is shown
in section “3” of the transfer relationship. It should be noted that the simple linearized models
for BJTs have greatest error near the transition between regions. In this example, the errors are
greatest near Vin.1/  0:83 V. Here, because of the extreme steepness of the curve in region “2,”
region “1” ends at Vin.1/ D 0:824 V and region “2” begins (the output voltage cannot exceed VCC,
therefore when Vo D 5) at Vin D 0:960 V. Experience tells us to ﬁll in the gap with a smooth
curve.
Notice in the transfer relationship, shown in Figure 3.10, the two constant voltage levels
are quite wide compared to the very rapid transition region. is form of transfer characteristic
is quite desirable in digital logic circuitry in that it allows for variation in the input (often caused
by noise) without change in the output. Noise Margins are quantitative measures of the allowable
variation in inputs. Each is deﬁned as the variation in input from the nominal input (voltage levels
that a similar gate would deliver if attached to the input):
NM(0)  allowable LOW input variation
NM(1)  allowable HIGH input variation.

e logic inverter circuit serves a useful purpose in digital circuitry: it performs the NOT
operation. In order to perform the more complex operations such as: AND and OR it is necessary
to increase the complexity of the circuitry. As a ﬁrst example, the addition of diodes to the input of
a BJT leads to the common Diode-Transistor Logic (DTL) family of gates. e most basic circuit
of the DTL family is the NAND (NOTAND) gate. It is formed by a connection of a diode logic
AND and a transistor logic inverter. In Figure 3.11, this gate is shown with two input diodes, D1a
and D1b: additional inputs could be implemented with additional similarly-connected diodes.

DIODE-TRANSISTOR LOGIC GATE
e operation of this circuit can be described as:⁸
1. For small values of either input voltage (or both input voltages), the corresponding input
diode, D1, will turn on. e voltage at the anode of the input diodes then becomes:
Vanode D Vin C V:
If Vanode is suﬃciently small, that is if
Vanode < VBE.on/ C 2V
⁸VCC is once again assumed to be a positive voltage. Often VCC is chosen to be  C5 V, but there are several varieties of DTL
circuitry that use other positive values.

or equivalently,

the BJT will be in the cut-oﬀregion and the output voltage,

2. If the minimum value of both inputs is Vin, and as Vin increases beyond the constraints of
the above region of operation, i.e., when
Vanode > 2V C VBE.on/
or equivalently,

e BJT enters the forward active region. e output voltage will steadily decrease until the

input diodes both turn oﬀ; that is, when:
Vin > VBE.sat/ C 2V   V D VBE.sat/ C V:
As in the logic inverter circuit, this region is very narrow: the BJT is in the forward-active
region for only a small range (VBE.sat/   VBE.on/  0:2 V) of input voltage values.
3. Once the input diodes turn oﬀ, the input is essentially disconnected from the circuit. Further
increases in the value of Vin produce no change in Vo, which remains at:
Vo  VCE.sat/ D 0:2 V:

To summarize the operation of this gate:
One or more inputs LOW
)
HIGH output D VCC
All inputs HIGH
)
LOW output D VCE.sat/:
is behavior forms a logic NAND gate.
It has been shown that input voltages are not necessarily a particular value: they can vary
over in a range of values without changing the output of the logic circuit:
LOW input range – 0  ViL  VBE.on/ C V
HIGH input range – VBE.sat/ C V  ViH  VCC:
e susceptibility of this any gate to noise is dependent on these input level range and the nominal
logic level that is expected. For this particular logic circuit the nominal logic levels are:
nominal LOW D VL D VCE.sat/
nominal HIGH D VH D VCC:
e noise voltage at an input that will cause the circuit to function improperly is called the noise
margin. Noise margin is typically diﬀerent for each logic level and is deﬁned as the diﬀerence
between the edge of the level range and the nominal level. e DTL NAND gate under consid-
eration has noise margins of:
NM(LOW) D VBE.on/ C V   VCE.sat/
NM(HIGH) D VBE.sat/ C V   VCC:
It should be noted that the magnitude of NM(LOW) is signiﬁcantly smaller than the magnitude
of NM(HIGH): the LOW input signal is much more susceptible to noise than the HIGH input
signal. Moving the transition voltage nearer to the center of the range of input values can equalize
the noise rejection properties between HIGH and LOW inputs. is equalization of noise margin
magnitudes (rarely done in DTL gates) can be accomplished by inserting additional diodes in
series with D2a and D2b, or, as in a closely related logic family, the High-reshold Logic (HTL)
family, the two diodes can be replaced by a reverse-biased Zener diode with an appropriate Zener
voltage greater than 2 V. e Zener diode allows an increase in the transition voltage values
without an increase in component quantity. e HTL family is particularly useful in high-noise
environments.
Another important factor when considering using logic gates, is the quantity of gates of
similar properties that can be connected in parallel to the output. e number of gates that can be
driven by a single gate, without changing the value of the output voltages, is called the fan-out of
the gate. e load that “slave” gates (the gates being driven) apply to the “master” gate (the gate
driving the slaves) takes the form of a load current. When the input to a slave gate is HIGH, the

3.5. DIGITAL ELECTRONICS APPLICATIONS
159
input diodes to the slave are oﬀ: the slave gates draw no current and present no load to the master
gate. When the input to a slave gate is LOW, current ﬂows out of the slave gate into the output
of the master gate: suﬃcient current added into the collector of the master gate BJT will force
the BJT out of saturation and therefore change the output voltage level.

this DTL logic gate (only LOW slave inputs present a load) :
• the input current for a slave gate with LOW input
• the BJT base and collector currents for a master gate with LOW output

operation as described in earlier sections of this chapter. When diode D2b of the DTL gate is

TRANSISTOR-TRANSISTOR LOGIC GATE
e operation of this basic logic circuit can be described as:
1. For small values of any one or more input voltage, the input transistor, Q1, base-emitter
junction will be forward-biased. Since currents coming out of the base of Q2 (this current
is also the collector current of Q1) are negligible, IC1 < ˇF IB1 and Q1 is in saturation. e
voltage at the base of Q2 is given by:
VB2 D Vin C VCE.sat/:
If this voltage is suﬃciently small, that is if
VB2 < VBE.on/2 C V3
or equivalently,
Vin < VBE.on/2 C V3   VCE.sat/1

162
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
the output transistor, Q3, will be in the cut-oﬀregion and the output voltage,
Vo D VCC:
2. Let the minimum value of both inputs be Vin. As Vin increases beyond the constraints of the
above region of operation, i.e., when
VB2 > VBE.on/2 C V3
or equivalently when,
Vin > VBE.on/2 C V3   VBE.sat/1;
the transistor Q1, with both its p-n junctions forward-biased, begins to have current ﬂowing
out its collector. is outward-ﬂowing current brings Q2 into the forward-active region,
allowing current to ﬂow through Rb. As Vin is increased farther, suﬃcient current ﬂows
through Rb to bring Q3 into the active and ﬁnally the saturation region. Much of the action
in this region is internal to the gate circuitry and not visible at the output. e output voltage
transitions from HIGH to LOW over a small range on input voltages: typically of width
0.2 V or less.
3. Finally, when Vin increases suﬃciently, that is when
Vin > VBE.sat/3 C VBE.sat/2 C VCE.sat/1 D 2VBE.sat/ C VCE.sat/;
ﬁrst Q3 and then Q2 have their base-emitter junctions suﬃciently forward-biased to enter
the saturation region. As the bias on the base-emitter junction of Q1 becomes less negative,
Q1 transitions through the saturation region (smaller inputs have the base-emitter junction
more strongly forward-biased; larger inputs force the base-collector junction to be more
strongly forward-biased) to the inverse-active region. It should be noted that Q1 in the
inverse-active region implies a current load on the input source. at load can certainly
be present; however, Q1 could also be in the saturation region (with the base-collector
junction more strongly forward-biased) to achieve the same output voltage. Q1 self-limits
the amount of current that it draws to no more than is available from the source. e output
voltage for HIGH inputs is:

⁹While a high input to a slave gate does draw current, it does not aﬀect the proper operation of the slave gate. It does, however
draw down the output voltage of the master gate. In extreme cases the input transistor of the slave gate will enter the inverse-
saturation (base-collector junction more strongly forward-biased) region due to a limitation on the current available: the slave
gate will self-limit the amount of current that it draws from the master gate.

If Q1 is in the inverse-active region, its emitter current is given by:

If the master gate is driven by other gates of the same type, it is unreasonable to assume that

BIASING THE BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR
In the previous section, transistors were used in digital (non-linear) circuits. In the digital appli-
cations considered, the transistors operated in one of two states that resulted in an output of either
a logic 1 or a logic 0: the transistors transitioned between the saturation and cut-oﬀregions. In
linear applications (e.g., in the design of linear ampliﬁers) the transistors are biased to operate in

168
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
only the forward-active region of operation. e transistor is biased at a quiescent operating point,
which is commonly called the Q-point, based on the dc conditions of the transistor. e Q-point
is determined by the transistor characteristics and the applied external currents and voltages. It is
commonly described by four dc quantities:
• the two transistor terminal voltages, VBE and VCE, and
• the two transistor currents, IB and IC.
Once the Q-point is established, a time varying excursion of the input signal (for example, a
base current) will cause an output signal (collector voltage or current) of the same waveform. e
ampliﬁer design and analysis techniques discussed in Book 2 of this series may be employed to
determine the gain of the circuit.
If the output waveform is not a reproduction of the input signal (e.g., the waveform is
clipped on one side), the Q-point is unsatisfactory and must be relocated. e selection of the
Q-point in the forward-active region is also subject to the various transistor ratings that limit the
range of useful operation. e manufacturers’ speciﬁcations sheets for transistors list the maxi-
mum collector dissipation (sometimes listed as maximum power dissipation) PC;max, maximum
collector current IC;max, maximum collector-emitter voltage VCEO, maximum emitter-base voltage
VEBO, and maximum collector-base voltage VCB.
A graphical representation of the operating limits of the transistor due to maximum power
dissipation, PC;max, maximum collector current, IC;max, and maximum collector-emitter voltage
VCEO is shown in Figure 3.15.

e safe operating region is not shaded and lies below the so-called maximum power dis-
sipation hyperbola deﬁned by PC;max, where
PC;max D IC;maxVCEO:
(3.18)
In an increased temperature environment, the maximum power dissipation hyperbola encroaches
into the safe operating region. erefore, the transistor should be load line and the operating point
should lie well within the unshaded safe operating region to avoid the possibility of transistor
thermal failure.
To help in the design and analysis of transistor biasing circuits, a few key terminal cur-
rent relationships are re-iterated here. e direction of transistor terminal current ﬂow is deﬁned
in Figure 3.1: all currents ﬂow into the transistor. ree important transistor terminal current
relationships from the previous sections of this chapter are:
IC D ˇF IB;
IC D  ˛F IE;
IB D  .IC C IE/:
From these equations, the emitter current, IE, can be related to the collector current, IC, and the
base current, IB.
To ﬁnd the relationship between the base and the emitter currents, Kirchhoﬀ’s Current
Law (KCL) is applied to the BJT:

In real transistors, the output characteristic curves in the forward-active region slope slightly
upward, increasing IC with VCE for a constant IB. e slope of the curve is determined by the
BJT Early voltage, VA. e Early voltage is that voltage which is the point of intersection of the
IC D 0 line and the extended line from the characteristic curves in the forward-active region,
with values typically in the 75 to 100 V range. Figure 3.16 provides a pictorial deﬁnition of the
BJT Early voltage.
Figure 3.16: e Early voltage of the BJT.
e .model statement in the SPICE model of the BJT can be altered to include an Early
voltage. For instance, the model statement for a BJT with VA D 75 V,
.model NPXEX NPN(BF=200 VA=75) ,
is used to create the load-line analysis plot in Figure 3.17.
Using resistive networks, several common BJT biasing methods that achieve the desired Q-
point will be discussed in this section. Current source biasing methods for achieving the desired
Q-point will be discussed in Chapter 6 (Book 2). For linear applications, the transistor Q-point
must be established in the forward-active region.
3.6.1
FIXED-BIAS CIRCUIT
One method of biasing a transistor to operate at a desired Q-point is illustrated in Figure 3.18a
which shows the ﬁxed-bias circuit (sometimes called the base-bias circuit). It is convenient to use
the forward-active model of the npn BJT as shown in Figure 3.18b for analyzing bias circuits.
e collector-emitter voltage VCE D VC   VE is equal to the power supply voltage minus
the voltage drop across the collector resistor RC. at is:

BJT. e slope of the input load line is  1=RB from Equation (3.23). e load line intersects
the IB axis at VCC=RB when VBE D 0 and intersect the VBE axis when at VCC. Note that relative

the remainder of this book.

A load line representing RC is superimposed on the transistor output characteristics as
shown in Figure 3.19b. As in the load line analysis performed for diode circuits in Chapter 2,
the slope of the input load line is the negative of the inverse of the load resistance ( 1=RC) as is
evident in Equation (3.22). e intersection of this load line with the common-emitter transistor
output characteristic curve for the desired IB determines the Q-point. is Q-point is identiﬁed
by the resultant transistor collector current and the collector-emitter voltage.

In this example, the BJT was assumed to have a ﬂat IC vs. VCE curve for each IB: that is

is commonly described by a parameter called the Early voltage. No variation in IC (a common
ﬁrst-order approximation) is modeled by inﬁnite Early voltage. e BJT output characteristic

First, the load line representing RC must be found. is is accomplished by ﬁrst establishing the
desired Q-point on the transistor output characteristics. e desired Q-point is located knowing

From the Q-point, a straight line that intersects the VCE axis at VCE D VCC is drawn. e line is
extended from the Q-point to intersect the IC axis to complete the load line. ese two points on
the load line establishes the extremes of the transistor operation. at is, when VCE D VCC, all of
the voltage from the power supply is dropped across the transistor (collector and emitter). ere-
fore, there is no voltage drop across the load resistor RC corresponding to zero current ﬂowing
through the resistor (IC D 0). When the load line intersects the IC axis, VCE D 0. erefore, the
transistor (collector-emitter) acts as if it were a short circuit and the voltage drop across the load
resistor equals the power supply voltage, VCC. From Equation (3.22), the current ﬂowing when
through the resistor VCE D 0 is VCC=RC. e load line analysis of the ﬁxed-bias circuit is shown
in Figure 3.20. e slope of the line (actually, the negative inverse slope of the line) is the desired
load resistor, RC, which in this case is 1 k.
In the ﬁxed-bias circuit, the base current is essentially ﬁxed by the value of VCC and RB. e
collector current is determined by IB and ˇF . Because ˇF varies widely from one transistor to
another and with temperature change, the collector current also varies widely with these changes.
In Section 3.7, the ﬁxed-bias circuit will be shown to be one of the worst ways to bias a transistor
from the standpoint of stability of the Q-point.
Several variations of the ﬁxed-bias circuit are commonly used. ese variations increase
the stability of the Q-point, making the circuit less susceptible to variations performance due to
changes in transistor parameters.

e other extreme of the load line occurs when the transistor collector-emitter voltage drops all
of the voltage provided by the power supply. If all of the supply voltage is dropped across the
transistor, the collector current must be zero (IC D 0). erefore, the intersection of the load line
with the VCE axis must occur at VCC. e BJT output characteristic with the load line for the
ﬁxed-bias circuit with collector feedback is shown in Figure 3.26.

e emitter-bias circuit is often used when two power supplies (positive and negative) are avail-
able. In this conﬁguration, shown in Figure 3.27 the collector current can easily be made to be
essentially independent of ˇF , making the circuit less sensitive to variations in ˇF due to tem-

BIASING PNP TRANSISTORS
When pnp transistors are used, the polarity of all dc sources must be reversed. For operation in
the forward-active region, the pnp transistor emitter voltage is greater than the collector voltage.
e pnp characteristic curves are shown in Figure 3.32. Note that the polarity of the base and
collector currents are negative in relation to the convention chosen in Figure 3.1. Because of the
polarity reversal of the terminal voltages, it is customary to use positive values of VEC and VEB in
the DC analysis and design of pnp transistor circuits.

BIAS STABILITY
e quiescent operating point (Q-point) of a BJT in the forward-active region is dependent on the
reverse saturation current, base-emitter voltage and the current gain of the transistor. is Q-point
of a BJT circuit can change due to variations in operating temperature or parameter variations
that occur when interchanging individual transistors with slightly diﬀerent characteristics in the
biasing circuit. A stable Q-point is desirable for the following reasons:
• Ensures that the transistor will operate over a speciﬁed range of DC voltages and currents
• e desired ampliﬁer gain, and input and output resistances, which are all dependent on
the bias condition, are achieved
• e maximum power hyperbola is not violated
As an example of the parameter variation, an input transistor characteristics in Figure 3.35 shows
a decrease in V (for VCE D 0) for a rise in operating temperature from 27ıC to 50ıC. For this
particular example, the change in V is approximately  70 mV.
Figure 3.36 shows the variation in the npn BJT output characteristic curve with load line
for a rise in operating temperature from 27ıC to 50ıC. At elevated temperatures, the change in
the collector current, IC, increases for higher base currents. erefore, for a constant IB, the
Q-point of the BJT is shifted by some increment of both IC and VCE. e change in the output
characteristic is caused by increases in both the transistor ˇF and the reverse saturation current.

to changes in the reverse saturation current for diﬀerent biasing arrangements.

3.7. BIAS STABILITY

A set of three stability factors is used to quantify the variation in the collector current with
respect to the reverse saturation current, base-emitter voltage, and ˇF . e stability factors are:

ICO
SV D @IC

Sˇ D @IC

 IC
ˇF
:
(3.69)
e stability of the bias conﬁguration is quantiﬁed with respect to the collector current for the
following reasons:
• the collector current is dependent on the base current and the collector-emitter voltage, and
determines the output signal of a BJT ampliﬁer,
• small variations in ˇF , ICO, and VBE can result in a large change in IC.
e total incremental change in IC for small changes in ICO, VBE, and ˇF is,
ICT D SIICO C SV VBE C SˇˇF :
(3.70)
Equation (3.70) clearly shows that in order to keep the change in IC small, the magnitude of the
stability factors must also be kept small.
An accurate method of determining ˇF at the operating point would be to include the
eﬀects of the Early voltage. Increase in accuracy is attained by using the slope of the output
characteristics caused by the Early voltage, VA, shown in Figure 3.37.

SELF-BIAS CIRCUIT STABILITY
e bias stability factors for the self-bias circuit, shown in Figure 3.15, can be derived using the
analysis for the ﬁxed-bias circuit. SI for the self-bias circuit is found by applying Equation (3.68)

SI can be reduced by choosing RB as small as possible and RE as large as possible. e range of
values of RB and RE are limited by the required input resistance and the limitation of the power
supply current output. at is, if a large RE is chosen, the power supply must be able to provide
a large collector current to the transistor to yield the required emitter voltage.
SV for the self-biased circuit is also found by using the expression for the base-emitter loop
of Equation (3.81). By re-arranging Equation (3.81), the expression for IC (for ICO  0) is found:

e ratio RB=RE in Equation (3.93) can be used as a rule of thumb when designing self-bias BJT
circuits. It is evident from Equation (3.93) that increasing RE results in increased stability. e
value of RE is determined by many factors including the ampliﬁer gain and maximum allowable
swing which will both be discussed in Chapter 5 (Book 2).
e bias stability factors for various npn BJT bias arrangements are shown in Table 3.5. In
general, the addition of RE to the bias network decreases all three stability factors with increases
the overall stability of the Q-point of the BJT .
Since the ˇF variation of a BJT is, in general, the dominant factor that determines Q-
point stability, the an approximate relationship for the change in collector current with respect to
a change in ˇF can be established. e change in collector current, IC, for a change in ˇF for
the diﬀerent bias conﬁgurations are shown in Table 3.6.

e analytical result is in general agreement with the load line result in Figure 3.40 where IC is
slightly larger than 0.06 mA. Note that the collector current change due ICO is negligible, and
in most cases, can be ignored.
Figure 3.40: Output characteristic curves for the 2N2222 BJT with load line.
e calculated variation in collector current is 79.8 A for the self-bias circuit as opposed
to 460 A for the ﬁxed-bias circuit. erefore, the self-bias circuit has better bias stability than
the ﬁxed-bias arrangement.
Some SPICE software packages allow for worst-case or Monte-Carlo analysis of the circuit
with variations in operating parameters. ese packages are useful when analyzing bias stability
when individual BJTs are replaced in a bias circuit without varying the operating temperature.
For instance, in PSpice, the .WCASE command is used for worst-case analysis: Multisim has a
worst case analysis available under the simulation tab.
For instance, if ˇF varies for an npn BJT from 200 to 220, the simple .model statement
for PSpice is:
.model
device_name
NPN(BF=200 DEV 20)
where DEV is the deviation from the nominal (BF=200).
To perform a worst-case analysis to determine the impact of the change in ˇF on the
collector current on the transistor Q1, the netlist includes the following statement:
.WCASE DC IC(Q1) YMAX HI VARY DEV DEVICES Q

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e Bipolar Junction Transistor has been described in this chapter as a commonly used semicon-
ductor device with four basic regions of operation: the saturation, forward-active, inverse-active,

208
3. BIPOLAR JUNCTION TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTIC
and cut-oﬀregions. e BJT operation into these regions is controlled by the bias conditions on
the transistor base-emitter and base-collector junctions. Typical applications lead to the use of the
transistor base current and the collector-emitter voltage as more accessible quantities for region
veriﬁcation.
e Ebers-Moll transistor model was presented to quantify the current-voltage relation-
ships of the BJT in all four regions of operation. As with the semiconductor diode, adequate
representation of BJT performance can be obtained with piece-wise linear approximations of the
transistor characteristics. A set of simple linear models, one for each region of operation, was
developed using transistor characteristics as expressed by the Ebers-Moll model and its corre-
sponding set of equations.
BJT logic gate applications have provided a good example of transistor circuitry using a
variety of regions of operation. e two-state output necessary for binary gates is often achieved
by the output BJT transitioning between the saturation or cut-oﬀregion. In addition, Transistor-
Transistor Logic Gates, provide an example of inverse-active region operation of the input BJT.
Linear BJT applications utilize the forward-active region. Here, the operation of the transistor
is nearly linear about a quiescent operating point (Q-point) achieved with external bias circuitry.
Several biasing circuits were developed, and the bias stability due to variations in transistor pa-
rameters was quantiﬁed. Based on the foundations developed in this chapter, additional linear
and non-linear applications will be examined in later chapters.
Summary Design Example
Bipolar Junction Transistors can often be used as a controlled current shunt to reduce power
consumption in sensitive or expensive electronic components. A Zener diode voltage regulator is
one device that can beneﬁt from a shunting BJT. e basic topology of such a voltage regulator
is shown below.

Without the use of a shunting BJT, the regulator resistor must be capable of carrying cur-
rents in excess of the of the load current. Similarly, the Zener diode also carries very large currents.
e shunting BJT in this design topology reduces the current through both these devices, thereby
reducing power consumption and component cost.
Design a Zener voltage regulator with BJT shunt to meet the following design require-
ments:

is simple design results in a power consumption of between 60.5 W (VS D 12 V) and
190 W (VS D 15 V) independent of the load current (maximum load power D 50 W). e dif-

Field Eﬀect Transistor
Characteristics
In Chapter 3 Bipolar Junction Transistors were shown to be semiconductor devices that operate on
carrier ﬂow from the emitter to the base and then through to the collector. For example, npn BJTs
are devices where the current ﬂow from the collector to the emitter is regulated by the current
injected into the base. erefore, the BJT is a current controlled three-terminal semiconductor
device.
Field Eﬀect Transistors (FETs) are semiconductor devices that employ a channel between
the drain and the source to transport carriers. An adjacent controlling surface, called the gate,
regulates the current ﬂow through the drain-source channel. is channel is controlled by a volt-
age applied to the gate of the FET. erefore, the FET can be described as a voltage controlled
three-terminal semiconductor device (see Figure 4.1). e physical properties of FETs make them
suitable for ampliﬁcation, switching, and other electronic applications.

Figure 4.1: FET represented as a three terminal device.
e terminal characteristics of Junction Field Eﬀect Transistors (JFETs) and Metal-Oxide-
Semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs) are described in this chapter. Other types of FETs exist, but
JFETs and MOSFET are the predominate FET types.¹ MOSFETs are used extensively in inte-
grated circuits for digital applications: JFETs are most commonly found in analog applications.
¹Other FET types include the Metal-Semiconductor FET (MESFET), Modulation-doped FET (MODFET), and Vertical
MOSFET (VMOSFET). Analysis of JFETs and MOSFETs will allow for a general understanding of FET behavior that
can be used with other FET devices.

230
4. FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS
Terminal characterization of FETs is suﬃcient for electronic analysis and design: for discussions
on the device physics of FETs, the reader is referred to the references.
Within each FET type, further categorization is based upon two properties of the channel:
channel doping and gate action on the channel. e FET channel may be fabricated from n-
or p-type material. erefore, the FETs are designated as n-channel JFETs, p-channel JFETs,
n-channel MOSFETs (NMOSFETs), and p-channel MOSFETs (PMOSFETs). e equations
governing the operation of the two channel types of FETs are identical with the exception that
the current and voltages in the two types are of opposite polarities. at is, the n-channel positive
current and voltages are replaced by negative current and voltages for p-channel devices. In ad-
dition to the two FET channel types, MOSFETs can either be depletion or enhancement mode
MOSFETs. JFETs are depletion mode devices. e terms depletion and enhancement refer to the
action of the gate control voltage on the carriers in the channel and the channel itself.
Depletion mode devices can be thought of has having a normally open channel for charge
carriers between the drain and the source. With the application of a potential of the proper polar-
ity across the gate and source, the carriers in the channels are essentially “depleted” which “pinches
oﬀ,” or squeezes, the channel between the drain and source disallowing additional charge carriers
(current) to ﬂow through the channel. e point at which the current between the drain and the
source is “pinched-oﬀ” is regulated by decreasing gate voltage relative to the source for n-channel
devices and increasing the voltage relative to the source for p-channel devices. For nchannel de-
vices, decreasing the gate potential relative to the source squeezes the drain-source channel closed.
e drain-source channel in an enhancement mode device is described as normally closed.
In the enhancement mode case, the application of a potential of the proper polarity between
the gate and source terminals causes the drain-source channel to become “enhanced,” allowing
additional carriers (current) to ﬂow. For n-channel devices, increasing the gate potential relative
to the source enhances the drain-source channel.
JFETs, whether n- or p-type, are depletion mode devices.² Depletion MOSFETs can op-
erate either in the depletion mode or the enhancement mode depending on the gate potential
relative to the source, allowing the drain-source channel to either open up to allow additional
current ﬂow (enhancement) or “squeezing” closed the channel and restricting further ﬂow of cur-
rent (depletion).
Like BJTs, FETs have diﬀerent regions of operation. e regions are identiﬁed and char-
acterized through the FET terminal characteristics. Simple circuits are developed that use the
basic terminal characteristics of the various types of FETs in each region. Among the signiﬁcant
circuits analyzed include a FET constant current source, active resistive loads constructed with
FETs, a CMOS inverter, FET switches, and voltage variable resistors. SPICE modeling param-
eters for the various FETs and the eﬀect of those parameters on circuit design and analysis are
discussed.
²Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) enhancement mode JFETs exist. e GaAs enhancement JFETs operate in a similar manner to
other enhancement mode devices. GaAs JFETs are currently not widely used. Unless speciﬁcally stated, JFETs are always
thought of as being depletion mode devices in this text.

Junction Field-Eﬀect Transistors (JFETs) are either n-channel or p-channel devices. e terminal
voltage and current relationships of n-channel JFETs are developed in this section. e p-channel
JFET terminal voltage and current relationships are identical to that of the n-channel JFET with
the exception that the polarities of the voltages and currents are reversed. A brief description of
the p-channel JFET characteristics will be presented at the end of this section.
e circuit symbol for the n-channel JFET is shown in Figure 4.2a. e terminal connection
to the gate has an arrow whose direction indicates the channel type of device depicted. For n-
channel JFETs the arrow points to the source on the gate terminal. For p-channel JFETs, the
arrow points away from the source as shown in Figure 4.2b.

causing an increase in resistance. e result is a decrease in the slope of the characteristic curve.
With increasing VDS, when VGS is held constant, the channel resistance increases as evi-
denced by the leveling of ID. At pinch-oﬀ, the drain current, ID, remains almost constant due
to low conductivity through the channel. e resistance of the device in this region is very high.

of Figure 4.4, operation in saturation allows the drain current to be adjusted by a varying a control
voltage at the gate, in this case VGS, independent of VDS. Ampliﬁers designed using JFETs takes
advantage of the small voltage variations in VGS controlling the current ﬂow through the device.
JFETs can also be used as switches since large and abrupt changes in VGS causes the current ID
to change from zero to a relatively large value.
e JFET does not require signiﬁcant input gate current. erefore, the input character-
istic of the device provides limited and nearly useless information for circuit design. e transfer
characteristic shown in Figure 4.5 is far more useful. Since the gate channel diode in JFETs must
be reverse biased, only negative values of VGS allow for operation in the ohmic and saturation
regions.

4. FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS
From the transfer function, the current at VGS D 0 is deﬁned as IDSS. IDSS is the drain
current at VGS D 0 at pinch-oﬀ(VDS D  VPO). IDSS is temperature dependent and decreases with
increasing temperature.
e voltage and current relationships of n-channel JFETs can be described for the three
most common regions of operation: Ohmic, Saturation, and Cut-Oﬀ. For n-channel JFETs op-
erating in the ohmic or saturation regions, the following voltage and current conditions must
hold:
ID > 0
VPO < VGS  0
VDS > 0:
e n-channel JFETs have the following characteristic parameters:
VPO < 0
IDSS > 0:
In the negative quadrant, where ID < 0 and VDS < 0, the drain-gate junction becomes forward
biased causing the drain current to increase rapidly. e characteristics in this region are similar
to diode characteristics (except that ID < 0 and VDS < 0) with the turn-on voltage determined
by VGS.

METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD-EFFECT
TRANSISTORS
Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Eﬀect Transistors (MOSFETs) are widely used in integrated
circuits. Because MOS devices can be fabricated in very small geometries and are relatively simple
to manufacture, most Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits are fabricated from MOS
devices.
MOSFETs come in either of two types:
• Depletion type.
• Enhancement type.
Both types of MOSFETs are either n- or p-channel devices, commonly abbreviated NMOSFET
and PMOSFET, respectively. e depletion MOSFET can operate in either the depletion or
enhancement modes. e enhancement MOSFET operates in the enhancement mode only.
is section considers the depletion- and enhancement-type MOSFETs separately.
4.2.1
DEPLETION-TYPE MOSFET
In this section, the terminal voltage and current relationships of depletion-type n-channel MOS-
FETs (NMOSFETs) will be developed. e depletion-type p-channel MOSFET (PMOSFET)
terminal voltage and current relationships are identical to the NMOSFET with the exception
that the polarities of the voltages and currents are reversed. e depletion MOSFET regions
of operation are identical to those of the JFET. In fact, the V-I relationships of the depletion

4.2. METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS
239
MOSFET are identical in form to those of the JFET. Both types of transistors are depletion
mode devices; that is, with the application of the appropriate polarity potential between the gate
and the source (a negative potential for NMOSFETs), the carriers in the channel are depleted
which squeezes oﬀthe channel through which charge carriers ﬂow. erefore, the same types of
transistor parameters are used to describe the V-I characteristics of the depletion MOSFET as for
the JFET. e operational characteristics of the depletion MOSFET does diﬀer from the JFET
by one important attribute, the depletion MOSFET can additionally operate in the enhancement
mode by applying a positive gate-source potential, thus “enhancing” the channel through which
the charge carriers ﬂow.
e circuit symbol for the depletion NMOSFET is shown in Figure 4.9a. In addition to
the three FET terminals of gate, drain, and source, the symbol depicts a terminal representing
the substrate of the semiconductor (“B” for body) with an arrow pointing into the junction. It
is common for the substrate to be electrically connected to the source: this connection does not
aﬀect the characteristics of the MOSFET. However, in integrated circuits using NMOSFETs,
the substrate is commonly connected to the most negative supply voltage. With NMOSFETs
connected in this fashion it is guaranteed that the substrate is at signal ground. Unfortunately,
there is some possibility that circuit performance may be compromised.

with the standard voltage and current directions indicated. For NMOSFETs, the arrow points
toward the source from the junction. e direction of the arrow corresponds to the direction of
standard current ﬂow toward the source terminal.
As in the n-channel JFET the source current is equal to the negative of the drain current
when the gate-source junction is reverse biased,

e depletion type MOSFET operates similarly to the JFET. Like the JFET, the MOSFET gate
current is essentially zero,
IG D 0:
(4.17)
As in the JFET, the pinch-oﬀvoltage is the gate-to-source voltage that depletes or “squeezes oﬀ”
the drain-source channel. For NMOSFETs, VPO is negative and is transistor speciﬁc.
Unlike the n-channel JFET, the depletion type NMOSFET allows for enhancement mode
operation with the application of a positive VGS. Application of a positive gate-to-source potential
“opens up” the drain-source channel by increasing the channel conductivity, allowing more current
to ﬂow. Enhancement mode operation of the depletion type NMOSFET allows for drain currents
in excess of IDSS.
Typical depletion type NMOSFET drain characteristics are shown in Figure 4.11. e
transfer characteristic of the depletion NMOSFET is shown in Figure 4.12.
e depletion NMOSFET characteristic curves of Figures 4.11 and 4.12 are very similar
to those of the n-channel JFET curves of Figure 4.4 and 4.5. e equations describing the curves
for the depletion NMOSFET and the n-channel JFET are identical. As in the JFET, there are
three common regions of operation: the Ohmic, Saturation, and Cut-Oﬀregions.
For the depletion type NMOSFET operating in the depletion-mode ohmic or saturation
regions, the following voltage and current conditions must hold:
ID > 0
VPO < VGS  0
VDS > 0:
For the depletion type NMOSFET operating in the enhancement mode, VGS changes sign. e
voltage and current conditions become:
ID > 0
VGS > 0
VDS > 0:
Depletion type NMOSFETs have the following characteristic parameters:
VPO < 0
IDSS > 0:

ENHANCEMENT TYPE MOSFETS
e enhancement type MOSFET is commonly used in integrated circuit design because of its ease
of fabrication, small geometry, and low power dissipation. Without an applied voltage between the
gate source terminals, the drain-source channel is closed. With the application of a gate-to-source
potential, the channel becomes “enhanced” to conduct carriers. e enhancement type carrier
conduction mechanism can be thought of as the antithesis of that of the depletion MOSFET.
An n-type channel layer (for the enhancement NMOSFET) is formed to conduct carriers
from the drain to the source with the application of a positive VGS. A p-type channel layer con-
ducts carriers from the drain to the source with the application of a positive VSG (negative VGS)

4.2. METAL-OXIDE-SEMICONDUCTOR FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS
245
in enhancement PMOSFETs. e gate-to-source voltage that starts to form the drain-source
channel is called the threshold voltage, VT . When VGS is less than VT (in NMOSFETs), ID is
zero since the drain-source channel does not exist. e value of VT is dependent on the speciﬁc
MOSFET device and commonly ranges in value from 1 to 5 volts for enhancement NMOSFETs.
Since ID D 0 for VGS D 0, the quantity IDSS found in the depletion MOSFET and JFET is not
pertinent to the enhancement type MOSFET.
Unlike the depletion MOSFETs that operate in both enhancement and depletion modes,
enhancement MOSFETs can only operate in the enhancement mode.
4.2.4
ENHANCEMENT TYPE NMOSFET
e circuit symbol for the enhancement type NMOSFET is shown in Figure 4.15. e symbol

senting the junction area. As with the depletion type NMOSFET, the symbol depicts a terminal

e circuit symbol for the enhancement type PMOSFET is shown in Figure 4.19. e symbol is
similar to that of the enhancement NMOSFET with the exception of the direction of the arrow
on the body (substrate) terminal. As with the depletion type PMOSFET, the symbol depicts a
terminal representing the substrate with an arrow pointing into the junction.
A simpliﬁed circuit symbol for the enhancement type PMOSFET is shown in Figure 4.20
with the voltage and current sign conventions. e arrow on the circuit symbol points toward the
junction to the source. e direction of the arrow corresponds to the direction of the current ﬂow
relative to the source terminal.
All terminal voltages are of opposite polarity from that of the enhancement NMOSFET.
e polarity of the threshold voltage is opposite that of the enhancement NMOSFET. e en-

THE FET AS A CIRCUIT ELEMENT
Using the terminal behavior of JFETs and MOSFETs, simple circuits using FETs can be de-
veloped. FETs are used in circuits as constant current devices, active loads, and voltage variable
resistors, to name a few. MOSFETs are used extensively in digital circuits and have certain ad-

FET SPICE MODELS
When trying to convert the p-FET parameters discussed in this chapter to those used in SPICE
models, it rapidly becomes apparent that the correspondence between the two sets of parameters

is not clear. e correspondence between the SPICE parameter names and the FET parameter
names used in this book is accomplished with the equivalences presented in this section.

VA is the “early” voltag of the FET. e voltage VA is that voltage (VDS in the case of n-JFETs)
that is the point of intersection of the ID D 0 line and the extended line from the characteristic
curves in saturation. Figure 4.23 provides a pictorial deﬁnition of the Early voltage.

RDS is controlled by VGS.

FET INVERTER
e methods used to analyze FET circuits are similar to that used to solve BJT circuits in Chap-
ter 3. ree choices are available to analyze FET circuits. ey are:
• Use the set of FET equations in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 along with additional circuit-
dependent equations to obtain a numerical solution
• Use empirical V-I curves and obtain a graphical solution
• Use SPICE to obtain the solution⁴
As in BJT circuit analysis, the choice of technique used to analyze the circuit is strongly
dependent on the complexity of the FET circuit.

Consider an n-JFET inverter shown in Figure 4.27. e JFET characteristics are:

culated for additional values of the voltage at the gate of the JFET using DC sweep analysis. A
plot of the resultant output voltage as a function of the input gate-source voltage is shown in

for high value of the input (VGS  0 V) the output is low (VDS  0 V). e output forms a digital
inverse of the input. In the region between these two extremes the output is roughly a negative
multiple of the input: a circuit of this topology forms a small-signal inverting ampliﬁer. FET
ampliﬁers are explored in Chapter 5 (Book 2).

FET AS AN ACTIVE LOAD
In some applications, a FET active load to replace the passive resistor used as a load in an in-
verting FET ampliﬁer may be desirable. For instance in integrated circuit fabrication, passive
resistors consume large areas of the chip compared to transistors. Both enhancement and de-
pletion NMOSFET active loads are commonly used. However, the load-line characteristics are
quite diﬀerent between the two types of NMOSFETs.
An enhancement NMOSFET inverting ampliﬁer with an enhancement NMOSFET load
is shown in Figure 4.30. In this circuit, Q1 acts as the load and Q2 is the driver.

Complementary symmetry MOS (CMOS) circuits are fabricated with both enhancement
NMOSFETs and enhancement PMOSFETs on the same chip. e main advantage of CMOS
technology is the ability to design circuits with essentially zero DC power dissipation. Power is
dissipated only during switching transitions. e CMOS inverter is shown in Figure 4.34. In Fig-

REGIONS OF OPERATIONS IN FETS
FET operation has been seen to fall into three regions of useful operation. e regions are de-
scribed by the state of the drain-source channel controlled by the gate voltage. e three regions
of interest are shown in Figure 4.37. Brieﬂy, the three regions of operation are:

4.5. THE FET AS AN ANALOG SWITCH
265
1. e cut-oﬀregion is deﬁned as that region where the gate voltage disallows charge ﬂow in
the drain-source channel. e FET essentially looks like an open circuit. Applications for
this region are primarily in switching and digital logic circuits.
2. e ohmic region is deﬁned by a gradual increase in charge ﬂow in the drain-source channel,
the rate of which is controlled by the gate voltage. Applications for this region include the
use of FETs as voltage variable resistors.
3. e saturation region. is region is deﬁned by constant charge ﬂow in the drain-source
channel without regard to the drain-source voltage. e amount of constant current ﬂow
is regulated by the gate voltage. e region is commonly used for ampliﬁcation with the
modulation of the gate voltage and for constant current source applications.
In addition to these three regions, there is an additional region of severe consequences:
the breakdown region. FETs are not manufactured to withstand extended use in the breakdown
region and will exhibit catastrophic thermal runaway and destruction. To insure proper operation
of the devices, manufacturers’ speciﬁcations on maximum voltages must be heeded.
Due to the JFET fabrication process, the drain and source can, in most cases, be inter-
changed when the JFET is used as a circuit element without aﬀecting the desired operating char-
acteristics. is property (drain-source reciprocity) is not common to all types of FETs.
e characteristics of the FETs in the diﬀerent regions are shown in Table 4.2.

THE FET AS AN ANALOG SWITCH
Both Bipolar Junction and Field Eﬀect Transistors can be used as switches in a wide variety of
analog electronic applications. Each type provides a great advantage over mechanical switches
in both speed, reliability, and resistance to deterioration. FETs are the more common choice
due to the inherent symmetry of FETs and the undesirable oﬀset voltage (VCE at IC D 0) that

266
4. FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS
is present in BJTs. e oﬀset voltage of BJTs, typically on the order of a few millivolts, can
produce signiﬁcant errors in the transmission of low-level analog signals. Another advantage of
FET switches is the high gate input impedance and the consequent low load that the voltage
control port presents to control electronics.
Among the many possible electronic applications of solid-state analog switches are the
following:
• Sample-and-hold circuits
• switchable gain ampliﬁers
• switched-capacitor ﬁlters
• digital-to-analog conversion
• signal gating and squelch control
• chopper stabilization of ampliﬁers
In addition, multiple switches connected to share a common output form a multiplexer: a common
building block for analog and digital systems.
e basic function of a switch is to electrically isolate or connect two sections of a circuit.
In order to accomplish that functionality, an ideal analog switch has the following design goals:
• in the ON state, it passes signals without attenuation or distortion
• in the OFF state, signals are not passed.
• the transitions between the ON and OFF states are instantaneous.
In order to accomplish the above design goals, real switches have the more realistic speciﬁcations:
• very low ON resistance compared to other circuit resistances
• very high OFF resistance compared to other circuit resistances
• low leakage currents in the OFF state
• low capacitive and/or inductive eﬀects
FETs satisfy these speciﬁcations satisfactorily for many applications. Control signals ap-
plied to the gate-source port of a FET will vary the drain-source port between ON and OFF
switch positions. Reasonably low ON resistance combined with extremely high OFF resistance
make the FET ideal as a voltage controlled analog switch element. In Section 4.3.2 it was seen

Variation in the control signal, VGS, can change this resistance from a the range of a few ohms
to many Megohms. A simple application of an analog switch using a single FET is shown in
Figure 4.38. Such simple analog switches typically use enhancement mode FETs although it is
possible to form a switch with depletion mode FETs.⁶ In order to keep the switch in the OFF
state for all values of the input voltage, vs, the control voltage, vc, must be less than the minimum
input signal value plus the threshold voltage of the FET:

Equations (4.49) and (4.50) provide expressions for that absolute limits of ON and OFF control

beyond these absolute limits.

⁷Care must be takes so that the FET gate breakdown voltage is not exceeded when choosing control voltages. Typical gate
breakdown voltages are in excess of 25 V.

4.5. THE FET AS AN ANALOG SWITCH

Example 4.6
e FET Analog Switch of Figure 4.38 is used on the output of an OpAmp whose power sup-
plies are set at ˙15 VDC. ese voltages are chosen as the control voltages for the switch. If the
threshold voltage for the FET is 2 V, what range of output voltages will be properly controlled by
the switch?
Solution:
e minimum signal voltage is given by Equation (4.49):
vs.min/ > vc.OFF/   T;
or
vs.min/ >  15 V   2 V D  17 V:
But, for this case the signal voltage is limited by the output of the OpAmp to   15 V.
e maximum signal voltage is given by Equation (4.50):
vs.max/ < vc.ON/   VT ;
or
vs.max/ < 15 V   2 V D C13 V:
us, the absolute maximum signal range is limited range to:
 15 V < vs < C13 V:
Good design practice would place tighter limits the on the signal. ese limits are functions of
whatever additional design speciﬁcations may apply to the particular application of this switch.
One of the problems associated with the simple FET analog switch of Figure 4.38 is that the
ON resistance of the switch is not constant as the input signal varies. Variation in ON resistance
can be a serious limitation in some circuit applications as it can cause distortion of the analog
signal. Variation in the input signal will cause the voltage at the source of the FET to vary. If
the gate terminal of the FET is set at a speciﬁc control voltage level, the input signal variation
therefore produces a variation in VGS for the FET and consequently a variation in the drain-source
resistance of the switch. Determination of the switch resistance as a function of input signal level
requires the solution of two non-linear equations. For this particular circuit the equations reduce
to:

(4.51)
and

4. FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS
Computer simulation or the application of load line techniques are perhaps the two best methods
to calculate the variation of switch resistance with input. A typical graph⁸ of the switch resistance
as a function of input signal is given in Figure 4.39. Notice that while the switch resistance is fairly
small throughout most of the input signal range (24  < RDS < 100  as  15 V < vs < 6:6 V),
it increases dramatically as the level of the input signal approaches the positive control voltage.
is drastic increase in switch resistance can greatly diminish the utility of such a simple switch.
e OFF resistance of this switch is typically very high ( 20 M) and the OFF performance of
such a switch is limited only by a very small leakage current in the FET.

Figure 4.39: Switch resistance as a function of input signal.
A common approach to designing a better analog switch using FETs is shown in Fig-
ure 4.40. is switch is a parallel combination of a two switches: one constructed with an n-
channel FET, the other with a p-channel FET. e triangular symbol is an inverter: it reverses
the controlsignal levels so that the p-channel FET will operate with the n-channel FET.
It has been shown that the n-channel FET in this conﬁguration will have low ON resistance
for inputs signals near the negative limits. e p-channel FET will have low ON resistance for
inputs signals near the positive limits. Since the total ON resistance of this parallel switch is the
parallel combination of the two individual switch resistances, the switch has nearly constant ON
resistance throughout the range of possible input signals. is near-constant resistance property is
demonstrated in Figure 4.41.⁹ In this example, the switch has an ON resistance of approximately
22:2  throughout most of the possible range of input voltage:

When the input voltage level exceeds the constraint of Equation (4.53), the input resistance drops

suﬀers a signiﬁcant degradation when the limit of Equation (4.53) is exceeded: Input signals levels

Figure 4.41: Complementary switch resistance as a function of input signal.
FET analog switches have speciﬁc limitations that are usually described in the speciﬁcations
provided by the manufacturer. Among the most common of the limitations are:
• Analog Output Leakage Current—the algebraic sum of currents from the power supplies,
ground, input signal, and control signal through a OFF switch.

272
4. FIELD EFFECT TRANSISTOR CHARACTERISTICS
• Analog Voltage Range—the range of analog voltage amplitudes with respect to ground over
which the analog switch operates within the ON and OFF speciﬁcations.
• ON Resistance & ON Resistance Variation—the resistance of the switch over the analog
voltage range.
• Output Switching Times—the time it takes the switch to change states.
• Switch Current—the maximum amount of current that can be fed through the switch.
In addition to the MOSFET switches described here, n-channel JFETs are used for analog
switches. In order to maintain a depletion mode JFET switch in the ON state a rather compli-
cated electronic control circuit is necessary. is control circuitry is usually fabricated on the same
semiconductor chip as the switch and consists of both bipolar and JFET devices. ese switches
have a very constant ON resistance over the entire analog signal range. e disadvantage of these
switches is their relatively high cost.
4.6
BIASING THE FET
e selection of an appropriate quiescent operating point for a FET is determined by conditions
similar to those for a BJT. Here, the quiescent conditions are the zero-input DC values of the
FET drain current, ID, and the terminal voltage diﬀerences, VGS, and VDS. In this section, several
bias circuits for FETs are examined. While bias circuitry can be used to put the FET in any of
its regions of operation, the focus of this section is the saturation region. e saturation region is,
of course, signiﬁcant as the region where FET ampliﬁcation occurs. While the examples in this
section use n-channel FETs, p-channel FETs are biased in a similar manner except for a change
in polarity of the voltage supplies.
e emphasis in this section in on biasing using voltage supplies and resistors. It is also
common to bias transistors using current sources. Biasing FETs for ampliﬁer applications using
current sources is discussed extensively in Chapter 6 (Book 2).
4.6.1
THE SOURCE SELF-BIAS CIRCUIT
e Source self-bias circuit shown in Figure 4.42 is particularly useful in biasing JFETs and de-
pletion mode FETs of other types. In this application, the external gate resistor, Rg serves to tie
the voltage at the gate of the FET to ground (the gate current is essentially zero). is resistor
is typically chosen to be a very large value (often on the order of a few Megohms). For a spec-
iﬁed drain current, ID, the gate-source voltage, VGS, can be determined from the FET transfer
characteristic in either analytic or graphical form. Rs is then determined from VGS and ID:

One drawback of the source self-bias circuit is that the quiescent conditions are sensitive
to variation in the FET parameters VPO and IDSS. e restriction of Equation (4.54),
VGS D  IDRd;
coupled with the FET characteristic equations potentially leads to wide variation in quiescent
condition. is variation is best described graphically as in Figure 4.43. In the circuit of Exam-
ple 4.7, a FET with the following parameter variations is used.
8 mA < IDSS < 12 mA
  4 V < VPO <  3 V:
If the design procedure results of Example 4.7 are used, the resultant ranges in quiescent
conditions due to FET parameter variation can be read oﬀFigure 4.43. ey are:
 1:20 V < VGS <  0:85 V and 4:13 mA < ID < 5:87 mA:
e variation in FET parameters has caused a change in the two quiescent quantities of more
than ˙ 17% from the nominal quiescent conditions calculated in Example 4.7. In many cases
it is necessary to control the quiescent point to a greater degree than is possible with the source
self-bias circuit.
4.6.2
THE FIXED-BIAS CIRCUIT
In addition to sensitivity to FET parameter variation, the source self-bias circuit mandates overly
restrictive constraints on the external bias resistors in many application. As will be seen in Chap-
ter 5 (Book 2), the resistors, Rd and Rs, play important roles in determining ampliﬁer gain and

centered at the holding of the FET gate terminal at ground potential. Removing that restriction
greatly improves the versatility of a bias scheme. e Fixed-Bias circuit of Figure 4.44 is a simple
depletion-mode FET bias circuit that allows the gate to be at voltages other than ground.

Setting the FET gate voltage at values other than zero allows for a wider possible choice of source
and drain resistances to accomplish speciﬁc quiescent conditions. Design choices for these resis-
tors are based primarily on one or more of the following speciﬁc criteria:
• Ampliﬁcation speciﬁcations
• Output resistance speciﬁcations
• Quiescent point stability
e ﬁrst two of these design criteria will be discussed in Chapter 5 (Book 2): quiescent
point stability involves reducing the variation in drain current due to FET parameter variation.
e relationship of drain current to the external resistors in a ﬁxed-bias circuit is determined by
the voltage across the drain resistor:

where VG is given by Equation (4.55). e variation of ID due to variation of the FET parameter,
VGS, is inversely proportional to the value of the source resistor, Rs. While other design criteria
may put upper limits on Rs, quiescent point stability indicates that a large value for Rs is desirable.
e basic load line interpretation of this stability principle is described in Figure 4.45.

BIASING ENHANCEMENT MODE FETS
e ﬁxed-bias circuit presented in the preceding section is also useful in biasing enhancement
mode FETs. e only signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the procedure necessary to determining resistance
values to properly bias the FET is in the initial determination of the quiescent conditions. VGS
in enhancement FETs carries the opposite sign as for depletion FETs and a diﬀerent relation-
ship between VGS and ID exists. e proper expression for the FET gate-source voltage in the
saturation region is given by Equation (4.36):
ID D K .VGS   VT /2 :
Bias stability can be achieved by following the procedure outlined in Example 4.8.
e source self-bias circuit of Figure 4.42 is not useful for enhancement FETs. However,
several other possibilities for biasing of this type of FET exist. In addition to the ﬁxed-bias cir-
cuit of Figure 4.44, two other common bias circuits for enhancement-mode FETs are given in
Figure 4.46. Both circuits oﬀer some bias stabilization with the circuit of Figure 4.46b oﬀering
superior stability and ﬂexibility in resistor value choice. e connection in these two circuits be-
tween the gate and drain through resistor Rf provides a signal path between input and output
when the FET is used in ampliﬁer applications. is path provides advantages and disadvantages
that will be discussed in Chapter 8 (Book 2).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
e Field Eﬀect Transistor has been described in this chapter as a highly useful device with three
basic regions of operation: the saturation, ohmic, and cut-oﬀregions. Entrance into each of these
regions is controlled by two voltages: the gate-source voltage and the drain-source voltage.
e large-signal characterization of a FET is non-linear. While it can be modeled through
local linearization, these linear models are highly dependent on the point of linearization. ere-
fore, unlike the BJT, the FET cannot easily be described with a unique, simple linear model in

expressions for FET description.
Switching applications, including logic gate applications, are achieved with the FET in
transitioning between the cut-oﬀand ohmic region. Linear applications take place in the satura-
tion region. While a variety of applications have been examined in this chapter, the possibilities
for circuitry using FETs extend far beyond what has been shown here. Many additional FET lin-
ear applications and several non-linear applications will be examined in later chapters. Additional
restrictions placed on FET circuit design by frequency response limitations will be discussed in
Chapter 9 (Book 3).
Summary Design Example
In order to provide bi-directional current to a DC motor, the motor is connected to an “H-driver”
circuit. e basic topology of such a circuit contains four switches as shown below.

.PUPS
e H-driver switches operate in counteracting pairs: only one pair is closed at a time.
When the A-A’ pair is closed, current ﬂows through the motor from right to left (in the above
diagram): closing the B-B’ pair reverses the current ﬂow.
It is necessary to design a circuit to control a small DC motor bi-directionally. Control sig-
nals will be provided by standard CMOS logic levels (HIGH  5 V, LOW  0 V). e voltage
and current ratings for the motor are:
voltage—3 V to 15 V:
maximum current—300 mA:
Design an H-driver to provide proper power to the motor when control signals are applied.
Solution:
e switches in an H-driver can be either mechanical or solid state. Because of the small
currents being switched and the complexity necessary for control of mechanical switches, solid
state switching is a good choice for this design. FET switches are the preferred choice in most
solid state switching applications.
e best FET H-driver is essentially formed from two counteracting CMOS gates (with
appropriate, high-current FETs) and a buﬀer FET. e basic topology is shown below.

FET, QC, provides 0 V and CVCC to ensure accurate switching. e switching FETs must be
enhancement-mode FETs with a threshold voltage signiﬁcantly less than the minimum applied
voltage and with maximum current capability in excess of 300 mA. QC must also be a similar
enhancement-mode FET, but with smaller current capability. R should be small compared to the
input resistance of QA0 and QB, but large to avoid wasting power.
A summary of appropriate design choices is:
QA & QB— p-channel, enhancement MOSFETs, VT   1 V; ID.max/   0:5 A
QA0 & QB0— n-channel, enhancement MOSFETs, VT  1 V; ID.max/  0:5 A

It is common when switching loads that have a signiﬁcant inductive component (i.e., motors)
to shunt the output of a switch with a reverse biased diode (shaded in the diagram). is diode
provides a current path during the switching transition. For such a small motor, these diodes are
probably not necessary. Many switching FETs have diodes incorporated into their design.
