BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY AND
DECENTRALIZED TECHNOLOGIES
Blockchain technology serves as the foundational
element of decentralized technologies, offering
transparency, immutability, and security.
To 
secure 
involvement 
in 
decentralized
technologies, it's crucial to conduct thorough
code audits, implement encryption practices, and
maintain continuous monitoring.
Decentralized systems provide enhanced security
by distributing data across a network of nodes,
making 
it 
challenging 
for 
attackers 
to
compromise the entire system.
