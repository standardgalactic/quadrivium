Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed 
that the more people understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous they 
would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a 
philanthropic, nonpolitical educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic 
understanding. 
 
Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works to

themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the United States, it seeks to significantly 
improve education so that all young people have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based 
in Seattle, Washington, the foundation is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., 
under the direction of Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.

About Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e
Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e (2nd edition) covers the scope and sequence of most introductory
microeconomics courses. The text includes many current examples, which are handled in a politically equitable way.
The outcome is a balanced approach to the theory and application of economics concepts. The second edition has
been thoroughly revised to increase clarity, update data and current event impacts, and incorporate the feedback from
many reviewers and adopters.
Coverage and scope
To develop the first edition of Principles of Microeconomics, we acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor’s Principles of
Economics and solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher education, from community colleges
to PhD-granting universities. For the second edition, we received even more expansive and actionable feedback from
hundreds of adopters who had used the book for several academic terms. These knowledgeable instructors informed
the pedagogical courses, learning objective development and fulfillment, and the chapter arrangements. Faculty who

taught from the material provided critical and detailed commentary.
The result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the
course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance theory and application, as well as the
amount of calculation and mathematical examples.
The book is organized into five main parts:
What is Economics? The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on
making choices in a world of scarce resources.
Supply and Demand, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in
economics–supply, demand, and equilibrium–before showing applications in the markets for labor and
finance.
The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion
of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of
market structure, including some simple game theory.
Microeconomic Policy Issues, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro, framed
around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities. Students explore competition and
antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text
also covers information, risk and financial markets, and public economy.
International Economics, Chapters 19 and 20, introduces the international dimensions of economics,
including international trade and protectionism.
Alternate sequencing
Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it
can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential structure, which fits reasonably well
with the textbook content, is provided. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely
independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and
textual consistency.

of Microeconomics for AP® Courses , we received a wealth of constructive feedback. Many of the book’s users felt
that consequential movement in economic data, coupled with the impacts of national and global events, warranted a
full revision. We also took advantage of the opportunity to improve the writing and sequencing of the text, as well as
many of the calculation examples. The major changes are summarized below.
Augmented explanations in chapters one through four provide a more comprehensive and informative
foundation for the book.
A clearer explanation, using a numerical example, has been given for finding the utility maximizing
combination of goods and services a consumer should choose.
The labor markets chapter and the poverty and economic inequality chapter have been resequenced.
Case studies and examples have been revised and, in some cases, replaced to provide more relevant and useful
information for students.
Economic data, tables, and graphs, as well as discussion and analysis around that data, have been thoroughly
updated.
Wherever possible, data from the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) was included and referenced. In most
of these uses, links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the
information and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly.
Additional updates and revisions appear throughout the book. They reflect changes to economic realities and policies
regarding international trade, taxation, insurance, and other topics. For issues that may change in the months or years
following the textbook's publication, the authors often provided a more open-ended explanation, but we will update
the text annually to address further changes.
The revision of Principles of Microeconomics was undertaken by Steven Greenlaw (University of Mary Washington)
and David Shapiro (Pennsylvania State University), with significant input by lead reviewer Daniel MacDonald
(California State University, San Bernardino).
Pedagogical foundation
Throughout Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e, you will find features that engage the students in
economic inquiry and support the understanding required in the AP® course. Our features include:
Bring It Home. This feature presents a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter’s
main topic to the real world. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro
module) and the second at chapter’s end, when students have learned what’s necessary to understand the case
and “bring home” the chapter’s core concepts.
Work It Out. This feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and
guides them step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived.
Clear It Up. This feature addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are
usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question. The
rest of the feature explains the answer.
Link It Up. This feature offers a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students’
understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.
Questions for each level of learning
Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e offers four types of end-of-module questions for students.
Self-Checks. These analytical self-assessment questions appear at the end of each module. They push the
student to think beyond what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than
summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being
walked through the problem.
Review Questions. These are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (not
multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text.
Critical Thinking Questions. These higher-level, conceptual questions ask students to demonstrate their
understanding by applying what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for reasoning about the
Preface

concepts in a manner that will help prepare students for the AP® exam.
Problems. These exercises give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational
concepts in the module.
Updated art
Principles of Microeconomics for AP® Courses 2e includes an updated art program to better inform today’s student,
providing the latest data on covered topics.

Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age
To post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to
which route to take to class, to the more complex—“Should I double major and add possibly another semester
of study to my education?” Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at
any given moment. Economists call this “imperfect” because we rarely have all the data we need to make
perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day.
Now we have another avenue in which to gather information—social media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter
are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see, which
products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university without checking out its Facebook page or
Twitter stream first for information and feedback?
As you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information
disseminates through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. “Economists love
nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,” says
Jessica Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.
This leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing

information, and understanding behavior in markets —the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will
start with a discussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter’s end—to “bring
home” the concepts in play.
Introduction
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
•
Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
•
How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues
•
How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems
What is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After all, there are other disciplines you could
be studying, and other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home feature just mentioned, making
choices is at the heart of what economists study, and your decision to take this course is as much as economic decision
as anything else.
Economics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about
business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.
1.1 | What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Discuss the importance of studying economics
•
Explain the relationship between production and division of labor
•
Evaluate the significance of scarcity
Economics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual decisions,
family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a
fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources,
such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in
limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours
in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is
only a finite amount of resources available.
Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according
to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these are certainly large
numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we
produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why
scarcity is a problem.
Introduction to FRED
Data is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek
to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this course, we will generally
use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user friendly. It allows you to
display data in tables or charges, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for
other purposes. The FRED website (https://openstax.org/l/FRED/) includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic
and international variables over time, in the following broad categories:
•
Money, Banking & Finance
•
Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income Distribution)

If you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat? Does
everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there
are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as Figure 1.2 shows),
and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of
scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.
The Problem of Scarcity
Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do
you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy?
You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough income to buy
all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?

resources.

Every society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to
spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police
and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense
or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do everything. How do
we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can? There are
a couple of options. First, we could each produce everything we each consume. Alternatively, we could each produce
some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want. Let’s explore these options. Why do we
not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so
much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their
equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all—or any—of those things, but it is not because we could not learn.
Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is something called the division and specialization of labor, a production
innovation first put forth by Adam Smith (Figure 1.3) in his book, The Wealth of Nations.
Figure 1.3 Adam Smith Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks. (Credit: Wikimedia
Commons)
The Division of and Specialization of Labor
The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book The Wealth of
Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address
the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept of division of labor, which
means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform,
instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.
To illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire,
cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins
for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people performed—all for a pin, believe it
or not!
Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of serving
meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter
at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic
12

connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located.
A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have
hundreds of job classifications.
Figure 1.4 Division of Labor Workers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor. (Credit: Nina
Hale/Flickr Creative Commons)
Why the Division of Labor Increases Production
When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses can
produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might
make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three
of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each
specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire
good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.
First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where
they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People
have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages
may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical
degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is
easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North
Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning
business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize
in the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some
of which they are good at and some of which they are not.
Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This
pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and
doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest
innovative ways to do their work faster and better.
A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products
(sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.
Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods,
as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a
factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory
produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing
specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can
focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that
society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods
and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.

Trade and Markets
Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the
other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.
You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3
player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of
sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about
internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge
and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to
learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This
is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.
Why Study Economics?
Now that you have an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.
Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts to learn.
Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most importantly, economics
provides the tools to solve those puzzles. If the economics “bug” has not bitten you yet, there are other reasons why
you should study economics.
•
Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts
in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those
problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.
•
It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote
intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill
at the end of 2012 due to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues? Did you know?
•
A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about
economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s argument. When you hear
classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish
between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about
personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.
The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.
1.2 | Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe microeconomics
•
Describe macroeconomics
•
Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy
Economics is concerned with the well-being of all people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as
those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and
services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps
to develop workers’ skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in
a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at
the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production
and consumption.
It should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two parts:
Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and
businesses. Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of
production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels
of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary
perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of
studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics:
certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake.
Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem from top to bottom; what eats
what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches
are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics
and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.
Whether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other.
In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain,
while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and
animals live.
In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy.
For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, macroeconomy's
performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual households and businesses make.
Microeconomics
What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will
best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if
so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they
should borrow to spend beyond their current means?
What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines the prices a
firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it
will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the
microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the theory of the firm, how
markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work properly.
Macroeconomics
What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and
services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines
a nation’s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more
workers or to lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?
We can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in the standard
of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use government
macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank conducts monetary policy, which involves
policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United States, this is the Federal
Reserve. A nation's legislative body determines fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxes. For
the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are
the government's main tools. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we
encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the
macroeconomic chapters of this book.

Figure 1.5 John Maynard Keynes One of the most influential economists in modern times was John Maynard
Keynes. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)
John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that
economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (Figure 1.5) famously wrote in the
introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind,
a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words, economics teaches
you how to think, not what to think.
Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/Keynes) about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.
Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any
other discipline. They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on particular assumptions
about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist
might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose
of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables
the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while
complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation you are studying.
Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract
representation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation. We use models to test theories, but for
this course we will use the terms interchangeably.
For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a
tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build
models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still demonstrate
how the new product will work.
A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram (Figure 1.6). It pictures the economy as
consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in two markets: the goods and services market in
which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other
employees.
16

Figure 1.6 The Circular Flow Diagram The circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the
goods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and services
market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households provide labor
and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.
Firms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product market).
Arrow “A” indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to firms. Arrow “B”
indicates this. Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do households obtain the income
to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g. land, capital, raw materials) firms need
to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of production). Arrow “C” indicates this. In return,
firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of wages and other factor payments. Arrow “D” indicates
this. Arrows “C” and “D” represent the two sides of the factor market.
Of course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different
types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms
produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer circle shows this, and
represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households
demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries, and benefits.
The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms
demand.
This version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how
the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to
introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe
(imports and exports).
Economists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic
issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the
theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams, graphs, or even as
mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the
answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help
them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without
applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you
will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and macroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most
well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others.

1.4 | How To Organize Economies: An Overview of
Economic Systems
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies
•
Explain gross domestic product (GDP)
•
Assess the importance and effects of globalization
Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying
and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the
economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who
insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants?
Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are
produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done?
There are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is the traditional economy, which is the
oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their
economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are
farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you consume. Because tradition
drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development.
Figure 1.7 A Command Economy Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: Jay Bergesen/
Flickr Creative Commons)
Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down
from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building
pyramids, like those in Figure 1.7, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the
land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the
lord’s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.
In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it will
charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers. The
government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have
command economies.

Figure 1.8 A Market Economy Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/
Flickr Creative Commons)
Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a
very decentralized structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services,
who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.8) is a prime example of
a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market
economies are based on private enterprise: the private individuals or groups of private individuals own and operate
the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In
a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and businesses.) Supply of goods and services
depends on what the demands. A person’s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor)
into something that society values. The more society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady
Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces, not governments, determine economic decisions.
Most economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even traditional)
systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe
and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic
decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several decades have moved more in the
direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. The
Heritage Foundation provides information about how free and thus market-oriented different countries' are, as the
following Clear It Up feature discusses. For a similar ranking, but one that defines freedom more broadly, see the
Cato Foundation's Human Freedom Index (https://openstax.org/l/cato) .
What countries are considered economically free?
Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want?
Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish?
Are banks free to choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices?
Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal look at 50 different categories
of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of
economic freedom in each category.
The 2016 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world:
Table 1.1 lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Several additional countries were
not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These
countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, and Yemen.
The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful
for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom,
although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has
been a higher level of economic freedom around the world.

Regulations: The Rules of the Game
Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market.
Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented
have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these
laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal
contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate
using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The government heavily regulates decisions of what to
produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies (or black markets),
which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government’s approval.
The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market
or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and
government rules.

Figure 1.9 Globalization Cargo ships are one mode of transportation for shipping goods in the global economy.
(Credit: Raul Valdez/Flickr Creative Commons)
The Rise of Globalization
Recent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic
connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods,
services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.
Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship in
Figure 1.9, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications
have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many
valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer
software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These
products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally,
international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.
Table 1.2 presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was
exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World Bank. Exports are
the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad. Imports are the goods and services that one
produces abroad and then sells domestically. Gross domestic product (GDP) measures the size of total production in
an economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country’s total economic production
is sold in other countries.

Table 1.2 The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP)
(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)
In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly,
the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large
economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However,
smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take
full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy
is less affected by globalization than most other countries.
Table 1.2 indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also
experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make
all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet
covered with connections.
Despite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback against
globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty, and increased
economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great Britain to exit the European
Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.
Hopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read
the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It is
essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.
Decisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age
The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as
recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer’s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their
crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could
drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop
harvested.
Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is
distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online
adults use Facebook. This social media forum posts topics ranging from the National Basketball Association,
to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.
Information helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should
send to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the
media send ten reporters to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other
tasks. Information provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize
scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
1.1 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the
available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in
what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows
individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of
advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to
take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase
what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the
world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.
1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
Microeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic
perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks
at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation.
Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.
1.3 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues
Economists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are
economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for
determining the answer.
1.4 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems
We can organize societies as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last
few decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in commercial and financial networks that cross
national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly interdependent.

2 | Choice in a World of
Scarcity
Figure 2.1 Choices and Tradeoffs In general, the higher the degree, the higher the salary, so why aren’t more
people pursuing higher degrees? The short answer: choices and tradeoffs. (Credit: modification of work by “Jim, the
Photographer”/Flickr Creative Commons)
Choices ... To What Degree?
In 2015, the median income for workers who hold master's degrees varies from males to females. The
average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of
$153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time worker over 25 with no higher than a
bachelor’s degree: $1,224 weekly and $63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school
diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months. In other words, says the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a bachelor’s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned
if you had stopped your education after high school. A master’s degree yields a salary almost double that of a
high school diploma.
Given these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor’s
degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those
choices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the
analysis is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88% of the
population in the United States had a high school diploma, only 33.6% of 25–65 year olds had bachelor’s
degrees, and only 7.4% of 25–65 year olds in 2014 had earned a master’s.
This brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists
explain those choices.
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity

Introduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint
•
The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices
•
Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach
You will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve
tradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.
In 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” Economists chuckled, because they
had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898–1984), in his Essay on the
Nature and Significance of Economic Science in 1932, described not always getting what you want in this way:
The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose
between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we
must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity
of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.
Because people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences they
wish. Neither can society.
This chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing three
critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will consider whether
the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how we make choices and how we should make them.
2.1 | How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their
Budget Constraint
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Calculate and graph budget constraints
•
Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs
•
Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility
•
Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices
Consider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things
they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets
for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We
can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 2.2.
Figure 2.2 The Budget Constraint: Alphonso’s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier
Each point on the
budget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso’s budget
of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the
budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.
28
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

The vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso
spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.)
However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure shows the choice (zero
bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per
week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any
burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).
If we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the combination
of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget amount.
If Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That
is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point on (or
inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the
constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.
The budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.
Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso
for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how
many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? Since
bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more burger. That is the true cost to
Alphonso.
The Concept of Opportunity Cost
Economists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what one must give up to obtain what he or she desires. The
idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else.
In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is
the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on
whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people
must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to obtain other things they
desire more.
View this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/linestanding) for an example of opportunity cost—paying
someone else to wait in line for you.
A fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your
economics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on
video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry
anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.
The following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to
understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix The Use of Mathematics
in Principles of Economics.
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
29

Understanding Budget Constraints
Budget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics
in Principles of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not
your strength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.
Step 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:
Budget = P1  × Q1  + P2 × Q2
where P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and
Budget is the amount of income one has to spend.
Step 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:
Budget = P1 × Q1 + P2 × Q2
$10 budget
= $2 per burger × quantity of burgers + $0.50 per bus ticket × quantity of bus tickets
$10 = $2 × Qburgers  + $0.50 × Qbus tickets
Step 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:
y  = b + mx
For Alphonso, this is:
$10  = $2 × Qburgers  + $0.50 × Qbus tickets
Step 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
2 × 10  = 2 × 2 × Qburgers  + 2 × 0.5 × Qbus tickets  
20  = 4 × Qburgers  + 1 × Qbus tickets
Step 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:
20 – Qbus tickets = 4 × Qburgers
Divide each side by 4 to yield the answer:
5 – 0.25 × Qbus tickets = Qburgers
or
Qburgers = 5 – 0.25 × Qbus tickets
Step 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the
slope is –0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you
plug other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 2.1), which are the points
on Alphonso’s budget constraint.

Table 2.1
Step 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on
the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give
up 1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.
There are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that
the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price
of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on
the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide
the two prices.
Identifying Opportunity Cost
In many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300,
then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has forsaken. For practical purposes, there may be
no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought with that $300, but
sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can
loom especially large when costs of time are involved.
For example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team spirit.” The
out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as
room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat,
none of the employees are doing any other work.
Attending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of
attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition, during the hours
that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an
out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.
What is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport
security measures?
After the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air
travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel
inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be
roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for
terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security
equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition
software, could cost another $2 billion.
However, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the
opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of
Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service
passengers in 2015. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and
consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
31

an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an
opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business
people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-
of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5
hours × $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important
as costs that involve direct spending.
In some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch
every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the
opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your
lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what
that adds up to in a year—250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you
describe the opportunity cost as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,” you might make different choices.
Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility
The budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of
one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or
else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis, which means examining
the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People naturally compare costs and benefits,
but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice necessitates comparing how costs and
benefits change from one option to another. You might think of marginal analysis as “change analysis.” Marginal
analysis is used throughout economics.
We now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and
services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices, is subjective but that does not make
it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the
more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is
typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso
chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with
a great deal of utility—perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor’s appointment. However, later bus
rides might provide much less utility—they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that
Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso
has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of
the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a
common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a
person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In
other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.
The law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You
would not say, “My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.” Instead, even if you
get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from
those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll never
work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no
income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of
scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.
A rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility exceeds the
opportunity cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to Point C and further.
As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the opportunity cost, that is,
the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity cost will exceed the marginal utility
of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won’t purchase more bus tickets once the marginal utility just
equals the opportunity cost. While we can’t (yet) say exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number
is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.
Sunk Costs
In the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will
32
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past
choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs that were incurred in the
past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.
Consider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it
is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave?
The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena will not get a refund.
However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next
90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is to
forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of
current and future options.
For people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in
judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent
so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make
decisions based on what will happen in the future.
From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods
The budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After
all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods
is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the
tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many
different pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include
many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the
total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we
presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to
the real world.
2.2 | The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social
Choices
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs
•
Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier
•
Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier and the law of diminishing returns
•
Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency
•
Define comparative advantage
Just as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole cannot have
everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society faces, using a model
called the production possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than differences between individual
choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.
Because society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to
the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education.
The production possibilities frontier in Figure 2.3 illustrates this situation.
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
33

Figure 2.3 A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier
This production possibilities frontier
shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all resources
go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to education.
Figure 2.3 shows healthcare on the vertical axis and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate
all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources to produce
education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F. Alternatively, the society
could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the production possibilities frontier. In
effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso.
Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. However, it does not have enough
resources to produce outside the PPF.
Most importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education.
Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is
downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare.
That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity
cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to forgo. Just as with
Alphonso’s budget constraint, the slope of the production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now
you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up
feature.
What’s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?
There are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is
the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of
the two goods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change.
In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is
different at various points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the
axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this
imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many
resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available.
Whether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional
education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the
horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B
and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the “rise”) over the
horizontal distance (the “run”). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.

The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns
The budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quantities of
goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the relative prices of the two
goods in the consumption budget constraint determined the slope of the budget constraint. However, we drew the
production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different
shape?
To understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A,
all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and
even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending
school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education
exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy
is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in
health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain
in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at point A,
can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a
relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.
Now consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at
choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to point F, which
is devoting all spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in
the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must
become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into
kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the
opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a
large drop in health for only a small gain in education.
The lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at point A or
no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to
education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed
to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number
of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller
gains.
This pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name: the law of diminishing returns, which holds
that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional
increments will decline. (The law of diminishing marginal utility that we introduced in the last section is a more
specific case of the law of diminishing returns.) When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime,
for example, the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. However, additional increases typically
cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at
all would be tremendously expensive.
The curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we add more resources to education, moving from
left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the
PPF is relatively flat. By contrast, as we add more resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical
axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep. In
this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.
Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency
The study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production
possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a
mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices
are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage,
efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates
at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and
high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.
The production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative
efficiency. Figure 2.4 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
35

education.
Figure 2.4 Productive and Allocative Efficiency Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of
one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like
B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods
being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier—represents the allocation that
society most desires.
Productive efficiency means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of
one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure 2.4,
including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any
other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production
possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the
other good, or some combination of both goods.
For example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods:
education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1), and healthcare on the vertical
axis is also higher at point C than point R (H2 is great than H1).
We can show the particular mix of goods and services produced—that is, the specific combination of selected
healthcare and education along the production possibilities frontier—as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point
on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with
more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.
Allocative efficiency means that the particular combination of goods and services on the production possibility curve
that a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires
can be a controversial question, and is usually a discussion in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as
well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that
consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society
as a whole.
Why Society Must Choose
In Welcome to Economics! we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where limited resources
conflict with unlimited needs and wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in this
dilemma.
Every economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case,
a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and
producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of
none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy
grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able
to afford more of all goods.
36

However, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens
only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often
involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would
do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek
to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. However, for both the government
and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases
somewhere else in the economy.
The PPF and Comparative Advantage
While every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to produce
every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive
it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country’s PPF gives
us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its
slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the
y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different
climates, geography, technology, or skills.
Suppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane
and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat.
Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a
lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S.
has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two countries in
Figure 2.5.
Figure 2.5 Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil
The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF
implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the
opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has
comparative advantage in sugar cane.
When a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a
comparative advantage in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S.
has a comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production
points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing
at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a
much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity
in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the U.S. If the U.S. moved
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
37

from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of foregone
wheat production.
The slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not
constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore
the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on International Trade you will learn
that countries’ differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade.
When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which they have comparative
advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have comparative advantage. With trade,
manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both
trading parties.
2.3 | Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making
•
Interpret a tradeoff diagram
•
Contrast normative statements and positive statements
It is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable
applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits
the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let’s consider these
arguments in turn.
First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This
The economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and
more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a
budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members
of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy
ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly
curving production possibilities frontiers.
However, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions.
To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a
bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the
correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of
the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the
ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.
Someone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far
more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually has, so it must
be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur.” This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact
that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation,
does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.
Similarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of practice
with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does
not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but
in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices
that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the economic actions of groups
of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic
analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on Consumer Choices.
Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way
The economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is
an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people
38
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.
First, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually
exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative
statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false,
but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of opinion. We cannot test
them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based on one's values. For example,
an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs,
he concludes that the project is worthy—an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended
unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take
care of its less fortunate citizens—an example of normative analysis.
Even if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to
remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption
that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further
than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book,
The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently
some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him,
though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.” Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and
altruistic.
Second, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice and
freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom.
Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend considerable amounts of
money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to charity or spend it on their friends and
family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require much time, energy, and expertise but does not offer
high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that
does consume much of their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and
contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business.
People’s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.
Is a diagram by any other name the same?
When you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams. Your goal should be to
recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.
This chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The
consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same
basic diagram. Figure 2.6 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two
goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs,
and economic efficiency.
The first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget
constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As
depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one
good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine,
the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the
consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line
represents the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds
that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape,
tradeoffs remain.
The third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the
production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase
the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
39

choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the
quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an
individual’s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.
The basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some
examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic
output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and
investment. Do not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities
frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular
situation.
Figure 2.6 The Tradeoff Diagram
Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social
production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a
whole operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the
other.
Third, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a
living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer
goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, named this property the
invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:
Every individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much
he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his
own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value,
he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote
an end which was no part of his intention…By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of
the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.
The metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from
selfish individual actions.
Fourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own
narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your
employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other people when you
volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-
interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people
never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.

Choices ... To What Degree?
What have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue
that people do not obtain a bachelor’s or master’s degree because they do not have the resources to make
those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s
or a master’s degree may not be available in their opportunity set.
The price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps
room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a
bachelor’s or a master’s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff
of forfeiting years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.
Finally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices.
An economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow
money to attend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions
today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption,
so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption
until after they graduate college.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
2.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint
Economists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people’s desires exceed what is possible. As
a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must forgo something that they
desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to
consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of available choices.
The relative price of the choices determines the slope of the budget constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint
are not affordable.
Opportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange. Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in money,
but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that we must forfeit.
Most economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means
they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal
utility points out that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a specific good or another resource—the
42
Chapter 2 | Choice in a World of Scarcity
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered,
they should be disregarded in making current decisions.
2.2 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices
A production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and services
it can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight.
Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will
tend to shift the PPF outwards.
The law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing something,
the marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier
display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society’s resources to produce more of one good without
decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that reflects
the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ
by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total production
can increase if countries specialize in the goods in which they have comparative advantage and trade some of their
production for the remaining goods.
2.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach
The economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists make the
careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which
describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or
policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in
a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.

3 | Demand and Supply
Figure 3.1 Farmer’s Market Organic vegetables and fruits that are grown and sold within a specific geographical
region should, in theory, cost less than conventional produce because the transportation costs are less. That is not,
however, usually the case. (Credit: Modification of work by Natalie Maynor/Flickr Creative Commons)
Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?
Organic food is increasingly popular, not just in the United States, but worldwide. At one time, consumers had
to go to specialty stores or farmers' markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores.
In short, organic is part of the mainstream.
Ever wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost
$1.99 a pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.49 a pound? The same price relationship is true for
just about every organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take
less time to get to market and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming
down? Turns out those forces have quite a bit to do with this chapter’s topic: demand and supply.

Price Ceilings and Price Floors
An auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston wore. A collector spends a small fortune
for a few drawings by John Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their jaw drops because
they think these are high prices to pay for such goods or they think these are rare, desirable items and the amount paid
seems right.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/celebauction) to read a list of bizarre items that have been
purchased for their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an interesting facet of demand and supply.
When economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical
understanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with weekly:
that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.71 per gallon in June 2014?
Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $1.96 per gallon by January 2016? To explain these price movements,
economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and what gasoline sellers are willing
to accept.
As it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January of that
same year. Over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon more than
their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing to pay more for
gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during those six months, such as
increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.
This chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply—one of the most powerful models in all of
economics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the quantity
sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in prices and
quantities.
3.1 | Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for
Goods and Services
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand

supply interact in a market.

Demand for Goods and Services
Economists use the term demand to refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and able
to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants—if you have no need or want for
something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an
economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you
have no effective demand. By this definition, a homeless person probably has no effective demand for shelter.
What a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units that consumers
would purchase at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service almost always
decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity
demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to reduce their
consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation
trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of
demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which we explain in the next
module) are held constant.
We can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows the
quantity demanded at each price, such as Table 3.1, a demand schedule. In this case we measure price in dollars per
gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per
day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A demand curve shows the relationship
between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure 3.2, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price
per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent
variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)
Table 3.1 shows the demand schedule and the graph in Figure 3.2 shows the demand curve. These are two ways to
describe the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.

Figure 3.2 A Demand Curve for Gasoline The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded
decreases, and vice versa. We graph these points, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The
downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices
and quantity demanded.
Demand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they
may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left
to right. Demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and
conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.

Is demand the same as quantity demanded?
In economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about
demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices,
as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they
mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand
refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.
Supply of Goods and Services
When economists talk about supply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at
each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a good or service. A rise in price almost always
leads to an increase in the quantity supplied of that good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity
supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions:
expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants
for refining into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to
gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive
relationship between price and quantity supplied—that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower
price leads to a lower quantity supplied—the law of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that
affect supply (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.

Is supply the same as quantity supplied?
In economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they
mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship
that we can illustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied,
they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply
refers to the curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the curve.
Figure 3.3 illustrates the law of supply, again using the market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we can
illustrate supply using a table or a graph. A supply schedule is a table, like Table 3.2, that shows the quantity
supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and we measure
quantity supplied in millions of gallons. A supply curve is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price,
shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and the supply curve are
just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for
the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve.
Figure 3.3 A Supply Curve for Gasoline The supply schedule is the table that shows quantity supplied of gasoline
at each price. As price rises, quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply curve (S) is created by
graphing the points from the supply schedule and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve
illustrates the law of supply—that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.

The shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved. Nearly
all supply curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left to right and illustrate the law of supply:
as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases from 500 gallons to
720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.
Equilibrium—Where Demand and Supply Intersect
Because the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal
axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same graph. Together,
demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market.
Figure 3.4 illustrates the interaction of demand and supply in the market for gasoline. The demand curve (D) is
identical to Figure 3.2. The supply curve (S) is identical to Figure 3.3. Table 3.3 contains the same information in
tabular form.
Figure 3.4 Demand and Supply for Gasoline The demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S) intersect at the
equilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600. The equilibrium is the only price where quantity
demanded is equal to quantity supplied. At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds the
quantity demanded, so there is excess supply. At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded
exceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.

Table 3.3 Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied
Remember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point where the
supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in Figure 3.4, is called the equilibrium. The
equilibrium price is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree—that is, where
the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the amount producers want to sell
(quantity supplied). Economists call this common quantity the equilibrium quantity. At any other price, the quantity
demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.
In Figure 3.4, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million
gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by
looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.
The word “equilibrium” means “balance.” If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason
to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to move the
market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.
Imagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price—that is, instead of $1.40
per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in Figure 3.4 illustrates this
above equilibrium price. At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500. This decline in quantity
reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.
Moreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the higher
price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded
and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while
quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the
quantity demanded. We call this an excess supply or a surplus.
With a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This
accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making and
selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this situation, some
producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at all. Once
some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate
a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure
of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.
Now suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at this
price in Figure 3.4 shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take
longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to work, and
buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline producers’
incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550.
When the price is below equilibrium, there is excess demand, or a shortage—that is, at the given price the quantity
demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been
depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations
running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits
by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level. Read
Demand, Supply, and Efficiency for more discussion on the importance of the demand and supply model.

Services
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify factors that affect demand
•
Graph demand curves and demand shifts
•
Identify factors that affect supply
•
Graph supply curves and supply shifts
The previous module explored how price affects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result was the
demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences demand, nor is it the only
thing that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause
more consumers to avoid eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover several
new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or supply?
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/toothfish) to read a brief note on how marketing strategies can
influence supply and demand of products.
What Factors Affect Demand?
We defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price. That
suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based
on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it. Ability
to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation
than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new
car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can
affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children
a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.
These factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect
demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the ceteris paribus
assumption.
The Ceteris Paribus Assumption
A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal
axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant
economic factors, other than the product’s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus, a
Latin phrase meaning “other things being equal.” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus
assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two,
variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand
will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.
52
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

When does ceteris paribus apply?
We typically apply ceteris paribus when we observe how changes in price affect demand or supply, but we can
apply ceteris paribus more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just
price. For example, a consumer’s demand depends on income and a producer’s supply depends on the cost
of producing the product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing
at the same time—say price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a
time, assuming the other factors are held constant.
For example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming
income, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the
amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged).
This is what the ceteris paribus assumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor
separately, we can combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the
higher price and second because of the lower income.
How Does Income Affect Demand?
Let’s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. Figure 3.5 shows the initial demand
for automobiles as D0. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18
million. D0 also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For
example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17 million, at point R.
The original demand curve D0, like every demand curve, is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that no other
economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of
many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this graphically?
Return to Figure 3.5. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has now
increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve shifts to
the right to the new demand curve D1, indicating an increase in demand. Table 3.4 shows clearly that this increased
demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.
Figure 3.5 Shifts in Demand: A Car Example Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity
demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at
every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.

Table 3.4 Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example
Now, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their
incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every given price,
and the original demand curve D0 would shift left to D2. The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a decrease in
demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of $20,000 means 18
million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.
When a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes by the
same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not
buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as a whole.
In the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for most
goods and services. For some—luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry—the effect of a rise in income can
be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is called a normal good.
A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer generic brand groceries and
more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will be less
likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A product whose demand falls when income rises, and
vice versa, is called an inferior good. In other words, when income increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.
Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves
Income is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes and
preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations. A change
in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause
a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a decrease)
of the original demand curve. Let’s look at these factors.
Changing Tastes or Preferences
From 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85
pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per year, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which change the
quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken
and leftward for beef.
Changes in the Composition of the Population
The proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6% in
2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively
more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services like tricycles and
day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is projected to have by 2030,
has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of the population can affect the
demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand
curve.
Changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a product. A
54
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

substitute is a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic books, like this one,
become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price
for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers
has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of demand). Since people are purchasing tablets,
there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can show graphically as a leftward shift in the demand
curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect.
Other goods are complements for each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption of
one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and
pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon,
lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the quantity demanded of golf clubs falls
(because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher
price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price
for a complement has the reverse effect.
Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand
While it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future
price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if people
hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn
that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee
now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift in demand happens when a change
in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price. The following
Work It Out feature shows how this happens.
Shift in Demand
A shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it
was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.
Step 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P0). Identify the
corresponding Q0. See an example in Figure 3.6.
Figure 3.6 Demand Curve
We can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at
any given price.
Step 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less
pizza? The answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity
demanded, to the new point with the new Q1. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label
the new Q1. Figure 3.7 provides an example.
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
55

Figure 3.7 Demand Curve with Income Increase
With an increase in income, consumers will purchase
larger quantities, pushing demand to the right.
Step 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward
(or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as Figure
3.8 illustrates.
Figure 3.8 Demand Curve Shifted Right
With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger
quantities, pushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.
Summing Up Factors That Change Demand
Figure 3.9 summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether the
demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the price of the
good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good
or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity
demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.

to D1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.
When a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price
and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect
equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.
How Production Costs Affect Supply
A supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming ceteris paribus so that
no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the entire
supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a
shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.
In thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the difference
between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor, materials, and
machinery, or what we call inputs or factors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices
for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm’s profits go up. When a firm’s profits increase, it
is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn. When costs of production
fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price for its output. We can show this by the supply curve
shifting to the right.
Take, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that buying
gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver messages more
cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply more
of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater
area, and increase its supply.
Conversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for its
products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any given
price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.
Consider the supply for cars, shown by curve S0 in Figure 3.10. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the
quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, ceteris paribus, the quantity supplied
will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S0 curve shows. We can show the same information in table form, as in
Table 3.5.
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
57

Figure 3.10 Shifts in Supply: A Car Example Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity
supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every given
price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2.

Table 3.5 Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example
Now, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car
has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a lower
quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S0 to S1, which indicates that at any given
price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from 18
million on the original supply curve (S0) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S1, which is labeled as point L.
Conversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for selling cars,
car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply
to the right, from S0 to S2, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this example, at a price
of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 19.8 million on the
supply curve S2, which is labeled M.
Other Factors That Affect Supply
In the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost of
production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in weather or
other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.
Changes in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example, in
58

2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans,
experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means
that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply
curve to the right.
When a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift
to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on
breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat
and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds—and the harvest was twice as
high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that a
greater quantity will be produced at any given price.
Government policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies.
For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from
producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we discussed above. Other
examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money
to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with regulations increases costs.
A government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays a
firm directly or reduces the firm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm’s perspective, taxes or
regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower
quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given
price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how this shift happens.
Shift in Supply
We know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.
What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in
supply due to a production cost increase.
Step 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q0). If you draw a vertical line up from
Q0 to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. Figure 3.11 provides an example.
Figure 3.11 Supply Curve
You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to
produce a given quantity of output.
Step 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price
is composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost
of producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of
the pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm’s desired profit, which is
determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts
together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one
point on the firm’s supply curve, as Figure 3.12 illustrates.
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
59

Figure 3.12 Setting Prices
The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for
a product.
Step 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by
$0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75).
Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as Figure
3.13 shows.
Figure 3.13 Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing Price
Because the cost of production and the
desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the
product will also need to increase.
Step 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a
leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as Figure 3.14
illustrates.
Figure 3.14 Supply Curve Shifts
When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts
upwardly to a new price level.

Summing Up Factors That Change Supply
Changes in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all affect
the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given price.
Figure 3.15 summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price of
the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change in price of a good or service
typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific good or service,
it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift.
Figure 3.15 Factors That Shift Supply Curves (a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to
S1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.
Because demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the axes,
an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only four topics:
demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really “umbrella” concepts: demand covers
all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We include factors other than
price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve. In this way,
the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of economic
circumstances.
3.3 | Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The
Four-Step Process
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step process
•
Graph equilibrium price and quantity
•
Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand or supply curve
•
Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and quantity, based on real-world
examples
Let’s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in
income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an
event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that
affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question
using a four-step process.
Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model requires
four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve; the law of
supply, which gives us the slope of the supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply.
From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.
Step 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does the
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
61

event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?
Step 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch
the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease the amount
consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?
Step 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new
equilibrium price and quantity.
Let’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will
consider an example where both supply and demand shift.
Good Weather for Salmon Fishing
Supposed that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the
California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed.
Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the
ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing
season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions
affect the quantity and price of salmon? Figure 3.16 illustrates the four-step approach, which we explain below, to
work through this problem. Table 3.6 also provides the information to work the problem.

changes in the price and quantity of salmon.

Table 3.6 Salmon Fishing
Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather
conditions began. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per
pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at
the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)
Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that
affects supply.
Step 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that
increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original
supply curve S0 to the new supply curve S1, which Figure 3.16 and Table 3.6 show.
Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E1, the
equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to 550,000 salmon.
Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve did not move.
In short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a higher
equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.
Newspapers and the Internet
According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people,
are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or
tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of
Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected
consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? Figure 3.17 and the text below illustrates using
the four-step analysis to answer this question.
Figure 3.17 The Print News Market: A Four-Step Analysis A change in tastes from print news sources to digital
sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and
quantity.
Step 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand
curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis without
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
63

specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.
Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print,
radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.
Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower
quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other
traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1)
occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).
The decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since
then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they received their
news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades,
with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012. Television
news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this
suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not obtain their news from
television at all?
The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets
In the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for
cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices
(a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that
reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the
installation of costly pollution-control technology.
Moreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How
can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption. Look
at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the
analyses to see the net effect.
A Combined Example
The U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years
due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and other digital
message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about
the continued viability of the Postal Service? Figure 3.18 and the text below illustrate this using the four-step
analysis to answer this question.

Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply

Figure 3.18 Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis (a) Higher labor compensation
causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium
price. (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in
the equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.
Since this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher
compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from “snail mail” to
email and other digital messages.
Figure 3.18 (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.
Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before
this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships.
Step 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A change in
production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.
Step 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied
of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from S0 to S1.
Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1)
occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E0).
Figure 3.18 (b) shows the shift in demand in the following steps.
Step 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this
scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. Note that this diagram
is independent from the diagram in panel (a).
Step 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward digital
messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.
Step 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital
messages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve for postal
services to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.
Step 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E2)
occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).
The final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to
determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two
diagrams one on top of the other, as in Figure 3.19.
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
65

Figure 3.19 Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased Supply
Supply and demand shifts cause
changes in equilibrium price and quantity.
Following are the results:
Effect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of production
is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the
equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of
Postal Services (Q3). This is easy to see graphically, since Q3 is to the left of Q0.
Effect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal
Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a change in tastes
away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we
know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When both curves shift,
typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the
overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.
The next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a
curve.
What is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus
movements along a demand or supply curve?
One common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a
supply curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks
whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a
student in an introductory economics class, might reason:
“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the
original supply curve S0 to S1 on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium
quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply
the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S1 to S2, shows on the diagram (Shift 2),
so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so
causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D0 to D1 on the diagram (labeled
66
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E3.”
Figure 3.20 Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply Curve
A
shift in one curve never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement
along the second curve.
At about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be
wrong with Lee’s logic, and then read the answer that follows.
Answer: Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a
prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement
along the original demand curve (D0), from E0 to E1. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because it mixes up
shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price
never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S1 to S2. Instead, a price change leads
to a movement along a given supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve,
as suggested in the shift from D0 to D1. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand
curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to
shift.
Think carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is
effect? If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.
In the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to
the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight
to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities
set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, a subsequent
change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.
3.4 | Price Ceilings and Price Floors
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors
•
Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism
To this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no government
intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when government does
intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising “too high” or to prevent the price
of some good or service from falling “too low”.
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
67

Economists believe there are a small number of fundamental principles that explain how economic agents respond in
different situations. Two of these principles, which we have already introduced, are the laws of demand and supply.
Governments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can negate these economic principles. Rather, the
principles will become apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the intent of the government
policy. This is one of the major conclusions of this section.
Controversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for products
that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians, who
may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing “too high” or falling “too low.”
The demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives that these laws provide to
control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often achieve the
desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.
Price Ceilings
Laws that government enact to regulate prices are called price controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A price
ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the “ceiling”), while a price floor keeps a price from falling
below a given level (the “floor”). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The
next section discusses price floors.
A price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service. A government imposes price ceilings
in order to keep the price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in 2005 during Hurricane
Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for price controls on
bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high. In this particular case, the government did not impose a price
ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.
In many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters,
sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as Albany, renters have
pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by stating that landlords can raise
rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best examples of rent control occur in urban areas
such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.
Rent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to
live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based
businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can cause a change in the
demand for rental housing, as Figure 3.21 illustrates. The original equilibrium (E0) lies at the intersection of supply
curve S0 and demand curve D0, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000
units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental
housing to the right, as the data in Table 3.7 shows and the shift from D0 to D1 on the graph. In this market, at
the new equilibrium E1, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to
17,000 units.

Figure 3.21 A Price Ceiling Example—Rent Control The original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E0.
If demand shifts from D0 to D1, the new equilibrium would be at E1—unless a price ceiling prevents the price from
rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in
demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.

Table 3.7 Rent Control
Suppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500 for a
typical apartment. In Figure 3.21, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed maximum price set
by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there. At that
price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental
units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing.
One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer
apartments rented out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600
(17,000 rental units).
Price ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters)
lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing remains in the rental
market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting.
The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing—everything has an opportunity cost. Thus, if
renters obtain “cheaper” housing than the market requires, they tend to also end up with lower quality housing.
Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the market
price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and thus a shortage
occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling will benefit, but sellers
of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is also likely to
deteriorate.
Price Floors
A price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known example
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
69

of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time should be able to
afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2016 was $7.25 per hour, although some states and
localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual income for a single person of
$15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880. As the cost of living rises over time, the
Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage.
Price floors are sometimes called “price supports,” because they support a price by preventing it from falling below
a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports. Farm prices
and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are adequate, some years they
can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.
The most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product, adding
to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform
passed in 2013, the European Union (EU) will spend about 60 billion euros per year, or 67 billion dollars per year
(with the November 2016 exchange rate), or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for Europe’s farmers
from 2014 to 2020.
Figure 3.22 illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing
on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust so that the
quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0, with price P0 and quantity Q0.
However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market equilibrium
level—the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of
the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, a surplus exists.
Economists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, spend
roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the excess supply
(or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor, but taxpayers and
consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have offered numerous proposals
for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong.
This is either because the population views this as supporting the traditional rural way of life or because of industry's
lobbying power of the agro-business.
Figure 3.22 European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor Example
The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S)
would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from
falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is
excess supply, also called a surplus.

3.5 | Demand, Supply, and Efficiency
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus
•
Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient
•
Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism
The familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that
economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost
on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing
costs on others.
Efficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit
as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the
optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.
Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus
Consider a market for tablet computers, as Figure 3.23 shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium
quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the
equilibrium point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have
been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.
For example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who would
have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay
the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the demand curve
traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing
to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area labeled
F—that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.
Figure 3.23 Consumer and Producer Surplus The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of
consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers
were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been
willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer
surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers
were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms
would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.
The supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in Figure
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
71

3.23 illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers
who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price
of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product. The amount that a seller
is paid for a good minus the seller’s actual cost is called producer surplus. In Figure 3.23, producer surplus is the
area labeled G—that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.
The sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or total
surplus. In Figure 3.23 we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity
and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium.
In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing
producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.
Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings
The imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and
quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with creating
inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some producer surplus
to consumers.
Imagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is
left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in
Figure 3.24 (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the
government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms
in the market now produce only 15,000.
As a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The
loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss. In a
very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 3.24 (a), the deadweight loss is the area
U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case
because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to
make.
A second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After the
price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the
price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less
than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.

Figure 3.24 Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings
(a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of
20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in
the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new
producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and
producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a
result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.
Figure 3.24 (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The
current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus is G
+ H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of business,
reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a
result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer
surplus is H + I. In effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus, but
also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.
This analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to
consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that
farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains
why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers
and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and
quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy’s social surplus.
Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism
The demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the
interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or
demand determined a price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts
a piece of paper.” The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved.
The adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much
government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee
shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people—call them the coffee addicts—continue to drink coffee
and pay the higher price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how
to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in
which cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such
adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and rapidly that
we barely notice them.
Think for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh
corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and restaurants alter their
menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the U.S. economy and the world
Chapter 3 | Demand and Supply
73

economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the primary social mechanism for answering the
basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.
Why Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?
Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In
recent decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association
reported sales increased from $1 billion in 1990 to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales
of food products.
Why, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear
application of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of
chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and
preferences for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases
in income, which allow people to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream.
This has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and
we have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater
quantity.
In addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers
converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve.
Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods
is definitely higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in
demand. We may need more time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of
these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management
techniques are more expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.
As a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s “Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables,
which test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of
strawberries on the list has led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher
equilibrium price and quantity of sales.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
3.1 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services
A demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand curve
shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of demand states
that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.
A supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve shows
the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher price typically
leads to a higher quantity supplied.
The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The equilibrium
occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the equilibrium level, then
the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage will exist. If the price is above
the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. Excess supply or a surplus will
exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward the equilibrium level.
3.2 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services
Economists often use the ceteris paribus or “other things being equal” assumption: while examining the economic
impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis purposes. Factors that can shift the demand curve
for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price, include changes in tastes,
population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations about future conditions and prices.
Factors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be supplied at any given
price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in technology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.

3.3 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process
When using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price and
quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the market looked
like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide whether the effect on
supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand curve; (4) compare the
new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.
3.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors
Price ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price,
quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a
price from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied will
exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will result. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to
unintended consequences.
3.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency
Consumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences, and
the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are willing to sell
a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and
producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it will be at any other quantity and
price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity.

Baby Boomers Come of Age
The Census Bureau reports that as of 2013, 20% of the U.S. population was over 60 years old, which means
that almost 63 million people are reaching an age when they will need increased medical care.
The baby boomer population, the group born between 1946 and 1964, is comprised of approximately
74 million people who have just reached retirement age. As this population grows older, they will be
faced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer’s that may require
hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-
extending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care
Act, which expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, has further increase the demand, although
with the election of Donald J. Trump, this increase may not be sustained.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are expected to increase by 16% between
2014 and 2024. The median annual wage of $67,490 (in 2015) is also expected to increase. The BLS
forecasts that 439,000 new nurses will be in demand by 2022.
These data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will
face several challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen in the

labor market for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as we will discuss in the second half of this case
at the end of the chapter.
Introduction to Labor and Financial Markets
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets
•
Demand and Supply in Financial Markets
•
The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information
The theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even markets
for things we may not think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor markets are markets for
employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.
When we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture the demanders and
suppliers: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and suppliers in labor
and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and
other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial markets, any individual or firm who saves
contributes to the supply of money, and any who borrows (person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand
for money.
As a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for
most college students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 2013 40% of full-time college
students and 76% of part-time college students were employed. Most college students are also heavily involved in
financial markets, primarily as borrowers. Among full-time students, about half take out a loan to help finance their
education each year, and those loans average about $6,000 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses,
like purchasing a car. As this chapter will illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same
tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the goods markets.
4.1 | Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market
•
Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves of the labor market
•
Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a living wage
Markets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies in labor
markets this way: A higher salary or wage—that is, a higher price in the labor market—leads to a decrease in the
quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor
demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of
labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.
Equilibrium in the Labor Market
In 2015, about 35,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin
metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors’ offices, schools,
health clinics, and nursing homes. Figure 4.2 illustrates how demand and supply determine equilibrium in this labor
market. The demand and supply schedules in Table 4.1 list the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of nurses at
different salaries.

Figure 4.2 Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington The
demand curve (D) of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are
qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $70,000 and the
equilibrium quantity is 34,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied increases to
38,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 33,000. At this above-equilibrium salary,
an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $60,000, quantity supplied
declines to 27,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 40,000 nurses. At this below-
equilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.

Table 4.1 Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington
The horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example we measure labor by number of workers, but
another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The vertical axis shows
the price for nurses’ labor—that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this “price” would be total labor
compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as high as 30 percent) of labor
compensation. In this example we measure the price of labor by salary on an annual basis, although in other cases we
could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses
rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and nursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire,
or they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher
nurses’ salaries may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer
monitoring and diagnostic systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number
of nurses they need.
As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses’ salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington
are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people
will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full-
time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area.
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets
85

At equilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a
nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary
can find a job. In Figure 4.2, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The
equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary
is $70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by focusing on the “average” nurse. In reality, of
course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees
of experience and credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that differ in quality. For instance, even
a simple product like gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in
such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it
reflects what is happening in most of the submarkets.
When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium.
For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at $75,000 per
year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-
equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess supply in the labor market, with many
applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would
have. Nurses’ salary will move down toward equilibrium.
In contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a
shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only
27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the
shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have to match the higher
pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or work in Minneapolis-St.
Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.
Shifts in Labor Demand
The demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate,
under the ceteris paribus assumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded
of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of labor demanded
will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries decrease,
employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting
in a downward movement along the demand curve.
Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is based
on the demand for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles consumers demand,
the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a “derived
demand.” Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:
•
The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.
•
The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.
•
The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.
As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet
employers’ production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will
decrease, or shift to the left. Table 4.2 shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also
increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.

Results
Demand for
Output
When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and
profitability increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up
production.

Factors
Results
Education
and
Training
A well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that
labor by employers. Increased levels of productivity within the workforce will cause the
demand for labor to shift to the right. If the workforce is not well-trained or educated,
employers will not hire from within that labor pool, since they will need to spend a
significant amount of time and money training that workforce. Demand for such will
shift to the left.
Technology
Technology changes can act as either substitutes for or complements to labor. When
technology acts as a substitute, it replaces the need for the number of workers an
employer needs to hire. For example, word processing decreased the number of
typists needed in the workplace. This shifted the demand curve for typists left. An
increase in the availability of certain technologies may increase the demand for labor.
Technology that acts as a complement to labor will increase the demand for certain
types of labor, resulting in a rightward shift of the demand curve. For example, the
increased use of word processing and other software has increased the demand for
information technology professionals who can resolve software and hardware issues
related to a firm’s network. More and better technology will increase demand for
skilled workers who know how to use technology to enhance workplace productivity.
Those workers who do not adapt to changes in technology will experience a decrease
in demand.
Number of
Companies
An increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the
demand for labor resulting in a shift to the right. A decrease in the number of
companies producing a given product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a
shift to the left.
Government
Regulations
Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for
labor at any given wage. In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that
nurses be hired to carry out certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand
for nurses. Less-trained healthcare workers would be prohibited from carrying out
these procedures, and the demand for these workers will shift to the left.
Price and
Availability
of Other
Inputs
Labor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a salesperson at
a call center needs a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record
sales. If prices of other inputs fall, production will become more profitable and
suppliers will demand more labor to increase production. This will cause a rightward
shift in the demand curve for labor. The opposite is also true. Higher prices for other
inputs lower demand for labor.

Shifts in Labor Supply
The supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the quantity
supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff between supplying
labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The higher the wage, the more
labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities. Table 4.3 lists some of the factors that will cause the supply to
increase or decrease.
Factors
Results
Number of
Workers
An increased number of workers will cause the supply curve to shift to the right. An
increased number of workers can be due to several factors, such as immigration,
increasing population, an aging population, and changing demographics. Policies that
encourage immigration will increase the supply of labor, and vice versa. Population
grows when birth rates exceed death rates. This eventually increases supply of labor
when the former reach working age. An aging and therefore retiring population will
decrease the supply of labor. Another example of changing demographics is more
women working outside of the home, which increases the supply of labor.
Required
Education
The more required education, the lower the supply. There is a lower supply of PhD
mathematicians than of high school mathematics teachers; there is a lower supply of
cardiologists than of primary care physicians; and there is a lower supply of physicians
than of nurses.
Government
Policies
Government policies can also affect the supply of labor for jobs. Alternatively, the
government may support rules that set high qualifications for certain jobs: academic
training, certificates or licenses, or experience. When these qualifications are made
tougher, the number of qualified workers will decrease at any given wage. On the
other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even reduce the required
level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for nursing
schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to
the right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of
working versus not working also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment
benefits, maternity leave, child care benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child
care benefits may increase the labor supply of working mothers. Long term
unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed workers. All
these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor
supply effects.

A change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift those
curves. However, other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the demand or the supply of labor to
shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.
Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process
Economic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of
new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill
workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often
a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions.
However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the
technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a
wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers?
For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in
Demand and Supply) works in this way:
Step 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new
technologies? In Figure 4.3 (a) and Figure 4.3 (b), S0 is the original supply curve for labor and D0 is the original
demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E0, occurs at the price W0
and the quantity Q0.
Figure 4.3 Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply (a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the
left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the
demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.
Step 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from firms? The
technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.
Step 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the substitute for
low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D0 to D1. As the technology
complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the right, from D0 to D1.
Step 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E1 with price W1 and quantity Q1, has a lower wage
and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E0. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as point E1 with
price W1 and quantity Q1, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E0).
Thus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will raise the
pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s, the wage gap
widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 1980,
for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with comparable job experience,
but by 2014, a college graduate earned about 66% more than an otherwise comparable high school graduate. Many
economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy that improvements in

Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages
In contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent people
from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or stockholders, as an
example, propose limits on the high incomes of top business executives.
The labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to increase the
wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a minimum wage, a price floor that makes it illegal for an
employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $7.25
per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage, which they
call a living wage. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable
standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage
of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is $14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government
definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two
young children will find it more cost efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works for income.
Thus the family income would be $14,500, which is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of
four, which was $24,250 in 2015.)
Supporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they can
afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living wage law
in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage ordinances do not
apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that the city hires
be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.
Figure 4.4 illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is
no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market.
Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at
this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring
employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the
city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity
supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to
have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost
their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved. Table 4.4 shows the differences in supply and demand at
different wages.

of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.

Table 4.4 Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor
The Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor
The U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly below
it. About 1% of American workers are actually paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast majority of the U.S.
labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor. However, for
workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum
wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently below the market price for unskilled
labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and other low-skill workers without
any government prodding.
Economists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill
labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the hiring of
unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found
no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places—although these studies are
controversial.
Let’s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly below the equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate
according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In
this situation, the price floor minimum wage is nonbinding —that is, the price floor is not determining the market
outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity of
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets
91

employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the government increases
minimum wage by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes binding, there will be
only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.
These insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on
employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor
and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the
minimum wage increased dramatically—say, if it doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have
considered—then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. As of 2017,
many U.S. states are set to increase their minimum wage to $15 per hour. We will see what happens. The following
Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.
What’s the harm in raising the minimum wage?
Because of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either
in terms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let’s say for
the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers
by 2%. Does this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.
If 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the
minimum wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not
clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others.
For one thing, we need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum
wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their
job are high school students picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.
Another complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine
a minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of
unemployment in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when
working, but also ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces
how much employers want people to work. Overall, this worker’s income would rise because the 10% pay
raise would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.
Of course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either.
There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The Poverty and
Economic Inequality chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage
arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a
proposed economic policy affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the
policy is a good idea.

government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit.
Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.
In this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply financial capital
(i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or make financial
investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial
market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a more detailed treatment of the
different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the Financial Markets chapter.
Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?
In any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply
financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial capital by
receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms, depending on the
type of investment.
The simplest example of a rate of return is the interest rate. For example, when you supply money into a savings
account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of your deposits
is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the
money you borrow.
Let’s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2015, almost 200 million Americans were
cardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the borrowed amount plus
interest, although most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying interest. A typical
credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In May 2016, Americans had about $943 billion outstanding
in credit card debts. About half of U.S. families with credit cards report that they almost always pay the full balance
on time, but one-quarter of U.S. families with credit cards say that they “hardly ever” pay off the card in full. In fact,
in 2014, 56% of consumers carried an unpaid balance in the last 12 months. Let’s say that, on average, the annual
interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per year. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in
interest on their credit cards—plus basic fees for the credit card or fees for late payments.
Figure 4.5 illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the financial
market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis shows the rate
of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate. Table 4.5 shows the
quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity that credit card firms
(often banks) are willing to supply.

Figure 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards
In this market for credit card borrowing,
the demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at
equilibrium E. At the equilibrium, the interest rate (the “price” in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial
capital loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity
supplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would
increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium interest
rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial
capital supplied would decrease to $510 billion.

Table 4.5 Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards
The laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to the law of demand, a higher
rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises, consumers will
reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied.
Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards
and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit cards falls, the quantity of financial
capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will fall.
Equilibrium in Financial Markets
In the financial market for credit cards in Figure 4.5, the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at the
equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds demanded and
the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.
If the interest rate (remember, this measures the “price” in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then
an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the
quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to $480 billion. At this
94
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets

above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or
businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the interest rates (or other fees) they charge
to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the equilibrium level.
If the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an
interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion, but the quantity
credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will perceive that they
are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or fees. The
interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.
The FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit cards,
automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FRED website
(https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis) .
Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets
Those who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their savings
among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.
Participants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists
call this intertemporal decision making because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to
buy from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions across a period of time, sometimes a long
period.
Most workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the opposite
will be true once they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their income increases, they save
more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For example, there is
some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks after
retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has
shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the left.
By contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college
expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and become
employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks
financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and development project that will
not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and businesses have greater confidence that
they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any given interest rate will shift
to the right.
For example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that investments
in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted to the right.
Conversely, during the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any given interest rate
shifted to the left.
To this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types of
financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial capital will
have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of investments, but
risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers will shift their funds to
Investment B—and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left while the supply
curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.
The United States as a Global Borrower
In the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early
2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more in the
U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with one of the
macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets
95

The Effect of Growing U.S. Debt
Imagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less desirable place to put their money because
of fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in
supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium
price and quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?
Step 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario
in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy. Figure 4.6 shows a demand curve, D,
and a supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The
original equilibrium E0 occurs at interest rate R0 and quantity of financial investment Q0.
Figure 4.6 The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty
The graph
shows the demand for financial capital from and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by
the foreign sector before the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E0)
occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.
Step 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of
financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store
their money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S.
financial assets will be seen as more risky.
Step 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors’ for investing their money
in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left. Figure 4.7 shows the supply
curve shift from S0 to S1.
96

Figure 4.7 The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty
The
graph shows the demand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by
the foreign sector before and after the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original
equilibrium (E0) occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.
Step 4. Thus, foreign investors’ diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E1, which occurs at the
higher interest rate, R1, and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q1. In short, U.S. borrowers will have
to pay more interest on their borrowing.
The economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, by the third quarter of 2015, U.S. investors had accumulated $23.3 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign
investors owned a total of $30.6 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their money out of the U.S.
economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower quantity of financial investment
in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign financial investment could
impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in borrowing.
In a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between one
bank account and another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and supply as
markets for goods or labor.
Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws
As we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total tens of
billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest
rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including banks, oil companies,
phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to cover the losses created by
those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point out that
cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.
Consider the credit card market as Figure 4.8 illustrators. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the interest
rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and businesses.
Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific numbers, which would be
hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price
ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R0 that
would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal dashed line at interest rate Rc in Figure 4.8 shows
the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity
demanded of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q0 to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit
card debt will decrease from the original Q0 to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity
supplied. Consequently, a number of people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing
interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets
97

Figure 4.8 Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example
The original intersection of demand D and
supply S occurs at equilibrium E0. However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium interest
rate R0, and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity demanded,
Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also called a shortage.
Many states do have usury laws, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge. However,
in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is not allowed
to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is
set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high
enough to exceed the price ceiling.
4.3 | The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for
Information
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities
•
Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities
Prices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices
serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant to
the market—namely, the relationship between demand and supply—and then serving as messengers to convey that
information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or guiding intelligence
oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each consumer reacts
according to that person’s preferences and budget set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its
expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the demand and supply models.
Why are demand and supply curves important?
The demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model
that we introduced in the Choice in a World of Scarcity chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to
try to learn the arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be
divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply
in this chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples. It is a
98
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets

model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they
are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can
use it to analyze any market.
Figure 4.9 displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of
quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital.
The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or
the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.
The demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry
out such an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will
be supplied at each price—that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves—and how these
forces will combine to produce equilibrium.
We can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages,
and rates of return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand
curve to shift right or to shift left, or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to
analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these
four possibilities occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the
demand and supply curves. Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall
impact will depend on the degree of the shifts. When there are multiple variables, economists isolate each
change and analyze it independently.
Figure 4.9 Demand and Supply Curves
The figure displays a generic demand and supply curve. The
horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor
for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a
good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial
market. We can use the demand and supply curves explain how economic events will cause changes in
prices, wages, and rates of return.
An increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage; therefore, they may want to
economize on buying this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but the ticket
turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might
be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling
is high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price temporarily to see how
many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze
the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at the ticket price and
decide whether and when to fly.
In the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows
Chapter 4 | Labor and Financial Markets
99

oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand caused by a
new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a substitute grain, like
corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not need to know the details.
The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production as a
result.
The actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods,
labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to
other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different
markets together helps to explain why price controls can be so counterproductive. Price controls are government laws
that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: “Don’t
kill the messenger.” In ancient times, messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they
brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill
the bad news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring
news to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.
Those who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger—or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that
prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do nothing to affect
the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China’s “Great Leap
Forward” in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million
people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This was communist party leader Mao
Zedong's social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian economy to a socialist
society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. Changes in demand and supply will continue to reveal
themselves through consumers’ and producers’ behavior. Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls
will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this information, it becomes difficult for
everyone—buyers and sellers alike—to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur throughout the
economy.
Baby Boomers Come of Age
The theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the
demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as Figure 4.10 shows. The
impact of that increase will result in an average salary higher than the $67,490 earned in 2015 referenced
in the first part of this case. The new equilibrium (E1) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe1).Equilibrium
quantity will also increase from Qe0 to Qe1.

Figure 4.10 Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2014-2024 In 2014, the median salary for
nurses was $67,490. As demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D0 to D1)
and the equilibrium quantity of nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equilibrium salary increases from Pe0
to Pe1.
Suppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses
entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve in
Figure 4.11 captures the impact of a decreasing supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher
salaries for nurses, but the overall impact in the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative
shifts of supply and demand.
Figure 4.11 Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2014 and 2024 The increase in
demand for nurses shown in Figure 4.10 leads to both higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As
nurses retire from the work force, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in the supply curve
and higher salaries for nurses at Pe2. The net effect on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which
in this representation is less than Qe1, but more than the initial Qe0.

While we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we
know they will have higher salaries.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
4.1 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets
In the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the market
for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of financial capital
when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they borrow or receive
financial investments.
In the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can measure the price by the annual salary or hourly wage
received. We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number of workers or the number of hours worked.
Factors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product that the
labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in government policy
that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also increase or decrease (shift)
in response to: workers’ level of education and training, technology, the number of companies, and availability and
price of other inputs.
The main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative to
the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for the job, the
number of workers in the economy, and required education.
4.2 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets
In the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the “price” is the rate of return or the interest rate received.
We measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those who demand it.
Two factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their existing
levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other investments. Factors
that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence in the future—since financial
investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.
4.3 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information
The market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative scarcities
of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices have changed,
only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and demand. Price controls
hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation of resources.

labor?
27. During a discussion several years ago on building a
pipeline to Alaska to carry natural gas, the U.S. Senate
passed a bill stipulating that there should be a guaranteed
minimum price for the natural gas that would flow
through the pipeline. The thinking behind the bill was
that if private firms had a guaranteed price for their
natural gas, they would be more willing to drill for gas
and to pay to build the pipeline.

That Will Be How Much?
Imagine going to your favorite coffee shop and having the waiter inform you the pricing has changed. Instead
of $3 for a cup of coffee, you will now be charged $2 for coffee, $1 for creamer, and $1 for your choice of
sweetener. If you pay your usual $3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose between creamer and sweetener. If
you want both, you now face an extra charge of $1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the situation Netflix
customers found themselves in—they faced a 60% price hike to retain the same service in 2011.
In early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package consisting of streaming video and
DVD rentals. In July 2011, the company announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both
streaming video and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase of about 60%. In
2014, Netflix also raised its streaming video subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S.
customers. The company also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00 to $12.00 per month that
year.

How would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon Netflix? Would the ease of access to
other venues make a difference in how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? We will explore the
answers to those questions in this chapter, which focuses on the change in quantity with respect to a change
in price, a concept economists call elasticity.
Introduction to Elasticity
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply
•
Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity
•
Elasticity and Pricing
•
Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price
Anyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price will lead to a lower quantity demanded.
What you may not know is how much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of supply states that
a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The question is: How much higher? This chapter will explain
how to answer these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.
To find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is an economics concept
that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two items from a
second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce higher? Obviously,
the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.
Consider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a “sin tax,” a tax on something that is bad for you,
like alcohol. Governments tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. State taxes range from a low of 17 cents per
pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. The average state cigarette tax is $1.69 per pack. The 2014 federal
tax rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack, but in 2015 the Obama Administration proposed raising the federal tax
nearly a dollar to $1.95 per pack. The key question is: How much would cigarette purchases decline?
Taxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for government and to discourage cigarette consumption.
However, if a higher cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly reduced quantity of
cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack will not raise much revenue for the government. Alternatively,
a higher cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually raise more tax revenue for the
government. Thus, when a government agency tries to calculate the effects of altering its cigarette tax, it must analyze
how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes consumed. This issue reaches beyond governments and taxes.
Every firm faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising the sales price, it must consider how much a price
increase will reduce the quantity demanded of what it sells. Conversely, when a firm puts its products on sale, it must
expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a significantly higher quantity demanded.
5.1 | Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of
Supply
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Calculate the price elasticity of demand
•
Calculate the price elasticity of supply
Both the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or
supplied. Price elasticity is the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied
(Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. The price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the
quantity demanded of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The price elasticity of supply
is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

We can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. An elastic demand or
elastic supply is one in which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price.
Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to inelastic demand or
inelastic supply. Unitary elasticities indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply, as Table 5.1
summarizes.

Before we delve into the details of elasticity, enjoy this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Super_Bowl) on
elasticity and ticket prices at the Super Bowl.
To calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use the average percent change in both quantity
and price. This is called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following equations:
% change in quantity
=
Q2 – Q1
⎛
⎝Q2 + Q1
⎞
⎠/2 × 100
% change in price =
P2 – P1
⎛
⎝P2 + P1
⎞
⎠/2 × 100
The advantage of the Midpoint Method is that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points whether there
is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average quantity and average price)
for both cases.
Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand
Let’s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H as Figure 5.2 shows.
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
109

Figure 5.2 Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand We calculate the price elasticity of demand as the
percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.
First, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:
% change in quantity
=
3,000 – 2,800
(3,000 + 2,800)/2 × 100
=
200
2,900 × 100
= 6.9
% change in price =
60 – 70
(60 + 70)/2 × 100
=
–10
65  × 100
= –15.4
Price Elasticity of Demand =
    6.9%
–15.4%
= 0.45
Therefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is     6.9%
–15.4% which is 0.45, an amount smaller than one,
showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price elasticities of demand are always negative since price and
quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention, we always talk about
elasticities as positive numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result. We will ignore this detail
from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as positive numbers.
This means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded
will change by 0.45%. A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the quantity demanded. For
example, a 10% increase in the price will result in only a 4.5% decrease in quantity demanded. A 10% decrease in the
price will result in only a 4.5% increase in the quantity demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers
indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we read them as absolute values. The following Work It
Out feature will walk you through calculating the price elasticity of demand.

Finding the Price Elasticity of Demand
Calculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in Figure 5.2 for an increase in price from G to H. Has
the elasticity increased or decreased?
Step 1. We know that:
Price Elasticity of Demand =
% change in quantity
% change in price
Step 2. From the Midpoint Formula we know that:
% change in quantity
=
Q2 – Q1
⎛
⎝Q2 + Q1)/2 × 100
% change in price =
P2 – P1
⎛
⎝P2 + P1)/2 × 100
Step 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each equation:
% change in quantity
=
1,600 – 1,800
⎛
⎝1,600 + 1,800)/2 × 100
=
–200
1,700 × 100
= –11.76
% change in price =
130 – 120
(130 + 120)/2 × 100
=
10
125 × 100
= 8.0
Step 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity of demand:
Price Elasticity of Demand =
% change in quantity
% change in price
=
–11.76
8
= 1.47
Therefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in
absolute value) as we moved up along the demand curve from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between
these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H.
This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a straight-line demand curve.
Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply
Assume that an apartment rents for $650 per month and at that price the landlord rents 10,000 units are rented as
Figure 5.3 shows. When the price increases to $700 per month, the landlord supplies 13,000 units into the market.
By what percentage does apartment supply increase? What is the price sensitivity?
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
111

Figure 5.3 Price Elasticity of Supply We calculate the price elasticity of supply as the percentage change in
quantity divided by the percentage change in price.
Using the Midpoint Method,
% change in quantity
=
13,000 – 10,000
(13,000 + 10,000)/2 × 100
=
3,000
11,500 × 100
= 26.1
% change in price =
$700 – $650
⎛
⎝$700 + $650)/2 × 100
=
50
675 × 100
= 7.4
Price Elasticity of Supply =
26.1%
  7.4%
= 3.53
Again, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one
percentage change to another percentage change—nothing more—and we read it as an absolute value. In this case,
a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of supply means
that the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one percent price change. If you're starting to
wonder if the concept of slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.
Is the elasticity the slope?
It is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The
slope is the rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For
example, in Figure 5.2, at each point shown on the demand curve, price drops by $10 and the number of units
demanded increases by 200 compared to the point to its left. The slope is –10/200 along the entire demand
curve and does not change. The price elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points
A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H. Elasticity is the percentage change, which
is a different calculation from the slope and has a different meaning.
When we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and the quantity demanded is low, a
small change in the quantity demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change
112
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

in price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in percentage terms than it would have been at
the bottom of the demand curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change when the
quantity demanded is high will be small as a percentage.
Thus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over
a small percentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic.
Even with the same change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end
of the demand curve the quantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in
quantity demanded is smaller and the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom
of the curve we'd have a small numerator over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much
lower, or inelastic.
As we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go up or down, depending on which
way we are moving, so the percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit difference in quantity,
will change as well, which means the ratios of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.
5.2 | Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity
•
Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant unitary, infinite, or zero
There are two extreme cases of elasticity: when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case is that of
constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each case. Infinite elasticity or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme
case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite amount in response to any
change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the demand curve are horizontal as Figure 5.4 shows. While
perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most part unrealistic, goods with readily available inputs and whose
production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply curves. Examples include pizza, bread, books, and
pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example. However, luxury goods, items that take a large
share of individuals’ income, and goods with many substitutes are likely to have highly elastic demand curves.
Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and sports vehicles.
Figure 5.4 Infinite Elasticity The horizontal lines show that an infinite quantity will be demanded or supplied at a
specific price. This illustrates the cases of a perfectly (or infinitely) elastic demand curve and supply curve. The
quantity supplied or demanded is extremely responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to
infinite when prices reach P.
Zero elasticity or perfect inelasticity, as Figure 5.5 depicts, refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change
in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme
example, goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves. Examples include
diamond rings or housing in prime locations such as apartments facing Central Park in New York City. Similarly,
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
113

while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities with no close substitutes are likely to have highly
inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and gasoline.
Figure 5.5 Zero Elasticity The vertical supply curve and vertical demand curve show that there will be zero
percentage change in quantity (a) demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.
Constant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent results in
a quantity change of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity. Constant unitary
elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change
of one percent. Figure 5.6 shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity. Using the midpoint method, you can
calculate that between points A and B on the demand curve, the price changes by 28.6% and quantity demanded
also changes by 28.6%. Hence, the elasticity equals 1. Between points B and C, price again changes by 28.6% as
does quantity, while between points C and D the corresponding percentage changes are 22.2% for both price and
quantity. In each case, then, the percentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity, and consequently
elasticity equals 1. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not
identical. Instead, the price falls by $2.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $1.50 from B to C, and by a still smaller
amount of $0.90 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a steeper slope
on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and a curved shape overall. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in
price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical. Instead, the price falls by $23 from A to B, by a smaller
amount of $1.50 from B to C, and by a still smaller amount of $.90 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with
constant unitary elasticity has a steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right—and a curved shape overall.
Figure 5.6 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand Curve A demand curve with constant unitary elasticity will be a
curved line. Notice how price and quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between each pair
of points on the demand curve.
Unlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with unitary elasticity is represented by a straight
114
Chapter 5 | Elasticity

line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points on the supply curve there is an equal difference in
quantity of 30. However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps are decreasing as one moves from
left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each percentage calculation are getting
increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in the elasticity calculation of the percentage change in quantity.
Consider the price changes moving up the supply curve in Figure 5.7. From points D to E to F and to G on the supply
curve, each step of $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the price changes in percentage
change terms, using the midpoint method, they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the
original price points in each percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger in value, increasing the denominator
in the calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant unitary elasticity supply curve, the percentage
quantity increases on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage price increases on the vertical axis—so this
supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity at all points.
Figure 5.7 A Constant Unitary Elasticity Supply Curve A constant unitary elasticity supply curve is a straight line
reaching up from the origin. Between each pair of points, the percentage increase in quantity supplied is the same as
the percentage increase in price.
5.3 | Elasticity and Pricing
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue
•
Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply
•
Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity affect equilibrium
•
Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the incidence of a tax on buyers and
sellers
Studying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing being most important. Let’s explore how elasticity
relates to revenue and pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let’s look at the elasticities of some common goods
and services.
Table 5.2 shows a selection of demand elasticities for different goods and services drawn from a variety of different
studies by economists, listed in order of increasing elasticity.

Note that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is inelastic, while items that are not necessities such
as restaurant meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal increases by 10%, the quantity demanded
will decrease by 22.7%. A 10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a slight decrease of 1.2% in the
quantity of housing demanded.

Does Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?
Imagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with 15,000 seats. To keep this example simple, assume
that the band keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for its appearance,
but that these costs, like travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how many people are in the
audience. Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if ticket prices are more
expensive for some seats than for others, but the calculations become more complicated.) The band knows that it
faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the ticket price and, it will sell fewer seats. How
should the band set the ticket price to generate the most total revenue, which in this example, because costs are fixed,
will also mean the highest profits for the band? Should the band sell more tickets at a lower price or fewer tickets at a
higher price?
The key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue is
price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which will
result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are in Table 5.3. If demand is elastic at that
price level, then the band should cut the price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an even larger
percentage increase in the quantity sold—thus raising total revenue. However, if demand is inelastic at that original
quantity level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a certain percentage increase in price will result in
a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity sold—and total revenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at
that quantity, then an equal percentage change in quantity will offset a moderate percentage change in the price—so
the band will earn the same revenue whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket price.
If
Demand
Is . . .
Then . . .
Therefore . . .
Elastic
% change in Qd > % change in P
A given % rise in P will be more than offset by a larger
% fall in Q so that total revenue (P × Q) falls.
Unitary
% change in Qd = % change in P
A given % rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal %
fall in Q so that total revenue (P × Q) is unchanged.
Inelastic
% change in Qd < % change in P
A given % rise in P will cause a smaller % fall in Q so
that total revenue (P × Q) rises.
Table 5.3 Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Prices?
What if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000 seats
in the available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to move to a bigger arena, so that
it could slash ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets sold. However, if the
15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to costs, then this option may not
work.
Conversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical followings, that demand for tickets may be inelastic
right up to the point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the ticket price. Ironically,
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
117

some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the arena is not full—but
those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes choose to sell tickets for
less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that fans will feel happier and spend
more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.
Can Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?
Most businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their goal
of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may
rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a key input, but they have no control over the world
market price for crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no control over the world market
price of coffee. If the cost of a key input rises, can the firm pass those higher costs along to consumers in the form of
higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of producing are invented, can the firm keep the benefits
in the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to pass the gains along to consumers in the form of
lower prices? The price elasticity of demand plays a key role in answering these questions.
Imagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological
breakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce aspirin more
cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you? Figure 5.8 illustrates two possibilities. In Figure 5.8 (a), the
demand curve is highly inelastic. In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right, from S0
to S1, so that the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1, creates a substantially lower price for the product with relatively
little impact on the quantity sold. In Figure 5.8 (b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this case, the technological
breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in the market at very close to the original price. Consumers benefit
more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift in the supply results in a much lower
price for consumers.
Figure 5.8 Passing along Cost Savings to Consumers Cost-saving gains cause supply to shift out to the right
from S0 to S1; that is, at any given price, firms will be willing to supply a greater quantity. If demand is inelastic, as in
(a), the result of this cost-saving technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as
in (b), the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower
price, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).
Aspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation in Figure 5.8, with extremely inelastic
demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity changes little. As a
result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn from aspirin sales. However,
if strong competition exists between aspirin producer, each producer may have little choice but to search for and
implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After all, if one firm decides not to implement
such a cost-saving technology, other firms that do can drive them out of business.
Since demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation in Figure 5.8 (a). That is, a surge in
118
Chapter 5 | Elasticity

production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease the total revenue that farmers receive. Conversely,
poor weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can sharply raise prices so that the total
revenue that the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses how these issues relate to coffee.
How do coffee prices fluctuate?
Coffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia,
and Ethiopia. In these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their main
source of income. These families are exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces
up and down. For example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was
four times as high, at $2 per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back
up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it had fallen back to 46 cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about $2.31 per
pound. By the end of 2012, the price had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound.
The reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The
elasticity of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of
about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee
supply shifted to the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when
Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out
to the right. With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically. Figure 5.8 (a) illustrates this
situation.
Elasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive substances, for
which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to consumers. For example, the
demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted. Economic research
suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults
smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes,
the result will be, as in Figure 5.9 (a), that the supply curve shifts from S0 to S1. However, as the equilibrium moves
from E0 to E1, governments mainly pass along these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher
taxes on cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.
If the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic demand
back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For example,
anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if cigarette demand were
more elastic, as in Figure 5.9 (b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S0 to S1 and equilibrium from E0
to E1 would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth smoking seems to be more elastic than adult
smoking—that is, the quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater percentage than the quantity of adult smoking
in response to a given percentage increase in price.
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
119

Figure 5.9 Passing along Higher Costs to Consumers Higher costs, like a higher tax on cigarette companies for
the example we gave in the text, lead supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b). However, in (a),
where demand is inelastic, companies largely can pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher
prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results
primarily in a lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers suffer in either case, but in (a), they suffer from paying a higher
price for the same quantity, while in (b), they suffer from buying a lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift
their consumption elsewhere).
Elasticity and Tax Incidence
The example of cigarette taxes demonstrated that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at reducing the
equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they mainly pass along to consumers in the form of higher prices. The analysis,
or manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and producers is called tax incidence. Typically, the
tax incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good. However, if one wants to
predict which group will bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is examine the elasticity of demand and supply.
In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the most inelastic side of the market.
If demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax burden, and if supply is more inelastic than
demand, sellers bear most of the tax burden.
The intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price changes,
and the quantity demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the case of smoking, the demand
is inelastic because consumers are addicted to the product. The government can then pass the tax burden along to
consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the equilibrium quantity.
Similarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example, beachfront
hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not greatly affect the
equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic and sellers had the
possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax burden on the sellers would
be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of lower prices received. Figure 5.10
illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence and elasticity of demand and supply.

Figure 5.10 Elasticity and Tax Incidence An excise tax introduces a wedge between the price paid by consumers
(Pc) and the price received by producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the amount of the tax per
unit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the
tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is lower than the tax incidence on producers Pe – Pp. (b) When the supply is
more elastic than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc – Pe is larger than the tax incidence on producers Pe
– Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the tax revenue.
In Figure 5.10 (a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels.
While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can’t easily move their businesses. By introducing a
tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price received by
producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to
the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new market price is Pc, but
sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can view a tax as raising the
costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, where the new supply curve
would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity, Figure 5.10 omits the shift in the supply curve.
The tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total quantity
sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and the initial
equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial equilibrium price
Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In Figure 5.10 (a), the tax burden falls disproportionately
on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the resulting lower price received
by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers. Figure 5.10 (b) describes the example of the
tobacco excise tax where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax incidence now falls disproportionately on
consumers, as shown by the large difference between the price they pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe.
Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this difference is much smaller than the change in consumers’
price. From this analysis one can also predict whether a tax is likely to create a large revenue or not. The more elastic
the demand curve, the more likely that consumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more
elastic the supply curve, the more likely that sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a
market where both the demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.
Some believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries they target. For example, the medical device excise
tax, in effect since 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry profitability and therefore hamper start-
ups and medical innovation. However, whether the tax burden falls mostly on the medical device industry or on the
patients depends simply on the elasticity of demand and supply.
Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact
Elasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On the demand side of the market, it can sometimes
be difficult to change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy is a clear example. In
the short run, it is not easy for a person to make substantial changes in energy consumption. Maybe you can carpool
to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of energy rises, but that is about all.
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
121

However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the gallon, choose a job that is closer to
where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more insulation in your home. As a result, the
elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run, but much more elastic in the long run.
Figure 5.11 is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price changes. In
1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17 million barrels per
day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut off
oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with the U.S. support
for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975—a policy that we can interpret as a shift
of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market. Figure 5.11 (a) and Figure 5.11 (b) show the same
original equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve to the left from S0 to S1.
Figure 5.11 How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or Quantity
The intersection (E0) between demand curve D
and supply curve S0 is the same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S0 to S1 is identical in both (a)
and (b). The new equilibrium (E1) has a higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E0) in both (a)
and (b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is different in (a) and (b), being more elastic in (b) than in (a). As
a result, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only slightly smaller
quantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a
relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more elastic demand.
Figure 5.11 (a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United States
in 1973. In Figure 5.11 (a), the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double the price
before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day. Figure 5.11 (b) shows what the
outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a result more likely over the long term.
This alternative equilibrium (E1) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14 per barrel and larger reduction
in equilibrium quantity to 13 million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S. petroleum consumption was 15.3
million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum consumption was down even though the
U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in 1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity
was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts, and after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient
cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had
become more elastic.
On the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically find it easier to expand production in the
long term of several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short run it can be costly or
difficult to build a new factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a few years, all of these
are possible.
In most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but
quantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply and
demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively greater
122
Chapter 5 | Elasticity

change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run, the long-run movements in
prices are more muted, while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.
5.4 | Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand
•
Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the
elasticity of labor supply and the elasticity of savings
•
Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations
The basic idea of elasticity—how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another
variable—does not just apply to the responsiveness quantity supplied and quantity demanded to changes in the price
of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the prices of related
goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as the cost of production,
as well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of quantity supplied and quantity demanded, not just
the price.
Income Elasticity of Demand
The income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in
income.
Income elasticity of demand =
% change in quantity demanded
% change in income
For most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income will cause
an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that we refer to these goods as normal goods.
However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good. For example, those
with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more steak instead, or those with a higher
income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is negative, we
call the good an inferior good.
We introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods in Demand and Supply. A higher level of income causes
a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive.
How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income elasticity means a larger
shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is negative, a higher level of
income would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how much it shifts depends on how
large the (negative) income elasticity is.
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
A change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are
complements, like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the quantity
demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets, then a
drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce consumption of the other
good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.
The cross-price elasticity of demand puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term “cross-price” refers to
the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically, the cross-price
elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a result of a percentage
change in the price of good B.
Cross-price elasticity of demand =
% change in Qd of good A
% change in price of good B
Substitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee and
tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods have negative cross-
price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price for B will mean a
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
123

lower quantity consumed of A.
Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets
The concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market, for
example, the wage elasticity of labor supply—that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by the
percentage change in wages—will reflect the shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:
Elasticity of labor supply =
% change in quantity of labor supplied
% change in wage
The wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage change
in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the wage elasticity of
labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up or down by a certain
percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years are willing to supply changes but by
a lesser percentage amount.
In markets for financial capital, the elasticity of savings—that is, the percentage change in the quantity of savings
divided by the percentage change in interest rates—will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital.
That is:
Elasticity of savings
=
% change in quantity of financial s vings
% change in interest rate
Sometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on
savings is higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on increasing the quantity saved if the supply
curve for financial capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the return to savings will cause a
higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for financial capital is highly
inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small increase in the quantity of savings.
The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at least in the short run, the elasticity of
savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.
Expanding the Concept of Elasticity
The elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example, imagine
that you are studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing tax returns. We
can frame the question in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax enforcement;
that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a given percentage change in spending on tax
enforcement?
With all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are in Table 5.4, the possibility of
confusion arises. When you hear the phrases “elasticity of demand” or “elasticity of supply,” they refer to the elasticity
with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because economists are discussing a wide variety
of elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand elasticity the price elasticity of demand or the
“elasticity of demand with respect to price.” Similarly, economists sometimes use the term elasticity of supply or
the supply elasticity, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or “the elasticity of supply
with respect to price.” However, in whatever context, the idea of elasticity always refers to percentage change in
one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage change in another variable,
typically a quantity variable of some kind.
Income elasticity of demand =
% change in Qd
% change in income
Cross-price elasticity of demand =
% change in Qd of good A
% change in price of good B

How did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.
Before the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000
infuriated U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to
23.79 million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the
United States. This was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase—an average per
quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix
experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.
During the first year after the price increase, the firm’s stock price (a measure of future expectations for the
firm) fell from about $33.60 per share per share to just under $7.80. By the end of 2016, however, the stock
price was at $123 per share. Today, Netflix has more than 86 million subscribers million subscribers in fifty
countries.
What happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials
reported, when announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing
subscribers. Using the elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic
response:
=
–600,000/[(24 million + 24.6 million)/2]
$6/[($10 + $16)/2]
=
–600,000/24.3 million
$6/$13
=
–0.025
0.46
= –0.05
In addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new
customers. Netflix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true
this was slower growth than the firm had experienced—about 2 million per quarter.
Why was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more than two decades since Netflix had been
founded, there was an increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had
choices ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in
Maclean’s that Redbox kiosks are “a five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems
that many people still find a five-minute drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.” It seems that
in 2012, many consumers still preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.
What missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing
Chapter 5 | Elasticity
125

to account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also misjudged customers’ preferences and tastes.
Yet, as the population increases, the preference for streaming video may overtake physical DVD disks. Netflix,
the source of numerous late night talk show laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
5.1 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply
Price elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its price.
We compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage change in
price. We can describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit elastic, or inelastic (not very responsive). Elastic
demand or supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied respond to price changes in a greater than
proportional manner. An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given percentage change in price will cause
a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied. A unitary elasticity means that a given percentage
change in price leads to an equal percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied.
5.2 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity
Infinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded or supplied changes by
an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero elasticity refers to the extreme case in which a
percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. Constant unitary elasticity in either
a supply or demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one
percent.
5.3 Elasticity and Pricing
In the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and quantity demanded are often relatively slow to react to
changes in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the long run. As a result, demand and supply often
(but not always) tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively elastic in the long run. A tax incidence
depends on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more elastic than demand, buyers bear
most of the tax burden, and when demand is more elastic than supply, producers bear most of the cost of the tax. Tax
revenue is larger the more inelastic the demand and supply are.
5.4 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price
Elasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to the change of one variable divided by the
percentage change of a related variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance, the income
elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good divided by the
percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial capital markets just as
it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the percentage change in the quantity
of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The elasticity of savings with respect to interest rates
is the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates.

"Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe"—Making Choices
The 2008–2009 Great Recession touched families around the globe. In too many countries, workers found
themselves out of a job. In developed countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but
families still saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough spending decisions. Of
course, non-essential, discretionary spending was the first to go.
Even so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase in spending world-wide during
that time—an 18% uptick in the United States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating
more meals at home, increasing grocery store spending; however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer
Expenditure Survey, which tracks U.S. food spending over time, showed “real total food spending by U.S.
households declined five percent between 2006 and 2009.” So, it was not groceries. What product would
people around the world demand more of during tough economic times, and more importantly, why? (Find out
at chapter’s end.)
That question leads us to this chapter’s topic—analyzing how consumers make choices. For most consumers,
using “eeny, meeny, miney, moe” is not how they make decisions. Their decision-making processes have been
educated far beyond a children’s rhyme.

How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices

How Consumer Choices Might Not Always be Rational
Microeconomics seeks to understand the behavior of individual economic agents such as individuals and businesses.
Economists believe that we can analyze individuals’ decisions, such as what goods and services to buy, as choices we
make within certain budget constraints. Generally, consumers are trying to get the most for their limited budget. In
economic terms they are trying to maximize total utility, or satisfaction, given their budget constraint.
Everyone has their own personal tastes and preferences. The French say: Chacun à son goût, or “Each to his own
taste.” An old Latin saying states, De gustibus non est disputandum or “There’s no disputing about taste.” If people
base their decisions on their own tastes and personal preferences, however, then how can economists hope to analyze
the choices consumers make?
An economic explanation for why people make different choices begins with accepting the proverbial wisdom that
tastes are a matter of personal preference. However, economists also believe that the choices people make are
influenced by their incomes, by the prices of goods and services they consume, and by factors like where they live.
This chapter introduces the economic theory of how consumers make choices about what goods and services to buy
with their limited income.
The analysis in this chapter will build on the budget constraint that we introduced in the Choice in a World of
Scarcity chapter. This chapter will also illustrate how economic theory provides a tool to systematically look at the
full range of possible consumption choices to predict how consumption responds to changes in prices or incomes.
After reading this chapter, consult the appendix Indifference Curves to learn more about representing utility and
choice through indifference curves.

Information on the consumption choices of Americans is available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey carried
out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Table 6.1 shows spending patterns for the average U.S. household. The
first row shows income and, after taxes and personal savings are subtracted, it shows that, in 2015, the average U.S.
household spent $48,109 on consumption. The table then breaks down consumption into various categories. The
average U.S. household spent roughly one-third of its consumption on shelter and other housing expenses, another
one-third on food and vehicle expenses, and the rest on a variety of items, as shown. These patterns will vary for
specific households by differing levels of family income, by geography, and by preferences.

Total Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility
To understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at what consumers can afford, as shown in
a budget constraint (or budget line), and the total utility or satisfaction derived from those choices. In a budget
constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good on the vertical
axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are affordable given consumer
income. Consider José's situation, shown in Figure 6.2. José likes to collect T-shirts and watch movies.
In Figure 6.2 we show the quantity of T-shirts on the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on the
vertical axis. If José had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit. However, José,
like all of us, faces a budget constraint. José has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is $14 and the price
of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight movies and zero T-shirts
($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where José spends of all of his money on T-shirts
and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/run or –8/4=–2. The specific choices along
the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable T-shirts and movies.
Figure 6.2 A Choice between Consumption Goods José has income of $56. Movies cost $7 and T-shirts cost
$14. The points on the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable movies and T-shirts.
José wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest utility, which is the term economists
use to describe a person’s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices.
Let’s begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail later, that José can measure his own utility with
something called utils. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils of individuals.
If one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean than the first person
gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much. The reason why
is that utils are subjective to an individual. The way one person measures utils is not the same as the way someone
else does.) Table 6.2 shows how José’s utility is connected with his T-shirt or movie consumption. The first column
of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second column shows the total utility, or total amount of
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
135

satisfaction, that José receives from consuming that number of T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility,
in this example, is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third
column shows marginal utility, which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This
equation for marginal utility is:
MU =
change in total utility
change in quantity
Notice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent unit of
a good consumed provides less additional utility. For example, the first T-shirt José picks is his favorite and it gives
him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and
yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law of diminishing marginal utility, which holds that the
additional utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is another example of the more general
law of diminishing returns we learned earlier in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity.
The rest of Table 6.2 shows the quantity of movies that José attends, and his total and marginal utility from seeing
each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies that José watches rises.
Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in utility than the
previous one. The first movie José attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus provides him with the highest
level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time. Notice that total utility is also the sum of
the marginal utilities. Read the next Work It Out feature for instructions on how to calculate total utility.

Calculating Total Utility
Let’s look at how José makes his decision in more detail.
Step 1. Observe that, at point Q (for example), José consumes three T-shirts and two movies.
Step 2. Look at Table 6.2. You can see from the fourth row/second column that three T-shirts are worth 63
utils. Similarly, the second row/fifth column shows that two movies are worth 31 utils.
Step 3. From this information, you can calculate that point Q has a total utility of 94 (63 + 31).
Step 4. You can repeat the same calculations for each point on Table 6.3, in which the total utility numbers
are shown in the last column.
For José, the highest total utility for all possible combinations of goods occurs at point S, with a total utility of 103
from consuming one T-shirt and six movies.
Choosing with Marginal Utility
Most people approach their utility-maximizing combination of choices in a step-by-step way. This approach is based
on looking at the tradeoffs, measured in terms of marginal utility, of consuming less of one good and more of another.
For example, say that José starts off thinking about spending all his money on T-shirts and choosing point P, which
corresponds to four T-shirts and no movies, as Figure 6.2 illustrates. José chooses this starting point randomly as
he has to start somewhere. Then he considers giving up the last T-shirt, the one that provides him the least marginal
utility, and using the money he saves to buy two movies instead. Table 6.4 tracks the step-by-step series of decisions
José needs to make (Key: T-shirts are $14, movies are $7, and income is $56). The following Work It Out feature
explains how marginal utility can effect decision making.

Table 6.4 A Step-by-Step Approach to Maximizing Utility
Decision Making by Comparing Marginal Utility
José could use the following thought process (if he thought in utils) to make his decision regarding how many
T-shirts and movies to purchase:
Step 1. From Table 6.2, José can see that the marginal utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If José gives up the
fourth T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils.
Step 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up $14 (the price of a T-shirt), allowing José to buy the first
two movies (at $7 each).
Step 3. José knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16 and the marginal utility of the second movie
is 15. Thus, if José moves from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but gains 31 utils
(from the movies).
Step 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This is just another way of saying that the total
utility at Q (94 according to the last column in Table 6.3) is 13 more than the total utility at P (81).
Step 5. Thus, for José, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in order to buy two movies.
José clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step process of decision making with marginal utilities.
José thinks about giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20, in exchange for purchasing
two more movies that promise a combined marginal utility of 27. José prefers point R to point Q. What if José thinks
about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt means a marginal utility loss of 21, and the marginal
utility gain from the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility gain of 23, so José prefers point
S to R.
However, if José seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that the loss of marginal utility from giving up the
first T-shirt is 22, while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total of 19. If José were to choose
point T, his utility would fall to 100. Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, José again concludes
that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that will provide him with the highest level of total utility. This
step-by-step approach will reach the same conclusion regardless of José’s starting point.
We can develop a more systematic way of using this approach by focusing on satisfaction per dollar. If an item costing
$5 yields 10 utils, then it’s worth 2 utils per dollar spent. Marginal utility per dollar is the amount of additional
utility José receives divided by the product's price. Table 6.5 shows the marginal utility per dollar for José's T shirts
and movies.
marginal utility per dollar =
marginal utility
price
If José wants to maximize the utility he gets from his limited budget, he will always purchase the item with the
greatest marginal utility per dollar of expenditure (assuming he can afford it with his remaining budget). José starts
with no purchases. If he purchases a T-shirt, the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 1.6. If he purchases a movie,
the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 2.3. Therefore, José’s first purchase will be the movie. Why? Because
it gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar and is affordable. Next, José will purchase another movie. Why?
138
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

Because the marginal utility of the next movie (2.14) is greater than the marginal utility of the next T-shirt (1.6). Note
that when José has no T- shirts, the next one is the first one. José will continue to purchase the next good with the
highest marginal utility per dollar until he exhausts his budget. He will continue purchasing movies because they give
him a greater "bang for the buck" until the sixth movie which gives the same marginal utility per dollar as the first
T-shirt purchase. José has just enough budget to purchase both. So in total, José will purchase six movies and one
T-shirt.

Table 6.5 Marginal Utility per Dollar
A Rule for Maximizing Utility
This process of decision making suggests a rule to follow when maximizing utility. Since the price of T-shirts is twice
as high as the price of movies, to maximize utility the last T-shirt that José chose needs to provide exactly twice the
marginal utility (MU) of the last movie. If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility of the last
movie, then the T-shirt is providing less “bang for the buck” (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent) than José would
receive from spending the same money on movies. If this is so, José should trade the T-shirt for more movies to
increase his total utility.
If the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing more
“bang for the buck” or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As a result, José should
buy more T-shirts. Notice that at José’s optimal choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first T-shirt, of 22 is
exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11. At this choice, the marginal utility per dollar is the
same for both goods. This is a tell-tale signal that José has found the point with highest total utility.
We can write this argument as a general rule: If you always choose the item with the greatest marginal utility per
dollar spent, when your budget is exhausted, the utility maximizing choice should occur where the marginal utility
per dollar spent is the same for both goods.

The following Work It Out feature provides step by step guidance for this concept of utility-maximizing choices.
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
139

Maximizing Utility
The general rule, MU1
P1
=
MU2
P2
, means that the last dollar spent on each good provides exactly the same
marginal utility. This is the case at point S. So:
Step 1. If we traded a dollar more of movies for a dollar more of T-shirts, the marginal utility gained from T-
shirts would exactly offset the marginal utility lost from fewer movies. In other words, the net gain would be
zero.
Step 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot trade a dollar’s worth of movies. The
best we can do is trade two movies for another T-shirt, since in this example T-shirts cost twice what a movie
does.
Step 3. If we trade two movies for one T-shirt, we would end up at point R (two T-shirts and four movies).
Step 4. Choice 4 in Table 6.4 shows that if we move to point R, we would gain 21 utils from one more T-shirt,
but lose 23 utils from two fewer movies, so we would end up with less total utility at point R.
In short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice, which is called the consumer equilibrium.
There is another equivalent way to think about this. We can also express the general rule as the ratio of the prices of
the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities. When we divide the price of good 1 by the price
of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility
of good 2.

P2
=
MU1
MU2
Along the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains the same, so the ratio of the prices does not
change. However, the marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed. At the optimal choice
of one T-shirt and six movies, point S, the ratio of marginal utility to price for T-shirts (22:14) matches the ratio of
marginal utility to price for movies (of 11:7).
Measuring Utility with Numbers
This discussion of utility began with an assumption that it is possible to place numerical values on utility, an
assumption that may seem questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the hardware store,
but what store sells an “utilimometer” for measuring utility? While measuring utility with numbers is a convenient
assumption to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that an outside party can measure utility but only that
individuals can decide which of two alternatives they prefer.
To understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of finding the choice with highest total utility by
comparing the marginal utility you gain and lose from different choices along the budget constraint. As José compares
each choice along his budget constraint to the previous choice, what matters is not the specific numbers that he places
on his utility—or whether he uses any numbers at all—but only that he personally can identify which choices he
prefers.
In this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of utility resembles rather closely how many people
make consumption decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest. We think about what things cost. We
think about buying a little more of one item and giving up a little of something else. We choose what provides us
with the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the points along a budget constraint and total and
marginal utility is just a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and specific manner. It is welcome
news that specific utility numbers are not central to the argument, since a good utilimometer is hard to find. Do not
worry—while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next module, we will have transformed our analysis into
something we can measure—demand.

6.2 | How Changes in Income and Prices Affect
Consumption Choices
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain how income, prices, and preferences affect consumer choices
•
Contrast the substitution effect and the income effect
•
Utilize concepts of demand to analyze consumer choices
•
Apply utility-maximizing choices to governments and businesses
Just as we can use utility and marginal utility to discuss making consumer choices along a budget constraint, we can
also use these ideas to think about how consumer choices change when the budget constraint shifts in response to
changes in income or price. Because we can use the budget constraint framework to analyze how quantities demanded
change because of price movements, the budget constraint model can illustrate the underlying logic behind demand
curves.
How Changes in Income Affect Consumer Choices
Let’s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices. Figure 6.3
shows a budget constraint that represents Kimberly’s choice between concert tickets at $50 each and getting away
overnight to a bed-and-breakfast for $200 per night. Kimberly has $1,000 per year to spend between these two
choices. After thinking about her total utility and marginal utility and applying the decision rule that the ratio of
the marginal utilities to the prices should be equal between the two products, Kimberly chooses point M, with eight
concerts and three overnight getaways as her utility-maximizing choice.
Figure 6.3 How a Change in Income Affects Consumption Choices
The utility-maximizing choice on the original
budget constraint is M. The dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you to see at a
glance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original
budget constraint. On the new budget constraint, Kimberly will make a choice like N if both goods are normal goods.
If overnight stays is an inferior good, Kimberly will make a choice like P. If concert tickets are an inferior good,
Kimberly will make a choice like Q.
Now, assume that the income Kimberly has to spend on these two items rises to $2,000 per year, causing her budget
constraint to shift out to the right. How does this rise in income alter her utility-maximizing choice? Kimberly will
again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek
her utility-maximizing choice on the new budget line, but how will her new choice relate to her original choice?
We can replace the possible choices along the new budget constraint into three groups, which the dashed horizontal
and vertical lines that pass through the original choice M in the figure divide. All choices on the upper left of the
new budget constraint that are to the left of the vertical dashed line, like choice P with two overnight stays and 32
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
141

concert tickets, involve less of the good on the horizontal axis but much more of the good on the vertical axis. All
choices to the right of the vertical dashed line and above the horizontal dashed line—like choice N with five overnight
getaways and 20 concert tickets—have more consumption of both goods. Finally, all choices that are to the right of
the vertical dashed line but below the horizontal dashed line, like choice Q with four concerts and nine overnight
getaways, involve less of the good on the vertical axis but much more of the good on the horizontal axis.
All of these choices are theoretically possible, depending on Kimberly’s personal preferences as expressed through
the total and marginal utility she would receive from consuming these two goods. When income rises, the most
common reaction is to purchase more of both goods, like choice N, which is to the upper right relative to Kimberly’s
original choice M, although exactly how much more of each good will vary according to personal taste. Conversely,
when income falls, the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods. As we defined in the chapter on
Demand and Supply and again in the chapter on Elasticity, we call goods and services normal goods when a
rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity
consumed.
However, depending on Kimberly’s preferences, a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase
while consumption of the other good declines. A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity
consumed of overnight stays to decline, while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of
concerts to decline. Goods where demand declines as income rises (or conversely, where the demand rises as income
falls) are called “inferior goods.” An inferior good occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises, because
they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer. For example, a higher-income household might eat
fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car, and instead eat more steak and buy a new car.
How Price Changes Affect Consumer Choices
For analyzing the possible effect of a change in price on consumption, let’s again use a concrete example. Figure 6.4
represents Sergei's consumer choice, who chooses between purchasing baseball bats and cameras. A price increase
for baseball bats would have no effect on the ability to purchase cameras, but it would reduce the number of bats
Sergei could afford to buy. Thus a price increase for baseball bats, the good on the horizontal axis, causes the
budget constraint to rotate inward, as if on a hinge, from the vertical axis. As in the previous section, the point
labeled M represents the originally preferred point on the original budget constraint, which Sergei has chosen after
contemplating his total utility and marginal utility and the tradeoffs involved along the budget constraint. In this
example, the units along the horizontal and vertical axes are not numbered, so the discussion must focus on whether
Sergei will consume more or less of certain goods, not on numerical amounts.
Figure 6.4 How a Change in Price Affects Consumption Choices
The original utility-maximizing choice is M.
When the price rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise. The dashed lines make it possible to see at a glance
whether the new consumption choice involves less of both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The new
possible choices would be fewer baseball bats and more cameras, like point H, or less of both goods, as at point J.
Choice K would mean that the higher price of bats led to exactly the same quantity of bat consumption, but fewer
cameras. Theoretically possible, but unlikely in the real world, we rule out choices like L because they would mean
that a higher price for baseball bats means a greater consumption of baseball bats.
After the price increase, Sergei will make a choice along the new budget constraint. Again, we can divide his choices
into three segments by the dashed vertical and horizontal lines. In the upper left portion of the new budget constraint,
142
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

at a choice like H, Sergei consumes more cameras and fewer bats. In the central portion of the new budget constraint,
at a choice like J, he consumes less of both goods. At the right-hand end, at a choice like L, he consumes more bats
but fewer cameras.
The typical response to higher prices is that a person chooses to consume less of the product with the higher price.
This occurs for two reasons, and both effects can occur simultaneously. The substitution effect occurs when a price
changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of
the good with a relatively lower price. The income effect is that a higher price means, in effect, the buying power
of income has been reduced (even though actual income has not changed), which leads to buying less of the good
(when the good is normal). In this example, the higher price for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy fewer bats
for both reasons. Exactly how much will a higher price for bats cause Sergei's bat consumption to fall? Figure 6.4
suggests a range of possibilities. Sergei might react to a higher price for baseball bats by purchasing the same quantity
of bats, but cutting his camera consumption. This choice is the point K on the new budget constraint, straight below
the original choice M. Alternatively, Sergei might react by dramatically reducing his bat purchases and instead buy
more cameras.
The key is that it would be imprudent to assume that a change in baseball bats will only or primarily affect the good's
price whose price is changed, while the quantity consumed of other goods remains the same. Since Sergei purchases
all his products out of the same budget, a change in the price of one good can also have a range of effects, either
positive or negative, on the quantity consumed of other goods.
In short, a higher price typically causes reduced consumption of the good in question, but it can affect the
consumption of other goods as well.

machines.
The Foundations of Demand Curves
Changes in the price of a good lead the budget constraint to rotate. A rotation in the budget constraint means that
when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change. In this way,
the logical foundations of demand curves—which show a connection between prices and quantity demanded—are
based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility. Figure 6.5 (a) shows a budget constraint with a choice
between housing and “everything else.” (Putting “everything else” on the vertical axis can be a useful approach in
some cases, especially when the focus of the analysis is on one particular good.) We label the preferred choice on the
original budget constraint that provides the highest possible utility M0. The other three budget constraints represent
successively higher prices for housing of P1, P2, and P3. As the budget constraint rotates in, and in, and in again, we
label the utility-maximizing choices M1, M2, and M3, and the quantity demanded of housing falls from Q0 to Q1 to
Q2 to Q3.
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
143

Figure 6.5 The Foundations of a Demand Curve: An Example of Housing
(a) As the price increases from P0 to
P1 to P2 to P3, the budget constraint on the upper part of the diagram rotates clockwise. The utility-maximizing choice
changes from M0 to M1 to M2 to M3. As a result, the quantity demanded of housing shifts from Q0 to Q1 to Q2 to Q3,
ceteris paribus. (b) The demand curve graphs each combination of the price of housing and the quantity of housing
demanded, ceteris paribus. The quantities of housing are the same at the points on both (a) and (b). Thus, the
original price of housing (P0) and the original quantity of housing (Q0) appear on the demand curve as point E0. The
higher price of housing (P1) and the corresponding lower quantity demanded of housing (Q1) appear on the demand
curve as point E1.
Thus, as the price of housing rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise and the quantity consumed of housing
falls, ceteris paribus (meaning, with all other things being the same). We graph this relationship—the price of housing
rising from P0 to P1 to P2 to P3, while the quantity of housing demanded falls from Q0 to Q1 to Q2 to Q3—on the
demand curve in Figure 6.5 (b). The vertical dashed lines stretching between the top and bottom of Figure 6.5
show that the quantity of housing demanded at each point is the same in both (a) and (b). We ultimately determine
the shape of a demand curve by the underlying choices about maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint. While
economists may not be able to measure “utils,” they can certainly measure price and quantity demanded.
Applications in Government and Business
The budget constraint framework for making utility-maximizing choices offers a reminder that people can react to a
change in price or income in a range of different ways. For example, in the winter months of 2005, costs for heating
homes increased significantly in many parts of the country as prices for natural gas and electricity soared, due in
large part to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some people reacted by reducing the quantity
demanded of energy; for example, by turning down the thermostats in their homes by a few degrees and wearing a
heavier sweater inside. Even so, many home heating bills rose, so people adjusted their consumption in other ways,
too. As you learned in the chapter on Elasticity, the short run demand for home heating is generally inelastic. Each
144

household cut back on what it valued least on the margin. For some it might have been some dinners out, or a vacation,
or postponing buying a new refrigerator or a new car. Sharply higher energy prices can have effects beyond the energy
market, leading to a widespread reduction in purchasing throughout the rest of the economy.
A similar issue arises when the government imposes taxes on certain products, such as on gasoline, cigarettes, and
alcohol. Say that a tax on alcohol leads to a higher price at the liquor store. The higher price of alcohol causes the
budget constraint to pivot left, and alcoholic beverage consumption is likely to decrease. However, people may also
react to the higher price of alcoholic beverages by cutting back on other purchases. For example, they might cut back
on snacks at restaurants like chicken wings and nachos. It would be unwise to assume that the liquor industry is the
only one affected by the tax on alcoholic beverages. Read the next Clear It Up to learn about how who controls the
household income influences buying decisions.
The Unifying Power of the Utility-Maximizing Budget Set Framework
An interaction between prices, budget constraints, and personal preferences determine household choices. The
flexible and powerful terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for bringing these elements
together.
Not even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their marginal utilities before they walk into a
shopping mall, accept a job, or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe that individuals
seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people often decide to try a little less of one thing and a little more
of another. If we accept these assumptions, then the idea of utility-maximizing households facing budget constraints
becomes highly plausible.
Does who controls household income make a difference?
In the mid-1970s, the United Kingdom made an interesting policy change in its “child allowance” policy. This
program provides a fixed amount of money per child to every family, regardless of family income. Traditionally,
the child allowance had been distributed to families by withholding less in taxes from the paycheck of
the family wage earner—typically the father in this time period. The new policy instead provided the child
allowance as a cash payment to the mother. As a result of this change, households have the same level of
income and face the same prices in the market, but the money is more likely to be in the mother's purse than
in the father's wallet.
Should this change in policy alter household consumption patterns? Basic models of consumption decisions,
of the sort that we examined in this chapter, assume that it does not matter whether the mother or the father
receives the money, because both parents seek to maximize the family's utility as a whole. In effect, this model
assumes that everyone in the family has the same preferences.
In reality, the share of that the father or mother controls does affect what the household consumes. When the
mother controls a larger share of family income a number of studies, in the United Kingdom and in a wide
variety of other countries, have found that the family tends to spend more on restaurant meals, child care,
and women’s clothing, and less on alcohol and tobacco. As the mother controls a larger share of household
resources, children’s health improves, too. These findings suggest that when providing assistance to poor
families, in high-income countries and low-income countries alike, the monetary amount of assistance is not
all that matters: it also matters which family member actually receives the money.
The budget constraint framework serves as a constant reminder to think about the full range of effects that can arise
from changes in income or price, not just effects on the one product that might seem most immediately affected.

6.3 | Labor-Leisure Choices
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Interpret labor-leisure budget constraint graphs
•
Predict consumer choices based on wages and other compensation
•
Explain the backward-bending supply curve of labor
People do not obtain utility just from products they purchase. They also obtain utility from leisure time. Leisure time
is time not spent at work. The decision-making process of a utility-maximizing household applies to what quantity of
hours to work in much the same way that it applies to purchases of goods and services. Choices made along the labor-
leisure budget constraint, as wages shift, provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve. The discussion
also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages, and specifically
about the claim that if people are paid higher wages, they will work a greater quantity of hours—assuming that they
have a say in the matter.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. workers averaged 38.6 hours per week on the job in 2014. This
average includes part-time workers; for full-time workers only, the average was 42.5 hours per week. Table 6.6
shows that more than half of all workers are on the job 35 to 48 hours per week, but significant proportions work
more or less than this amount.
Table 6.7 breaks down the average hourly compensation received by private industry workers, including wages and
benefits. Wages and salaries are about three-quarters of total compensation received by workers; the rest is in the form
of health insurance, vacation pay, and other benefits. The compensation workers receive differs for many reasons,
including experience, education, skill, talent, membership in a labor union, and the presence of discrimination against
certain groups in the labor market. Issues surrounding the inequality of incomes in a market-oriented economy are
explored in the chapters on Poverty and Economic Inequality (http://cnx.org/content/m57266/latest/) and

The Labor-Leisure Budget Constraint
How do workers make decisions about the number of hours to work? Again, let’s proceed with a concrete example.
The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a consumption choice budget constraint, but the labels are
different on a labor-leisure budget constraint.
Vivian has 70 hours per week that she could devote either to work or to leisure, and her wage is $10/hour. The lower
budget constraint in Figure 6.6 shows Vivian’s possible choices. The horizontal axis of this diagram measures both
leisure and labor, by showing how Vivian’s time is divided between leisure and labor. Hours of leisure are measured
from left to right on the horizontal axis, while hours of labor are measured from right to left. Vivian will compare
choices along this budget constraint, ranging from 70 hours of leisure and no income at point S to zero hours of
leisure and $700 of income at point L. She will choose the point that provides her with the highest total utility. For
this example, let’s assume that Vivian’s utility-maximizing choice occurs at O, with 30 hours of leisure, 40 hours of
work, and $400 in weekly income.
Figure 6.6 How a Rise in Wages Alters the Utility-Maximizing Choice Vivian’s original choice is point O on the
lower opportunity set. A rise in her wage causes her opportunity set to swing upward. In response to the increase in
wages, Vivian can make a range of different choices available to her: a choice like D, which involves less work; and a
choice like B, which involves the same amount of work but more income; or a choice like A, which involves more work
and considerably more income. Vivian’s personal preferences will determine which choice she makes.
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
147

For Vivian to discover the labor-leisure choice that will maximize her utility, she does not have to place numerical
values on the total and marginal utility that she would receive from every level of income and leisure. All that really
matters is that Vivian can compare, in her own mind, whether she would prefer more leisure or more income, given
the tradeoffs she faces. If Vivian can say to herself: “I’d really rather work a little less and have more leisure, even
if it means less income,” or “I’d be willing to work more hours to make some extra income,” then as she gradually
moves in the direction of her preferences, she will seek out the utility-maximizing choice on her labor-leisure budget
constraint.
Now imagine that Vivian’s wage level increases to $12/hour. A higher wage will mean a new budget constraint that
tilts up more steeply; conversely, a lower wage would have led to a new budget constraint that was flatter. How will
a change in the wage and the corresponding shift in the budget constraint affect Vivian’s decisions about how many
hours to work?
Vivian’s choices of quantity of hours to work and income along her new budget constraint can be divided into several
categories, using the dashed horizontal and vertical lines in Figure 6.6 that go through her original choice (O). One
set of choices in the upper-left portion of the new budget constraint involves more hours of work (that is, less leisure)
and more income, at a point like A with 20 hours of leisure, 50 hours of work, and $600 of income (that is, 50 hours
of work multiplied by the new wage of $12 per hour). A second choice would be to work exactly the same 40 hours,
and to take the benefits of the higher wage in the form of income that would now be $480, at choice B. A third choice
would involve more leisure and the same income at point C (that is, 33-1/3 hours of work multiplied by the new wage
of $12 per hour equals $400 of total income). A fourth choice would involve less income and much more leisure at a
point like D, with a choice like 50 hours of leisure, 20 hours of work, and $240 in income.
In effect, Vivian can choose whether to receive the benefits of her wage increase in the form of more income, or more
leisure, or some mixture of these two. With this range of possibilities, it would be unwise to assume that Vivian (or
anyone else) will necessarily react to a wage increase by working substantially more hours. Maybe they will; maybe
they will not.
Applications of Utility Maximizing with the Labor-Leisure Budget Constraint
The theoretical insight that higher wages will sometimes cause an increase in hours worked, sometimes cause hours
worked not to change by much, and sometimes cause hours worked to decline, has led to labor supply curves that
look like the one in Figure 6.7. The bottom-left portion of the labor supply curve slopes upward, which reflects
the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying a greater quantity of labor. The middle, close-to-
vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying
about the same quantity of labor. The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a backward-bending supply
curve for labor, which is the situation of high-wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still-higher
wage by working fewer hours. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more on the number of hours the average
person works each year.

Figure 6.7 A Backward-Bending Supply Curve of Labor The bottom upward-sloping portion of the labor supply
curve shows that as wages increase over this range, the quantity of hours worked also increases. The middle, nearly
vertical portion of the labor supply curve shows that as wages increase over this range, the quantity of hours worked
changes very little. The backward-bending portion of the labor supply curve at the top shows that as wages increase
over this range, the quantity of hours worked actually decreases. All three of these possibilities can be derived from
how a change in wages causes movement in the labor-leisure budget constraint, and thus different choices by
individuals.

Is America a nation of workaholics?
Americans work a lot. Table 6.8 shows average hours worked per year in the United States, Canada, Japan,
and several European countries, with data from 2013. To get a perspective on these numbers, someone who
works 40 hours per week for 50 weeks per year, with two weeks off, would work 2,000 hours per year. The gap
in hours worked is a little astonishing; the 250 to 300 hour gap between how much Americans work and how
much Germans or the French work amounts to roughly six to seven weeks less of work per year. Economists
who study these international patterns debate the extent to which average Americans and Japanese have a
preference for working more than, say, Germans, or whether German workers and employers face particular
kinds of taxes and regulations that lead to fewer hours worked. Many countries have laws that regulate the
work week and dictate holidays and the standards of “normal” vacation time vary from country to country. It is
also interesting to take the amount of time spent working in context; it is estimated that in the late nineteenth
century in the United States, the average work week was over 60 hours per week—leaving little to no time for
leisure.

Index.aspx?DataSetCode=ANHRS)
The different responses to a rise in wages—more hours worked, the same hours worked, or fewer hours worked—are
patterns exhibited by different groups of workers in the U.S. economy. Many full-time workers have jobs where the
number of hours is held relatively fixed, partly by their own choice and partly by their employer’s practices. These
workers do not much change their hours worked as wages rise or fall, so their supply curve of labor is inelastic.
However, part-time workers and younger workers tend to be more flexible in their hours, and more ready to increase
hours worked when wages are high or cut back when wages fall.
The backward-bending supply curve for labor, when workers react to higher wages by working fewer hours and
having more income, is not observed often in the short run. However, some well-paid professionals, like dentists or
accountants, may react to higher wages by choosing to limit the number of hours, perhaps by taking especially long
vacations, or taking every other Friday off. Over a long-term perspective, the backward-bending supply curve for
labor is common. Over the last century, Americans have reacted to gradually rising wages by working fewer hours;
for example, the length of the average work-week has fallen from about 60 hours per week in 1900 to the present
average of less than 40 hours per week.
Recognizing that workers have a range of possible reactions to a change in wages casts some fresh insight on a
perennial political debate: the claim that a reduction in income taxes—which would, in effect, allow people to earn
150
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices

more per hour—will encourage people to work more. The leisure-income budget set points out that this connection
will not hold true for all workers. Some people, especially part-timers, may react to higher wages by working more.
Many will work the same number of hours. Some people, especially those whose incomes are already high, may react
to the tax cut by working fewer hours. Of course, cutting taxes may be a good or a bad idea for a variety of reasons,
not just because of its impact on work incentives, but the specific claim that tax cuts will lead people to work more
hours is only likely to hold for specific groups of workers and will depend on how and for whom taxes are cut.
6.4 | Intertemporal Choices in Financial Capital Markets
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Evaluate the reasons for making intertemporal choices
•
Interpret an intertemporal budget constraint
•
Analyze why people in America tend to save such a small percentage of their income
Rates of saving in America have never been especially high, but they seem to have dipped even lower in recent years,
as the data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in Figure 6.8 show. A decision about how much to save can
be represented using an intertemporal budget constraint. Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings
show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor-leisure decision.
Figure 6.8 Personal Savings as a Percentage of Personal Income
Personal savings were about 7 to 11% of
personal income for most of the years from the late 1950s up to the early 1990s. Since then, the rate of personal
savings has fallen substantially, although it seems to have bounced back a bit since 2008. (Source:
http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm)
The discussion of financial saving here will not focus on the specific financial investment choices, like bank
accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or owning a house or gold coins. The characteristics of these specific financial
investments, along with the risks and tradeoffs they pose, are detailed in the Labor and Financial Markets
(http://cnx.org/content/m57219/latest/) chapter. Here, the focus is saving in total—that is, on how a household
determines how much to consume in the present and how much to save, given the expected rate of return (or interest
rate), and how the quantity of saving alters when the rate of return changes.
Using Marginal Utility to Make Intertemporal Choices
Savings behavior varies considerably across households. One factor is that households with higher incomes tend to
save a larger percentage of their income. This pattern makes intuitive sense; a well-to-do family has the flexibility in
its budget to save 20–25% of income, while a poor family struggling to keep food on the table will find it harder to
put money aside.
Another factor that causes personal saving to vary is personal preferences. Some people may prefer to consume
more now, and let the future look after itself. Others may wish to enjoy a lavish retirement, complete with expensive
vacations, or to pile up money that they can pass along to their grandchildren. There are savers and spendthrifts among
the young, middle-aged, and old, and among those with high, middle, and low income levels.

Consider this example: Yelberton is a young man starting off at his first job. He thinks of the “present” as his working
life and the “future” as after retirement. Yelberton’s plan is to save money from ages 30 to 60, retire at age 60, and
then live off his retirement money from ages 60 to 85. On average, therefore, he will be saving for 30 years. If the
rate of return that he can receive is 6% per year, then $1 saved in the present would build up to $5.74 after 30 years
(using the formula for compound interest, $1(1 + 0.06)30 = $5.74). Say that Yelberton will earn $1,000,000 over the
30 years from age 30 to age 60 (this amount is approximately an annual salary of $33,333 multiplied by 30 years).
The question for Yelberton is how much of those lifetime earnings to consume during his working life, and how much
to put aside until after retirement. This example is obviously built on simplifying assumptions, but it does convey the
basic life-cycle choice of saving during working life for future consumption after retirement.
Figure 6.9 and Table 6.9 show Yelberton’s intertemporal budget constraint. Yelberton’s choice involves comparing
the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement. The rate of return
that determines the slope of the intertemporal budget line between present consumption and future consumption in
this example is the annual interest rate that he would earn on his savings, compounded over the 30 years of his
working life. (For simplicity, we are assuming that any savings from current income will compound for 30 years.)
Thus, in the lower budget constraint line on the figure, future consumption grows by increments of $574,000, because
each time $100,000 is saved in the present, it compounds to $574,000 after 30 years at a 6% interest rate. If some
of the numbers on the future consumption axis look bizarrely large, remember that this occurs because of the power
of compound interest over substantial periods of time, and because the figure is grouping together all of Yelberton’s
saving for retirement over his lifetime.
Figure 6.9 Yelberton’s Choice: The Intertemporal Budget Set Yelberton will make a choice between present and
future consumption. With an annual rate of return of 6%, he decides that his utility will be highest at point B, which
represents a choice of $800,000 in present consumption and $1,148,000 in future consumption. When the annual
rate of return rises to 9%, the intertemporal budget constraint pivots up. Yelberton could choose to take the gains
from this higher rate of return in several forms: more present saving and much higher future consumption (J), the
same present saving and higher future consumption (K), more present consumption and more future consumption
(L), or more present consumption and the same future consumption (M).

Table 6.9 Yelburton’s Intertemporal Budget Constraint
Yelberton will compare the different choices along the budget constraint and choose the one that provides him with the
highest utility. For example, he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point A, with consumption
of $1 million in the present, zero savings, and zero future consumption; point B, with present consumption of
$800,000, savings of $200,000, and future consumption of $1,148,000; point C, with present consumption of
$600,000, savings of $400,000, and future consumption of $2,296,000; or even choice D, with present consumption
of zero, savings of $1,000,000, and future consumption of $5,740,000. Yelberton will also ask himself questions like
these: “Would I prefer to consume a little less in the present, save more, and have more future consumption?” or
“Would I prefer to consume a little more in the present, save less, and have less future consumption?” By considering
marginal changes toward more or less consumption, he can seek out the choice that will provide him with the highest
level of utility.
Let us say that Yelberton’s preferred choice is B. Imagine that Yelberton’s annual rate of return raises from 6% to 9%.
In this case, each time he saves $100,000 in the present, it will be worth $1,327,000 in 30 years from now (using the
formula for compound interest that $100,000 (1 + 0.09)30 = $1,327,000). A change in rate of return alters the slope of
the intertemporal budget constraint: a higher rate of return or interest rate will cause the budget line to pivot upward,
while a lower rate of return will cause it to pivot downward. If Yelberton were to consume nothing in the present and
save all $1,000,000, with a 9% rate of return, his future consumption would be $13,270,000, as shown on Figure
6.9.
As the rate of return rises, Yelberton considers a range of choices on the new intertemporal budget constraint. The
dashed vertical and horizontal lines running through the original choice B help to illustrate his range of options. One
choice is to reduce present consumption (that is, to save more) and to have considerably higher future consumption
at a point like J above and to the left of his original choice B. A second choice would be to keep the level of present
consumption and savings the same, and to receive the benefits of the higher rate of return entirely in the form of
higher future consumption, which would be choice K.
As a third choice Yelberton could have both more present consumption—that is, less savings—but still have higher
future consumption because of the higher interest rate, which would be choice like L, above and to the right of his
original choice B. Thus, the higher rate of return might cause Yelberton to save more, or less, or the same amount,
depending on his own preferences. A fourth choice would be that Yelberton could react to the higher rate of return by
increasing his current consumption and leaving his future consumption unchanged, as at point M directly to the right
of his original choice B. The actual choice of what quantity to save and how saving will respond to changes in the
rate of return will vary from person to person, according to the choice that will maximize each person’s utility.
Applications of the Model of Intertemporal Choice
The theoretical model of the intertemporal budget constraint suggests that when the rate of return rises, the quantity
of saving may rise, fall, or remain the same, depending on the preferences of individuals. For the U.S. economy as a
whole, the most common pattern seems to be that the quantity of savings does not adjust much to changes in the rate of
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
153

return. As a practical matter, many households either save at a fairly steady pace, by putting regular contributions into
a retirement account or by making regular payments as they buy a house, or they do not save much at all. Of course,
some people will have preferences that cause them to react to a higher rate of return by increasing their quantity of
saving; others will react to a higher rate of return by noticing that with a higher rate of return, they can save less in
the present and still have higher future consumption.
One prominent example in which a higher rate of return leads to a lower savings rate occurs when firms save money
because they have promised to pay workers a certain fixed level of pension benefits after retirement. When rates of
return rise, those companies can save less money in the present in their pension fund and still have enough to pay the
promised retirement benefits in the future.
This insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with
a higher rate of return. For example, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) accounts are special savings
accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later, after retirement.
The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual, while a 401(k) needs to
be set up through an employer. By not taxing savings in the present, the effect of an IRA or a 401(k) is to increase the
return to saving in these accounts.
IRA and 401(k) accounts have attracted a large quantity of savings since they became common in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. In fact, the amount of IRAs rose from $239 billion in 1992 to $3.7 trillion in 2005, then to over $5 trillion
in 2012, as per the Investment Company Institute, a national association of U.S. investment companies. However,
overall U.S. personal savings, as discussed earlier, actually dropped from low to lower in the late 1990s and into
the 2000s. Evidently, the larger amounts in these retirement accounts are being offset, in the economy as a whole,
either by less savings in other kinds of accounts, or by a larger amount of borrowing (that is, negative savings). The
following Clear It Up further explores America's saving rates.
A rise in interest rates makes it easier for people to enjoy higher future consumption. But it also allows them to enjoy
higher present consumption, if that is what these individuals desire. Again, a change in prices—in this case, in interest
rates—leads to a range of possible outcomes.

How does America’s saving rates compare to other countries?
By international standards, Americans do not save a high proportion of their income, as Table 6.10 shows. The
rate of gross national saving includes saving by individuals, businesses, and government. By this measure,
U.S. national savings amount to 17% of the size of the U.S. GDP, which measures the size of the U.S.
economy. The comparable world average rate of savings is 22%.

The Unifying Power of the Utility-Maximizing Budget Set Framework
The choices of households are determined by an interaction between prices, budget constraints, and personal
preferences. The flexible and powerful terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for bringing
these elements together.
Not even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their marginal utilities before they walk into a
shopping mall, accept a job, or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe that individuals
seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people often decide to try a little less of one thing and a little more of
another. If these assumptions are accepted, then the idea of utility-maximizing households facing budget constraints
becomes highly plausible.
Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Viewpoint
As we know, people sometimes make decisions that seem “irrational” and not in their own best interest. People’s
decisions can seem inconsistent from one day to the next and they even deliberately ignore ways to save money or
time. The traditional economic models assume rationality, which means that people take all available information and
make consistent and informed decisions that are in their best interest. (In fact, economics professors often delight in
pointing out so-called “irrational behavior” each semester to their new students, and present economics as a way to
become more rational.)
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices
155

But a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists, argue that the traditional method leaves out
something important: people’s state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one is feeling
revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily irrational states of mind, but part of a range of emotions
that can affect anyone on a given day. And what’s more, actions under these conditions are indeed predictable, if
the underlying environment is better understood. So, behavioral economics seeks to enrich the understanding of
decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics. It does this by investigating how given
dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation. This can lead to decisions that
appear outwardly inconsistent, or irrational, to the outside observer.
The way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to traditional economists but is actually far
more complex than an unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional economist would say
that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also got an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After
all, –$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have done
research that shows many people will feel some negative emotion—anger, frustration, and so forth—after those two
things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. This is known as loss aversion, where a $1 loss
pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky
in a famous 1979 article in the journal Econometrica. This insight has implications for investing, as people tend
to “overplay” the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains. Indeed, this behavior looks irrational to
traditional economists, but is consistent once we understand better how the mind works, these economists argue.
Traditional economists also assume human beings have complete self-control. But, for instance, people will buy
cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep usage down. They
purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on taxes to force themselves to save. In other words, we protect
ourselves from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral economists are responding to
this is by setting up ways for people to keep themselves free of these temptations. This includes what are called
“nudges” toward more rational behavior rather than mandatory regulations from government. For example, up to
20 percent of new employees do not enroll in retirement savings plans immediately, because of procrastination or
feeling overwhelmed by the different choices. Some companies are now moving to a new system, where employees
are automatically enrolled unless they “opt out.” Almost no-one opts out in this program and employees begin saving
at the early years, which are most critical for retirement.
Another area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or putting dollars in different mental categories
where they take different values. Economists typically consider dollars to be fungible, or having equal value to the
individual, regardless of the situation.
You might, for instance, think of the $25 you found in the street differently from the $25 you earned from three
hours working in a fast food restaurant. The street money might well be treated as “mad money” with little rational
regard to getting the best value. This is in one sense strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard work
in the restaurant. Yet the “easy come-easy go” mentality replaces the rational economizer because of the situation, or
context, in which the money was attained.
In another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a traditional economist, a person could carry a
credit card debt of $1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a $2,000 savings account
that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays $150 a year to the credit card company, while collecting only $40
annually in bank interest, so she loses $130 a year. That doesn’t seem wise.
The “rational” decision would be to pay off the debt, since a $1,000 savings account with $0 in debt is the equivalent
net worth, and she would now net $20 per year. But curiously, it is not uncommon for people to ignore this advice,
since they will treat a loss to their savings account as higher than the benefit of paying off their credit card. The dollars
are not being treated as fungible so it looks irrational to traditional economists.
Which view is right, the behavioral economists’ or the traditional view? Both have their advantages, but behavioral
economists have at least shed a light on trying to describe and explain behavior that has historically been dismissed
as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some “irrational behavior,” perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for
this behavior in the first place.

"Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe"—Making Choices
In what category did consumers worldwide increase their spending during the recession? Higher education.
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrollment
in colleges and universities rose one-third in China and almost two-thirds in Saudi Arabia, nearly doubled
in Pakistan, tripled in Uganda, and surged by three million—18 percent—in the United States. Why were
consumers willing to spend on education during lean times? Both individuals and countries view higher
education as the way to prosperity. Many feel that increased earnings are a significant benefit of attending
college.
Bureau of Labor Statistics data from May 2012 supports this view, as shown in Figure 6.10. They show a
positive correlation between earnings and education. The data also indicate that unemployment rates fall with
higher levels of education and training.
Figure 6.10 The Impact of Education on Earnings and Unemployment Rates, 2012
Those with the
highest degrees in 2012 had substantially lower unemployment rates whereas those with the least formal
education suffered from the highest unemployment rates. The national median average weekly income was
$815, and the nation unemployment average in 2012 was 6.8%. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 22,

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
6.1 Consumption Choices
Economic analysis of household behavior is based on the assumption that people seek the highest level of utility or
satisfaction. Individuals are the only judge of their own utility. In general, greater consumption of a good brings higher
total utility. However, the additional utility people receive from each unit of greater consumption tends to decline in
a pattern of diminishing marginal utility.
We can find the utility-maximizing choice on a consumption budget constraint in several ways. You can add up total
utility of each choice on the budget line and choose the highest total. You can select a starting point at random and
compare the marginal utility gains and losses of moving to neighboring points—and thus eventually seek out the
preferred choice. Alternatively, you can compare the ratio of the marginal utility to price of good 1 with the marginal
utility to price of good 2 and apply the rule that at the optimal choice, the two ratios should be equal:

MU2
P2
6.2 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices
The budget constraint framework suggest that when income or price changes, a range of responses are possible. When
income rises, households will demand a higher quantity of normal goods, but a lower quantity of inferior goods. When
158
Chapter 6 | Consumer Choices

the price of a good rises, households will typically demand less of that good—but whether they will demand a much
lower quantity or only a slightly lower quantity will depend on personal preferences. Also, a higher price for one good
can lead to more or less demand of the other good.
6.3 Labor-Leisure Choices
When making a choice along the labor-leisure budget constraint, a household will choose the combination of labor,
leisure, and income that provides the most utility. The result of a change in wage levels can be higher work hours, the
same work hours, or lower work hours.
6.4 Intertemporal Choices in Financial Capital Markets
When making a choice along the intertemporal budget constraint, a household will choose the combination of present
consumption, savings, and future consumption that provides the most utility. The result of a higher rate of return (or
higher interest rates) can be a higher quantity of saving, the same quantity of saving, or a lower quantity of saving,
depending on preferences about present and future consumption. Behavioral economics is a branch of economics that
seeks to understand and explain the "human" factors that drive what traditional economists see as people's irrational
spending decisions.

Praxilla, who lived in ancient Greece, derives
utility from reading poems and from eating cucumbers.
Praxilla gets 30 units of marginal utility from her first
poem, 27 units of marginal utility from her second
poem, 24 units of marginal utility from her third poem,
and so on, with marginal utility declining by three units
for each additional poem. Praxilla gets six units of
marginal utility for each of her first three cucumbers
consumed, five units of marginal utility for each of her
next three cucumbers consumed, four units of marginal
utility for each of the following three cucumbers
consumed, and so on, with marginal utility declining by
one for every three cucumbers consumed. A poem costs
three bronze coins but a cucumber costs only one bronze
coin. Praxilla has 18 bronze coins. Sketch Praxilla’s
budget set between poems and cucumbers, placing
poems on the vertical axis and cucumbers on the
horizontal axis. Start off with the choice of zero poems
and 18 cucumbers, and calculate the changes in marginal
utility of moving along the budget line to the next choice
of one poem and 15 cucumbers. Using this step-by-
step process based on marginal utility, create a table and
identify Praxilla’s utility-maximizing choice. Compare
the marginal utility of the two goods and the relative
prices at the optimal choice to see if the expected
relationship holds. Hint: Label the table columns: 1)
Choice, 2) Marginal Gain from More Poems, 3)
Marginal Loss from Fewer Cucumbers, 4) Overall Gain

Amazon
In less than two decades, Amazon.com has transformed the way consumers sell, buy, and even read. Prior
to Amazon, independent bookstores with limited inventories in small retail locations primarily sold books.
There were exceptions, of course. Borders and Barnes & Noble offered larger stores in urban areas. In the
last decade, however, independent bookstores have mostly disappeared, Borders has gone out of business,
and Barnes & Noble is struggling. Online delivery and purchase of books has overtaken the more traditional
business models. How has Amazon changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its
competition?
A major reason for the giant retailer’s success is its production model and cost structure, which has enabled
Amazon to undercut the competitors' prices even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read on to see how
firms great (like Amazon) and small (like your corner deli) determine what to sell, at what output, and price.

•
Costs in the Short Run

Production in the Long Run
•
Costs in the Long Run
This chapter is the first of four chapters that explores the theory of the firm. This theory explains how firms behave.
What does that mean? Let’s define what we mean by the firm. A firm (or producer or business) combines inputs of
labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs. If the firm is successful, the outputs
are more valuable than the inputs. This activity of production goes beyond manufacturing (i.e., making things). It
includes any process or service that creates value, including transportation, distribution, wholesale and retail sales.
Production involves a number of important decisions that define a firm's behavior. These decisions include, but are
not limited to:
•
What product or products should the firm produce?
•
How should the firm produce the products (i.e., what production process should the firm use)?
•
How much output should the firm produce?
•
What price should the firm charge for its products?
•
How much labor should the firm employ?
The answers to these questions depend on the production and cost conditions facing each firm. That is the subject
of this chapter. The answers also depend on the market structure for the product(s) in question. Market structure is a
multidimensional concept that involves how competitive the industry is. We define it by questions such as these:
•
How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?
•
How similar is each firm’s product to the products of other firms in the industry?
•
How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?
•
Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other product differences?
Figure 7.2 illustrates the range of different market structures, which we will explore in Perfect Competition,
Monopoly, and Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.
Figure 7.2 The Spectrum of Competition Firms face different competitive situations. At one extreme—perfect
competition—many firms are all trying to sell identical products. At the other extreme—monopoly—only one firm is
selling the product, and this firm faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall between the
extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic competition is a situation with many firms selling similar,
but not identical products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell identical or similar products.
Let's examine how firms determine their costs and desired profit levels. Then we will discuss the origins of cost,
both in the short and long run. Private enterprise, which can be private individual or group business ownership,
characterizes the U.S. economy. In the U.S. system, we have the option to organize private businesses as sole
proprietorships (one owner), partners (more than one owner), and corporations (legal entitles separate from the
owners.
When people think of businesses, often corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, or General Motors come to mind.
However, firms come in all sizes, as Table 7.1 shows. The vast majority of American firms have fewer than 20
employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S. economy.
164
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure

Slightly less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000 large firms, meaning they employ more
than 500 workers. Another 35% of workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100 workers. These
small-scale businesses include everything from dentists and lawyers to businesses that mow lawns or clean houses.
Table 7.1 does not include a separate category for the millions of small “non-employer” businesses where a single
owner or a few partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive whatever they can earn.

7.1 | Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and
Economic Profit
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the difference between explicit costs and implicit costs
•
Understand the relationship between cost and revenue
Each business, regardless of size or complexity, tries to earn a profit:
Profi = Total Revenue – Total Cost
Total revenue is the income the firm generates from selling its products. We calculate it by multiplying the price of
the product times the quantity of output sold:
Total Revenue = Price × Quantity
We will see in the following chapters that revenue is a function of the demand for the firm’s products.
Total cost is what the firm pays for producing and selling its products. Recall that production involves the firm
converting inputs to outputs. Each of those inputs has a cost to the firm. The sum of all those costs is total cost. We
will learn in this chapter that short run costs are different from long run costs.
We can distinguish between two types of cost: explicit and implicit. Explicit costs are out-of-pocket costs, that is,
actual payments. Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs. Implicit
costs are more subtle, but just as important. They represent the opportunity cost of using resources that the firm
already owns. Often for small businesses, they are resources that the owners contribute. For example, working in the
business while not earning a formal salary, or using the ground floor of a home as a retail store are both implicit costs.
Implicit costs also include the depreciation of goods, materials, and equipment that are necessary for a company to
operate. (See the Work It Out feature for an extended example.)
These two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit, accounting profit,
and economic profit. Accounting profit is a cash concept. It means total revenue minus explicit costs—the difference
between dollars brought in and dollars paid out. Economic profit is total revenue minus total cost, including both
explicit and implicit costs. The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
165

its accounting profit, whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit.
Calculating Implicit Costs
Consider the following example. Fred currently works for a corporate law firm. He is considering opening his
own legal practice, where he expects to earn $200,000 per year once he establishes himself. To run his own
firm, he would need an office and a law clerk. He has found the perfect office, which rents for $50,000 per
year. He could hire a law clerk for $35,000 per year. If these figures are accurate, would Fred’s legal practice
be profitable?
Step 1. First you have to calculate the costs. You can take what you know about explicit costs and total them:
Office ental :
   $50,000
Law clerk's salary :
+$35,000
____________
Total explicit costs :
   $85,000
Step 2. Subtracting the explicit costs from the revenue gives you the accounting profit.
Revenues :
$200,000
Explicit costs :
–$85,000
____________
Accounting profi :
$115,000
However, these calculations consider only the explicit costs. To open his own practice, Fred would have to quit
his current job, where he is earning an annual salary of $125,000. This would be an implicit cost of opening
his own firm.
Step 3. You need to subtract both the explicit and implicit costs to determine the true economic profit:
Economic profi
= total revenues – explicit costs – implicit costs
= $200,000 – $85,000 – $125,000
= –$10,000 per year
Fred would be losing $10,000 per year. That does not mean he would not want to open his own business, but
it does mean he would be earning $10,000 less than if he worked for the corporate firm.
Implicit costs can include other things as well. Maybe Fred values his leisure time, and starting his own firm
would require him to put in more hours than at the corporate firm. In this case, the lost leisure would also be
an implicit cost that would subtract from economic profits.
Now that we have an idea about the different types of costs, let’s look at cost structures. A firm’s cost structure in the
long run may be different from that in the short run. We turn to that distinction in the next few sections.

In this chapter, we want to explore the relationship between the quantity of output a firm produces, and the cost of
166
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure

producing that output. We mentioned that the cost of the product depends on how many inputs are required to produce
the product and what those inputs cost. We can answer the former question by looking at the firm’s production
function.
Figure 7.3 The production process for pizza includes inputs such as ingredients, the efforts of the pizza maker, and
tools and materials for cooking and serving. (Credit: Haldean Brown/Flickr Creative Commons)
Production is the process (or processes) a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g. labor, capital, raw materials) into outputs,
i.e. the goods or services the firm wishes to sell. Consider pizza making. The pizzaiolo (pizza maker) takes flour,
water, and yeast to make dough. Similarly, the pizzaiolo may take tomatoes, spices, and water to make pizza sauce.
The cook rolls out the dough, brushes on the pizza sauce, and adds cheese and other toppings. The pizzaiolo uses a
peel—the shovel-like wooden tool-- to put the pizza into the oven to cook. Once baked, the pizza goes into a box (if
it’s for takeout) and the customer pays for the good. What are the inputs (or factors of production) in the production
process for this pizza?
Economists divide factors of production into several categories:
•
Natural Resources (Land and Raw Materials) - The ingredients for the pizza are raw materials. These
include the flour, yeast, and water for the dough, the tomatoes, herbs, and water for the sauce, the cheese, and
the toppings. If the pizza place uses a wood-burning oven, we would include the wood as a raw material. If the
establishment heats the oven with natural gas, we would count this as a raw material. Don’t forget electricity
for lights. If, instead of pizza, we were looking at an agricultural product, like wheat, we would include the
land the farmer used for crops here.
•
Labor – When we talk about production, labor means human effort, both physical and mental. The pizzaiolo
was the primary example of labor here. He or she needs to be strong enough to roll out the dough and to insert
and retrieve the pizza from the oven, but he or she also needs to know how to make the pizza, how long it
cooks in the oven and a myriad of other aspects of pizza-making. The business may also have one or more
people to work the counter, take orders, and receive payment.
•
Capital – When economists uses the term capital, they do not mean financial capital (money); rather, they
mean physical capital, the machines, equipment, and buildings that one uses to produce the product. In the
case of pizza, the capital includes the peel, the oven, the building, and any other necessary equipment (for
example, tables and chairs).
•
Technology – Technology refers to the process or processes for producing the product. How does the pizzaiolo
combine ingredients to make pizza? How hot should the oven be? How long should the pizza cook? What
is the best oven to use? Gas or wood burning? Should the restaurant make its own dough, sauce, cheese,
toppings, or should it buy them?
•
Entrepreneurship – Production involves many decisions and much knowledge, even for something as simple
as pizza. Who makes those decisions? Ultimately, it is the entrepreneur, the person who creates the business,
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
167

whose idea it is to combine the inputs to produce the outputs.
The cost of producing pizza (or any output) depends on the amount of labor capital, raw materials, and other inputs
required and the price of each input to the entrepreneur. Let’s explore these ideas in more detail.
We can summarize the ideas so far in terms of a production function, a mathematical expression or equation that
explains the engineering relationship between inputs and outputs:
Q = f
⎡
⎣NR, L, K, t, E
⎤
⎦
The production function gives the answer to the question, how much output can the firm produce given different
amounts of inputs? Production functions are specific to the product. Different products have different production
functions. The amount of labor a farmer uses to produce a bushel of wheat is likely different than that required to
produce an automobile. Firms in the same industry may have somewhat different production functions, since each
firm may produce a little differently. One pizza restaurant may make its own dough and sauce, while another may buy
those pre-made. A sit-down pizza restaurant probably uses more labor (to handle table service) than a purely take-out
restaurant.
We can describe inputs as either fixed or variable.
Fixed inputs are those that can’t easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. In the pizza example,
the building is a fixed input. Once the entrepreneur signs the lease, he or she is stuck in the building until the lease
expires. Fixed inputs define the firm’s maximum output capacity. This is analogous to the potential real GDP shown
by society’s production possibilities curve, i.e. the maximum quantities of outputs a society can produce at a given
time with its available resources.
Variable inputs are those that can easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. The pizzaiolo can order
more ingredients with a phone call, so ingredients would be variable inputs. The owner could hire a new person to
work the counter pretty quickly as well.
Economists often use a short-hand form for the production function:
Q = f
⎡
⎣L, K
⎤
⎦,
where L represents all the variable inputs, and K represents all the fixed inputs.
Economists differentiate between short and long run production.
The short run is the period of time during which at least some factors of production are fixed. During the period of
the pizza restaurant lease, the pizza restaurant is operating in the short run, because it is limited to using the current
building—the owner can’t choose a larger or smaller building.
The long run is the period of time during which all factors are variable. Once the lease expires for the pizza restaurant,
the shop owner can move to a larger or smaller place.
Let’s explore production in the short run using a specific example: tree cutting (for lumber) with a two-person crosscut
saw.

Figure 7.4 Production in the short run may be explored through the example of lumberjacks using a two-person
saw. (Credit: Wknight94/Wikimedia Commons)
Since by definition capital is fixed in the short run, our production function becomes
Q = f[L, K
−] or Q = f[L]
This equation simply indicates that since capital is fixed, the amount of output (e.g. trees cut down per day) depends
only on the amount of labor employed (e.g. number of lumberjacks working). We can express this production function
numerically as Table 7.2 below shows.

Table 7.2 Short Run Production Function for Trees
Note that we have introduced some new language. We also call Output (Q) Total Product (TP), which means the
amount of output produced with a given amount of labor and a fixed amount of capital. In this example, one
lumberjack using a two-person saw can cut down four trees in an hour. Two lumberjacks using a two-person saw can
cut down ten trees in an hour.
We should also introduce a critical concept: marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output of one
more worker. Mathematically, Marginal Product is the change in total product divided by the change in labor:
MP = ΔTP / ΔL . In the table above, since 0 workers produce 0 trees, the marginal product of the first worker is four
trees per day, but the marginal product of the second worker is six trees per day. Why might that be the case? It’s
because of the nature of the capital the workers are using. A two-person saw works much better with two persons than
with one. Suppose we add a third lumberjack to the story. What will that person’s marginal product be? What will that
person contribute to the team? Perhaps he or she can oil the saw's teeth to keep it sawing smoothly or he or she could
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
169

bring water to the two people sawing. What you see in the table is a critically important conclusion about production
in the short run: It may be that as we add workers, the marginal product increases at first, but sooner or later additional
workers will have decreasing marginal product. In fact, there may eventually be no effect or a negative effect on
output. This is called the Law of Diminishing Marginal Product and it’s a characteristic of production in the short
run. Diminishing marginal productivity is very similar to the concept of diminishing marginal utility that we learned
about in the chapter on consumer choice. Both concepts are examples of the more general concept of diminishing
marginal returns. Why does diminishing marginal productivity occur? It’s because of fixed capital. We will see this
more clearly when we discuss production in the long run.
We can show these concepts graphically as Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6 illustrate. Figure 7.5 graphically shows the
data from Table 7.2. Figure 7.6 shows the more general cases of total product and marginal product curves.

We’ve explained that a firm’s total costs depend on the quantities of inputs the firm uses to produce its output and the
cost of those inputs to the firm. The firm’s production function tells us how much output the firm will produce with
given amounts of inputs. However, if we think about that backwards, it tells us how many inputs the firm needs to
produce a given quantity of output, which is the first thing we need to determine total cost. Let’s move to the second
172
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure

factor we need to determine.
For every factor of production (or input), there is an associated factor payment. Factor payments are what the firm
pays for the use of the factors of production. From the firm’s perspective, factor payments are costs. From the owner
of each factor’s perspective, factor payments are income. Factor payments include:
•
Raw materials prices for raw materials
•
Rent for land or buildings
•
Wages and salaries for labor
•
Interest and dividends for the use of financial capital (loans and equity investments)
•
Profit for entrepreneurship. Profit is the residual, what’s left over from revenues after the firm pays all the
other costs. While it may seem odd to treat profit as a “cost”, it is what entrepreneurs earn for taking the risk
of starting a business. You can see this correspondence between factors of production and factor payments in
the inside loop of the circular flow diagram in Figure 1.6.
We now have all the information necessary to determine a firm’s costs.
A cost function is a mathematical expression or equation that shows the cost of producing different levels of output.

Table 7.3 Cost Function for Producing Widgets
What we observe is that the cost increases as the firm produces higher quantities of output. This is pretty intuitive,
since producing more output requires greater quantities of inputs, which cost more dollars to acquire.
What is the origin of these cost figures? They come from the production function and the factor payments. The
discussion of costs in the short run above, Costs in the Short Run, was based on the following production
function, which is similar to Table 7.3 except for "widgets" instead of trees.

Now that we have the basic idea of the cost origins and how they are related to production, let’s drill down into the
details.
Average and Marginal Costs
The cost of producing a firm’s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses. A list of the
costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or
haircuts or fast-food meals.
We can measure costs in a variety of ways. Each way provides its own insight into costs. Sometimes firms need to
look at their cost per unit of output, not just their total cost. There are two ways to measure per unit costs. The most
intuitive way is average cost. Average cost is the cost on average of producing a given quantity. We define average
cost as total cost divided by the quantity of output produced. AC = TC / Q If producing two widgets costs a total of
$44, the average cost per widget is $44/ 2 = $22 per widget. The other way of measuring cost per unit is marginal
cost. If average cost is the cost of the average unit of output produced, marginal cost is the cost of each individual unit
produced. More formally, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of output. Mathematically, marginal
cost is the change in total cost divided by the change in output: MC = ΔTC / ΔQ . If the cost of the first widget is
$32.50 and the cost of two widgets is $44, the marginal cost of the second widget is $44 −$32.50 = $11.50. We can
see the Widget Cost table redrawn below with average and marginal cost added.

Table 7.8 Extended Cost Function for Producing Widgets
Note that the marginal cost of the first unit of output is always the same as total cost.
Fixed and Variable Costs
We can decompose costs into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are the costs of the fixed inputs (e.g. capital).
Because fixed inputs do not change in the short run, fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless of the
level of production. Whether you produce a great deal or a little, the fixed costs are the same. One example is the rent
on a factory or a retail space. Once you sign the lease, the rent is the same regardless of how much you produce, at
174
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

least until the lease expires. Fixed costs can take many other forms: for example, the cost of machinery or equipment
to produce the product, research and development costs to develop new products, even an expense like advertising
to popularize a brand name. The amount of fixed costs varies according to the specific line of business: for instance,
manufacturing computer chips requires an expensive factory, but a local moving and hauling business can get by with
almost no fixed costs at all if it rents trucks by the day when needed.
Variable costs are the costs of the variable inputs (e.g. labor). The only way to increase or decrease output is by
increasing or decreasing the variable inputs. Therefore, variable costs increase or decrease with output. We treat labor
as a variable cost, since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more
work hours. Variable costs would also include raw materials.
Total costs are the sum of fixed plus variable costs. Let's look at another example. Consider the barber shop called
“The Clip Joint” in Figure 7.7. The data for output and costs are in Table 7.9. The fixed costs of operating the
barber shop, including the space and equipment, are $160 per day. The variable costs are the costs of hiring barbers,
which in our example is $80 per barber each day. The first two columns of the table show the quantity of haircuts the
barbershop can produce as it hires additional barbers. The third column shows the fixed costs, which do not change
regardless of the level of production. The fourth column shows the variable costs at each level of output. We calculate
these by taking the amount of labor hired and multiplying by the wage. For example, two barbers cost: 2 × $80 =
$160. Adding together the fixed costs in the third column and the variable costs in the fourth column produces the
total costs in the fifth column. For example, with two barbers the total cost is: $160 + $160 = $320.

Table 7.9 Output and Total Costs
Figure 7.7 How Output Affects Total Costs At zero production, the fixed costs of $160 are still present. As
production increases, variable costs are added to fixed costs, and the total cost is the sum of the two.
At zero production, the fixed costs of $160 are still present. As production increases, we add variable costs to fixed
costs, and the total cost is the sum of the two. Figure 7.7 graphically shows the relationship between the quantity of
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
175

output produced and the cost of producing that output. We always show the fixed costs as the vertical intercept of the
total cost curve; that is, they are the costs incurred when output is zero so there are no variable costs.
You can see from the graph that once production starts, total costs and variable costs rise. While variable costs may
initially increase at a decreasing rate, at some point they begin increasing at an increasing rate. This is caused by
diminishing marginal productivity which we discussed earlier in the Production in the Short Run section of this
chapter, which is easiest to see with an example. As the number of barbers increases from zero to one in the table,
output increases from 0 to 16 for a marginal gain (or marginal product) of 16. As the number rises from one to two
barbers, output increases from 16 to 40, a marginal gain of 24. From that point on, though, the marginal product
diminishes as we add each additional barber. For example, as the number of barbers rises from two to three, the
marginal product is only 20; and as the number rises from three to four, the marginal product is only 12.
To understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man barber shop is a very busy operation. The
single barber needs to do everything: say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair, sweep, and run the
cash register. A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between these tasks, and
allows a greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be increasing marginal productivity. However, as
the shop adds other barbers, the advantage of each additional barber is less, since the specialization of labor can only
go so far. The addition of a sixth or seventh or eighth barber just to greet people at the door will have less impact than
the second one did. This is the pattern of diminishing marginal productivity. As a result, the total costs of production
will begin to rise more rapidly as output increases. At some point, you may even see negative returns as the additional
barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other’s way. In this case, the addition of still more barbers would
actually cause output to decrease, as the last row of Table 7.9 shows.
This pattern of diminishing marginal productivity is common in production. As another example, consider the
problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer’s field. The plot of land is the fixed factor of production, while the water
that the farmer can add to the land is the key variable cost. As the farmer adds water to the land, output increases.
However, adding increasingly more water brings smaller increases in output, until at some point the water floods the
field and actually reduces output. Diminishing marginal productivity occurs because, with fixed inputs (land in this
example), each additional unit of input (e.g. water) contributes less to overall production.
Average Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, Marginal Cost
The breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a basis for other insights as well. The first
five columns of Table 7.10 duplicate the previous table, but the last three columns show average total costs, average
variable costs, and marginal costs. These new measures analyze costs on a per-unit (rather than a total) basis and are
reflected in the curves in Figure 7.8.
Figure 7.8 Cost Curves at the Clip Joint We can also present the information on total costs, fixed cost, and
variable cost on a per-unit basis. We calculate average total cost (ATC) by dividing total cost by the total quantity
produced. The average total cost curve is typically U-shaped. We calculate average variable cost (AVC) by dividing
variable cost by the quantity produced. The average variable cost curve lies below the average total cost curve and is
also typically U-shaped. We calculate marginal cost (MC) by taking the change in total cost between two levels of
output and dividing by the change in output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping.

Table 7.10 Different Types of Costs
Average total cost (sometimes referred to simply as average cost) is total cost divided by the quantity of output.
Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320, the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is
$320/40, or $8 per haircut. Average cost curves are typically U-shaped, as Figure 7.8 shows. Average total cost
starts off relatively high, because at low levels of output total costs are dominated by the fixed cost. Mathematically,
the denominator is so small that average total cost is large. Average total cost then declines, as the fixed costs are
spread over an increasing quantity of output. In the average cost calculation, the rise in the numerator of total costs
is relatively small compared to the rise in the denominator of quantity produced. However, as output expands still
further, the average cost begins to rise. At the right side of the average cost curve, total costs begin rising more rapidly
as diminishing returns come into effect.
We obtain average variable cost when we divide variable cost by quantity of output. For example, the variable cost
of producing 80 haircuts is $400, so the average variable cost is $400/80, or $5 per haircut. Note that at any level of
output, the average variable cost curve will always lie below the curve for average total cost, as Figure 7.8 shows.
The reason is that average total cost includes average variable cost and average fixed cost. Thus, for Q = 80 haircuts,
the average total cost is $8 per haircut, while the average variable cost is $5 per haircut. However, as output grows,
fixed costs become relatively less important (since they do not rise with output), so average variable cost sneaks closer
to average cost.
Average total and variable costs measure the average costs of producing some quantity of output. Marginal cost is
somewhat different. Marginal cost is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. It is not the cost per
unit of all units produced, but only the next one (or next few). We calculate marginal cost by taking the change in total
cost and dividing it by the change in quantity. For example, as quantity produced increases from 40 to 60 haircuts,
total costs rise by 400 – 320, or 80. Thus, the marginal cost for each of those marginal 20 units will be 80/20, or $4
per haircut. The marginal cost curve is generally upward-sloping, because diminishing marginal returns implies that
additional units are more costly to produce. We can see small range of increasing marginal returns in the figure as a
dip in the marginal cost curve before it starts rising. There is a point at which marginal and average costs meet, as the
following Clear it Up feature discusses.
Where do marginal and average costs meet?
The marginal cost line intersects the average cost line exactly at the bottom of the average cost curve—which
occurs at a quantity of 72 and cost of $6.60 in Figure 7.8. The reason why the intersection occurs at this point
is built into the economic meaning of marginal and average costs. If the marginal cost of production is below
the average cost for producing previous units, as it is for the points to the left of where MC crosses ATC, then
producing one more additional unit will reduce average costs overall—and the ATC curve will be downward-
sloping in this zone. Conversely, if the marginal cost of production for producing an additional unit is above
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
177

the average cost for producing the earlier units, as it is for points to the right of where MC crosses ATC, then
producing a marginal unit will increase average costs overall—and the ATC curve must be upward-sloping in
this zone. The point of transition, between where MC is pulling ATC down and where it is pulling it up, must
occur at the minimum point of the ATC curve.
This idea of the marginal cost “pulling down” the average cost or “pulling up” the average cost may sound
abstract, but think about it in terms of your own grades. If the score on the most recent quiz you take is lower
than your average score on previous quizzes, then the marginal quiz pulls down your average. If your score on
the most recent quiz is higher than the average on previous quizzes, the marginal quiz pulls up your average.
In this same way, low marginal costs of production first pull down average costs and then higher marginal
costs pull them up.
The numerical calculations behind average cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost will change from firm to
firm. However, the general patterns of these curves, and the relationships and economic intuition behind them, will
not change.
Lessons from Alternative Measures of Costs
Breaking down total costs into fixed cost, marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable cost is useful because
each statistic offers its own insights for the firm.
Whatever the firm’s quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit. As explored in
the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are often sunk costs that a firm cannot recoup. In thinking
about what to do next, typically you should ignore sunk costs, since you have already spent this money and cannot
make any changes. However, you can change variable costs, so they convey information about the firm’s ability to
cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will increase if production rises.
Why are total cost and average cost not on the same graph?
Total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost each reflect different aspects of the cost of production over the entire
quantity of output produced. We measure these costs in dollars. In contrast, marginal cost, average cost, and
average variable cost are costs per unit. In the previous example, we measured them as dollars per haircut.
Thus, it would not make sense to put all of these numbers on the same graph, since we measure them in
different units ($ versus $ per unit of output).
It would be as if the vertical axis measured two different things. In addition, as a practical matter, if they were
on the same graph, the lines for marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost would appear almost
flat against the horizontal axis, compared to the values for total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost. Using the
figures from the previous example, the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320. However, the average cost
is $320/40, or $8. If you graphed both total and average cost on the same axes, the average cost would hardly
show.
Average cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market. If we divide profit by the
quantity of output produced we get average profit, also known as the firm’s profit margin. Expanding the equation
for profit gives:
average profi
=
profi
quantity produced
=
total revenue – total cost
quantity produced

total revenue
quantity produced –
total cost
quantity produced
= average revenue – average cost
178
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure

However, note that:
average revenue
=
price × quantity produced
quantity produced
= price
Thus:
average profi
= price – average cost
This is the firm’s profit margin. This definition implies that if the market price is above average cost, average profit,
and thus total profit, will be positive. If price is below average cost, then profits will be negative.
We can compare this marginal cost of producing an additional unit with the marginal revenue gained by selling
that additional unit to reveal whether the additional unit is adding to total profit—or not. Thus, marginal cost helps
producers understand how increasing or decreasing production affects profits.
A Variety of Cost Patterns
The pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry. Some businesses have
high fixed costs, but low marginal costs. Consider, for example, an internet company that provides medical advice
to customers. Consumers might pay such a company directly, or perhaps hospitals or healthcare practices might
subscribe on behalf of their patients. Setting up the website, collecting the information, writing the content, and
buying or leasing the computer space to handle the web traffic are all fixed costs that the company must undertake
before the site can work. However, when the website is up and running, it can provide a high quantity of service with
relatively low variable costs, like the cost of monitoring the system and updating the information. In this case, the
total cost curve might start at a high level, because of the high fixed costs, but then might appear close to flat, up to
a large quantity of output, reflecting the low variable costs of operation. If the website is popular, however, a large
rise in the number of visitors will overwhelm the website, and increasing output further could require a purchase of
additional computer space.
For other firms, fixed costs may be relatively low. For example, consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or shovel
snow off sidewalks and driveways in the winter. For fixed costs, such firms may need little more than a car to transport
workers to homes of customers and some rakes and shovels. Still other firms may find that diminishing marginal
returns set in quite sharply. If a manufacturing plant tried to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, little time remains
for routine equipment maintenance, and marginal costs can increase dramatically as the firm struggles to repair and
replace overworked equipment.
Every firm can gain insight into its task of earning profits by dividing its total costs into fixed and variable
costs, and then using these calculations as a basis for average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost.
However, making a final decision about the profit-maximizing quantity to produce and the price to charge will require
combining these perspectives on cost with an analysis of sales and revenue, which in turn requires looking at the
market structure in which the firm finds itself. Before we turn to the analysis of market structure in other chapters, we
will analyze the firm’s cost structure from a long-run perspective.
7.4 | Production in the Long Run
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Understand how long run production differs from short run production.
In the long run, all factors (including capital) are variable, so our production function is Q = f
⎡
⎣L, K
⎤
⎦.
Consider a secretarial firm that does typing for hire using typists for labor and personal computers for capital. To start,
the firm has just enough business for one typist and one PC to keep busy for a day. Say that’s five documents. Now
suppose the firm receives a rush order from a good customer for 10 documents tomorrow. Ideally, the firm would like
to use two typists and two PCs to produce twice their normal output of five documents. However, in the short turn,
the firm has fixed capital, i.e. only one PC. The table below shows the situation:

Table 7.11 Short Run Production Function for Typing
In the short run, the only variable factor is labor so the only way the firm can produce more output is by hiring
additional workers. What could the second worker do? What can they contribute to the firm? Perhaps they can answer
the phone, which is a major impediment to completing the typing assignment. What about a third worker? Perhaps he
or she could bring coffee to the first two workers. You can see both total product and marginal product for the firm
above. Now here’s something to think about: At what point (e.g. after how many workers) does diminishing marginal
productivity kick in, and more importantly, why?
In this example, marginal productivity starts to decline after the second worker. This is because capital is fixed. The
production process for typing works best with one worker and one PC. If you add more than one typist, you get
seriously diminishing marginal productivity.
Consider the long run. Suppose the firm’s demand increases to 15 documents per day. What might the firm do to
operate more efficiently? If demand has tripled, the firm could acquire two more PCs, which would give us a new
short run production function as Table 7.4 below shows.

Table 7.12 Long Run Production Function for Typing
With more capital, the firm can hire three workers before diminishing productivity comes into effect. More generally,
because all factors are variable, the long run production function shows the most efficient way of producing any level
of output.
7.5 | Costs in the Long Run
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Calculate long run total cost
•
Identify economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and constant returns to scale
•
Interpret graphs of long-run average cost curves and short-run average cost curves
•
Analyze cost and production in the long run and short run
The long run is the period of time when all costs are variable. The long run depends on the specifics of the firm in
question—it is not a precise period of time. If you have a one-year lease on your factory, then the long run is any
period longer than a year, since after a year you are no longer bound by the lease. No costs are fixed in the long run. A
firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery, or it can close existing facilities. In planning for the long
run, the firm will compare alternative production technologies (or processes).

In this context, technology refers to all alternative methods of combining inputs to produce outputs. It does not refer
to a specific new invention like the tablet computer. The firm will search for the production technology that allows it
to produce the desired level of output at the lowest cost. After all, lower costs lead to higher profits—at least if total
revenues remain unchanged. Moreover, each firm must fear that if it does not seek out the lowest-cost methods of
production, then it may lose sales to competitor firms that find a way to produce and sell for less.
Choice of Production Technology
A firm can perform many tasks with a range of combinations of labor and physical capital. For example, a firm can
have human beings answering phones and taking messages, or it can invest in an automated voicemail system. A
firm can hire file clerks and secretaries to manage a system of paper folders and file cabinets, or it can invest in
a computerized recordkeeping system that will require fewer employees. A firm can hire workers to push supplies
around a factory on rolling carts, it can invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots that carry materials
without a driver. Firms often face a choice between buying a many small machines, which need a worker to run each
one, or buying one larger and more expensive machine, which requires only one or two workers to operate it. In short,
physical capital and labor can often substitute for each other.
Consider the example of local governments hiring a private firm to clean up public parks. Three different
combinations of labor and physical capital for cleaning up a single average-sized park appear in Table 7.13. The
first production technology is heavy on workers and light on machines, while the next two technologies substitute
machines for workers. Since all three of these production methods produce the same thing—one cleaned-up park—a
profit-seeking firm will choose the production technology that is least expensive, given the prices of labor and
machines.

Table 7.13 Three Ways to Clean a Park
Production technology 1 uses the most labor and least machinery, while production technology 3 uses the least labor
and the most machinery. Table 7.14 outlines three examples of how the total cost will change with each production
technology as the cost of labor changes. As the cost of labor rises from example A to B to C, the firm will choose to
substitute away from labor and use more machinery.

Table 7.14 Total Cost with Rising Labor Costs
Example A shows the firm’s cost calculation when wages are $40 and machines costs are $80. In this case, technology
1 is the low-cost production technology. In example B, wages rise to $55, while the cost of machines does not change,
in which case technology 2 is the low-cost production technology. If wages keep rising up to $90, while the cost
of machines remains unchanged, then technology 3 clearly becomes the low-cost form of production, as example C
shows.
This example shows that as an input becomes more expensive (in this case, the labor input), firms will attempt to
conserve on using that input and will instead shift to other inputs that are relatively less expensive. This pattern helps
to explain why the demand curve for labor (or any input) slopes down; that is, as labor becomes relatively more
expensive, profit-seeking firms will seek to substitute the use of other inputs. When a multinational employer like
Coca-Cola or McDonald’s sets up a bottling plant or a restaurant in a high-wage economy like the United States,
Canada, Japan, or Western Europe, it is likely to use production technologies that conserve on the number of workers
and focuses more on machines. However, that same employer is likely to use production technologies with more
workers and less machinery when producing in a lower-wage country like Mexico, China, or South Africa.
Economies of Scale
Once a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of production,
or quantity of output to produce. Many industries experience economies of scale. Economies of scale refers to the
situation where, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down. This is the idea behind “warehouse
stores” like Costco or Walmart. In everyday language: a larger factory can produce at a lower average cost than a
smaller factory.
Figure 7.9 illustrates the idea of economies of scale, showing the average cost of producing an alarm clock falling
as the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like S, with an output level of 1,000, the average cost of
production is $12 per alarm clock. For a medium-sized factory like M, with an output level of 2,000, the average
cost of production falls to $8 per alarm clock. For a large factory like L, with an output of 5,000, the average cost of
production declines still further to $4 per alarm clock.
182
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure

Figure 7.9 Economies of Scale A small factory like S produces 1,000 alarm clocks at an average cost of $12 per
clock. A medium factory like M produces 2,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $8 per clock. A large factory like L produces
5,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $4 per clock. Economies of scale exist when the larger scale of production leads to
lower average costs.
The average cost curve in Figure 7.9 may appear similar to the average cost curves we presented earlier in
this chapter, although it is downward-sloping rather than U-shaped. However, there is one major difference. The
economies of scale curve is a long-run average cost curve, because it allows all factors of production to change.
The short-run average cost curves we presented earlier in this chapter assumed the existence of fixed costs, and only
variable costs were allowed to change.
One prominent example of economies of scale occurs in the chemical industry. Chemical plants have many pipes.
The cost of the materials for producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its length. However, the
cross-section area of the pipe determines the volume of chemicals that can flow through it. The calculations in Table
7.15 show that a pipe which uses twice as much material to make (as shown by the circumference) can actually carry
four times the volume of chemicals because the pipe's cross-section area rises by a factor of four (as the Area column
below shows).
Circumference ( 2πr )
Area ( πr2 )
4-inch pipe
12.5 inches
12.5 square inches
8-inch pipe
25.1 inches
50.2 square inches
16-inch pipe
50.2 inches
201.1 square inches
Table 7.15 Comparing Pipes: Economies of Scale in the Chemical Industry
A doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to process four times as much material. This
pattern is a major reason for economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity of pipes. Of
course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more complex than this simple calculation suggests. However, the
chemical engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the “six-tenths rule,” a rule of thumb which
holds that increasing the quantity produced in a chemical plant by a certain percentage will increase total cost by only
six-tenths as much.
Shapes of Long-Run Average Cost Curves
While in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve (corresponding to the level of
fixed costs they have chosen), in the long run when all costs are variable, they can choose to operate on any average
cost curve. Thus, the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve is actually based on a group of short-run average cost
(SRAC) curves, each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs. More precisely, the long-run average cost
curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output. Figure 7.10 shows how we build the
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
183

long-run average cost curve from a group of short-run average cost curves. Five short-run-average cost curves appear
on the diagram. Each SRAC curve represents a different level of fixed costs. For example, you can imagine SRAC1
as a small factory, SRAC2 as a medium factory, SRAC3 as a large factory, and SRAC4 and SRAC5 as very large and
ultra-large. Although this diagram shows only five SRAC curves, presumably there are an infinite number of other
SRAC curves between the ones that we show. Think of this family of short-run average cost curves as representing
different choices for a firm that is planning its level of investment in fixed cost physical capital—knowing that
different choices about capital investment in the present will cause it to end up with different short-run average cost
curves in the future.
Figure 7.10 From Short-Run Average Cost Curves to Long-Run Average Cost Curves The five different short-
run average cost (SRAC) curves each represents a different level of fixed costs, from the low level of fixed costs at
SRAC1 to the high level of fixed costs at SRAC5. Other SRAC curves, not in the diagram, lie between the ones that
are here. The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest cost for producing each quantity of output when
fixed costs can vary, and so it is formed by the bottom edge of the family of SRAC curves. If a firm wished to produce
quantity Q3, it would choose the fixed costs associated with SRAC3.
The long-run average cost curve shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run, when the firm can choose
its level of fixed costs and thus choose which short-run average costs it desires. If the firm plans to produce in the
long run at an output of Q3, it should make the set of investments that will lead it to locate on SRAC3, which allows
producing q3 at the lowest cost. A firm that intends to produce Q3 would be foolish to choose the level of fixed
costs at SRAC2 or SRAC4. At SRAC2 the level of fixed costs is too low for producing Q3 at lowest possible cost,
and producing q3 would require adding a very high level of variable costs and make the average cost very high. At
SRAC4, the level of fixed costs is too high for producing q3 at lowest possible cost, and again average costs would be
very high as a result.
The shape of the long-run cost curve, in Figure 7.10, is fairly common for many industries. The left-hand portion of
the long-run average cost curve, where it is downward- sloping from output levels Q1 to Q2 to Q3, illustrates the case
of economies of scale. In this portion of the long-run average cost curve, larger scale leads to lower average costs. We
illustrated this pattern earlier in Figure 7.9.
In the middle portion of the long-run average cost curve, the flat portion of the curve around Q3, economies of
scale have been exhausted. In this situation, allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of
production. We call this constant returns to scale. In this LRAC curve range, the average cost of production does not
change much as scale rises or falls. The following Clear It Up feature explains where diminishing marginal returns fit
into this analysis.

How do economies of scale compare to diminishing marginal
returns?
The concept of economies of scale, where average costs decline as production expands, might seem to
conflict with the idea of diminishing marginal returns, where marginal costs rise as production expands.
However, diminishing marginal returns refers only to the short-run average cost curve, where one variable
input (like labor) is increasing, but other inputs (like capital) are fixed. Economies of scale refers to the long-run
average cost curve where all inputs are allowed to increase together. Thus, it is quite possible and common to
have an industry that has both diminishing marginal returns when only one input is allowed to change, and at
the same time has economies of scale when all inputs change together to produce a larger-scale operation.
Finally, the right-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, running from output level Q4 to Q5, shows
a situation where, as the level of output and the scale rises, average costs rise as well. We call this situation
diseconomies of scale. A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage, resulting in
unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other, and as
failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials. Not many overly large factories exist
in the real world, because with their very high production costs, they are unable to compete for long against plants
with lower average costs of production. However, in some planned economies, like the economy of the old Soviet
Union, plants that were so large as to be grossly inefficient were able to continue operating for a long time because
government economic planners protected them from competition and ensured that they would not make losses.
Diseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm, not just a large factory. The leviathan effect can hit
firms that become too large to run efficiently, across the entirety of the enterprise. Firms that shrink their operations
are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region, thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower
output level.

The Size and Number of Firms in an Industry
The shape of the long-run average cost curve has implications for how many firms will compete in an industry, and
whether the firms in an industry have many different sizes, or tend to be the same size. For example, say that the
appliance industry sells one million dishwashers every year at a price of $500 each and the long-run average cost
curve for dishwashers is in Figure 7.11 (a). In Figure 7.11 (a), the lowest point of the LRAC curve occurs at a
quantity of 10,000 produced. Thus, the market for dishwashers will consist of 100 different manufacturing plants of
this same size. If some firms built a plant that produced 5,000 dishwashers per year or 25,000 dishwashers per year,
the average costs of production at such plants would be well above $500, and the firms would not be able to compete.
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
185

Figure 7.11 The LRAC Curve and the Size and Number of Firms
(a) Low-cost firms will produce at output level
R. When the LRAC curve has a clear minimum point, then any firm producing a different quantity will have higher
costs. In this case, a firm producing at a quantity of 10,000 will produce at a lower average cost than a firm producing,
say, 5,000 or 20,000 units. (b) Low-cost firms will produce between output levels R and S. When the LRAC curve has
a flat bottom, then firms producing at any quantity along this flat bottom can compete. In this case, any firm producing
a quantity between 5,000 and 20,000 can compete effectively, although firms producing less than 5,000 or more than
20,000 would face higher average costs and be unable to compete.
How can we view cities as examples of economies of scale?
Why are people and economic activity concentrated in cities, rather than distributed evenly across a country?
The fundamental reason must be related to the idea of economies of scale—that grouping economic activity
is more productive in many cases than spreading it out. For example, cities provide a large group of nearby
customers, so that businesses can produce at an efficient economy of scale. They also provide a large group
of workers and suppliers, so that business can hire easily and purchase whatever specialized inputs they
need. Many of the attractions of cities, like sports stadiums and museums, can operate only if they can draw
on a large nearby population base. Cities are big enough to offer a wide variety of products, which is what
appeals to many shoppers.
These factors are not exactly economies of scale in the narrow sense of the production function of a single
firm, but they are related to growth in the overall size of population and market in an area. Cities are
sometimes called “agglomeration economies.”
These agglomeration factors help to explain why every economy, as it develops, has an increasing proportion
of its population living in urban areas. In the United States, about 80% of the population now lives in
metropolitan areas (which include the suburbs around cities), compared to just 40% in 1900. However, in
poorer nations of the world, including much of Africa, the proportion of the population in urban areas is only
about 30%. One of the great challenges for these countries as their economies grow will be to manage the
growth of the great cities that will arise.
If cities offer economic advantages that are a form of economies of scale, then why don’t all or most people
live in one giant city? At some point, agglomeration economies must turn into diseconomies. For example,
traffic congestion may reach a point where the gains from being geographically nearby are counterbalanced
by how long it takes to travel. High densities of people, cars, and factories can mean more garbage and air
and water pollution. Facilities like parks or museums may become overcrowded. There may be economies of
scale for negative activities like crime, because high densities of people and businesses, combined with the
greater impersonality of cities, make it easier for illegal activities as well as legal ones. The future of cities,
both in the United States and in other countries around the world, will be determined by their ability to benefit

from the economies of agglomeration and to minimize or counterbalance the corresponding diseconomies.
We illustrate a more common case in Figure 7.11 (b), where the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed area of constant
returns to scale. In this situation, any firm with a level of output between 5,000 and 20,000 will be able to produce at
about the same level of average cost. Given that the market will demand one million dishwashers per year at a price
of $500, this market might have as many as 200 producers (that is, one million dishwashers divided by firms making
5,000 each) or as few as 50 producers (one million dishwashers divided by firms making 20,000 each). The producers
in this market will range in size from firms that make 5,000 units to firms that make 20,000 units. However, firms
that produce below 5,000 units or more than 20,000 will be unable to compete, because their average costs will be too
high. Thus, if we see an industry where almost all plants are the same size, it is likely that the long-run average cost
curve has a unique bottom point as in Figure 7.11 (a). However, if the long-run average cost curve has a wide flat
bottom like Figure 7.11 (b), then firms of a variety of different sizes will be able to compete with each other.
We can interpret the flat section of the long-run average cost curve in Figure 7.11 (b) in two different ways. One
interpretation is that a single manufacturing plant producing a quantity of 5,000 has the same average costs as a single
manufacturing plant with four times as much capacity that produces a quantity of 20,000. The other interpretation
is that one firm owns a single manufacturing plant that produces a quantity of 5,000, while another firm owns four
separate manufacturing plants, which each produce a quantity of 5,000. This second explanation, based on the insight
that a single firm may own a number of different manufacturing plants, is especially useful in explaining why the
long-run average cost curve often has a large flat segment—and thus why a seemingly smaller firm may be able to
compete quite well with a larger firm. At some point, however, the task of coordinating and managing many different
plants raises the cost of production sharply, and the long-run average cost curve slopes up as a result.
In the examples to this point, the quantity demanded in the market is quite large (one million) compared with the
quantity produced at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve (5,000, 10,000 or 20,000). In such a situation, the
market is set for competition between many firms. However, what if the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is
at a quantity of 10,000 and the total market demand at that price is only slightly higher than that quantity—or even
somewhat lower?
Return to Figure 7.11 (a), where the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at 10,000, but now imagine that
the total quantity of dishwashers demanded in the market at that price of $500 is only 30,000. In this situation, the
total number of firms in the market would be three. We call a handful of firms in a market an “oligopoly,” and the
chapter on Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly will discuss the range of competitive strategies that can
occur when oligopolies compete.
Alternatively, consider a situation, again in the setting of Figure 7.11 (a), where the bottom of the long-run average
cost curve is 10,000, but total demand for the product is only 5,000. (For simplicity, imagine that this demand is
highly inelastic, so that it does not vary according to price.) In this situation, the market may well end up with a
single firm—a monopoly—producing all 5,000 units. If any firm tried to challenge this monopoly while producing a
quantity lower than 5,000 units, the prospective competitor firm would have a higher average cost, and so it would
not be able to compete in the longer term without losing money. The chapter on Monopoly discusses the situation of
a monopoly firm.
Thus, the shape of the long-run average cost curve reveals whether competitors in the market will be different sizes.
If the LRAC curve has a single point at the bottom, then the firms in the market will be about the same size, but if the
LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed segment of constant returns to scale, then firms in the market may be a variety of
different sizes.
The relationship between the quantity at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve and the quantity demanded
in the market at that price will predict how much competition is likely to exist in the market. If the quantity demanded
in the market far exceeds the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, then many firms will compete. If the quantity
demanded in the market is only slightly higher than the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, a few firms will
compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, a single-
producer monopoly is a likely outcome.
Shifting Patterns of Long-Run Average Cost
New developments in production technology can shift the long-run average cost curve in ways that can alter the size
distribution of firms in an industry.
Chapter 7 | Production, Costs and Industry Structure
187

For much of the twentieth century, the most common change had been to see alterations in technology, like the
assembly line or the large department store, where large-scale producers seemed to gain an advantage over smaller
ones. In the long-run average cost curve, the downward-sloping economies of scale portion of the curve stretched
over a larger quantity of output.
However, new production technologies do not inevitably lead to a greater average size for firms. For example, in
recent years some new technologies for generating electricity on a smaller scale have appeared. The traditional
coal-burning electricity plants needed to produce 300 to 600 megawatts of power to exploit economies of scale
fully. However, high-efficiency turbines to produce electricity from burning natural gas can produce electricity at a
competitive price while producing a smaller quantity of 100 megawatts or less. These new technologies create the
possibility for smaller companies or plants to generate electricity as efficiently as large ones. Another example of
a technology-driven shift to smaller plants may be taking place in the tire industry. A traditional mid-size tire plant
produces about six million tires per year. However, in 2000, the Italian company Pirelli introduced a new tire factory
that uses many robots. The Pirelli tire plant produced only about one million tires per year, but did so at a lower
average cost than a traditional mid-sized tire plant.
Controversy has simmered in recent years over whether the new information and communications technologies will
lead to a larger or smaller size for firms. On one side, the new technology may make it easier for small firms to reach
out beyond their local geographic area and find customers across a state, or the nation, or even across international
boundaries. This factor might seem to predict a future with a larger number of small competitors. On the other
side, perhaps the new information and communications technology will create “winner-take-all” markets where one
large company will tend to command a large share of total sales, as Microsoft has done producing of software for
personal computers or Amazon has done in online bookselling. Moreover, improved information and communication
technologies might make it easier to manage many different plants and operations across the country or around the
world, and thus encourage larger firms. This ongoing battle between the forces of smallness and largeness will be of
great interest to economists, businesspeople, and policymakers.
Amazon
Traditionally, bookstores have operated in retail locations with inventories held either on the shelves or in
the back of the store. These retail locations were very pricey in terms of rent. Until recently, Amazon had
no retail locations. It only sold online and delivered by mail. Amazon now has retail stores in California,
Oregon and Washington State and retail stores are coming to Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New
York. Amazon offers almost any book in print, convenient purchasing, and prompt delivery by mail. Amazon
holds its inventories in huge warehouses in low-rent locations around the world. The warehouses are highly
computerized using robots and relatively low-skilled workers, making for low average costs per sale. Amazon
demonstrates the significant advantages economies of scale can offer to a firm that exploits those economies.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
7.1 Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit
Privately owned firms are motivated to earn profits. Profit is the difference between revenues and costs. While
accounting profit considers only explicit costs, economic profit considers both explicit and implicit costs.
7.2 Production in the Short Run
Production is the process a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g. labor, capital, raw materials, etc.) into outputs. It
is not possible to vary fixed inputs (e.g. capital) in a short period of time. Thus, in the short run the only way to
change output is to change the variable inputs (e.g. labor). Marginal product is the additional output a firm obtains
by employing more labor in production. At some point, employing additional labor leads to diminishing marginal
productivity, meaning the additional output obtained is less than for the previous increment to labor. Mathematically,
marginal product is the slope of the total product curve.
7.3 Costs in the Short Run
For every input (e.g. labor), there is an associated factor payment (e.g. wages and salaries). The cost of production for
a given quantity of output is the sum of the amount of each input required to produce that quantity of output times the
associated factor payment.
In a short-run perspective, we can divide a firm’s total costs into fixed costs, which a firm must incur before producing
any output, and variable costs, which the firm incurs in the act of producing. Fixed costs are sunk costs; that is,
because they are in the past and the firm cannot alter them, they should play no role in economic decisions about
future production or pricing. Variable costs typically show diminishing marginal returns, so that the marginal cost of
producing higher levels of output rises.
We calculate marginal cost by taking the change in total cost (or the change in variable cost, which will be the same
thing) and dividing it by the change in output, for each possible change in output. Marginal costs are typically rising.
A firm can compare marginal cost to the additional revenue it gains from selling another unit to find out whether its
marginal unit is adding to profit.
We calculate average total cost by taking total cost and dividing by total output at each different level of output.
Average costs are typically U-shaped on a graph. If a firm’s average cost of production is lower than the market price,
a firm will be earning profits.
We calculate average variable cost by taking variable cost and dividing by the total output at each level of output.
Average variable costs are typically U-shaped. If a firm’s average variable cost of production is lower than the market
price, then the firm would be earning profits if fixed costs are left out of the picture.
7.4 Production in the Long Run
In the long run, all inputs are variable. Since diminishing marginal productivity is caused by fixed capital, there are
no diminishing returns in the long run. Firms can choose the optimal capital stock to produce their desired level of
output.

7.5 Costs in the Long Run
A production technology refers to a specific combination of labor, physical capital, and technology that makes up a
particular method of production.
In the long run, firms can choose their production technology, and so all costs become variable costs. In making this
choice, firms will try to substitute relatively inexpensive inputs for relatively expensive inputs where possible, so as
to produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost.
Economies of scale refers to a situation where as the level of output increases, the average cost decreases. Constant
returns to scale refers to a situation where average cost does not change as output increases. Diseconomies of scale
refers to a situation where as output increases, average costs also increase.
The long-run average cost curve shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the inputs
to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology. A downward-sloping LRAC shows
economies of scale; a flat LRAC shows constant returns to scale; an upward-sloping LRAC shows diseconomies of
scale. If the long-run average cost curve has only one quantity produced that results in the lowest possible average
cost, then all of the firms competing in an industry should be the same size. However, if the LRAC has a flat segment
at the bottom, so that a firm can produce a range of different quantities at the lowest average cost, the firms competing
in the industry will display a range of sizes. The market demand in conjunction with the long-run average cost curve
determines how many firms will exist in a given industry.
If the quantity demanded in the market of a certain product is much greater than the quantity found at the bottom of
the long-run average cost curve, where the cost of production is lowest, the market will have many firms competing.
If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the bottom of the LRAC, there will likely be only
one firm.

A Dime a Dozen
When you were younger did you babysit, deliver papers, or mow the lawn for money? If so, you faced stiff
competition from many other competitors who offered identical services. There was nothing to stop others
from also offering their services.
All of you charged the “going rate.” If you tried to charge more, your customers would simply buy from
someone else. These conditions are very similar to the conditions agricultural growers face.
Growing a crop may be more difficult to start than a babysitting or lawn mowing service, but growers face the
same fierce competition. In the grand scale of world agriculture, farmers face competition from thousands of
others because they sell an identical product. After all, winter wheat is winter wheat, but if they find it hard to
make money with that crop, it is relatively easy for farmers to leave the marketplace for another crop. In this
case, they do not sell the family farm, they switch crops.
Take the case of the upper Midwest region of the United States—for many generations the area was
called “King Wheat.” According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics
Service, statistics by state, in 1997, 11.6 million acres of wheat and 780,000 acres of corn were planted in
North Dakota. In the intervening 20 or so years has the mix of crops changed? Since it is relatively easy to
switch crops, did farmers change what they planted in response to changes in relative crop prices? We will
find out at chapter’s end.
In the meantime, let's consider the topic of this chapter—the perfectly competitive market. This is a market in
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition

which entry and exit are relatively easy and competitors are “a dime a dozen.”
Introduction to Perfect Competition
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Perfect Competition and Why It Matters
•
How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions
•
Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run
•
Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets
Most businesses face two realities: no one is required to buy their products, and even customers who might want those
products may buy from other businesses instead. Firms that operate in perfectly competitive markets face this reality.
In this chapter, you will learn how such firms make decisions about how much to produce, how much profit they
make, whether to stay in business or not, and many others. Industries differ from one another in terms of how many
sellers there are in a specific market, how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter, and the type of products that
they sell. Economists refer to this as an industry's market structure. In this chapter, we focus on perfect competition.
However, in other chapters we will examine other industry types: Monopoly and Monopolistic Competition
and Oligopoly.
8.1 | Perfect Competition and Why It Matters
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market
•
Discuss how perfectly competitive firms react in the short run and in the long run
Firms are in perfect competition when the following conditions occur: (1) many firms produce identical products;
(2) many buyers are available to buy the product, and many sellers are available to sell the product; (3) sellers and
buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product that they are buying and selling;
and (4) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions—in other words, there is free entry and exit into
and out of the market.
A perfectly competitive firm is known as a price taker, because the pressure of competing firms forces it to accept
the prevailing equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product
by so much as a penny, it will lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower, as we discussed in the Bring
It Home feature, wants to know the going price of wheat, he or she has to check on the computer or listen to the radio.
Supply and demand in the entire market solely determine the market price, not the individual farmer. A perfectly
competitive firm must be a very small player in the overall market, so that it can increase or decrease output without
noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in the market.
A perfectly competitive market is a hypothetical extreme; however, producers in a number of industries do face
many competitor firms selling highly similar goods, in which case they must often act as price takers. Economists
often use agricultural markets as an example. The same crops that different farmers grow are largely interchangeable.
According to the United States Department of Agriculture monthly reports, in 2015, U.S. corn farmers received an
average price of $6.00 per bushel. A corn farmer who attempted to sell at $7.00 per bushel, would not have found
any buyers. A perfectly competitive firm will not sell below the equilibrium price either. Why should they when they
can sell all they want at the higher price? Other examples of agricultural markets that operate in close to perfectly
competitive markets are small roadside produce markets and small organic farmers.

This chapter examines how profit-seeking firms decide how much to produce in perfectly competitive markets. Such
firms will analyze their costs as we discussed in the chapter on Production, Costs and Industry Structure. In
the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity of output where profits are highest or, if profits are
not possible, where losses are lowest.
In the long run, positive economic profits will attract competition as other firms enter the market. Economic losses
will cause firms to exit the market. Ultimately, perfectly competitive markets will attain long-run equilibrium when
no new firms want to enter the market and existing firms do not want to leave the market, as economic profits have
been driven down to zero.
8.2 | How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output
Decisions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Calculate profits by comparing total revenue and total cost
•
Identify profits and losses with the average cost curve
•
Explain the shutdown point
•
Determine the price at which a firm should continue producing in the short run
A perfectly competitive firm has only one major decision to make—namely, what quantity to produce. To understand
this, consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of profit:
Profi = Total revenue −Total cost
         = (Price)(Quantity produced) −(Average cost)(Quantity produced)
Since a perfectly competitive firm must accept the price for its output as determined by the product’s market demand
and supply, it cannot choose the price it charges. This is already determined in the profit equation, and so the perfectly
competitive firm can sell any number of units at exactly the same price. It implies that the firm faces a perfectly
elastic demand curve for its product: buyers are willing to buy any number of units of output from the firm at the
market price. When the perfectly competitive firm chooses what quantity to produce, then this quantity—along with
the prices prevailing in the market for output and inputs—will determine the firm’s total revenue, total costs, and
ultimately, level of profits.
Determining the Highest Profit by Comparing Total Revenue and Total Cost
A perfectly competitive firm can sell as large a quantity as it wishes, as long as it accepts the prevailing market
price. The formula above shows that total revenue depends on the quantity sold and the price charged. If the firm
sells a higher quantity of output, then total revenue will increase. If the market price of the product increases, then
total revenue also increases whatever the quantity of output sold. As an example of how a perfectly competitive firm
decides what quantity to produce, consider the case of a small farmer who produces raspberries and sells them frozen
for $4 per pack. Sales of one pack of raspberries will bring in $4, two packs will be $8, three packs will be $12, and
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
197

so on. If, for example, the price of frozen raspberries doubles to $8 per pack, then sales of one pack of raspberries will
be $8, two packs will be $16, three packs will be $24, and so on.
Table 8.1 graphically shows total revenue and total costs for the raspberry farm, also appear in Figure 8.2. The
horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs. The vertical axis shows both total revenue
and total costs, measured in dollars. The total cost curve intersects with the vertical axis at a value that shows the
level of fixed costs, and then slopes upward. All these cost curves follow the same characteristics as the curves that
we covered in the Production, Costs and Industry Structure chapter.
Figure 8.2 Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm Total revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is a
straight line sloping up. The slope is equal to the price of the good. Total cost also slopes up, but with some
curvature. At higher levels of output, total cost begins to slope upward more steeply because of diminishing marginal
returns. The maximum profit will occur at the quantity where the difference between total revenue and total cost is
largest.

Table 8.1 Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm
Based on its total revenue and total cost curves, a perfectly competitive firm like the raspberry farm can calculate the
quantity of output that will provide the highest level of profit. At any given quantity, total revenue minus total cost
will equal profit. One way to determine the most profitable quantity to produce is to see at what quantity total revenue
exceeds total cost by the largest amount. Figure 8.2 shows total revenue, total cost and profit using the data from
Table 8.1. The vertical gap between total revenue and total cost is profit, for example, at Q = 60, TR = 240 and TC =
165. The difference is 75, which is the height of the profit curve at that output level. The firm doesn’t make a profit at
every level of output. In this example, total costs will exceed total revenues at output levels from 0 to approximately
30, and so over this range of output, the firm will be making losses. At output levels from 40 to 100, total revenues
exceed total costs, so the firm is earning profits. However, at any output greater than 100, total costs again exceed total
revenues and the firm is making increasing losses. Total profits appear in the final column of Table 8.1. Maximum
profit occurs at an output between 70 and 80, when profit equals $90.
A higher price would mean that total revenue would be higher for every quantity sold. A lower price would mean that
total revenue would be lower for every quantity sold. What happens if the price drops low enough so that the total
revenue line is completely below the total cost curve; that is, at every level of output, total costs are higher than total
revenues? In this instance, the best the firm can do is to suffer losses. However, a profit-maximizing firm will prefer
the quantity of output where total revenues come closest to total costs and thus where the losses are smallest.
(Later we will see that sometimes it will make sense for the firm to close, rather than stay in operation producing
output.)
Comparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Costs
The approach that we described in the previous section, using total revenue and total cost, is not the only approach
to determining the profit maximizing level of output. In this section, we provide an alternative approach which uses
marginal revenue and marginal cost.
Firms often do not have the necessary data they need to draw a complete total cost curve for all levels of production.
They cannot be sure of what total costs would look like if they, say, doubled production or cut production in half,
because they have not tried it. Instead, firms experiment. They produce a slightly greater or lower quantity and
observe how it affects profits. In economic terms, this practical approach to maximizing profits means examining how
changes in production affect marginal revenue and marginal cost.
Figure 8.3 presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in Table
8.1. The marginal revenue curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit. As mentioned
before, a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product—that is, the firm’s demand
curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level. This also means that the firm’s marginal revenue curve is
the same as the firm’s demand curve: Every time a consumer demands one more unit, the firm sells one more unit and
revenue increases by exactly the same amount equal to the market price. In this example, every time the firm sells a
pack of frozen raspberries, the firm’s revenue increases by $4. Table 8.2 shows an example of this. This condition
only holds for price taking firms in perfect competition where:
marginal revenue = price
The formula for marginal revenue is:
marginal revenue = change in total revenue
change in quantity

Table 8.2
Notice that marginal revenue does not change as the firm produces more output. That is because under perfect
competition, the price is determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market and does not change
as the farmer produces more (keeping in mind that, due to the relative small size of each firm, increasing their supply
has no impact on the total market supply where price is determined).
Since a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell whatever quantity it wishes at the market-determined
price. We calculate marginal cost, the cost per additional unit sold, by dividing the change in total cost by the change
in quantity. The formula for marginal cost is:
marginal cost = change in total cost
change in quantity
Ordinarily, marginal cost changes as the firm produces a greater quantity.
In the raspberry farm example, in Figure 8.3, Figure 8.4 and Table 8.3, marginal cost at first declines as
production increases from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 packs of raspberries—which represents the area of increasing marginal
returns that is not uncommon at low levels of production. At some point, though, marginal costs start to increase,
displaying the typical pattern of diminishing marginal returns. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MR > MC,
like 40 or 50 packs of raspberries, then it can increase profit by increasing output because the marginal revenue is
exceeding the marginal cost. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MC > MR, like 90 or 100 packs, then it
can increase profit by reducing output because the reductions in marginal cost will exceed the reductions in marginal
revenue. The firm’s profit-maximizing choice of output will occur where MR = MC (or at a choice close to that point).

Figure 8.3 Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm: Individual Farmer For a perfectly
competitive firm, the marginal revenue (MR) curve is a horizontal line because it is equal to the price of the good,
which is determined by the market, as Figure 8.4 illustrates. The marginal cost (MC) curve is sometimes initially
downward-sloping, if there is a region of increasing marginal returns at low levels of output, but is eventually upward-
sloping at higher levels of output as diminishing marginal returns kick in.

price of raspberries is determined through the interaction of market supply and market demand at $4.00.

Table 8.3 Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm
In this example, the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves cross at a price of $4 and a quantity of 80 produced.
If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60, and then experimented with increasing production to 70, marginal
revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs—and so profits would rise. The farmer has an
incentive to keep producing. At a level of output of 80, marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal so profit doesn’t
change. If the farmer then experimented further with increasing production from 80 to 90, he would find that marginal
costs from the increase in production are greater than marginal revenues, and so profits would decline.
The profit-maximizing choice for a perfectly competitive firm will occur at the level of output where marginal
revenue is equal to marginal cost—that is, where MR = MC. This occurs at Q = 80 in the figure.
Does Profit Maximization Occur at a Range of Output or a Specific
Level of Output?
Table 8.1 shows that maximum profit occurs at any output level between 70 and 80 units of output. But MR =
MC occurs only at 80 units of output. How can do we explain this slight discrepancy? As long as MR > MC.
a profit-seeking firm should keep expanding production. Expanding production into the zone where MR < MC
reduces economic profits. It’s true that profit is the same at Q = 70 and Q = 80, but it’s only when the firm goes
beyond that that see that profits fall. Thus, MR = MC is the signal to stop expanding, so that is the level of
output they should target.
Because the marginal revenue received by a perfectly competitive firm is equal to the price P, we can also write the
profit-maximizing rule for a perfectly competitive firm as a recommendation to produce at the quantity of output
where P = MC.
Profits and Losses with the Average Cost Curve
Does maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual economic profit? The answer depends on the
relationship between price and average total cost, which is the average profit or profit margin. If the market price
is higher than the firm's average cost of production for that quantity produced, then the profit margin is positive and
the firm will earn profits. Conversely, if the market price is lower than the average cost of production, the profit
margin is negative and the firm will suffer losses. You might think that, in this situation, the firm may want to shut

down immediately. Remember, however, that the firm has already paid for fixed costs, such as equipment, so it may
continue to produce for a while and incur a loss. Table 8.3 continues the raspberry farm example. Figure 8.5
illustrates the three possible scenarios: (a) where price intersects marginal cost at a level above the average cost curve,
(b) where price intersects marginal cost at a level equal to the average cost curve, and (c) where price intersects
marginal cost at a level below the average cost curve.
Figure 8.5 Price and Average Cost at the Raspberry Farm In (a), price intersects marginal cost above the average
cost curve. Since price is greater than average cost, the firm is making a profit. In (b), price intersects marginal cost at
the minimum point of the average cost curve. Since price is equal to average cost, the firm is breaking even. In (c),
price intersects marginal cost below the average cost curve. Since price is less than average cost, the firm is making
a loss.
First consider a situation where the price is equal to $5 for a pack of frozen raspberries. The rule for a profit-
maximizing perfectly competitive firm is to produce the level of output where Price= MR = MC, so the raspberry
farmer will produce a quantity of approximately 85, which is labeled as E' in Figure 8.5 (a). Remember that the area
of a rectangle is equal to its base multiplied by its height. The farm’s total revenue at this price will be shown by the
rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 85 packs (the base) up to point E' (the height), over to the price of $5,
and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 80 packs is shown by point C or about $3.50. Total costs will
be the quantity of 85 times the average cost of $3.50, which is shown by the area of the rectangle from the origin to a
quantity of 90, up to point C, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin. The difference between total revenues
and total costs is profits. Thus, profits will be the blue shaded rectangle on top.
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
203

We calculate this as:
profi
= total revenue −total cost
= (85)($5.00) −(85)($3.50)
= $170
Or, we can calculate it as:
profi
= (price – average cost) × quantity
= ($5.00 – $3.50) × 85
= $170
Now consider Figure 8.5 (b), where the price has fallen to $2.75 for a pack of frozen raspberries. Again, the perfectly
competitive firm will choose the level of output where Price = MR = MC, but in this case, the quantity produced will
be 75. At this price and output level, where the marginal cost curve is crossing the average cost curve, the price the
firm receives is exactly equal to its average cost of production. We call this the break even point.
The farm’s total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a quantity
of 75 packs (the base) up to point E (the height), over to the price of $2.75, and back to the origin. The height of
the average cost curve at Q = 75, i.e. point E, shows the average cost of producing this quantity. Total costs will be
the quantity of 75 times the average cost of $2.75, which is shown by the area of the rectangle from the origin to a
quantity of 75, up to point E, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin. It should be clear that the rectangles for
total revenue and total cost are the same. Thus, the firm is making zero profit. The calculations are as follows:
profi
= total revenue – total cost
= (75)($2.75) – (75)($2.75)
= $0
Or, we can calculate it as:
profi
= (price – average cost)×quantity
= ($2.75 – $2.75)×75
= $0
In Figure 8.5 (c), the market price has fallen still further to $2.00 for a pack of frozen raspberries. At this price,
marginal revenue intersects marginal cost at a quantity of 65. The farm’s total revenue at this price will be shown by
the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 65 packs (the base) up to point E” (the height), over
to the price of $2, and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 65 packs is shown by Point C” or shows the
average cost of producing 50 packs is about $2.73. Total costs will be the quantity of 65 times the average cost of
$2.73, which the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 50, up to point C”, over to the vertical axis and
down to the origin shows. It should be clear from examining the two rectangles that total revenue is less than total
cost. Thus, the firm is losing money and the loss (or negative profit) will be the rose-shaded rectangle.
The calculations are:
profi
= (total revenue –  total cost)
= (65)($2.00) – (65)($2.73)
= –$47.45
Or:
profi
= (price – average cost) × quantity
= ($2.00 – $2.73) × 65
= –$47.45
If the market price that perfectly competitive firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is greater
than average cost, the firm will earn profits. If the price the firm receives causes it to produce at a quantity where price
equals average cost, which occurs at the minimum point of the AC curve, then the firm earns zero profits. Finally, if
the price the firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is less than average cost, the firm will earn
losses. Table 8.4 summarizes this.

Table 8.4
Which intersection should a firm choose?
At a price of $2, MR intersects MC at two points: Q = 20 and Q = 65. It never makes sense for a firm to choose
a level of output on the downward sloping part of the MC curve, because the profit is lower (the loss is bigger).
Thus, the correct choice of output is Q = 65.
The Shutdown Point
The possibility that a firm may earn losses raises a question: Why can the firm not avoid losses by shutting down and
not producing at all? The answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero, but in the short run, the firm
has already paid for fixed costs. As a result, if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would still make losses because
it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. Therefore when a firm is experiencing losses, it must face a question:
should it continue producing or should it shut down?
As an example, consider the situation of the Yoga Center, which has signed a contract to rent space that costs $10,000
per month. If the firm decides to operate, its marginal costs for hiring yoga teachers is $15,000 for the month. If
the firm shuts down, it must still pay the rent, but it would not need to hire labor. Table 8.5 shows three possible
scenarios. In the first scenario, the Yoga Center does not have any clients, and therefore does not make any revenues,
in which case it faces losses of $10,000 equal to the fixed costs. In the second scenario, the Yoga Center has clients
that earn the center revenues of $10,000 for the month, but ultimately experiences losses of $15,000 due to having
to hire yoga instructors to cover the classes. In the third scenario, the Yoga Center earns revenues of $20,000 for the
month, but experiences losses of $5,000.
In all three cases, the Yoga Center loses money. In all three cases, when the rental contract expires in the long run,
assuming revenues do not improve, the firm should exit this business. In the short run, though, the decision varies
depending on the level of losses and whether the firm can cover its variable costs. In scenario 1, the center does not
have any revenues, so hiring yoga teachers would increase variable costs and losses, so it should shut down and only
incur its fixed costs. In scenario 2, the center’s losses are greater because it does not make enough revenue to offset
the increased variable costs, so it should shut down immediately and only incur its fixed costs. If price is below the
minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down. In contrast, in scenario 3 the revenue that the center can
earn is high enough that the losses diminish when it remains open, so the center should remain open in the short run.
Scenario 1
If the center shuts down now, revenues are zero but it will not incur any variable costs and would only
need to pay fixed costs of $10,000.
Table 8.5 Should the Yoga Center Shut Down Now or Later?
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
205

profit = otal revenue–(fi ed costs + variable cost)
          = 0 –$10,000
          = –$10,000
Scenario 2
The center earns revenues of $10,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should shut down
now.
profit = otal revenue –  (fi ed costs + variable cost)
          = $10,000 –  ($10,000 + $15,000)
          = –$15,000
Scenario 3
The center earns revenues of $20,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should continue in
business.
profit = otal revenue –  (fi ed costs + variable cost)
          = $20,000 –  ($10,000 + $15,000)
          = –$5,000
Table 8.5 Should the Yoga Center Shut Down Now or Later?
Figure 8.6 illustrates the lesson that remaining open requires the price to exceed the firm’s average variable cost.
When the firm is operating below the break-even point, where price equals average cost, it is operating at a loss so it
faces two options: continue to produce and lose money or shutdown. Which option is preferable? The one that loses
the least money is the best choice.
At a price of $2.00 per pack, as Figure 8.6 (a) illustrates, if the farm stays in operation it will produce at a level of 65
packs of raspberries, and it will make losses of $47.45 (as explained earlier). The alternative would be to shutdown
and lose all the fixed costs of $62.00. Since losing $47.45 is preferable to losing $62.00, the profit maximizing (or in
this case the loss minimizing) choice is to stay in operation. The key reason is because price is above average variable
cost. This means that at the current price the farm can pay all its variable costs, and have some revenue left over to
pay some of the fixed costs. So the loss represents the part of the fixed costs the farm can’t pay, which is less than the
entire fixed costs. However, if the price declined to $1.50 per pack, as Figure 8.6 shows (b), and if the firm applied
its rule of producing where P = MR = MC, it would produce a quantity of 60. This price is below average variable
cost for this level of output. If the farmer cannot pay workers (the variable costs), then it has to shut down. At this
price and output, total revenues would be $90 (quantity of 60 times price of $1.50) and total cost would be $165, for
overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62, so shutting down is preferable to
selling at a price of $1.50 per pack.

Figure 8.6 The Shutdown Point for the Raspberry Farm In (a), the farm produces at a level of 65. It is making
losses of $47.50, but price is above average variable cost, so it continues to operate. In (b), total revenues are $90
and total cost is $165, for overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62.
Shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.50 per pack.
Looking at Table 8.6, if the price falls below about $1.65, the minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut
down.

The intersection of the average variable cost curve and the marginal cost curve, which shows the price below which
the firm would lack enough revenue to cover its variable costs, is called the shutdown point. If the perfectly
competitive firm faces a market price above the shutdown point, then the firm is at least covering its average variable
costs. At a price above the shutdown point, the firm is also making enough revenue to cover at least a portion of fixed
costs, so it should limp ahead even if it is making losses in the short run, since at least those losses will be smaller
than if the firm shuts down immediately and incurs a loss equal to total fixed costs. However, if the firm is receiving a
price below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm is not even covering its variable costs. In this case, staying
open is making the firm’s losses larger, and it should shut down immediately. To summarize, if:
•
price < minimum average variable cost, then firm shuts down
•
price > minimum average variable cost, then firm stays in business
Short-Run Outcomes for Perfectly Competitive Firms
The average cost and average variable cost curves divide the marginal cost curve into three segments, as Figure 8.7
shows. At the market price, which the perfectly competitive firm accepts as given, the profit-maximizing firm chooses
the output level where price or marginal revenue, which are the same thing for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal
to marginal cost: P = MR = MC.
Figure 8.7 Profit, Loss, Shutdown We can divide marginal cost curve into three zones, based on where it is
crossed by the average cost and average variable cost curves. We call the point where MC crosses AC the break
even point. If the firm is operating where the market price is at a level higher than the break even point, then price will
be greater than average cost and the firm is earning profits. If the price is exactly at the break even point, then the
firm is making zero profits. If price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the break even point, then the
firm is making losses but will continue to operate in the short run, since it is covering its variable costs, and more if
price is above the shutdown-point price. However, if price falls below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm will
shut down immediately, since it is not even covering its variable costs.
First consider the upper zone, where prices are above the level where marginal cost (MC) crosses average cost (AC)
at the zero profit point. At any price above that level, the firm will earn profits in the short run. If the price falls
exactly on the break even point where the MC and AC curves cross, then the firm earns zero profits. If a price falls
into the zone between the break even point, where MC crosses AC, and the shutdown point, where MC crosses AVC,
the firm will be making losses in the short run—but since the firm is more than covering its variable costs, the losses
208
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition

are smaller than if the firm shut down immediately. Finally, consider a price at or below the shutdown point where
MC crosses AVC. At any price like this one, the firm will shut down immediately, because it cannot even cover its
variable costs.
Marginal Cost and the Firm’s Supply Curve
For a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve is identical to the firm’s supply curve starting from the
minimum point on the average variable cost curve. To understand why this perhaps surprising insight holds true, first
think about what the supply curve means. A firm checks the market price and then looks at its supply curve to decide
what quantity to produce. Now, think about what it means to say that a firm will maximize its profits by producing at
the quantity where P = MC. This rule means that the firm checks the market price, and then looks at its marginal cost
to determine the quantity to produce—and makes sure that the price is greater than the minimum average variable
cost. In other words, the marginal cost curve above the minimum point on the average variable cost curve becomes
the firm’s supply curve.
Watch this video (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/foodprice) that addresses how drought in the United States can
impact food prices across the world. (Note that the story on the drought is the second one in the news report.
You need to let the video play through the first story in order to watch the story on the drought.)
As we discussed in the chapter on Demand and Supply, many of the reasons that supply curves shift relate to
underlying changes in costs. For example, a lower price of key inputs or new technologies that reduce production
costs cause supply to shift to the right. In contrast, bad weather or added government regulations can add to costs of
certain goods in a way that causes supply to shift to the left. We can also interpret these shifts in the firm’s supply
curve as shifts of the marginal cost curve. A shift in costs of production that increases marginal costs at all levels of
output—and shifts MC upward and to the left—will cause a perfectly competitive firm to produce less at any given
market price. Conversely, a shift in costs of production that decreases marginal costs at all levels of output will shift
MC downward and to the right and as a result, a competitive firm will choose to expand its level of output at any
given price. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through an example.

Step 5. Once you have determined the profit-maximizing output level (in this case, output quantity 5), you can look
at the amount of profits made (in this case, $40).
Step 6. If the firm is making economic losses, the firm needs to determine whether it produces the output level where
price equals marginal revenue and equals marginal cost or it shuts down and only incurs its fixed costs.
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
211

Step 7. For the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, check if the market price is greater than
the average variable cost of producing that output level.
•
If P > AVC but P < ATC, then the firm continues to produce in the short-run, making economic losses.
•
If P < AVC, then the firm stops producing and only incurs its fixed costs.
In this example, the price of $28 is greater than the AVC ($16.40) of producing 5 units of output, so the firm continues
producing.
8.3 | Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain how entry and exit lead to zero profits in the long run
•
Discuss the long-run adjustment process
It is impossible to precisely define the line between the short run and the long run with a stopwatch, or even with a
calendar. It varies according to the specific business. Therefore, the distinction between the short run and the long run
is more technical: in the short run, firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the long run, the firm can
adjust all factors of production.
In a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses to charge. If a business is making a profit in the
short run, it has an incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms may start production, as
well. When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called entry.
Losses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a business is making losses in the short run, it
will either keep limping along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs.
But in the long run, firms that are facing losses will cease production altogether. The long-run process of reducing
production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called exit. The following Clear It Up feature discusses
where some of these losses might come from, and the reasons why some firms go out of business.
Why do firms cease to exist?
Can we say anything about what causes a firm to exit an industry? Profits are the measurement that
determines whether a business stays operating or not. Individuals start businesses with the purpose of making
profits. They invest their money, time, effort, and many other resources to produce and sell something that
they hope will give them something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful, and many new
startups soon realize that their “business venture” must eventually end.
In the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently cannot make money will “exit,” which is
a nice, bloodless word for a more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose their jobs,
investors lose their money, and owners and managers can lose their dreams. Many businesses fail. The U.S.
Small Business Administration indicates that in 2011, 534,907 new firms "entered," and 575,691 firms failed.
Sometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are not very productive, or
because of tough domestic or foreign competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes. For example,
conditions of demand and supply in the market may shift in an unexpected way, so that the prices that
a business charges for outputs fall or the prices for inputs rise. With millions of businesses in the U.S.
economy, even a small fraction of them failing will affect many people—and business failures can be very
hard on the workers and managers directly involved. However, from the standpoint of the overall economic
system, business exits are sometimes a necessary evil if a market-oriented system is going to offer a flexible
mechanism for satisfying customers, keeping costs low, and inventing new products.

How Entry and Exit Lead to Zero Profits in the Long Run
No perfectly competitive firm acting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many firms
entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the market as a
whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that,
in the long run, pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit.
To understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run, imagine the
following situation. The market is in long-run equilibrium, where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the
output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC. No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market. Let’s say that
the product’s demand increases, and with that, the market price goes up. The existing firms in the industry are now
facing a higher price than before, so they will increase production to the new output level where P = MR = MC.
This will temporarily make the market price rise above the minimum point on the average cost curve, and therefore,
the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic profits attract other
firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As the supply
curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, and with that, economic profits fall for new and existing
firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift supply to the right. This will stop
whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no firm is earning economic profits.
Short-run losses will fade away by reversing this process. Say that the market is in long-run equilibrium. This time,
instead, demand decreases, and with that, the market price starts falling. The existing firms in the industry are now
facing a lower price than before, and as it will be below the average cost curve, they will now be making economic
losses. Some firms will continue producing where the new P = MR = MC, as long as they are able to cover their
average variable costs. Some firms will have to shut down immediately as they will not be able to cover their average
variable costs, and will then only incur their fixed costs, minimizing their losses. Exit of many firms causes the market
supply curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the market price starts rising, and economic
losses start to be lower. This process ends whenever the market price rises to the zero-profit level, where the existing
firms are no longer losing money and are at zero profits again. Thus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn
profits in the short run, in the long run the process of entry will push down prices until they reach the zero-profit
level. Conversely, while a perfectly competitive firm may earn losses in the short run, firms will not continually lose
money. In the long run, firms making losses are able to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market
will push the price back up to the zero-profit level. In the long run, this process of entry and exit will drive the price
in perfectly competitive markets to the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC curve, where marginal cost crosses
average cost.
The Long-Run Adjustment and Industry Types
Whenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for the existing and new firms could either stay
the same, increase, or even decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being (1) a constant cost industry
(as demand increases, the cost of production for firms stays the same), (2) an increasing cost industry (as demand
increases, the cost of production for firms increases), or (3) a decreasing cost industry (as demand increases the costs
of production for the firms decreases).
For a constant cost industry, whenever there is an increase in market demand and price, then the supply curve shifts to
the right with new firms’ entry and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium intersects at the same market
price as before. This is the case of constant returns to scale, which we discussed earlier in the chapter on Production,
Costs, and Industry Structure. However, why will costs remain the same? In this type of industry, the supply curve
is very elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers demand. In addition, there is a perfectly elastic
supply of inputs—firms can easily increase their demand for employees, for example, with no increase to wages.
Tying in to our Bring it Home discussion, an increased demand for ethanol in recent years has caused the demand for
corn to increase. Consequently, many farmers switched from growing wheat to growing corn. Agricultural markets
are generally good examples of constant cost industries.
For an increasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of
production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. Here companies may have
to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor. As the demand for these workers rise, wages rise and this increases
the cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type of industry is more inelastic.
For a decreasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience lower costs of production,
which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case, the industry and all the
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
213

firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs. This can be due to an improvement in technology in the entire
industry or an increase in the education of employees. High tech industries may be a good example of a decreasing
cost market.
Figure 8.8 (a) presents the case of an adjustment process in a constant cost industry. Whenever there are output
expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more output produced at exactly the same original
price. Note that supply was able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the before and after long-run
equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run supply (LRS) curve in perfectly competitive markets. In this case, it is
a flat curve. Figure 8.8 (b) and Figure 8.8 (c) present the cases for an increasing cost and decreasing cost industry,
respectively. For an increasing cost industry, the LRS is upward sloping, while for a decreasing cost industry, the LRS
is downward sloping.
Figure 8.8 Adjustment Process in a Constant-Cost Industry In (a), demand increased and supply met it. Notice
that the supply increase is equal to the demand increase. The result is that the equilibrium price stays the same as
quantity sold increases. In (b), notice that sellers were not able to increase supply as much as demand. Some inputs
were scarce, or wages were rising. The equilibrium price rises. In (c), sellers easily increased supply in response to
the demand increase. Here, new technology or economies of scale caused the large increase in supply, resulting in
declining equilibrium price.
8.4 | Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Apply concepts of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency to perfectly competitive markets
•
Compare the model of perfect competition to real-world markets
When profit-maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility-maximizing consumers,
something remarkable happens: the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive
and allocative efficiency (terms that we first introduced in (Choice in a World of Scarcity) .
Productive efficiency means producing without waste, so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier. In
the long run in a perfectly competitive market, because of the process of entry and exit, the price in the market is
equal to the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In other words, firms produce and sell goods at the lowest
possible average cost.
Allocative efficiency means that among the points on the production possibility frontier, the chosen point is socially
preferred—at least in a particular and specific sense. In a perfectly competitive market, price will be equal to the
marginal cost of production. Think about the price that one pays for a good as a measure of the social benefit one
receives for that good; after all, willingness to pay conveys what the good is worth to a buyer. Then think about the
marginal cost of producing the good as representing not just the cost for the firm, but more broadly as the social cost
of producing that good. When perfectly competitive firms follow the rule that profits are maximized by producing at
the quantity where price is equal to marginal cost, they are thus ensuring that the social benefits they receive from
producing a good are in line with the social costs of production.
To explore what economists mean by allocative efficiency, it is useful to walk through an example. Begin by assuming
214
Chapter 8 | Perfect Competition
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive, and so P = MC. Now, consider what it would mean
if firms in that market produced a lesser quantity of flowers. At a lesser quantity, marginal costs will not yet have
increased as much, so that price will exceed marginal cost; that is, P > MC. In that situation, the benefit to society as
a whole of producing additional goods, as measured by the willingness of consumers to pay for marginal units of a
good, would be higher than the cost of the inputs of labor and physical capital needed to produce the marginal good.
In other words, the gains to society as a whole from producing additional marginal units will be greater than the costs.
Conversely, consider what it would mean if, compared to the level of output at the allocatively efficient choice when
P = MC, firms produced a greater quantity of flowers. At a greater quantity, marginal costs of production will have
increased so that P < MC. In that case, the marginal costs of producing additional flowers is greater than the benefit
to society as measured by what people are willing to pay. For society as a whole, since the costs are outstripping the
benefits, it will make sense to produce a lower quantity of such goods.
When perfectly competitive firms maximize their profits by producing the quantity where P = MC, they also assure
that the benefits to consumers of what they are buying, as measured by the price they are willing to pay, is equal to
the costs to society of producing the marginal units, as measured by the marginal costs the firm must pay—and thus
that allocative efficiency holds.
We should view the statements that a perfectly competitive market in the long run will feature both productive
and allocative efficiency with a degree of skepticism about its truth. Remember, economists are using the concept
of “efficiency” in a particular and specific sense, not as a synonym for “desirable in every way.” For one thing,
consumers’ ability to pay reflects the income distribution in a particular society. Thus, a homeless person may have
no ability to pay for housing because he or she has insufficient income.
Perfect competition, in the long run, is a hypothetical benchmark. For market structures such as monopoly,
monopolistic competition, and oligopoly, which are more frequently observed in the real world than perfect
competition, firms will not always produce at the minimum of average cost, nor will they always set price equal to
marginal cost. Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and allocative efficiency.
Moreover, real-world markets include many issues that are assumed away in the model of perfect competition,
including pollution, inventions of new technology, poverty which may make some people unable to pay for basic
necessities of life, government programs like national defense or education, discrimination in labor markets, and
buyers and sellers who must deal with imperfect and unclear information. We explore these issues in other chapters.
However, the theoretical efficiency of perfect competition does provide a useful benchmark for comparing the issues
that arise from these real-world problems.
A Dime a Dozen
A quick glance at Table 8.12 reveals the dramatic increase in North Dakota corn production—more than
double. Taking into consideration that corn typically yields two to three times as many bushels per acre
as wheat, it is obvious there has been a significant increase in bushels of corn. Why the increase in corn
acreage? Converging prices.

Historically, wheat prices have been higher than corn prices, offsetting wheat’s lower yield per acre. However,
in recent years wheat and corn prices have been converging. In April 2013, Agweek reported the gap was just
71 cents per bushel. As the difference in price narrowed, switching to the production of higher yield per acre
of corn simply made good business sense. Erik Younggren, president of the National Association of Wheat
Growers said in the Agweek article, “I don't think we're going to see mile after mile of waving amber fields [of

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
8.1 Perfect Competition and Why It Matters
A perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, which means that it must accept the equilibrium price at which it sells
goods. If a perfectly competitive firm attempts to charge even a tiny amount more than the market price, it will be
unable to make any sales. In a perfectly competitive market there are thousands of sellers, easy entry, and identical
products. A short-run production period is when firms are producing with some fixed inputs. Long-run equilibrium
in a perfectly competitive industry occurs after all firms have entered and exited the industry and seller profits are
driven to zero.
Perfect competition means that there are many sellers, there is easy entry and exiting of firms, products are identical
from one seller to another, and sellers are price takers.
8.2 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions
As a perfectly competitive firm produces a greater quantity of output, its total revenue steadily increases at a constant
rate determined by the given market price. Profits will be highest (or losses will be smallest) at the quantity of output
where total revenues exceed total costs by the greatest amount (or where total revenues fall short of total costs by
the smallest amount). Alternatively, profits will be highest where marginal revenue, which is price for a perfectly
competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost. If the market price faced by a perfectly competitive firm is above average
cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making profits. If the market price is below average
cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making losses.
If the market price is equal to average cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, then the firm is making zero
profits. We call the point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average cost curve, at the minimum of the average
cost curve, the “zero profit point.” If the market price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is below average variable
cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm should shut down operations immediately. If the market
price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is above average variable cost, but below average cost, then the firm
should continue producing in the short run, but exit in the long run. We call the point where the marginal cost curve
crosses the average variable cost curve the shutdown point.

8.3 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run
In the long run, firms will respond to profits through a process of entry, where existing firms expand output and
new firms enter the market. Conversely, firms will react to losses in the long run through a process of exit, in which
existing firms cease production altogether. Through the process of entry in response to profits and exit in response to
losses, the price level in a perfectly competitive market will move toward the zero-profit point, where the marginal
cost curve crosses the AC curve at the minimum of the average cost curve.
The long-run supply curve shows the long-run output supplied by firms in three different types of industries: constant
cost, increasing cost, and decreasing cost.
8.4 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets
Long-run equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets meets two important conditions: allocative efficiency and
productive efficiency. These two conditions have important implications. First, resources are allocated to their best
alternative use. Second, they provide the maximum satisfaction attainable by society.
SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS
1.
Firms in a perfectly competitive market are said to be “price takers”—that is, once the market determines an
equilibrium price for the product, firms must accept this price. If you sell a product in a perfectly competitive market,
but you are not happy with its price, would you raise the price, even by a cent?
2. Would independent trucking fit the characteristics of a perfectly competitive industry?

9 | Monopoly
Figure 9.1 Political Power from a Cotton Monopoly In the mid-nineteenth century, the United States, specifically
the Southern states, had a near monopoly in the cotton that they supplied to Great Britain. These states attempted to
leverage this economic power into political power—trying to sway Great Britain to formally recognize the Confederate
States of America. (Credit: modification of work by “ashleylovespizza”/Flickr Creative Commons)
The Rest is History
Many of the opening case studies have focused on current events. This one steps into the past to observe
how monopoly, or near monopolies, have helped shape history. In spring 1773, the East India Company, a
firm that, in its time, was designated “too big to fail,” was experiencing financial difficulties. To help shore up
the failing firm, the British Parliament authorized the Tea Act. The act continued the tax on teas and made
the East India Company the sole legal supplier of tea to the American colonies. By November, the citizens
of Boston had had enough. They refused to permit the unloading of tea, citing their main complaint: “No
taxation without representation.” Several newspapers, including The Massachusetts Gazette, warned arriving
tea-bearing ships, “We are prepared, and shall not fail to pay them an unwelcome visit by The Mohawks.”
Step forward in time to 1860—the eve of the American Civil War—to another near monopoly supplier of
historical significance: the U.S. cotton industry. At that time, the Southern states provided the majority of
the cotton Britain imported. The South, wanting to secede from the Union, hoped to leverage Britain’s high
dependency on its cotton into formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America.
This leads us to this chapter's topic: a firm that controls all (or nearly all) of the supply of a good or service—a
monopoly. How do monopoly firms behave in the marketplace? Do they have “power?” Does this power
potentially have unintended consequences? We’ll return to this case at the end of the chapter to see how the
tea and cotton monopolies influenced U.S. history.
Chapter 9 | Monopoly

Introduction to a Monopoly
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
How Monopolies form: Barriers to Entry
•
How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price
Many believe that top executives at firms are the strongest supporters of market competition, but this belief is far
from the truth. Think about it this way: If you very much wanted to win an Olympic gold medal, would you rather
be far better than everyone else, or locked in competition with many athletes just as good as you? Similarly, if you
would like to attain a very high level of profits, would you rather manage a business with little or no competition, or
struggle against many tough competitors who are trying to sell to your customers? By now, you might have read the
chapter on Perfect Competition. In this chapter, we explore the opposite extreme: monopoly.
If perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price,
monopoly is a market with no competition at all, and firms have a great deal of market power. In the case of
monopoly, one firm produces all of the output in a market. Since a monopoly faces no significant competition, it can
charge any price it wishes, subject to the demand curve. While a monopoly, by definition, refers to a single firm, in
practice people often use the term to describe a market in which one firm merely has a very high market share. This
tends to be the definition that the U.S. Department of Justice uses.
Even though there are very few true monopolies in existence, we do deal with some of those few every day, often
without realizing it: The U.S. Postal Service, your electric, and garbage collection companies are a few examples.
Some new drugs are produced by only one pharmaceutical firm—and no close substitutes for that drug may exist.
From the mid-1990s until 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted the Microsoft Corporation for including
Internet Explorer as the default web browser with its operating system. The Justice Department’s argument was that,
since Microsoft possessed an extremely high market share in the industry for operating systems, the inclusion of a free
web browser constituted unfair competition to other browsers, such as Netscape Navigator. Since nearly everyone
was using Windows, including Internet Explorer eliminated the incentive for consumers to explore other browsers
and made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold in the market. In 2013, the Windows system ran on more
than 90% of the most commonly sold personal computers. In 2015, a U.S. federal court tossed out antitrust charges
that Google had an agreement with mobile device makers to set Google as the default search engine.
This chapter begins by describing how monopolies are protected from competition, including laws that prohibit
competition, technological advantages, and certain configurations of demand and supply. It then discusses how a
monopoly will choose its profit-maximizing quantity to produce and what price to charge. While a monopoly must
be concerned about whether consumers will purchase its products or spend their money on something altogether
different, the monopolist need not worry about the actions of other competing firms producing its products. As a
result, a monopoly is not a price taker like a perfectly competitive firm, but instead exercises some power to choose
its market price.
9.1 | How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Distinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.
•
Explain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources led to the necessary formation of
legal monopolies
•
Analyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting innovation
•
Identify examples of predatory pricing
Because of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant economic profits. These profits should attract
vigorous competition as we described in Perfect Competition, and yet, because of one particular characteristic of
monopoly, they do not. Barriers to entry are the legal, technological, or market forces that discourage or prevent
potential competitors from entering a market. Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable,
224
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive. For example, there are a finite number of radio
frequencies available for broadcasting. Once an entrepreneur or firm has purchased the rights to all of them, no new
competitors can enter the market.
In some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases, they may limit competition to a few firms.
Barriers may block entry even if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus, in markets with
significant barriers to entry, it is not necessarily true that abnormally high profits will attract new firms, and that this
entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that surviving firms earn only a normal level of profit
in the long run.
There are two types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit. One is natural monopoly,
where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition. The other is legal monopoly, where laws
prohibit (or severely limit) competition.
Natural Monopoly
Economies of scale can combine with the size of the market to limit competition. (We introduced this theme in
Production, Cost and Industry Structure). Figure 9.2 presents a long-run average cost curve for the airplane
manufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of P0, then
constant returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies of scale at a quantity of production
greater than 20,000 planes per year.
Now consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve
at an output level of 5,000 planes per year and at a price P1, which is higher than P0. In this situation, the market
has room for only one producer. If a second firm attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by producing a
quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than those of the existing firm, and it will be unable
to compete. If the second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000 planes per year, then it could
produce at a lower average cost—but it could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced because of insufficient demand
in the market.
Figure 9.2 Economies of Scale and Natural Monopoly In this market, the demand curve intersects the long-run
average cost (LRAC) curve at its downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity demanded is
less than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve.
Economists call this situation, when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the market,
a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of adding an additional
customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the overall system are in place. This results in situations where
there are substantial economies of scale. For example, once a water company lays the main water pipes through a
neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once the electric company
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
225

installs lines in a new subdivision, the marginal cost of providing additional electrical service to one more home is
minimal. It would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the market and invest in a whole
second set of main water pipes, or for a second electricity company to enter the market and invest in a whole new set
of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where, because of economies of scale, one producer can serve
the entire market more efficiently than a number of smaller producers that would need to make duplicate physical
capital investments.
A natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products that are difficult to transport. For example,
cement production exhibits economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in a local area may not be much
larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover, the costs of transporting cement over land are high, and so a
cement plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural monopoly.
Control of a Physical Resource
Another type of natural monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce physical resource. In the
U.S. economy, one historical example of this pattern occurred when ALCOA—the Aluminum Company of
America—controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used in making aluminum. Back in the 1930s, when
ALCOA controlled most of the bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough aluminum to compete.
As another example, the majority of global diamond production is controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national company
that has mining and production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It also has exploration
activities on four continents, while directing a worldwide distribution network of rough cut diamonds. Although
in recent years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the rough diamond market is still
considerable.
Legal Monopoly
For some products, the government erects barriers to entry by prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S. law,
no organization but the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail. Many states or cities have
laws or regulations that allow households a choice of only one electric company, one water company, and one
company to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are utilities—products necessary for everyday life—that are
socially beneficial. As a consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated monopolies, to insure
that customers have access to an appropriate amount of these products or services. Additionally, legal monopolies are
often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one provider.
Promoting Innovation
Innovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company invests in research and development and finds
the cure for the common cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies could take the formula,
produce the drug, and because they did not incur the costs of research and development (R&D), undercut the price of
the company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms would choose not to invest in research and
development, and as a result, the world would have less innovation. To prevent this from happening, the Constitution
of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8: “The Congress shall have Power . . . to Promote the Progress of
Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the Exclusive Right to their Writings
and Discoveries.” Congress used this power to create the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the U.S.
Copyright Office. A patent gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited
time. In the United States, exclusive patent rights last for 20 years. The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so
that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&D, but then to allow other firms to produce the product more
cheaply once the patent expires.
A trademark is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or the
Nike “swoosh” that appears on shoes and athletic gear. Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S.
government. A firm can renew a trademark repeatedly, as long as it remains in active use.
A copyright, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, “is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United
States for ‘original works of authorship’ including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural, cartographic,
choreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and audiovisual creations.” No one can reproduce, display,
or perform a copyrighted work without the author's permission. Copyright protection ordinarily lasts for the life of
the author plus 70 years.
Roughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects books, songs, and art. However, in certain
226
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

areas, like the invention of new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply.
There is also a body of law known as trade secrets. Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention,
competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the formula for Coca-Cola, which is
not protected under copyright or patent law, but is simply kept secret by the company.
Taken together, we call this combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law intellectual
property, because it implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece of property like a
house or a car. Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the time
periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are ongoing negotiations, both through the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring greater harmony to the
intellectual property laws of different countries to determine the extent to which those in other countries will respect
patents and copyrights of those in other countries.
Government limitations on competition used to be more common in the United States. For most of the twentieth
century, only one phone company—AT&T—was legally allowed to provide local and long distance service. From the
1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations limited which destinations airlines could choose to fly to and what
fares they could charge. Another set of regulations limited the interest rates that banks could pay to depositors; yet
another specified how much trucking firms could charge customers.
What products we consider utilities depends, in part, on the available technology. Fifty years ago, telephone
companies provided local and long distance service over wires. It did not make much sense to have many companies
building multiple wiring systems across towns and the entire country. AT&T lost its monopoly on long distance
service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission,
so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism. The same thing happened to local service,
especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.
The combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide
services adequately led to a wave of deregulation, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s. This
wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter, the prices that they could charge,
and the quantities that many industries could produce, including telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking, and
electricity.
Around the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many governments continue to control and limit
competition in what those governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks, steel companies, oil
companies, and telephone companies.
Vist this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/patents) for examples of some pretty bizarre patents.
Intimidating Potential Competition
Businesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from
entering the market. One method is known as predatory pricing, in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts
to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it is difficult to prove.
Consider a large airline that provides most of the flights between two particular cities. A new, small start-up airline
decides to offer service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes prices on this route to the
bone, so that the new entrant cannot make any money. After the new entrant has gone out of business, the incumbent
Chapter 9 | Monopoly

firm can raise prices again.
After the company repeats this pattern once or twice, potential new entrants may decide that it is not wise to try to
compete. Small airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early 2000s, for example, ValuJet
accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015, the Justice
Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing restrictions on retailers that encouraged
customers to use lower swipe fees on credit transactions.
In some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of discouraging the competition. If the only way to
launch a successful new national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of Coca-Cola and Pepsi
Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.
Summing Up Barriers to Entry
Table 9.1 lists the barriers to entry that we have discussed. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved to
be highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage competition. When barriers to entry exist, perfect
competition is no longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers to entry are high enough,
monopoly can result.

9.2 | How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output
and Price
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the perceived demand curve for a perfect competitor and a monopoly
•
Analyze a demand curve for a monopoly and determine the output that maximizes profit and revenue
•
Calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost
•
Explain allocative efficiency as it pertains to the efficiency of a monopoly
Consider a monopoly firm, comfortably surrounded by barriers to entry so that it need not fear competition from
other producers. How will this monopoly choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output, and what price will it
charge? Profits for the monopolist, like any firm, will be equal to total revenues minus total costs. We can analyze the
pattern of costs for the monopoly within the same framework as the costs of a perfectly competitive firm—that is, by
using total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost. However, because a
monopoly faces no competition, its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive
firm. (The Clear It Up feature discusses how hard it is sometimes to define “market” in a monopoly situation.)

Demand Curves Perceived by a Perfectly Competitive Firm and by a
Monopoly
A perfectly competitive firm acts as a price taker, so we calculate total revenue taking the given market price and
multiplying it by the quantity of output that the firm chooses. The demand curve as it is perceived by a perfectly
competitive firm appears in Figure 9.3 (a). The flat perceived demand curve means that, from the viewpoint of the
perfectly competitive firm, it could sell either a relatively low quantity like Ql or a relatively high quantity like Qh at
the market price P.
Figure 9.3 The Perceived Demand Curve for a Perfect Competitor and a Monopolist
(a) A perfectly competitive
firm perceives the demand curve that it faces to be flat. The flat shape means that the firm can sell either a low
quantity (Ql) or a high quantity (Qh) at exactly the same price (P). (b) A monopolist perceives the demand curve that
it faces to be the same as the market demand curve, which for most goods is downward-sloping. Thus, if the
monopolist chooses a high level of output (Qh), it can charge only a relatively low price (PI). Conversely, if the
monopolist chooses a low level of output (Ql), it can then charge a higher price (Ph). The challenge for the monopolist
is to choose the combination of price and quantity that maximizes profits.
What defines the market?
A monopoly is a firm that sells all or nearly all of the goods and services in a given market. However, what
defines the “market”?
In a famous 1947 case, the federal government accused the DuPont company of having a monopoly in the
cellophane market, pointing out that DuPont produced 75% of the cellophane in the United States. DuPont
countered that even though it had a 75% market share in cellophane, it had less than a 20% share of the
“flexible packaging materials,” which includes all other moisture-proof papers, films, and foils. In 1956, after
years of legal appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the broader market definition was more appropriate,
and it dismissed the case against DuPont.
Questions over how to define the market continue today. True, Microsoft in the 1990s had a dominant share
of the software for computer operating systems, but in the total market for all computer software and services,
including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. The
Greyhound bus company may have a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus transportation, but it is
only a small share of the market for intercity transportation if that market includes private cars, airplanes, and
railroad service. DeBeers has a monopoly in diamonds, but it is a much smaller share of the total market for
precious gemstones and an even smaller share of the total market for jewelry. A small town in the country may
have only one gas station: is this gas station a “monopoly,” or does it compete with gas stations that might be

five, 10, or 50 miles away?
In general, if a firm produces a product without close substitutes, then we can consider the firm a monopoly
producer in a single market. However, if buyers have a range of similar—even if not identical—options
available from other firms, then the firm is not a monopoly. Still, arguments over whether substitutes are close
or not close can be controversial.
While a monopolist can charge any price for its product, nonetheless the demand for the firm’s product constrains
the price. No monopolist, even one that is thoroughly protected by high barriers to entry, can require consumers to
purchase its product. Because the monopolist is the only firm in the market, its demand curve is the same as the
market demand curve, which is, unlike that for a perfectly competitive firm, downward-sloping.
Figure 9.3 illustrates this situation. The monopolist can either choose a point like R with a low price (Pl) and high
quantity (Qh), or a point like S with a high price (Ph) and a low quantity (Ql), or some intermediate point. Setting
the price too high will result in a low quantity sold, and will not bring in much revenue. Conversely, setting the price
too low may result in a high quantity sold, but because of the low price, it will not bring in much revenue either. The
challenge for the monopolist is to strike a profit-maximizing balance between the price it charges and the quantity
that it sells. However, why isn’t the perfectly competitive firm’s demand curve also the market demand curve? See
the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.
What is the difference between perceived demand and market
demand?
The demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is not the overall market demand curve for
that product. However, the firm’s demand curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market
demand curve. The reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand for
its products in a market that includes many other firms. In effect, the demand curve perceived by a perfectly
competitive firm is a tiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In contrast, a monopoly perceives demand
for its product in a market where the monopoly is the only producer.
Total Cost and Total Revenue for a Monopolist
We can illustrate profits for a monopolist with a graph of total revenues and total costs, with the example of the
hypothetical HealthPill firm in Figure 9.4. The total cost curve has its typical shape that we learned about in
Production, Costs and Industry Structure, and that we used in Perfect Competition; that is, total costs rise
and the curve grows steeper as output increases, as the final column of Table 9.2 shows.

Figure 9.4 Total Revenue and Total Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly Total revenue for the monopoly firm called
HealthPill first rises, then falls. Low levels of output bring in relatively little total revenue, because the quantity is low.
High levels of output bring in relatively less revenue, because the high quantity pushes down the market price. The
total cost curve is upward-sloping. Profits will be highest at the quantity of output where total revenue is most above
total cost. The profit-maximizing level of output is not the same as the revenue-maximizing level of output, which
should make sense, because profits take costs into account and revenues do not.

Table 9.2 Total Costs and Total Revenues of HealthPill
Total revenue, though, is different. Since a monopolist faces a downward sloping demand curve, the only way it can
sell more output is by reducing its price. Selling more output raises revenue, but lowering price reduces it. Thus,
the shape of total revenue isn’t clear. Let’s explore this using the data in Table 9.2, which shows quantities along
the demand curve and the price at each quantity demanded, and then calculates total revenue by multiplying price
times quantity at each level of output. (In this example, we give the output as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, for the sake of
simplicity. If you prefer a dash of greater realism, you can imagine that the pharmaceutical company measures the
pharmaceutical company measures these output levels and the corresponding prices per 1,000 or 10,000 pills.) As
the figure illustrates, total revenue for a monopolist has the shape of a hill, first rising, next flattening out, and then
falling. In this example, total revenue is highest at a quantity of 6 or 7.
However, the monopolist is not seeking to maximize revenue, but instead to earn the highest possible profit. In the
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
231

HealthPill example in Figure 9.4, the highest profit will occur at the quantity where total revenue is the farthest
above total cost. This looks to be somewhere in the middle of the graph, but where exactly? It is easier to see the
profit maximizing level of output by using the marginal approach, to which we turn next.
Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for a Monopolist
In the real world, a monopolist often does not have enough information to analyze its entire total revenues or total
costs curves. After all, the firm does not know exactly what would happen if it were to alter production dramatically.
However, a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts
will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs, because it has had experience with such changes over time and
because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience. A monopolist can use information on
marginal revenue and marginal cost to seek out the profit-maximizing combination of quantity and price.
Table 9.3 expands Table 9.2 using the figures on total costs and total revenues from the HealthPill example
to calculate marginal revenue and marginal cost. This monopoly faces typical upward-sloping marginal cost and
downward sloping marginal revenue curves, as Figure 9.5 shows.
Notice that marginal revenue is zero at a quantity of 7, and turns negative at quantities higher than 7. It may seem
counterintuitive that marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative: after all, doesn't an increase in quantity sold not
always mean more revenue? For a perfect competitor, each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue,
because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price. However, a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and
see a decline in total revenue. When a monopolist increases sales by one unit, it gains some marginal revenue from
selling that extra unit, but also loses some marginal revenue because it must now sell every other unit at a lower
price. As the quantity sold becomes higher, at some point the drop in price is proportionally more than the increase in
greater quantity of sales, causing a situation where more sales bring in less revenue. In other words, marginal revenue
is negative.
Figure 9.5 Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly
For a monopoly like HealthPill,
marginal revenue decreases as it sells additional units of output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping. The
profit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to
marginal cost: that is, MR = MC. If the monopoly produces a lower quantity, then MR > MC at those levels of output,
and the firm can make higher profits by expanding output. If the firm produces at a greater quantity, then MC > MR,
and the firm can make higher profits by reducing its quantity of output.

Table 9.3 Costs and Revenues of HealthPill
A monopolist can determine its profit-maximizing price and quantity by analyzing the marginal revenue and marginal
costs of producing an extra unit. If the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost, then the firm should produce the
extra unit.
For example, at an output of 4 in Figure 9.5, marginal revenue is 600 and marginal cost is 250, so producing this unit
will clearly add to overall profits. At an output of 5, marginal revenue is 400 and marginal cost is 400, so producing
this unit still means overall profits are unchanged. However, expanding output from 5 to 6 would involve a marginal
revenue of 200 and a marginal cost of 850, so that sixth unit would actually reduce profits. Thus, the monopoly can
tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices in the table, the profit-maximizing level of output
is 5.
The monopoly could seek out the profit-maximizing level of output by increasing quantity by a small amount,
calculating marginal revenue and marginal cost, and then either increasing output as long as marginal revenue exceeds
marginal cost or reducing output if marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. This process works without any need to
calculate total revenue and total cost. Thus, a profit-maximizing monopoly should follow the rule of producing up to
the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost—that is, MR = MC. This quantity is easy to identify
graphically, where MR and MC intersect.
Maximizing Profits
If you find it counterintuitive that producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost will maximize profits,
working through the numbers will help.
Step 1. Remember, we define marginal cost as the change in total cost from producing a small amount of
additional output.
MC =
change in total cost
change in quantity produced
Step 2. Note that in Table 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total cost increases from $1500 to $1800.
As a result, the marginal cost of the second unit will be:
MC =
$775 – $500
1
= $275
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
233

Step 3. Remember that, similarly, marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from selling a small amount
of additional output.
MR =
change in total revenue
change in quantity sold
Step 4. Note that in Table 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total revenue increases from $1200 to
$2200. As a result, the marginal revenue of the second unit will be:
MR =
$2200 – $1200

= $1000

Table 9.4 Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, Marginal and Total Profit
Table 9.4 repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data from Table 9.3, and adds two more columns:
Marginal profit is the profitability of each additional unit sold. We define it as marginal revenue minus
marginal cost. Finally, total profit is the sum of marginal profits. As long as marginal profit is positive, producing
more output will increase total profits. When marginal profit turns negative, producing more output will
decrease total profits. Total profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this example,
maximum profit occurs at 5 units of output.
A perfectly competitive firm will also find its profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC. The key
difference with a perfectly competitive firm is that in the case of perfect competition, marginal revenue is equal
to price (MR = P), while for a monopolist, marginal revenue is not equal to the price, because changes in
quantity of output affect the price.
Illustrating Monopoly Profits
It is straightforward to calculate profits of given numbers for total revenue and total cost. However, the size of
monopoly profits can also be illustrated graphically with Figure 9.6, which takes the marginal cost and marginal
revenue curves from the previous exhibit and adds an average cost curve and the monopolist’s perceived demand
curve. Table 9.5 shows the data for these curves.

Table 9.5
Figure 9.6 Illustrating Profits at the HealthPill Monopoly This figure begins with the same marginal revenue and
marginal cost curves from the HealthPill monopoly from Figure 9.5. It then adds an average cost curve and the
demand curve that the monopolist faces. The HealthPill firm first chooses the quantity where MR = MC. In this
example, the quantity is 5. The monopolist then decides what price to charge by looking at the demand curve it faces.
The large box, with quantity on the horizontal axis and demand (which shows the price) on the vertical axis, shows
total revenue for the firm. The lighter-shaded box, which is quantity on the horizontal axis and average cost of
production on the vertical axis shows the firm's total costs. The large total revenue box minus the smaller total cost
box leaves the darkly shaded box that shows total profits. Since the price charged is above average cost, the firm is
earning positive profits.
Figure 9.7 illustrates the three-step process where a monopolist: selects the profit-maximizing quantity to produce;
decides what price to charge; determines total revenue, total cost, and profit.
Step 1: The Monopolist Determines Its Profit-Maximizing Level of Output
The firm can use the points on the demand curve D to calculate total revenue, and then, based on total revenue,
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
235

calculate its marginal revenue curve. The profit-maximizing quantity will occur where MR = MC—or at the last
possible point before marginal costs start exceeding marginal revenue. On Figure 9.6, MR = MC occurs at an output
of 5.
Step 2: The Monopolist Decides What Price to Charge
The monopolist will charge what the market is willing to pay. A dotted line drawn straight up from the profit-
maximizing quantity to the demand curve shows the profit-maximizing price which, in Figure 9.6, is $800. This
price is above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning profits.
Step 3: Calculate Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit
Total revenue is the overall shaded box, where the width of the box is the quantity sold and the height is the price.
In Figure 9.6, this is 5 x $800 = $4000. In Figure 9.6, the bottom part of the shaded box, which is shaded more
lightly, shows total costs; that is, quantity on the horizontal axis multiplied by average cost on the vertical axis or 5
x $330 = $1650. The larger box of total revenues minus the smaller box of total costs will equal profits, which the
darkly shaded box shows. Using the numbers gives $4000 - $1650 = $2350. In a perfectly competitive market, the
forces of entry would erode this profit in the long run. However, a monopolist is protected by barriers to entry. In fact,
one obvious sign of a possible monopoly is when a firm earns profits year after year, while doing more or less the
same thing, without ever seeing increased competition eroding those profits.
Figure 9.7 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Decides Price In Step 1, the monopoly chooses the profit-
maximizing level of output Q1, by choosing the quantity where MR = MC. In Step 2, the monopoly decides how much
to charge for output level Q1 by drawing a line straight up from Q1 to point R on its perceived demand curve. Thus,
the monopoly will charge a price (P1). In Step 3, the monopoly identifies its profit. Total revenue will be Q1 multiplied
by P1. Total cost will be Q1 multiplied by the average cost of producing Q1, which point S shows on the average cost
curve to be P2. Profits will be the total revenue rectangle minus the total cost rectangle, which the shaded zone in the
figure shows.
Why is a monopolist’s marginal revenue always less than the
price?
The marginal revenue curve for a monopolist always lies beneath the market demand curve. To understand
why, think about increasing the quantity along the demand curve by one unit, so that you take one step down
236
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

the demand curve to a slightly higher quantity but a slightly lower price. A demand curve is not sequential: It
is not that first we sell Q1 at a higher price, and then we sell Q2 at a lower price. Rather, a demand curve is
conditional: If we charge the higher price, we would sell Q1. If, instead, we charge a lower price (on all the
units that we sell), we would sell Q2.
When we think about increasing the quantity sold by one unit, marginal revenue is affected in two ways. First,
we sell one additional unit at the new market price. Second, all the previous units, which we sold at the higher
price, now sell for less. Because of the lower price on all units sold, the marginal revenue of selling a unit
is less than the price of that unit—and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve. Tip: For a
straight-line demand curve, MR and demand have the same vertical intercept. As output increases, marginal
revenue decreases twice as fast as demand, so that the horizontal intercept of MR is halfway to the horizontal
intercept of demand. You can see this in the Figure 9.8.
Figure 9.8 The Monopolist’s Marginal Revenue Curve versus Demand Curve Because the market
demand curve is conditional, the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist lies beneath the demand curve.
The Inefficiency of Monopoly
Most people criticize monopolies because they charge too high a price, but what economists object to is that
monopolies do not supply enough output to be allocatively efficient. To understand why a monopoly is inefficient, it
is useful to compare it with the benchmark model of perfect competition.
Allocative efficiency is an economic concept regarding efficiency at the social or societal level. It refers to producing
the optimal quantity of some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals
the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization in a world of perfect competition was for each firm to produce
the quantity of output where P = MC, where the price (P) is a measure of how much buyers value the good and the
marginal cost (MC) is a measure of what marginal units cost society to produce. Following this rule assures allocative
efficiency. If P > MC, then the marginal benefit to society (as measured by P) is greater than the marginal cost to
society of producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be produced. However, in the case of monopoly,
price is always greater than marginal cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, as you can see by looking back
at Figure 9.6. Thus, consumers will suffer from a monopoly because it will sell a lower quantity in the market, at a
higher price, than would have been the case in a perfectly competitive market.
The problem of inefficiency for monopolies often runs even deeper than these issues, and also involves incentives for
efficiency over longer periods of time. There are counterbalancing incentives here. On one side, firms may strive for
new inventions and new intellectual property because they want to become monopolies and earn high profits—at least
for a few years until the competition catches up. In this way, monopolies may come to exist because of competitive
pressures on firms. However, once a barrier to entry is in place, a monopoly that does not need to fear competition can
just produce the same old products in the same old way—while still ringing up a healthy rate of profit. John Hicks,
who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972, wrote in 1935: “The best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.” He
did not mean the comment in a complimentary way. He meant that monopolies may bank their profits and slack off
on trying to please their customers.
Chapter 9 | Monopoly

When AT&T provided all of the local and long-distance phone service in the United States, along with manufacturing
most of the phone equipment, the payment plans and types of phones did not change much. The old joke was that
you could have any color phone you wanted, as long as it was black. However, in 1982, government litigation
split up AT&T into a number of local phone companies, a long-distance phone company, and a phone equipment
manufacturer. An explosion of innovation followed. Services like call waiting, caller ID, three-way calling, voice mail
through the phone company, mobile phones, and wireless connections to the internet all became available. Companies
offered a wide range of payment plans, as well. It was no longer true that all phones were black. Instead, phones came
in a wide variety of shapes and colors. The end of the telephone monopoly brought lower prices, a greater quantity of
services, and also a wave of innovation aimed at attracting and pleasing customers.
The Rest is History
In the opening case, we presented the East India Company and the Confederate States as a monopoly or
near monopoly provider of a good. Nearly every American schoolchild knows the result of the “unwelcome
visit” the “Mohawks” bestowed upon Boston Harbor’s tea-bearing ships—the Boston Tea Party. Regarding the
cotton industry, we also know Great Britain remained neutral during the Civil War, taking neither side during
the conflict.
Did the monopoly nature of these business have unintended and historical consequences? Might the
American Revolution have been deterred, if the East India Company had sailed the tea-bearing ships back
to England? Might the southern states have made different decisions had they not been so confident “King
Cotton” would force diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America? Of course, it is not possible
to definitively answer these questions. We cannot roll back the clock and try a different scenario. We can,
however, consider the monopoly nature of these businesses and the roles they played and hypothesize about
what might have occurred under different circumstances.
Perhaps if there had been legal free tea trade, the colonists would have seen things differently. There was
smuggled Dutch tea in the colonial market. If the colonists had been able to freely purchase Dutch tea, they
would have paid lower prices and avoided the tax.
What about the cotton monopoly? With one in five jobs in Great Britain depending on Southern cotton and the
Confederate States as nearly the sole provider of that cotton, why did Great Britain remain neutral during the
Civil War? At the beginning of the war, Britain simply drew down massive stores of cotton. These stockpiles
lasted until near the end of 1862. Why did Britain not recognize the Confederacy at that point? Two reasons:
The Emancipation Proclamation and new sources of cotton. Having outlawed slavery throughout the United
Kingdom in 1833, it was politically impossible for Great Britain, empty cotton warehouses or not, to recognize,
diplomatically, the Confederate States. In addition, during the two years it took to draw down the stockpiles,
Britain expanded cotton imports from India, Egypt, and Brazil.
Monopoly sellers often see no threats to their superior marketplace position. In these examples did the power
of the monopoly blind the decision makers to other possibilities? Perhaps. As a result of their actions, this is
how history unfolded.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
9.1 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry
Barriers to entry prevent or discourage competitors from entering the market. These barriers include: economies of
scale that lead to natural monopoly; control of a physical resource; legal restrictions on competition; patent, trademark
and copyright protection; and practices to intimidate the competition like predatory pricing. Intellectual property
refers to legally guaranteed ownership of an idea, rather than a physical item. The laws that protect intellectual
property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. A natural monopoly arises when economies of
scale persist over a large enough range of output that if one firm supplies the entire market, no other firm can enter
without facing a cost disadvantage.
9.2 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price
A monopolist is not a price taker, because when it decides what quantity to produce, it also determines the market
price. For a monopolist, total revenue is relatively low at low quantities of output, because it is not selling much.
Total revenue is also relatively low at very high quantities of output, because a very high quantity will sell only at
a low price. Thus, total revenue for a monopolist will start low, rise, and then decline. The marginal revenue for
a monopolist from selling additional units will decline. Each additional unit a monopolist sells will push down the
overall market price, and as it sells more units, this lower price applies to increasingly more units.
Chapter 9 | Monopoly
239

The monopolist will select the profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC, and then charge the price for that
quantity of output as determined by the market demand curve. If that price is above average cost, the monopolist earns
positive profits.
Monopolists are not productively efficient, because they do not produce at the minimum of the average cost curve.
Monopolists are not allocatively efficient, because they do not produce at the quantity where P = MC. As a result,
monopolists produce less, at a higher average cost, and charge a higher price than would a combination of firms in a
perfectly competitive industry. Monopolists also may lack incentives for innovation, because they need not fear entry.

Competition and Oligopoly
Figure 10.1 Competing Brands? The laundry detergent market is one that is characterized neither as perfect
competition nor monopoly. (Credit: modification of work by Pixel Drip/Flickr Creative Commons)
The Temptation to Defy the Law
Laundry detergent and bags of ice—products of industries that seem pretty mundane, maybe even boring.
Hardly! Both have been the center of clandestine meetings and secret deals worthy of a spy novel. In France,
between 1997 and 2004, the top four laundry detergent producers (Proctor & Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, and
Colgate-Palmolive) controlled about 90 percent of the French soap market. Officials from the soap firms were
meeting secretly, in out-of-the-way, small cafés around Paris. Their goals: Stamp out competition and set
prices.
Around the same time, the top five Midwest ice makers (Home City Ice, Lang Ice, Tinley Ice, Sisler’s Dairy,
and Products of Ohio) had similar goals in mind when they secretly agreed to divide up the bagged ice market.
If both groups could meet their goals, it would enable each to act as though they were a single firm—in
essence, a monopoly—and enjoy monopoly-size profits. The problem? In many parts of the world, including
the European Union and the United States, it is illegal for firms to divide markets and set prices collaboratively.
These two cases provide examples of markets that are characterized neither as perfect competition nor
monopoly. Instead, these firms are competing in market structures that lie between the extremes of monopoly
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly
243

and perfect competition. How do they behave? Why do they exist? We will revisit this case later, to find out
what happened.
Introduction to Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Monopolistic Competition
•
Oligopoly
Perfect competition and monopoly are at opposite ends of the competition spectrum. A perfectly competitive market
has many firms selling identical products, who all act as price takers in the face of the competition. If you recall, price
takers are firms that have no market power. They simply have to take the market price as given.
Monopoly arises when a single firm sells a product for which there are no close substitutes. We consider Microsoft,
for instance, as a monopoly because it dominates the operating systems market.
What about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes, firms that we
could describe as imperfectly competitive? What determines their behavior? They have more influence over the
price they charge than perfectly competitive firms, but not as much as a monopoly. What will they do?
One type of imperfectly competitive market is monopolistic competition. Monopolistically competitive markets
feature a large number of competing firms, but the products that they sell are not identical. Consider, as an example,
the Mall of America in Minnesota, the largest shopping mall in the United States. In 2010, the Mall of America had 24
stores that sold women’s “ready-to-wear” clothing (like Ann Taylor and Urban Outfitters), another 50 stores that sold
clothing for both men and women (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and Nordstrom’s), plus 14 more stores that sold
women’s specialty clothing (like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria’s Secret). Most of the markets that consumers
encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive.
The other type of imperfectly competitive market is oligopoly. Oligopolistic markets are those which a small number
of firms dominate. Commercial aircraft provides a good example: Boeing and Airbus each produce slightly less than
50% of the large commercial aircraft in the world. Another example is the U.S. soft drink industry, which Coca-Cola
and Pepsi dominate. We characterize oligopolies by high barriers to entry with firms choosing output, pricing, and
other decisions strategically based on the decisions of the other firms in the market. In this chapter, we first explore
how monopolistically competitive firms will choose their profit-maximizing level of output. We will then discuss
oligopolistic firms, which face two conflicting temptations: to collaborate as if they were a single monopoly, or to
individually compete to gain profits by expanding output levels and cutting prices. Oligopolistic markets and firms
can also take on elements of monopoly and of perfect competition.
10.1 | Monopolistic Competition
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the significance of differentiated products
•
Describe how a monopolistic competitor chooses price and quantity
•
Discuss entry, exit, and efficiency as they pertain to monopolistic competition
•
Analyze how advertising can impact monopolistic competition
Monopolistic competition involves many firms competing against each other, but selling products that are distinctive
in some way. Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants or grocery stores that sell a
variety of food; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public
perception because of advertising and brand names. There are over 600,000 restaurants in the United States. When
products are distinctive, each firm has a mini-monopoly on its particular style or flavor or brand name. However, firms
producing such products must also compete with other styles and flavors and brand names. The term “monopolistic
competition” captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough competition, and the following Clear It Up feature
244
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

introduces its derivation.
Who invented the theory of imperfect competition?
Two economists independently but simultaneously developed the theory of imperfect competition in 1933.
The first was Edward Chamberlin of Harvard University who published The Economics of Monopolistic
Competition. The second was Joan Robinson of Cambridge University who published The Economics of
Imperfect Competition. Robinson subsequently became interested in macroeconomics and she became a
prominent Keynesian, and later a post-Keynesian economist. (See the Welcome to Economics! and The
Keynesian Perspective (http://cnx.org/content/m63849/latest/) chapters for more on Keynes.)
Differentiated Products
A firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways: physical aspects of the
product, location from which it sells the product, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product.
We call products that are distinctive in one of these ways differentiated products.
Physical aspects of a product include all the phrases you hear in advertisements: unbreakable bottle, nonstick surface,
freezer-to-microwave, non-shrink, extra spicy, newly redesigned for your comfort. A firm's location can also create a
difference between producers. For example, a gas station located at a heavily traveled intersection can probably sell
more gas, because more cars drive by that corner. A supplier to an automobile manufacturer may find that it is an
advantage to locate close to the car factory.
Intangible aspects can differentiate a product, too. Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of
satisfaction or money back, a reputation for high quality, services like free delivery, or offering a loan to purchase the
product. Finally, product differentiation may occur in the minds of buyers. For example, many people could not tell
the difference in taste between common varieties of ketchup or mayonnaise if they were blindfolded but, because of
past habits and advertising, they have strong preferences for certain brands. Advertising can play a role in shaping
these intangible preferences.
The concept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree of variety that is available. If everyone in the
economy wore only blue jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets for clothing, food,
and drink would be much closer to perfectly competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations, and characteristics
creates product differentiation and monopolistic competition.
Perceived Demand for a Monopolistic Competitor
A monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly
and competition. Figure 10.2 offers a reminder that the demand curve that a perfectly competitive firm faces is
perfectly elastic or flat, because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing market
price. In contrast, the demand curve, as faced by a monopolist, is the market demand curve, since a monopolist is the
only firm in the market, and hence is downward sloping.
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly
245

Figure 10.2 Perceived Demand for Firms in Different Competitive Settings
The demand curve that a perfectly
competitive firm faces is perfectly elastic, meaning it can sell all the output it wishes at the prevailing market price.
The demand curve that a monopoly faces is the market demand. It can sell more output only by decreasing the price
it charges. The demand curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces falls in between.
The demand curve as a monopolistic competitor faces is not flat, but rather downward-sloping, which means that
the monopolistic competitor can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the price and gain more
customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive firm is more elastic
than that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. If a monopolist raises its price, some consumers will
choose not to purchase its product—but they will then need to buy a completely different product. However, when
a monopolistic competitor raises its price, some consumers will choose not to purchase the product at all, but others
will choose to buy a similar product from another firm. If a monopolistic competitor raises its price, it will not lose as
many customers as would a perfectly competitive firm, but it will lose more customers than would a monopoly that
raised its prices.
At a glance, the demand curves that a monopoly and a monopolistic competitor face look similar—that is, they both
slope down. However, the underlying economic meaning of these perceived demand curves is different, because
a monopolist faces the market demand curve and a monopolistic competitor does not. Rather, a monopolistically
competitive firm’s demand curve is but one of many firms that make up the “before” market demand curve. Are you
following? If so, how would you categorize the market for golf balls? Take a swing, then see the following Clear It
Up feature.
Are golf balls really differentiated products?
Monopolistic competition refers to an industry that has more than a few firms, each offering a product which,
from the consumer’s perspective, is different from its competitors. The U.S. Golf Association runs a laboratory
that tests 20,000 golf balls a year. There are strict rules for what makes a golf ball legal. A ball's weight cannot
exceed 1.620 ounces and its diameter cannot be less than 1.680 inches (which is a weight of 45.93 grams and
a diameter of 42.67 millimeters, in case you were wondering). The Association also tests the balls by hitting
them at different speeds. For example, the distance test involves having a mechanical golfer hit the ball with
a titanium driver and a swing speed of 120 miles per hour. As the testing center explains: “The USGA system
then uses an array of sensors that accurately measure the flight of a golf ball during a short, indoor trajectory
from a ball launcher. From this flight data, a computer calculates the lift and drag forces that are generated by
the speed, spin, and dimple pattern of the ball. ... The distance limit is 317 yards.”
Over 1800 golf balls made by more than 100 companies meet the USGA standards. The balls do differ in
various ways, such as the pattern of dimples on the ball, the types of plastic on the cover and in the cores,
and other factors. Since all balls need to conform to the USGA tests, they are much more alike than different.
246

In other words, golf ball manufacturers are monopolistically competitive.
However, retail sales of golf balls are about $500 million per year, which means that many large companies
have a powerful incentive to persuade players that golf balls are highly differentiated and that it makes a huge
difference which one you choose. Sure, Tiger Woods can tell the difference. For the average amateur golfer
who plays a few times a summer—and who loses many golf balls to the woods and lake and needs to buy
new ones—most golf balls are pretty much indistinguishable.
How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses Price and Quantity
The monopolistically competitive firm decides on its profit-maximizing quantity and price in much the same way as
a monopolist. A monopolistic competitor, like a monopolist, faces a downward-sloping demand curve, and so it will
choose some combination of price and quantity along its perceived demand curve.
As an example of a profit-maximizing monopolistic competitor, consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store, which
serves pizza with cheese, sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of vegetables and meats. Although Authentic
Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants, it has a differentiated product. The firm’s
perceived demand curve is downward sloping, as Figure 10.3 shows and the first two columns of Table 10.1.
Figure 10.3 How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses its Profit Maximizing Output and Price
To maximize
profits, the Authentic Chinese Pizza shop would choose a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, or
Q where MR = MC. Here it would choose a quantity of 40 and a price of $16.

Table 10.1 Revenue and Cost Schedule
We can multiply the combinations of price and quantity at each point on the demand curve to calculate the total
revenue that the firm would receive, which is in the third column of Table 10.1. We calculate marginal revenue, in
the fourth column, as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. The final columns of Table 10.1
show total cost, marginal cost, and average cost. As always, we calculate marginal cost by dividing the change in total
cost by the change in quantity, while we calculate average cost by dividing total cost by quantity. The following Work
It Out feature shows how these firms calculate how much of their products to supply at what price.
How
a
Monopolistic
Competitor
Determines
How
Much
to
Produce and at What Price
The process by which a monopolistic competitor chooses its profit-maximizing quantity and price resembles
closely how a monopoly makes these decisions process. First, the firm selects the profit-maximizing quantity
to produce. Then the firm decides what price to charge for that quantity.
Step 1. The monopolistic competitor determines its profit-maximizing level of output. In this case, the Authentic
Chinese Pizza company will determine the profit-maximizing quantity to produce by considering its marginal
revenues and marginal costs. Two scenarios are possible:
•
If the firm is producing at a quantity of output where marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, then the
firm should keep expanding production, because each marginal unit is adding to profit by bringing in
more revenue than its cost. In this way, the firm will produce up to the quantity where MR = MC.
•
If the firm is producing at a quantity where marginal costs exceed marginal revenue, then each
marginal unit is costing more than the revenue it brings in, and the firm will increase its profits by
reducing the quantity of output until MR = MC.
In this example, MR and MC intersect at a quantity of 40, which is the profit-maximizing level of output for the
firm.
Step 2. The monopolistic competitor decides what price to charge. When the firm has determined its profit-
maximizing quantity of output, it can then look to its perceived demand curve to find out what it can charge for
that quantity of output. On the graph, we show this process as a vertical line reaching up through the profit-
maximizing quantity until it hits the firm’s perceived demand curve. For Authentic Chinese Pizza, it should
charge a price of $16 per pizza for a quantity of 40.
Once the firm has chosen price and quantity, it’s in a position to calculate total revenue, total cost, and profit.
At a quantity of 40, the price of $16 lies above the average cost curve, so the firm is making economic profits.
From Table 10.1 we can see that, at an output of 40, the firm’s total revenue is $640 and its total cost is $580,
so profits are $60. In Figure 10.3, the firm’s total revenues are the rectangle with the quantity of 40 on the
horizontal axis and the price of $16 on the vertical axis. The firm’s total costs are the light shaded rectangle
with the same quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis but the average cost of $14.50 on the vertical axis. Profits
are total revenues minus total costs, which is the shaded area above the average cost curve.

Although the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to
the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions, two differences are worth remembering. First, although both
a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward-sloping demand curves, the monopolist’s perceived
demand curve is the market demand curve, while the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is based
on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces. Second, a monopolist is surrounded
by barriers to entry and need not fear entry, but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of
firms with similar, but differentiated, products.
Monopolistic Competitors and Entry
If one monopolistic competitor earns positive economic profits, other firms will be tempted to enter the market. A gas
station with a great location must worry that other gas stations might open across the street or down the road—and
perhaps the new gas stations will sell coffee or have a carwash or some other attraction to lure customers. A successful
restaurant with a unique barbecue sauce must be concerned that other restaurants will try to copy the sauce or offer
their own unique recipes. A laundry detergent with a great reputation for quality must take note that other competitors
may seek to build their own reputations.
The entry of other firms into the same general market (like gas, restaurants, or detergent) shifts the demand curve that
a monopolistically competitive firm faces. As more firms enter the market, the quantity demanded at a given price
for any particular firm will decline, and the firm’s perceived demand curve will shift to the left. As a firm’s perceived
demand curve shifts to the left, its marginal revenue curve will shift to the left, too. The shift in marginal revenue
will change the profit-maximizing quantity that the firm chooses to produce, since marginal revenue will then equal
marginal cost at a lower quantity.
Figure 10.4 (a) shows a situation in which a monopolistic competitor was earning a profit with its original perceived
demand curve (D0). The intersection of the marginal revenue curve (MR0) and marginal cost curve (MC) occurs
at point S, corresponding to quantity Q0, which is associated on the demand curve at point T with price P0. The
combination of price P0 and quantity Q0 lies above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning
positive economic profits.
Figure 10.4 Monopolistic Competition, Entry, and Exit (a) At P0 and Q0, the monopolistically competitive firm in
this figure is making a positive economic profit. This is clear because if you follow the dotted line above Q0, you can
see that price is above average cost. Positive economic profits attract competing firms to the industry, driving the
original firm’s demand down to D1. At the new equilibrium quantity (P1, Q1), the original firm is earning zero economic
profits, and entry into the industry ceases. In (b) the opposite occurs. At P0 and Q0, the firm is losing money. If you
follow the dotted line above Q0, you can see that average cost is above price. Losses induce firms to leave the
industry. When they do, demand for the original firm rises to D1, where once again the firm is earning zero economic
profit.
Unlike a monopoly, with its high barriers to entry, a monopolistically competitive firm with positive economic profits
will attract competition. When another competitor enters the market, the original firm’s perceived demand curve
shifts to the left, from D0 to D1, and the associated marginal revenue curve shifts from MR0 to MR1. The new profit-
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly
249

maximizing output is Q1, because the intersection of the MR1 and MC now occurs at point U. Moving vertically up
from that quantity on the new demand curve, the optimal price is at P1.
As long as the firm is earning positive economic profits, new competitors will continue to enter the market, reducing
the original firm’s demand and marginal revenue curves. The long-run equilibrium is in the figure at point Y, where
the firm’s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve. When price is equal to average cost, economic
profits are zero. Thus, although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short
term, the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run. Remember that zero economic
profit is not equivalent to zero accounting profit. A zero economic profit means the firm’s accounting profit is
equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use. Figure 10.4 (b) shows the reverse situation, where a
monopolistically competitive firm is originally losing money. The adjustment to long-run equilibrium is analogous
to the previous example. The economic losses lead to firms exiting, which will result in increased demand for this
particular firm, and consequently lower losses. Firms exit up to the point where there are no more losses in this
market, for example when the demand curve touches the average cost curve, as in point Z.
Monopolistic competitors can make an economic profit or loss in the short run, but in the long run, entry and exit will
drive these firms toward a zero economic profit outcome. However, the zero economic profit outcome in monopolistic
competition looks different from the zero economic profit outcome in perfect competition in several ways relating
both to efficiency and to variety in the market.
Monopolistic Competition and Efficiency
The long-term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price
level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve. This outcome is why perfect competition displays
productive efficiency: goods are produced at the lowest possible average cost. However, in monopolistic competition,
the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward-sloping portion of the
average cost curve, not at the very bottom of the AC curve. Thus, monopolistic competition will not be productively
efficient.
In a perfectly competitive market, each firm produces at a quantity where price is set equal to marginal cost, both in
the short and long run. This outcome is why perfect competition displays allocative efficiency: the social benefits of
additional production, as measured by the marginal benefit, which is the same as the price, equal the marginal costs
to society of that production. In a monopolistically competitive market, the rule for maximizing profit is to set MR
= MC—and price is higher than marginal revenue, not equal to it because the demand curve is downward sloping.
When P > MC, which is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market, the benefits to society of providing
additional quantity, as measured by the price that people are willing to pay, exceed the marginal costs to society of
producing those units. A monopolistically competitive firm does not produce more, which means that society loses
the net benefit of those extra units. This is the same argument we made about monopoly, but in this case the allocative
inefficiency will be smaller. Thus, a monopolistically competitive industry will produce a lower quantity of a good
and charge a higher price for it than would a perfectly competitive industry. See the following Clear It Up feature for
more detail on the impact of demand shifts.
Why does a shift in perceived demand cause a shift in marginal
revenue?
We use the combinations of price and quantity at each point on a firm’s perceived demand curve to calculate
total revenue for each combination of price and quantity. We then use this information on total revenue to
calculate marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. A change
in perceived demand will change total revenue at every quantity of output and in turn, the change in total
revenue will shift marginal revenue at each quantity of output. Thus, when entry occurs in a monopolistically
competitive industry, the perceived demand curve for each firm will shift to the left, because a smaller quantity
will be demanded at any given price. Another way of interpreting this shift in demand is to notice that, for
each quantity sold, the firm will charge a lower price. Consequently, the marginal revenue will be lower for
250

each quantity sold—and the marginal revenue curve will shift to the left as well. Conversely, exit causes the
perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm to shift to the right and the corresponding
marginal revenue curve to shift right, too.
A monopolistically competitive industry does not display productive or allocative efficiency in either the short run,
when firms are making economic profits and losses, nor in the long run, when firms are earning zero profits.
The Benefits of Variety and Product Differentiation
Even though monopolistic competition does not provide productive efficiency or allocative efficiency, it does have
benefits of its own. Product differentiation is based on variety and innovation. Most people would prefer to live in an
economy with many kinds of clothes, foods, and car styles; not in a world of perfect competition where everyone will
always wear blue jeans and white shirts, eat only spaghetti with plain red sauce, and drive an identical model of car.
Most people would prefer to live in an economy where firms are struggling to figure out ways of attracting customers
by methods like friendlier service, free delivery, guarantees of quality, variations on existing products, and a better
shopping experience.
Economists have struggled, with only partial success, to address the question of whether a market-oriented economy
produces the optimal amount of variety. Critics of market-oriented economies argue that society does not really need
dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles. They argue that much of the cost of creating
such a high degree of product differentiation, and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation, is socially
wasteful—that is, most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of differentiated products produced and
sold at a lower price. Defenders of a market-oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated
products or highly advertised brand names, no one is forcing them to do so. Moreover, they argue that consumers
benefit substantially when firms seek short-term profits by providing differentiated products. This controversy may
never be fully resolved, in part because deciding on the optimal amount of variety is very difficult, and in part because
the two sides often place different values on what variety means for consumers. Read the following Clear It Up feature
for a discussion on the role that advertising plays in monopolistic competition.
How does advertising impact monopolistic competition?
The U.S. economy spent about $180.12 billion on advertising in 2014, according to eMarketer.com. Roughly
one third of this was television advertising, and another third was divided roughly equally between internet,
newspapers, and radio. The remaining third was divided between direct mail, magazines, telephone directory
yellow pages, and billboards. Mobile devices are increasing the opportunities for advertisers.
Advertising is all about explaining to people, or making people believe, that the products of one firm are
differentiated from another firm's products. In the framework of monopolistic competition, there are two ways
to conceive of how advertising works: either advertising causes a firm’s perceived demand curve to become
more inelastic (that is, it causes the perceived demand curve to become steeper); or advertising causes
demand for the firm’s product to increase (that is, it causes the firm’s perceived demand curve to shift to the
right). In either case, a successful advertising campaign may allow a firm to sell either a greater quantity or to
charge a higher price, or both, and thus increase its profits.
However, economists and business owners have also long suspected that much of the advertising may only
offset other advertising. Economist A. C. Pigou wrote the following back in 1920 in his book, The Economics
of Welfare:
It may happen that expenditures on advertisement made by competing monopolists [that is, what
we now call monopolistic competitors] will simply neutralise one another, and leave the industrial
position exactly as it would have been if neither had expended anything. For, clearly, if each of two
rivals makes equal efforts to attract the favour of the public away from the other, the total result is
the same as it would have been if neither had made any effort at all.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

Explain why and how oligopolies exist
•
Contrast collusion and competition
•

•
Evaluate the tradeoffs of imperfect competition
Many purchases that individuals make at the retail level are produced in markets that are neither perfectly competitive,
monopolies, nor monopolistically competitive. Rather, they are oligopolies. Oligopoly arises when a small number of
large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry,
cable television, and commercial air travel. Oligopolistic firms are like cats in a bag. They can either scratch each
other to pieces or cuddle up and get comfortable with one another. If oligopolists compete hard, they may end up
acting very much like perfect competitors, driving down costs and leading to zero profits for all. If oligopolists collude
with each other, they may effectively act like a monopoly and succeed in pushing up prices and earning consistently
high levels of profit. We typically characterize oligopolies by mutual interdependence where various decisions such
as output, price, and advertising depend on other firm(s)' decisions. Analyzing the choices of oligopolistic firms about
pricing and quantity produced involves considering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given point
in time.
Why Do Oligopolies Exist?
A combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the product differentiation that characterizes
monopolistic competition can create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a government grants a patent
for an invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly. When the government grants patents to, for example, three
different pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for reducing high blood pressure, those three firms
may become an oligopoly.
Similarly, a natural monopoly will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single
firm to operate at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In such a setting, the market has room for only
one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete, and no larger firm could sell
what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market.
Quantity demanded in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of
the average cost curve—which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms (and
they need not produce differentiated products). Again, smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable
to compete, while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a
profitable price. This combination of economies of scale and market demand creates the barrier to entry, which led to
the Boeing-Airbus oligopoly (also called a duopoly) for large passenger aircraft.
The product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can also play a role in creating oligopoly. For
example, firms may need to reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on advertising and
marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The problem in competing with, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi is not that
producing fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a brand name and marketing effort to equal
Coke or Pepsi is an enormous task.
Collusion or Competition?
When oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce and what price to charge, they face a
temptation to act as if they were a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output,
charge a higher price, and divide the profit among themselves. When firms act together in this way to reduce output
and keep prices high, it is called collusion. A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the
monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a cartel. See the following Clear It Up feature for a more
in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.
252

Collusion versus cartels: How to differentiate
In the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti-
competitive behavior, which is a violation of antitrust law. Both the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States.
The problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion. Cartels are formal agreements to collude.
Because cartel agreements provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States. Instead, most
collusion is tacit, where firms implicitly reach an understanding that competition is bad for profits.
Economists have understood for a long time the desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise
the prices that they charge and earn higher profits. Adam Smith wrote in Wealth of Nations in 1776: “People of the
same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against
the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”
Even when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by acting like a monopoly, each individual
oligopoly faces a private temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity and earn slightly higher profit—while
still counting on the other oligopolists to hold down their production and keep prices high. If at least some oligopolists
give in to this temptation and start producing more, then the market price will fall. A small handful of oligopoly firms
may end up competing so fiercely that they all find themselves earning zero economic profits—as if they were perfect
competitors.
The Prisoner’s Dilemma
Because of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms, there is no single,
generally-accepted theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories for all the other market
structures. Instead, economists use game theory, a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players
must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do. Game theory has found
widespread applications in the social sciences, as well as in business, law, and military strategy.
The prisoner’s dilemma is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing
self-interest. It applies well to oligopoly. The story behind the prisoner’s dilemma goes like this:
Two co-conspiratorial criminals are arrested. When they are taken to the police station, they refuse to say
anything and are put in separate interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room where
Prisoner A is being held and says: “You know what? Your partner in the other room is confessing. Your
partner is going to get a light prison sentence of just one year, and because you’re remaining silent, the
judge is going to stick you with eight years in prison. Why don’t you get smart? If you confess, too, we’ll
cut your jail time down to five years, and your partner will get five years, also.” Over in the next room,
another police officer is giving exactly the same speech to Prisoner B. What the police officers do not say
is that if both prisoners remain silent, the evidence against them is not especially strong, and the prisoners
will end up with only two years in jail each.
The game theory situation facing the two prisoners is in Table 10.2. To understand the dilemma, first consider the
choices from Prisoner A’s point of view. If A believes that B will confess, then A should confess, too, so as to not
get stuck with the eight years in prison. However, if A believes that B will not confess, then A will be tempted to
act selfishly and confess, so as to serve only one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to confess regardless
of what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will have an incentive to confess regardless of
what choice A makes. To confess is called the dominant strategy. It is the strategy an individual (or firm) will pursue
regardless of the other individual’s (or firm’s) decision. The result is that if prisoners pursue their own self-interest,
both are likely to confess, and end up doing a total of 10 years of jail time between them.

Table 10.2 The Prisoner’s Dilemma Problem
The game is called a dilemma because if the two prisoners had cooperated by both remaining silent, they would only
have had to serve a total of four years of jail time between them. If the two prisoners can work out some way of
cooperating so that neither one will confess, they will both be better off than if they each follow their own individual
self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer jail terms.
The Oligopoly Version of the Prisoner’s Dilemma
The members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner’s dilemma, also. If each of the oligopolists cooperates in holding
down output, then high monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry that while it is holding
down output, other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits. Table
10.3 shows the prisoner’s dilemma for a two-firm oligopoly—known as a duopoly. If Firms A and B both agree to
hold down output, they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $1,000 in profits. However, both firms’
dominant strategy is to increase output, in which case each will earn $400 in profits.

A

cooperate with other firm)
A gets $1,500, B gets
$200
A gets $400, B gets $400
Table 10.3 A Prisoner’s Dilemma for Oligopolists
Can the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:
•
If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase output, then A will increase output, too, because
for A the profit of $400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand choice in Table 10.3) is
better than a profit of only $200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper right-hand choice in the
table).
•
If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may seize the opportunity to earn higher
profits by raising output. After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn $1,500 in profits by
expanding output (the bottom left-hand choice in the table) compared with only $1,000 by holding down
output as well (the upper left-hand choice in the table).
Thus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds down output and that it also makes sense to
expand output if B raises output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions that will lead B also to expand output.
The result of this prisoner’s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits
by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may well end up in
254
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

a situation where they each increase output and earn only $400 each in profits. The following Clear It Up feature
discusses one cartel scandal in particular.
What is the Lysine cartel?
Lysine, a $600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid that farmers use as a feed additive to ensure the
proper growth of swine and poultry. The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but
several other large European and Japanese firms are also in this market. For a time in the first half of the
1990s, the world’s major lysine producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how
much each firm would sell and what it would charge. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however,
had learned of the cartel and placed wire taps on a number of their phone calls and meetings.
From FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson, president of the corn processing
division at ADM, made to the other lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:
I wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we’re going to trust each other, okay,
and if I’m assured that I’m gonna get 67,000 tons by the year’s end, we’re gonna sell it at the
prices we agreed to . . . The only thing we need to talk about there because we are gonna get
manipulated by these [expletive] buyers—they can be smarter than us if we let them be smarter.
. . . They [the customers] are not your friend. They are not my friend. And we gotta have ‘em, but
they are not my friends. You are my friend. I wanna be closer to you than I am to any customer.
Cause you can make us ... money. ... And all I wanna tell you again is let’s—let’s put the prices on
the board. Let’s all agree that’s what we’re gonna do and then walk out of here and do it.
The price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland
pled guilty in 1996 and paid a fine of $100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other firms,
later paid fines of up to $350,000 and were sentenced to 24–30 months in prison.
In another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels Midland told an executive from another
competing firm that ADM had a slogan that, in his words, had “penetrated the whole company.” The company
president stated the slogan this way: “Our competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy.” That
slogan could stand as the motto of cartels everywhere.
How to Enforce Cooperation
How can parties who find themselves in a prisoner’s dilemma situation avoid the undesired outcome and cooperate
with each other? The way out of a prisoner’s dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not cooperate.
Perhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might imagine, would be to sign a contract with each
other that they will hold output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. companies signed such a contract,
however, it would be illegal. Certain international organizations, like the nations that are members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly, hold down
output, and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports. Such agreements,
however, because they fall in a gray area of international law, are not legally enforceable. If Nigeria, for example,
decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia cannot sue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.
Visit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/OPEC) and
learn more about its history and how it defines itself.
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly
255

Because oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act like a monopoly, the firms may instead keep
close tabs on what other firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists may choose to act in a way that
generates pressure on each firm to stick to its agreed quantity of output.
One example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the kinked demand curve, in which competing
oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts, but not price increases. Figure 10.5 shows this situation. Say that an
oligopoly airline has agreed with the rest of a cartel to provide a quantity of 10,000 seats on the New York to Los
Angeles route, at a price of $500. This choice defines the kink in the firm’s perceived demand curve. The reason that
the firm faces a kink in its demand curve is because of how the other oligopolists react to changes in the firm’s price.
If the oligopoly decides to produce more and cut its price, the other members of the cartel will immediately match
any price cuts—and therefore, a lower price brings very little increase in quantity sold.
If one firm cuts its price to $300, it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise prices,
the other oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of
sales. For example, if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold. Thus, if oligopolists always
match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but do not match price increases, then none of the oligopolists will have
a strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are minimal. This strategy can work like a silent form
of cooperation, in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output, increase price, and share a monopoly
level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement.
Figure 10.5 A Kinked Demand Curve Consider a member firm in an oligopoly cartel that is supposed to produce a
quantity of 10,000 and sell at a price of $500. The other members of the cartel can encourage this firm to honor its
commitments by acting so that the firm faces a kinked demand curve. If the oligopolist attempts to expand output and
reduce price slightly, other firms also cut prices immediately—so if the firm expands output to 11,000, the price per
unit falls dramatically, to $300. On the other side, if the oligopoly attempts to raise its price, other firms will not do so,
so if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales decline sharply to 5,000. Thus, the members of a cartel can discipline
each other to stick to the pre-agreed levels of quantity and price through a strategy of matching all price cuts but not
matching any price increases.
Many real-world oligopolies, prodded by economic changes, legal and political pressures, and the egos of their top
executives, go through episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain cooperation with each
256
Chapter 10 | Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly

other on output and pricing, they could earn profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each firm in an
oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a bigger share of the overall market; when firms start behaving
in this way, the market outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a highly competitive market.
Tradeoffs of Imperfect Competition
Monopolistic competition is probably the single most common market structure in the U.S. economy. It provides
powerful incentives for innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry assures that firms do not
earn economic profits in the long run. However, monopolistically competitive firms do not produce at the lowest point
on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless search to impress consumers through product differentiation may
lead to excessive social expenses on advertising and marketing.
Oligopoly is probably the second most common market structure. When oligopolies result from patented innovations
or from taking advantage of economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they may provide considerable benefit
to consumers. Oligopolies are often buffered by significant barriers to entry, which enable the oligopolists to earn
sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not typically produce at the minimum of their average
cost curves. When they lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to provide innovative products and high-
quality service.
The task of public policy with regard to competition is to sort through these multiple realities, attempting to encourage
behavior that is beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior that only adds to the profits of a few large
companies, with no corresponding benefit to consumers. Monopoly and Antitrust Policy discusses the delicate
judgments that go into this task.
The Temptation to Defy the Law
Oligopolistic firms have been called “cats in a bag,” as this chapter mentioned. The French detergent makers
chose to “cozy up” with each other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When the Wall Street
Journal reported on the matter, it wrote: “According to a statement a Henkel manager made to the [French
anti-trust] commission, the detergent makers wanted ‘to limit the intensity of the competition between them
and clean up the market.’ Nevertheless, by the early 1990s, a price war had broken out among them.” During
the soap executives’ meetings, sometimes lasting more than four hours, the companies established complex
pricing structures. “One [soap] executive recalled ‘chaotic’ meetings as each side tried to work out how the
other had bent the rules.” Like many cartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the very strong temptation
for each member to maximize its own individual profits.
How did this soap opera end? After an investigation, French antitrust authorities fined Colgate-Palmolive,
Henkel, and Proctor & Gamble a total of €361 million ($484 million). A similar fate befell the icemakers.
Bagged ice is a commodity, a perfect substitute, generally sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what
label is on the bag. By agreeing to carve up the ice market, control broad geographic swaths of territory, and
set prices, the icemakers moved from perfect competition to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each
firm was the sole supplier of bagged ice to a region. There were profits in both the long run and the short run.
According to the courts: “These companies illegally conspired to manipulate the marketplace.” Fines totaled
about $600,000—a steep fine considering a bag of ice sells for under $3 in most parts of the United States.
Even though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set prices and carve up a market, the temptation
to earn higher profits makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
10.1 Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition refers to a market where many firms sell differentiated products. Differentiated products
can arise from characteristics of the good or service, location from which the firm sells the product, intangible aspects
of the product, and perceptions of the product.
The perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is downward-sloping, which shows that it
is a price maker and chooses a combination of price and quantity. However, the perceived demand curve for a
monopolistic competitor is more elastic than the perceived demand curve for a monopolist, because the monopolistic
competitor has direct competition, unlike the pure monopolist. A profit-maximizing monopolistic competitor will
seek out the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. The monopolistic competitor will produce
that level of output and charge the price that the firm’s demand curve indicates.
If the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are earning economic profits, the industry will attract entry
until profits are driven down to zero in the long run. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are
suffering economic losses, then the industry will experience exit of firms until economic losses are driven up to zero
in the long run.
A monopolistically competitive firm is not productively efficient because it does not produce at the minimum of
its average cost curve. A monopolistically competitive firm is not allocatively efficient because it does not produce
where P = MC, but instead produces where P > MC. Thus, a monopolistically competitive firm will tend to produce
a lower quantity at a higher cost and to charge a higher price than a perfectly competitive firm.
Monopolistically competitive industries do offer benefits to consumers in the form of greater variety and incentives
for improved products and services. There is some controversy over whether a market-oriented economy generates
too much variety.
10.2 Oligopoly
An oligopoly is a situation where a few firms sell most or all of the goods in a market. Oligopolists earn their
258

highest profits if they can band together as a cartel and act like a monopolist by reducing output and raising price.
Since each member of the oligopoly can benefit individually from expanding output, such collusion often breaks
down—especially since explicit collusion is illegal.
The prisoner’s dilemma is an example of the application of game theory to analysis of oligopoly. It shows how, in
certain situations, all sides can benefit from cooperative behavior rather than self-interested behavior. However, the
challenge for the parties is to find ways to encourage cooperative behavior.
SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS
1.
Suppose that, due to a successful advertising campaign, a monopolistic competitor experiences an increase in
demand for its product. How will that affect the price it charges and the quantity it supplies?
2.
Continuing with the scenario in question 1, in the long run, the positive economic profits that the monopolistic
competitor earns will attract a response either from existing firms in the industry or firms outside. As those firms
capture the original firm’s profit, what will happen to the original firm’s profit-maximizing price and output levels?
3. Consider the curve in Figure 10.6, which shows the market demand, marginal cost, and marginal revenue curve
for firms in an oligopolistic industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed costs.
a.
Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the cartel charge? What quantity will the cartel
supply? How much profit will the cartel earn?
b.
Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms compete as vigorously as possible by cutting
the price and increasing sales. What will be the industry quantity and price? What will be the collective profits
of all firms in the industry?
c.
Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel and cutthroat competition outcomes.

4. Sometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size. Suppose we have a duopoly where one firm
(Firm A) is large and the other firm (Firm B) is small, as the prisoner’s dilemma box in Table 10.4 shows.

A
Firm B cheats by selling more

are earning economic profits or losses in the short run,
would you expect them to continue doing so in the long
run? Why?
10. Is a monopolistically competitive firm productively
efficient? Is it allocatively efficient? Why or why not?

Does each individual in a prisoner’s dilemma
benefit more from cooperation or from pursuing self-
interest? Explain briefly.

What stops oligopolists from acting together as
a monopolist and earning the highest possible level of

CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
14.
Aside from advertising, how can monopolistically
competitive firms increase demand for their products?
15. Make a case for why monopolistically competitive
industries never reach long-run equilibrium.
16.
Would you rather have efficiency or variety? That
is, one opportunity cost of the variety of products we
have is that each product costs more per unit than if
there were only one kind of product of a given type, like
shoes. Perhaps a better question is, “What is the right
amount of variety? Can there be too many varieties of
shoes, for example?”
17.
Would you expect the kinked demand curve to be
more extreme (like a right angle) or less extreme (like a
normal demand curve) if each firm in the cartel produces
a near-identical product like OPEC and petroleum?
What if each firm produces a somewhat different
product? Explain your reasoning.

When OPEC raised the price of oil dramatically
in the mid-1970s, experts said it was unlikely that the
cartel could stay together over the long term—that the
incentives for individual members to cheat would
become too strong. More than forty years later, OPEC
still exists. Why do you think OPEC has been able to
beat the odds and continue to collude? Hint: You may
wish to consider non-economic reasons.

Mary and Raj are the only two growers who
provide organically grown corn to a local grocery store.
They know that if they cooperated and produced less
corn, they could raise the price of the corn. If they
work independently, they will each earn $100. If they
decide to work together and both lower their output,
they can each earn $150. If one person lowers output
and the other does not, the person who lowers output
will earn $0 and the other person will capture the entire
market and will earn $200. Table 10.6 represents the

Figure 11.1 Oligopoly versus Competitors in the Marketplace
Large corporations, such as the natural gas
producer Kinder Morgan, can bring economies of scale to the marketplace. Will that benefit consumers, or is more
competition better? (Credit: modification of work by Derrick Coetzee/Flickr Creative Commons)
More than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling
If you live in the United States, there is a slightly better than 50–50 chance your home is heated and cooled
using natural gas. You may even use natural gas for cooking. However, those uses are not the primary uses
of natural gas in the U.S. In 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating,
cooling, and cooking accounted for just 16% of natural gas usage. What accounts for the rest? The greatest
uses for natural gas are the generation of electric power (36%) and in industry (28%). Together these three
uses for natural gas touch many areas of our lives, so why would there be any opposition to a merger of two
natural gas firms? After all, a merger could mean increased efficiencies and reduced costs to people like you
and me.
In October 2011, Kinder Morgan and El Paso Corporation, two natural gas firms, announced they were
merging. The announcement stated the combined firm would link “nearly every major production region with
markets,” cut costs by “eliminating duplication in pipelines and other assets,” and that “the savings could be
passed on to consumers.”
The objection? The $21.1 billion deal would give Kinder Morgan control of more than 80,000 miles of
pipeline, making the new firm the third largest energy producer in North America. Policymakers and the public
wondered whether the new conglomerate really would pass on cost savings to consumers, or would the
merger give Kinder Morgan a strong oligopoly position in the natural gas marketplace?
That brings us to the central questions this chapter poses: What should the balance be between corporate
size and a larger number of competitors in a marketplace, and what role should the government play in this
balancing act?

Introduction to Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Corporate Mergers
•
Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior
•
Regulating Natural Monopolies
•
The Great Deregulation Experiment
The previous chapters on the theory of the firm identified three important lessons: First, that competition, by
providing consumers with lower prices and a variety of innovative products, is a good thing; second, that large-
scale production can dramatically lower average costs; and third, that markets in the real world are rarely perfectly
competitive. As a consequence, government policymakers must determine how much to intervene to balance the
potential benefits of large-scale production against the potential loss of competition that can occur when businesses
grow in size, especially through mergers.
For example, in 2006, AT&T and BellSouth proposed a merger. At the time, there were very few mobile phone service
providers. Both the Justice Department and the FCC blocked the proposal.
The two companies argued that the merger would benefit consumers, who would be able to purchase better
telecommunications services at a cheaper price because the newly created firm would take advantage of economies
of scale and eliminate duplicate investments. However, a number of activist groups like the Consumer Federation
of America and Public Knowledge expressed fears that the merger would reduce competition and lead to higher
prices for consumers for decades to come. In December 2006, the federal government allowed the merger to
proceed. By 2009, the new post-merger AT&T was the eighth largest company by revenues in the United States,
and by that measure the largest telecommunications company in the world. Economists have spent – and will still
spend – years trying to determine whether the merger of AT&T and BellSouth, as well as other smaller mergers
of telecommunications companies at about this same time, helped consumers, hurt them, or did not make much
difference.
This chapter discusses public policy issues about competition. How can economists and governments determine when
mergers of large companies like AT&T and BellSouth should be allowed and when they should be blocked? The
government also plays a role in policing anticompetitive behavior other than mergers, like prohibiting certain kinds
of contracts that might restrict competition. In the case of natural monopoly, however, trying to preserve competition
probably will not work very well, and so government will often resort to regulation of price and/or quantity of output.
In recent decades, there has been a global trend toward less government intervention in the price and output decisions
of businesses.
11.1 | Corporate Mergers
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain antitrust law and its significance
•
Calculate concentration ratios
•
Calculate the Herfindahl-Herschman Index (HHI)
•
Evaluate methods of antitrust regulation
A corporate merger occurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm. When one firm
purchases another, it is called an acquisition. An acquisition may not look just like a merger, since the newly
purchased firm may continue to operate under its former company name. Mergers can also be lateral, where two firms
of similar sizes combine to become one. However, both mergers and acquisitions lead to two formerly separate firms
operating under common ownership, and so they are commonly grouped together.
Regulations for Approving Mergers
Since a merger combines two firms into one, it can reduce the extent of competition between firms. Therefore, when
264
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

two U.S. firms announce a merger or acquisition where at least one of the firms is above a minimum size of sales (a
threshold that moves up gradually over time, and was at $76.3 million in 2015), or certain other conditions are met,
they are required under law to notify the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The left-hand panel of Figure 11.2
(a) shows the number of mergers submitted for review to the FTC each year from 2002 to 2015. Mergers follow the
business cycle, falling after the 2001 recession, peaking in 2007 as the Great Recession struck, and then rising since
2009. The right-hand panel of Figure 11.2 (b) shows the distribution of those mergers submitted for review in 2015
as measured by the size of the transaction. It is important to remember that this total leaves out many small mergers
under $50 million, which companies only need to report in certain limited circumstances. About a third of all reported
merger and acquisition transactions in 2015 exceeded $500 million, while about 15 percent exceeded $1 billion.
Figure 11.2 Number and Size of Mergers (a) The number of mergers grew from 2003 to 2007, then fell
dramatically during the 2008-2009 Great Recession, before recovering since. (b) In 2015, the greatest number of
mergers submitted for review by the Federal Trade Commission was for transactions between $500 million and $1
billion.
The laws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and even in some cases to break up large firms
into smaller ones, are called antitrust laws. Before a large merger happens, the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the
U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger, prohibit it, or allow it if certain conditions are met. One common
condition is that the merger will be allowed if the firm agrees to sell off certain parts. For example, in 2006, Johnson &
Johnson bought the Pfizer’s “consumer health” division, which included well-known brands like Listerine mouthwash
and Sudafed cold medicine. As a condition of allowing the merger, Johnson & Johnson was required to sell off six
brands to other firms, including Zantac® heartburn relief medication, Cortizone anti-itch cream, and Balmex diaper
rash medication, to preserve a greater degree of competition in these markets.
The U.S. government approves most proposed mergers. In a market-oriented economy, firms have the freedom to
make their own choices. Private firms generally have the freedom to:
•
expand or reduce production
•
set the price they choose
•
open new factories or sales facilities or close them
•
hire workers or to lay them off
•
start selling new products or stop selling existing ones
If the owners want to acquire a firm or be acquired, or to merge with another firm, this decision is just one of many
that firms are free to make. In these conditions, the managers of private firms will sometimes make mistakes. They
may close down a factory which, it later turns out, would have been profitable. They may start selling a product that
ends up losing money. A merger between two companies can sometimes lead to a clash of corporate personalities
that makes both firms worse off. However, the fundamental belief behind a market-oriented economy is that firms,
not governments, are in the best position to know if their actions will lead to attracting more customers or producing
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
265

more efficiently.
Government regulators agree that most mergers are beneficial to consumers. As the Federal Trade Commission
has noted on its website (as of November, 2013): “Most mergers actually benefit competition and consumers by
allowing firms to operate more efficiently.” At the same time, the FTC recognizes, “Some [mergers] are likely to
lessen competition. That, in turn, can lead to higher prices, reduced availability of goods or services, lower quality of
products, and less innovation. Some mergers create a concentrated market, while others enable a single firm to raise
prices.” The challenge for the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice is to figure out when
a merger may hinder competition. This decision involves both numerical tools and some judgments that are difficult
to quantify. The following Clear It Up explains the origins of U.S. antitrust law.
What is U.S. antitrust law?
In the closing decades of the 1800s, many industries in the U.S. economy were dominated by a single firm
that had most of the sales for the entire country. Supporters of these large firms argued that they could take
advantage of economies of scale and careful planning to provide consumers with products at low prices.
However, critics pointed out that when competition was reduced, these firms were free to charge more and
make permanently higher profits, and that without the goading of competition, it was not clear that they were
as efficient or innovative as they could be.
In many cases, these large firms were organized in the legal form of a “trust,” in which a group of formerly
independent firms were consolidated by mergers and purchases, and a group of “trustees” then ran the
companies as if they were a single firm. Thus, when the U.S. government sought to limit the power of these
trusts, it passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 - the nation's first antitrust law. In an early demonstration
of the law’s power, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government’s right to break up Standard Oil,
which had controlled about 90% of the country’s oil refining, into 34 independent firms, including Exxon, Mobil,
Amoco, and Chevron. In 1914, the Clayton Antitrust Act outlawed mergers and acquisitions (where the
outcome would be to “substantially lessen competition” in an industry), price discrimination (where different
customers are charged different prices for the same product), and tied sales (where purchase of one product
commits the buyer to purchase some other product). Also in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was
created to define more specifically what competition was unfair. In 1950, the Celler-Kefauver Act extended
the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers. A vertical merger occurs when two or more
firms, operating at different levels within an industry's supply chain, merge operations. A conglomerate merger
is a merger between firms that are involved in totally unrelated business activities. In the twenty-first century,
the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws.
The Four-Firm Concentration Ratio
Regulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry. An early tool was the
concentration ratio, which measures the combined market share (or percent of total industry sales) which account
for the largest firms (typically the top four to eight). For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create
inefficiencies in an economy, refer to Monopoly.
Say that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares
in Table 11.1, where the market share is each firm’s proportion of total sales in that market. We calculate the four-
firm concentration ratio by adding the market shares of the four largest firms: in this case, 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40. We
do not consider this concentration ratio especially high, because the largest four firms have less than half the market.
If the market shares for replacing automobile windshields are:
Smooth as Glass Repair Company
16% of the market
Table 11.1 Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares
266
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

If the market shares for replacing automobile windshields are:
The Auto Glass Doctor Company
10% of the market
Your Car Shield Company
8% of the market
Seven firms that each have 6% of the market
42% of the market, combined
Eight firms that each have 3% of the market
24% of the market, combined
Then the four-firm concentration ratio is 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40.
Table 11.1 Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares
The concentration ratio approach can help to clarify some of the fuzziness over deciding when a merger might affect
competition. For instance, if two of the smallest firms in the hypothetical market for repairing automobile windshields
merged, the four-firm concentration ratio would not change—which implies that there is not much worry that the
degree of competition in the market has notably diminished. However, if the top two firms merged, then the four-firm
concentration ratio would become 46 (that is, 26 + 8 + 6 + 6). While this concentration ratio is modestly higher, the
four-firm concentration ratio would still be less than half, so such a proposed merger might barely raise an eyebrow
among antitrust regulators.

FTC.
The Herfindahl-Hirshman Index
A four-firm concentration ratio is a simple tool, which may reveal only part of the story. For example, consider two
industries that both have a four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, in one industry five firms each control 20%
of the market, while in the other industry, the top firm holds 77% of the market and all the other firms have 1% each.
Although the four-firm concentration ratios are identical, it would be reasonable to worry more about the extent of
competition in the second case—where the largest firm is nearly a monopoly—than in the first.
Another approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). We calculate HHI by summing the squares of the market share of each firm
in the industry, as the following Work It Out shows.
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
267

Calculating HHI
Step 1. Calculate the HHI for a monopoly with a market share of 100%. Because there is only one firm, it has
100% market share. The HHI is 1002 = 10,000.
Step 2. For an extremely competitive industry, with dozens or hundreds of extremely small competitors, the
HHI value might drop as low as 100 or even less. Calculate the HHI for an industry with 100 firms that each
have 1% of the market. In this case, the HHI is 100(12) = 100.
Step 3. Calculate the HHI for the industry in Table 11.1. In this case, the HHI is 162 + 102 + 82 + 7(62) + 8(32)
= 744.
Step 4. Note that the HHI gives greater weight to large firms.
Step 5. Consider the earlier example, comparing one industry where five firms each have 20% of the market
with an industry where one firm has 77% and the other 23 firms have 1% each. The two industries have the
same four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, the HHI for the first industry is 5(202) = 2,000, while the
HHI for the second industry is much higher at 772 + 23(12) = 5,952.
Step 6. Note that the near-monopolist in the second industry drives up the HHI measure of industrial
concentration.
Step 7. Review Table 11.2 which gives some examples of the four-firm concentration ratio and the HHI in
various U.S. industries in 2016. (You can find market share data from multiple industry sources. Data in
the table are from: Statista.com (for wireless), The Wall Street Journal (for automobiles), Gartner.com (for
computers) and the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (for airlines).)

Table 11.2 Examples of Concentration Ratios and HHIs in the U.S. Economy, 2016
In the 1980s, the FTC followed these guidelines: If a merger would result in an HHI of less than 1,000, the FTC
would probably approve it. If a merger would result in an HHI of more than 1,800, the FTC would probably challenge
it. If a merger would result in an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800, then the FTC would scrutinize the plan and make a
case-by-case decision. However, in the last several decades, the antitrust enforcement authorities have moved away
from relying as heavily on measures of concentration ratios and HHIs to determine whether they will allow a merger,
and instead they carry out more case-by-case analysis on the extent of competition in different industries.
New Directions for Antitrust
Both the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index share some weaknesses. First, they begin
268
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy

from the assumption that the “market” under discussion is well-defined, and the only question is measuring how
sales are divided in that market. Second, they are based on an implicit assumption that competitive conditions across
industries are similar enough that a broad measure of concentration in the market is enough to make a decision about
the effects of a merger. These assumptions, however, are not always correct. In response to these two problems, the
antitrust regulators have been changing their approach in the last decade or two.
Defining a market is often controversial. For example, Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the
software for computer operating systems. However, in the total market for all computer software and services,
including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. A narrowly
defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher, while a broadly defined market will tend to make it
appear smaller.
In recent decades, there have been two especially important shifts affecting how we define markets: one centers on
technology and the other centers on globalization. In addition, these two shifts are interconnected. With the vast
improvement in communications technologies, including the development of the internet, a consumer can order books
or pet supplies from all over the country or the world. As a result, the degree of competition many local retail
businesses face has increased. The same effect may operate even more strongly in markets for business supplies,
where so-called “business-to-business” websites can allow buyers and suppliers from anywhere in the world to find
each other.
Globalization has changed the market boundaries. As recently as the 1970s, it was common for measurements of
concentration ratios and HHIs to stop at national borders. Now, many industries find that their competition comes
from the global market. A few decades ago, three companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, dominated the
U.S. auto market. By 2014, however, production of these three firms accounted for less than half of U.S. auto sales,
and they were facing competition from well-known car manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen,
Mitsubishi, and Mazda. When analysts calculate HHIs with a global perspective, concentration in most major
industries—including cars—is lower than in a purely domestic context.
Because attempting to define a particular market can be difficult and controversial, the Federal Trade Commission
has begun to look less at market share and more at the data on actual competition between businesses. For example,
in February 2007, Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Market announced that they wished to merge. These were
the two largest companies in the market that the government defined as “premium natural and organic supermarket
chains.” However, one could also argue that they were two relatively small companies in the broader market for all
stores that sell groceries or specialty food products.
Rather than relying on a market definition, the government antitrust regulators looked at detailed evidence on profits
and prices for specific stores in different cities, both before and after other competitive stores entered or exited. Based
on that evidence, the Federal Trade Commission decided to block the merger. After two years of legal battles, the
FTC eventually allowed the merger in 2009 under the conditions that Whole Foods sell off the Wild Oats brand name
and a number of individual stores, to preserve competition in certain local markets. For more on the difficulties of
defining markets, refer to Monopoly.
This new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies, instead of
defining a market and counting up total sales. A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical
tools and real-world evidence to estimate the demand curves and supply curves the firms proposing a merger face.
A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry. Some possibilities include competing
to cut prices, to raise output, to build a brand name through advertising, and to build a reputation for good service
or high quality. With these pieces of the puzzle in place, it is then possible to build a statistical model that estimates
the likely outcome for consumers if the two firms are allowed to merge. These models do require some degree of
subjective judgment, and so they can become the subject of legal disputes between the antitrust authorities and the
companies that wish to merge.

11.2 | Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Analyze restrictive practices
•
Explain tying sales, bundling, and predatory pricing
•
Evaluate a real-world situation of possible anticompetitive and restrictive practices
The U.S. antitrust laws reach beyond blocking mergers that would reduce competition to include a wide array of
anticompetitive practices. For example, it is illegal for competitors to form a cartel to collude to make pricing and
output decisions, as if they were a monopoly firm. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of
Justice prohibit firms from agreeing to fix prices or output, rigging bids, or sharing or dividing markets by allocating
customers, suppliers, territories, or lines of commerce.
In the late 1990s, for example, the antitrust regulators prosecuted an international cartel of vitamin manufacturers,
including the Swiss firm Hoffman-La Roche, the German firm BASF, and the French firm Rhone-Poulenc. These
firms reached agreements on how much to produce, how much to charge, and which firm would sell to which
customers. Firms bought the high-priced vitamins like General Mills, Kellogg, Purina-Mills, and Proctor and Gamble
which pushed up the prices more. Hoffman-La Roche pleaded guilty in May 1999 and agreed both to pay a fine of
$500 million and to have at least one top executive serve four months of jail time.
Under U.S. antitrust laws, monopoly itself is not illegal. If a firm has a monopoly because of a newly patented
invention, for example, the law explicitly allows a firm to earn higher-than-normal profits for a time as a reward for
innovation. If a firm achieves a large share of the market by producing a better product at a lower price, such behavior
is not prohibited by antitrust law.
Restrictive Practices
Antitrust law includes rules against restrictive practices—practices that do not involve outright agreements to
raise price or to reduce the quantity produced, but that might have the effect of reducing competition. Antitrust
cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial, because they delve into specific contracts or agreements
between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others.
For example, if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal
for the manufacturer to demand a minimum resale price maintenance agreement, which would require the dealers
to sell for at least a certain minimum price. A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition
among dealers. However, the manufacturer is legally allowed to “suggest” minimum prices and to stop selling to
dealers who regularly undercut the suggested price. If you think this rule sounds like a fairly subtle distinction, you
are right.
An exclusive dealing agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal. It is legal if the purpose
of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers. For example, it is legal for the Ford Motor Company to
sell its cars to only Ford dealers, and for General Motors to sell to only GM dealers, and so on. However, exclusive
deals may also limit competition. If one large retailer obtained the exclusive rights to be the sole distributor of
televisions, computers, and audio equipment made by a number of companies, then this exclusive contract would
have an anticompetitive effect on other retailers.
Tying sales happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product.
Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want
or need. Further, the additional, required products are not necessarily advantageous to the customer. Suppose that to
purchase a popular DVD, the store required that you also purchase a certain portable TV model. These products are
only loosely related, thus there is no reason to make the purchase of one contingent on the other. Even if a customer
were interested in a portable TV, the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of
selecting one from the numerous types available in the market.
A related, but not identical, concept is bundling, where a firm sells two or more products as one. Bundling typically
offers an advantage for consumers by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price. For
example, several cable companies allow customers to buy products like cable, internet, and a phone line through a
special price available through bundling. Customers are also welcome to purchase these products separately, but the
270

price of bundling is usually more appealing.
In some cases, we can view tying sales and bundling as anticompetitive. However, in other cases they may be legal
and even common. It is common for people to purchase season tickets to a sports team or a set of concerts so
to guarantee tickets to the few contests or shows that are most popular and likely to sell out. Computer software
manufacturers may often bundle a number of different programs, even when the buyer wants only a few. Think about
the software that is included in a new computer purchase, for example.
Recall from the chapter on Monopoly that predatory pricing occurs when the existing firm (or firms) reacts to a new
firm by dropping prices very low, until the new firm is driven out of the market, at which point the existing firm raises
prices again. This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring new firms from entering the market. However, in practice,
it can be hard to figure out when pricing is predatory. Say that American Airlines is flying between two cities, and a
new airline starts flying between the same two cities, at a lower price. If American Airlines cuts its price to match the
new entrant, is this predatory pricing or is it just market competition at work? A commonly proposed rule is that if a
firm is selling for less than its average variable cost—that is, at a price where it should be shutting down—then there
is evidence for predatory pricing. However, calculating in the real world what costs are variable and what costs are
fixed is often not obvious, either.
The Microsoft antitrust case embodies many of these gray areas in restrictive practices, as the next Clear It Up shows.
Did
Microsoft®
engage
in
anticompetitive
and
restrictive
practices?
The most famous restrictive practices case of recent years was a series of lawsuits by the U.S. government
against Microsoft—lawsuits that some of Microsoft’s competitors encouraged. All sides admitted that
Microsoft’s Windows program had a near-monopoly position in the market for the software used in general
computer operating systems. All sides agreed that the software had many satisfied customers and that the
computer software capabilities were compatible with Windows. Software that Microsoft and other companies
produced had expanded dramatically in the 1990s. Having a monopoly or a near-monopoly is not necessarily
illegal in and of itself, but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market, antitrust regulators
look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care.
The antitrust regulators argued that Microsoft had gone beyond profiting from its software innovations and
its dominant position in the software market for operating systems, and had tried to use its market power in
operating systems software to take over other parts of the software industry. For example, the government
argued that Microsoft had engaged in an anticompetitive form of exclusive dealing by threatening computer
makers that, if they did not leave another firm’s software off their machines (specifically, Netscape’s Internet
browser), then Microsoft would not sell them its operating system software. Government antitrust regulators
accused Microsoft of tying together its Windows operating system software, where it had a monopoly, with
its Internet Explorer browser software, where it did not have a monopoly, and thus using this bundling as an
anticompetitive tool. The government also accused Microsoft of a form of predatory pricing; namely, giving
away certain additional software products for free as part of Windows, as a way of driving out the competition
from other software makers.
In April 2000, a federal court held that Microsoft’s behavior had crossed the line into unfair competition, and
recommended that the company be split into two competing firms. However, the court overturned that penalty
on appeal, and in November 2002 Microsoft reached a settlement with the government that it would end its
restrictive practices.
The concept of restrictive practices is continually evolving, as firms seek new ways to earn profits and government
regulators define what is permissible. A situation where the law is evolving and changing is always somewhat
troublesome, since laws are most useful and fair when firms know what they are in advance. In addition, since the law
is open to interpretation, competitors who are losing out in the market can accuse successful firms of anticompetitive
restrictive practices, and try to win through government regulation what they have failed to accomplish in the market.

Officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are, of course, aware of these issues, but
there is no easy way to resolve them.
11.3 | Regulating Natural Monopolies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Evaluate the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly
•
Interpret a graph of regulatory choices
•
Contrast cost-plus and price cap regulation
Most true monopolies today in the U.S. are regulated, natural monopolies. A natural monopoly poses a difficult
challenge for competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand makes competition unlikely or costly. A
natural monopoly arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand.
This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs. As a result, one firm is able to supply the
total quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more firms—so splitting up the natural monopoly
would raise the average cost of production and force customers to pay more.
Public utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water and electrical service across much of the United
States, are leading examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a local water company
should be divided into several competing companies, each with its own separate set of pipes and water supplies.
Installing four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water company, so that each household could
choose its own water provider, would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to the idea of having many
competing companies for delivering electricity to homes, each with its own set of wires. Before the advent of wireless
phones, the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone companies, each with its own set of phone
wires running through the neighborhood.
The Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly
What then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly? Figure 11.3 illustrates the case of natural
monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve.
Points A, B, C, and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation. Table 11.3 outlines the regulatory choices
for dealing with a natural monopoly.

Figure 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly will maximize profits by
producing at the quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal costs (MC) and by then looking to the market
demand curve to see what price to charge for this quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a quantity of 4
and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly in half, then each half would produce at point B,
with average costs of 9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce where marginal cost
crosses the market demand curve at point C. However, if the firm is required to produce at a quantity of 8 and sell at
a price of 3.5, the firm will suffer from losses. The most likely choice is point F, where the firm is required to produce a
quantity of 6 and charge a price of 6.5.

Table 11.3 Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly
(*We obtain total revenue by
multiplying price and quantity. However, we have rounded some of the price values in this table for ease
of presentation.)
The first possibility is to leave the natural monopoly alone. In this case, the monopoly will follow its normal approach
to maximizing profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at point P at a quantity of 4. The
firm then looks to point A on the demand curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for that profit-maximizing
quantity. Since the price is above the average cost curve, the natural monopoly would earn economic profits.
A second outcome arises if antitrust authorities decide to divide the company, so that the new firms can compete. As
a simple example, imagine that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one large firm producing a quantity of
4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity of 2. Because of the declining average cost curve (AC), the average
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
273

cost of production for each of the half-size companies each producing 2, as point B shows, would be 9.75, while the
average cost of production for a larger firm producing 4 would only be 7.75. Thus, the economy would become less
productively efficient, since the good is produced at a higher average cost. In a situation with a downward-sloping
average cost curve, two smaller firms will always have higher average costs of production than one larger firm for
any quantity of total output. In addition, the antitrust authorities must worry that splitting the natural monopoly into
pieces may be only the start of their problems. If one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower
average costs and may be able to drive its competitor out of the market. Alternatively, two firms in a market may
discover subtle ways of coordinating their behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the result will not be the
greater competition that was desired.
A third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and quantities produced for this industry. The regulators
will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest.
Point C illustrates one tempting choice: the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where
marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and charge the price of 3.5, which is equal to marginal cost
at that point. This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost, which is what would
occur in a perfectly competitive market, and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the
monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of resources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers
of the last unit bought and sold in this market is equal to the marginal cost of producing it.
Attempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however, runs into a severe difficulty. At point C, with
an output of 8, a price of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, so if the firm charges a price of
3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public subsidy (and
there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm will lose money and go out of business.
Perhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is, to set the price where AC crosses the demand
curve at an output of 6 and a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let the natural monopoly
charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a normal rate of profit, so that it can continue operating, but prevent
the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly profits, as it would at the monopoly choice A.
Determining this level of output and price with the political pressures, time constraints, and limited information of
the real world is much harder than identifying the point on a graph. For more on the problems that can arise from a
centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and price ceilings in Demand and Supply.
Cost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation
Regulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general approach of attempting to choose a point like F
in Figure 11.3. They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies, added in an
amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price for consumers accordingly. This
method was known as cost-plus regulation.
Cost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers receive reimbursement for their costs, plus a bit more,
then at a minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high costs—because they can just pass them
along in higher prices. Worse, firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate high costs by
building huge factories or employing many staff, because what they can charge is linked to the costs they incur.
Thus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some public utility regulators began to use price cap regulation, where the regulator
sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a price that declined
slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps, it can make a high
level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price caps or suffers bad luck in the market, it may
suffer losses. A few years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price caps based on the firm’s
performance.
Price cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price regulators set the price cap unrealistically low. It
may not work if the market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring losses no matter what it
does—say, if energy prices rise dramatically on world markets, then the company selling natural gas or heating oil
to homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year or two ago. However, if the regulators
compare the prices with producers of the same good in other areas, they can, in effect, pressure a natural monopoly
in one area to compete with the prices charged in other areas. Moreover, the possibility of earning greater profits or
experiencing losses—instead of having an average rate of profit locked in every year by cost-plus regulation—can
provide the natural monopoly with incentives for efficiency and innovation.
With natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so if consumers are not to suffer the high prices

and restricted output of an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a role. In attempting to
design a system of price cap regulation with flexibility and incentive, government regulators do not have an easy task.
11.4 | The Great Deregulation Experiment
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Evaluate the effectiveness of price regulation and antitrust policy
•
Explain regulatory capture and its significance
Governments at all levels across the United States have regulated prices in a wide range of industries. In some cases,
like water and electricity that have natural monopoly characteristics, there is some room in economic theory for such
regulation. However, once politicians are given a basis to intervene in markets and to choose prices and quantities, it
is hard to know where to stop.
Doubts about Regulation of Prices and Quantities
Beginning in the 1970s, it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation
was not working well. The United States carried out a great policy experiment—the deregulation that we discussed
in Monopoly—removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines, railroads, trucking,
intercity bus travel, natural gas, and bank interest rates. The Clear It Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one
industry in particular—airlines.
What are the results of airline deregulation?
Why did the pendulum swing in favor of deregulation? Consider the airline industry. In the early days of air
travel, no airline could make a profit just by flying passengers. Airlines needed something else to carry and
the Postal Service provided that something with airmail. Thus, the first U.S. government regulation of the
airline industry happened through the Postal Service, when in 1926 the Postmaster General began giving
airlines permission to fly certain routes based on mail delivery needs—and the airlines took some passengers
along for the ride. In 1934, the antitrust authorities charged the Postmaster General with colluding with the
major airlines of that day to monopolize the nation’s airways. In 1938, the U.S. government created the Civil
Aeronautics Board (CAB) to regulate airfares and routes instead. For 40 years, from 1938 to 1978, the CAB
approved all fares, controlled all entry and exit, and specified which airlines could fly which routes. There was
zero entry of new airlines on the main routes across the country for 40 years, because the CAB did not think
it was necessary.
In 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act took the government out of the business of determining airfares and
schedules. The new law shook up the industry. Famous old airlines like Pan American, Eastern, and Braniff
went bankrupt and disappeared. Some new airlines like People Express were created—and then vanished.
The greater competition from deregulation reduced airfares by about one-third over the next two decades,
saving consumers billions of dollars a year. The average flight used to take off with just half its seats full; now
it is two-thirds full, which is far more efficient. Airlines have also developed hub-and-spoke systems, where
planes all fly into a central hub city at a certain time and then depart. As a result, one can fly between any of
the spoke cities with just one connection—and there is greater service to more cities than before deregulation.
With lower fares and more service, the number of air passengers doubled from the late 1970s to the start of
the 2000s—an increase that, in turn, doubled the number of jobs in the airline industry. Meanwhile, with the
watchful oversight of government safety inspectors, commercial air travel has continued to get safer over time.
The U.S. airline industry is far from perfect. For example, a string of mergers in recent years has raised
concerns over how competition might be compromised.
Chapter 11 | Monopoly and Antitrust Policy
275

One difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call regulatory capture, in which the firms that
are supposedly regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow. When the airline
industry was regulated, for example, it suggested appointees to the regulatory board, sent lobbyists to argue with the
board, provided most of the information on which the board made decisions, and offered well-paid jobs to at least
some of the people leaving the board. In this situation, it is easy for regulators to poorly represent consumers. The
result of regulatory capture is that government price regulation can often become a way for existing competitors to
work together to reduce output, keep prices high, and limit competition.
The Effects of Deregulation
Deregulation, both of airlines and of other industries, has its negatives. The greater pressure of competition led to
entry and exit. When firms went bankrupt or contracted substantially in size, they laid off workers who had to find
other jobs. Market competition is, after all, a full-contact sport.
A number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron, Tyco International, and
WorldCom led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. The government designed Sarbanes-Oxley to increase confidence
in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud.
The Great Recession, which began in late 2007, was caused at least in part by a global financial crisis, which began
in the United States. The key component of the crisis was the creation and subsequent failure of several types of
unregulated financial assets, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, a type of mortgage-backed security),
and credit default swaps (CDSs, insurance contracts on assets like CMOs that provided a payoff even if the holder of
the CDS did not own the CMO). Private credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poors, Moody’s, and Fitch rated
many of these assets very safe.
The collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers,
a major investment bank, numerous large commercial banks, such as Wachovia, and even the Federal National
Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), which had to be nationalized—that is, taken over by the federal government.
One response to the financial crisis was the Dodd-Frank Act, which majorly attempted to reform the financial
system. The legislation’s purpose, as noted on dodd-frank.com is:
To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in
the financial system, to end “too big to fail,” to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, [and] to
protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. . .
All market-based economies operate against a background of laws and regulations, including laws about enforcing
contracts, collecting taxes, and protecting health and the environment. The government policies that we discussed
in this chapter—like blocking certain anticompetitive mergers, ending restrictive practices, imposing price cap
regulation on natural monopolies, and deregulation—demonstrate the role of government to strengthen the incentives
that come with a greater degree of competition.
More than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling
What did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decide on the Kinder Morgan / El Paso Corporation merger?
After careful examination, federal officials decided there was only one area of significant overlap that might
provide the merged firm with strong market power. The FTC approved the merger, provided Kinder Morgan
divest itself of the overlap area. Tallgrass purchased Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer
Pipeline Co. LLC, two processing facilities in Wyoming, and Kinder Morgan’s 50 percent interest in the
Rockies Express Pipeline to meet the FTC requirements. The FTC was attempting to strike a balance between
potential cost reductions resulting from economies of scale and concentration of market power.
Did the price of natural gas decrease? Yes, rather significantly. In 2010, the wellhead price of natural gas was
$4.48 per thousand cubic foot. In 2012 the price had fallen to just $2.66. Was the merger responsible for the
large drop in price? The answer is uncertain. The larger contributor to the sharp drop in price was the overall
increase in the supply of natural gas. Increasingly, more natural gas was able to be recovered by fracturing
shale deposits, a process called fracking. Fracking, which is controversial for environmental reasons, enabled
276

the recovery of known reserves of natural gas that previously were not economically feasible to tap. Kinder
Morgan’s control of 80,000-plus miles of pipeline likely made moving the gas from wellheads to end users
smoother and allowed for an even greater benefit from the increased supply.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
11.1 Corporate Mergers
A corporate merger involves two private firms joining together. An acquisition refers to one firm buying another firm.
In either case, two formerly independent firms become one firm. Antitrust laws seek to ensure active competition
in markets, sometimes by preventing large firms from forming through mergers and acquisitions, sometimes by
regulating business practices that might restrict competition, and sometimes by breaking up large firms into smaller
competitors.
A four-firm concentration ratio is one way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We calculate it by
adding the market shares—that is, the percentage of total sales—of the four largest firms in the market. A Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) is another way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We calculate it by taking
the market shares of all firms in the market, squaring them, and then summing the total.
The forces of globalization and new communications and information technology have increased the level of
competition that many firms face by increasing the amount of competition from other regions and countries.

11.2 Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior
Antitrust firms block authorities from openly colluding to form a cartel that will reduce output and raise prices.
Companies sometimes attempt to find other ways around these restrictions and, consequently, many antitrust cases
involve restrictive practices that can reduce competition in certain circumstances, like tie-in sales, bundling, and
predatory pricing.
11.3 Regulating Natural Monopolies
In the case of a natural monopoly, market competition will not work well and so, rather than allowing an unregulated
monopoly to raise price and reduce output, the government may wish to regulate price and/or output. Common
examples of regulation are public utilities, the regulated firms that often provide electricity and water service.
Cost-plus regulation refers to government regulating a firm which sets the price that a firm can charge over a period
of time by looking at the firm’s accounting costs and then adding a normal rate of profit. Price cap regulation refers
to government regulation of a firm where the government sets a price level several years in advance. In this case, the
firm can either earn high profits if it manages to produce at lower costs or sell a higher quantity than expected or
suffer low profits or losses if costs are high or it sells less than expected.
11.4 The Great Deregulation Experiment
The U.S. economy experienced a wave of deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the government
eliminated a number of regulations that had set prices and quantities produced in a number of industries. Major
accounting scandals in the early 2000s and, more recently, the Great Recession have spurred new regulation to prevent
similar occurrences in the future. Regulatory capture occurs when the regulated industries end up having a strong
influence over what regulations exist.
SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS
1. Is it true that a merger between two firms that are not already in the top four by size can affect both the four-firm
concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index? Explain briefly.
2.
Is it true that the four-firm concentration ratio puts more emphasis on one or two very large firms, while the
Herfindahl-Hirshman Index puts more emphasis on all the firms in the entire market? Explain briefly.
3.
Some years ago, two intercity bus companies, Greyhound Lines, Inc. and Trailways Transportation System,
wanted to merge. One possible definition of the market in this case was “the market for intercity bus service.” Another
possible definition was “the market for intercity transportation, including personal cars, car rentals, passenger trains,
and commuter air flights.” Which definition do you think the bus companies preferred, and why?
4.
As a result of globalization and new information and communications technology, would you expect that the
definitions of markets that antitrust authorities use will become broader or narrower?

Use the following information to answer the next three questions. In the years before wireless phones, when
telephone technology required having a wire running to every home, it seemed plausible that telephone service had
diminishing average costs and might require regulation like a natural monopoly. For most of the twentieth century,
the national U.S. phone company was AT&T, and the company functioned as a regulated monopoly. Think about
the deregulation of the U.S. telecommunications industry that has occurred over the last few decades. (This is not a

Protection and Negative
Externalities
Figure 12.1 Environmental Debate Across the country, countless people have protested, even risking arrest,
against the Keystone XL Pipeline. (Credit: modification of image by “NoKXL”/Flickr Creative Commons)
Keystone XL
You might have heard about Keystone XL in the news. It is a pipeline system designed to bring oil from
Canada to the refineries near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to boost crude oil production in the United States.
While a private company, TransCanada, will own the pipeline, U.S. government approval is required because
of its size and location. There are four phases in building the pipeline, with the first two currently in operation,
bringing oil from Alberta, Canada, east across Canada, south through the United States into Nebraska and
Oklahoma, and northeast again to Illinois. The project's third and fourth phases, known as Keystone XL, would
create a pipeline southeast from Alberta straight to Nebraska, and then from Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico.
Sounds like a great idea, right? A pipeline that would move much needed crude oil to the Gulf refineries would
increase oil production for manufacturing needs, reduce price pressure at the gas pump, and increase overall
economic growth. Supporters argue that the pipeline is one of the safest pipelines built yet, and would reduce
America’s dependence on politically vulnerable Middle Eastern oil imports.
Not so fast, say its critics. The Keystone XL would be constructed over an enormous aquifer (one of the
largest in the world) in the Midwest, and through an environmentally fragile area in Nebraska, causing great
concern among environmentalists about possible destruction to the natural surroundings. They argue that
leaks could taint valuable water sources and pipeline construction could disrupt and even harm indigenous
species. Environmentalist groups have fought government approval of the proposed pipeline construction, and
as of press time the pipeline projects remain stalled.
Environmental concerns matter when discussing issues related to economic growth. However, how much
should economists factor in these issues when deciding policy? In the case of the pipeline, how do we know
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
283

how much damage it would cause when we do not know how to put a value on the environment? Would
the pipeline's benefits outweigh the opportunity cost? The issue of how to balance economic progress with
unintended effects on our planet is the subject of this chapter.

The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection
In 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it spontaneously burst into flame. Air pollution was so bad
at that time that Chattanooga, Tennessee was a city where, as an article from Sports Illustrated put it: “the death rate
from tuberculosis was double that of the rest of Tennessee and triple that of the rest of the United States, a city in
which the filth in the air was so bad it melted nylon stockings off women’s legs, in which executives kept supplies
of clean white shirts in their offices so they could change when a shirt became too gray to be presentable, in which
headlights were turned on at high noon because the sun was eclipsed by the gunk in the sky.”
The problem of pollution arises for every economy in the world, whether high-income or low-income, and whether
market-oriented or command-oriented. Every country needs to strike some balance between production and
environmental quality. This chapter begins by discussing how firms may fail to take certain social costs, like pollution,
into their planning if they do not need to pay these costs. Traditionally, policies for environmental protection have
focused on governmental limits on how much of each pollutant could be emitted. While this approach has had some
success, economists have suggested a range of more flexible, market-oriented policies that reduce pollution at a lower
cost. We will consider both approaches, but first let’s see how economists frame and analyze these issues.
12.1 | The Economics of Pollution
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain and give examples of positive and negative externalities
•
Identify equilibrium price and quantity
•
Evaluate how firms can contribute to market failure
From 1970 to 2012, the U.S. population increased by one-third and the size of the U.S. economy more than doubled.
Since the 1970s, however, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution policies, has made genuine progress
against a number of pollutants. Table 12.1 lists the change in carbon dioxide emissions by energy users (from
residential to industrial) according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The table shows that
emissions of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from 2007 to 2012. They dropped 740 million metric
tons (MMT) a year—a 12% reduction. This seems to indicate that there has been progress made in the United States
in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which cause greenhouse gases.

Despite the gradual reduction in emissions from fossil fuels, many important environmental issues remain. Along with
the still high levels of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste disposal, destruction of wetlands
and other wildlife habitats, and the impact on human health from pollution.
Externalities
Private markets, such as the cell phone industry, offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine
what goods they produce, how they produce them and who gets them. The principle that voluntary exchange benefits
both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking. However, what happens
when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer nor the seller?
As an example, consider a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor arena that will host country music concerts
a half-mile from your neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while sitting on your back
porch—or perhaps even in your dining room. In this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite
satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their market transaction. The effect of a market
exchange on a third party who is outside or “external” to the exchange is called an externality. Because externalities
that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called spillovers.
Externalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music, then having it waft into your house every night
would be a negative externality. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be
a positive externality.
Pollution as a Negative Externality
Pollution is a negative externality. Economists illustrate the social costs of production with a demand and supply
diagram. The social costs include the private costs of production that a company incurs and the external costs of
pollution that pass on to society. Figure 12.2 shows the demand and supply for manufacturing refrigerators. The
demand curve (D) shows the quantity demanded at each price. The supply curve (Sprivate) shows the quantity of
refrigerators that all firms in the industry supply at each price assuming they are taking only their private costs into
account and they are allowed to emit pollution at zero cost. The market equilibrium (E0), where quantity supplied
equals quantity demanded, is at a price of $650 per refrigerator and a quantity of 45,000 refrigerators. Table 12.2
reflects this information in the first three columns.
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
285

Figure 12.2 Taking Social Costs into Account: A Supply Shift
If the firm takes only its own costs of production
into account, then its supply curve will be Sprivate, and the market equilibrium will occur at E0. Accounting for
additional external costs of $100 for every unit produced, the firm’s supply curve will be Ssocial. The new equilibrium
will occur at E1.

Table 12.2 A Supply Shift Caused by Pollution Costs
However, as a by-product of the metals, plastics, chemicals and energy that refrigerator manufacturers use, some
pollution is created. Let’s say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they would create costs of
$100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might occur because of adverse effects on human health, property values,
or wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of other negative impacts. In a market with no
anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free. Now imagine that firms which produce
refrigerators must factor in these external costs of pollution—that is, the firms have to consider not only labor and
material costs, but also the broader costs to society of harm to health and other costs caused by pollution. If the firm
is required to pay $100 for the additional external costs of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production
becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $100.
As Table 12.2 and Figure 12.2 illustrate, the firm will need to receive a price of $700 per refrigerator and produce
286
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities

a quantity of 40,000—and the firm’s new supply curve will be Ssocial. The new equilibrium will occur at E1. In short,
taking the additional external costs of pollution into account results in a higher price, a lower quantity of production,
and a lower quantity of pollution. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through an example, this time
with musical accompaniment.

Table 12.3 Supply and Demand Conditions for a Trumpet-Playing Firm
Step 1. Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do this, you must think about the situation and
consider all parties that might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise pollution in
the area where the firm is playing.
Step 2. Identify the initial equilibrium price and quantity only taking private costs into account. Next, identify
the new equilibrium taking into account social costs as well as private costs. Remember that equilibrium is
where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.
Step 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded (the second column) is equal to the “quantity
supplied without paying the costs of the externality” (the third column). Then refer to the first column of that
row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity would be at a price of
$10 and a quantity of five when we only take into account private costs.
Step 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when we take into account the additional external costs.
Look down the columns of quantity demanded (the second column) and the “quantity supplied after paying
the costs of the externality” (the fourth column) then refer to the first column of that row to determine the
equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium will be at a price of $12 and a quantity of four.
Step 5. Consider how taking into account the externality affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Do this
by comparing the two equilibrium situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs, then
production of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply curve will shift up.
Remember that the supply curve is based on choices about production that firms make while looking at their marginal
costs, while the demand curve is based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing utility. If no
externalities existed, private costs would be the same as the costs to society as a whole, and private benefits would be
the same as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities existed, the interaction of demand and supply
will coordinate social costs and benefits.
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
287

However, when the externality of pollution exists, the supply curve no longer represents all social costs. Because
externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs, but only some of them, economists
commonly refer to externalities as an example of market failure. When there is market failure, the private market
fails to achieve efficient output, because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output
and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained (a positive externality). In the case of pollution, at the
market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to consumers, and the market produces too much of
the product.
We can see a general lesson here. If firms were required to pay the social costs of pollution, they would create
less pollution but produce less of the product and charge a higher price. In the next module, we will explore how
governments require firms to account for the social costs of pollution.
12.2 | Command-and-Control Regulation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain command-and-control regulation
•
Evaluate the effectiveness of command-and-control regulation
When the United States started passing comprehensive environmental laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a typical
law specified to companies how much pollution their smokestacks or drainpipes could emit and imposed penalties
if companies exceeded the limit. Other laws required that companies install certain equipment—for example,
on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks—to reduce pollution. These types of laws, which specify allowable
quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution-control technologies companies must use, fall under
the category of command-and-control regulation. In effect, command-and-control regulation requires that firms
increase their costs by installing anti-pollution equipment. Thus, firms are required to account for the social costs of
pollution in deciding how much output to produce.
Command-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment. In
1970, the Federal government created Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee all environmental laws. In
the same year, Congress enacted the Clean Air Act to address air pollution. Just two years later, in 1972, Congress
passed and the president signed the far-reaching Clean Water Act. These command-and-control environmental
laws, and their amendments and updates, have been largely responsible for America’s cleaner air and water in
recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three difficulties with command-and-control environmental
regulation.
First, command-and-control regulation offers no incentive to improve the quality of the environment beyond the
standard set by a particular law. Once firms meet the standard, polluters have zero incentive to do better.
Second, command-and-control regulation is inflexible. It usually requires the same standard for all polluters, and
often the same pollution-control technology as well. This means that command-and-control regulation draws no
distinctions between firms that would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard—or to reduce
pollution even further—and firms that might find it difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms have no reason to
rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce pollution even more and at lower cost.
Third, legislators and EPA analysts write the command-and-control regulations, and so they are subject to
compromises in the political process. Existing firms often argue (and lobby) that stricter environmental standards
should not apply to them, only to new firms that wish to start production. Consequently, real-world environmental
laws are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions.
Although critics accept the goal of reducing pollution, they question whether command-and-control regulation is the
best way to design policy tools for accomplishing that goal. A different approach is the use of market-oriented tools,
which we discussed in the next section.

12.3 | Market-Oriented Environmental Tools
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Show how pollution charges impact firm decisions
•
Suggest other laws and regulations that could fall under pollution charges
•
Explain the significance of marketable permits and property rights
•
Evaluate which policies are most appropriate for various situations
Market-oriented environmental policies create incentives to allow firms some flexibility in reducing pollution. The
three main categories of market-oriented approaches to pollution control are pollution charges, marketable permits,
and better-defined property rights. All of these policy tools which we discuss, below, address the shortcomings of
command-and-control regulation—albeit in different ways.
Pollution Charges
A pollution charge is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits. A pollution charge gives a profit-
maximizing firm an incentive to determine ways to reduce its emissions—as long as the marginal cost of reducing the
emissions is less than the tax.
For example, consider a small firm that emits 50 pounds per year of small particles, such as soot, into the air. This
particulate matter causes respiratory illnesses and also imposes costs on firms and individuals.
Figure 12.3 illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution. The marginal cost of pollution
reduction, like most most marginal cost curves increases with output, at least in the short run. Reducing the first 10
pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $300. Reducing the second 10 pounds would cost $500; reducing the
third ten pounds would cost $900; reducing the fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500; and the fifth 10 pounds would
cost $2,500. This pattern for the costs of reducing pollution is common, because the firm can use the cheapest and
easiest method to make initial reductions in pollution, but additional reductions in pollution become more expensive.
Figure 12.3 A Pollution Charge If a pollution charge is set equal to $1,000, then the firm will have an incentive to
reduce pollution by 30 pounds because the $900 cost of these reductions would be less than the cost of paying the
pollution charge.
Imagine the firm now faces a pollution tax of $1,000 for every 10 pounds of particulates it emits. The firm has the
choice of either polluting and paying the tax, or reducing the amount of particulates it emits and paying the cost of
abatement as the figure shows. How much will the firm pollute and how much will the firm abate? The first 10 pounds
would cost the firm $300 to abate. This is substantially less than the $1,000 tax, so the firm will choose to abate. The
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
289

second 10 pounds would cost $500 to abate, which is still less than the tax, so it will choose to abate. The third 10
pounds would cost $900 to abate, which is slightly less than the $1,000 tax. The fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500,
which is much more costly than paying the tax. As a result, the firm will decide to reduce pollutants by 30 pounds,
because the marginal cost of reducing pollution by this amount is less than the pollution tax. With a tax of $1,000, the
firm has no incentive to reduce pollution more than 30 pounds.
A firm that has to pay a pollution tax will have an incentive to figure out the least expensive technologies for reducing
pollution. Firms that can reduce pollution cheaply and easily will do so to minimize their pollution taxes; whereas
firms that will incur high costs for reducing pollution will end up paying the pollution tax instead. If the pollution tax
applies to every source of pollution, then there are no special favoritism or loopholes for politically well-connected
producers.
For an example of a pollution charge at the household level, consider two ways of charging for garbage collection.
One method is to have a flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces. An alternative
approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on how much garbage the household produces—and to offer
lower or free charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006 (latest statistics available), the EPA had recorded over 7,000
communities that have implemented “pay as you throw” programs. When people have a financial incentive to put out
less garbage and to increase recycling, they find ways to make it happen.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/payasyouthrow) to learn more about pay-as-you-throw
programs, including viewing a map and a table that shows the number of communities using this program in
each state.
A number of environmental policies are really pollution charges, although they often do not travel under that name.
For example, the federal government and many state governments impose taxes on gasoline. We can view this tax as
a charge on the air pollution that cars generate as well as a source of funding for maintaining roads. Gasoline taxes
are far higher in most other countries than in the United States.
Similarly, the refundable charge of five or 10 cents that only 10 states have for returning recyclable cans and bottles
works like a pollution tax that provides an incentive to avoid littering or throwing bottles in the trash. Compared with
command-and-control regulation, a pollution tax reduces pollution in a more flexible and cost-effective way.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bottlebill) to see the current U.S. states with bottle bills and the
states that have active campaigns for new bottle bills. You can also view current and proposed bills in Canada
and other countries around the world.

Marketable Permits
When a city or state government sets up a marketable permit program (e.g. cap-and-trade), it must start by
determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards. Then, it
divides a number of permits allowing only this quantity of pollution among the firms that emit that pollutant. The
government can sell or provide these permits to pollute free to firms.
Now, add two more conditions. Imagine that these permits are designed to reduce total emissions over time. For
example, a permit may allow emission of 10 units of pollution one year, but only nine units the next year, then eight
units the year after that, and so on down to some lower level. In addition, imagine that these are marketable permits,
meaning that firms can buy and sell them.
To see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the four firms in Table 12.4. The table shows
current emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit program, each firm receives permits to
allow this level of pollution. However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the permits allow the firms to emit
only half as much pollution. Let’s say that in a year, Firm Gamma finds it easy and cheap to reduce emissions from
600 tons of lead to 200 tons, which means that it has permits that it is not using that allow emitting 100 tons of lead.
Firm Beta reduces its lead pollution from 400 tons to 200 tons, so it does not need to buy any permits, and it does not
have any extra permits to sell. However, although Firm Alpha can easily reduce pollution from 200 tons to 150 tons,
it finds that it is cheaper to purchase permits from Gamma rather than to reduce its own emissions to 100. Meanwhile,
Firm Delta did not even exist in the first period, so the only way it can start production is to purchase permits to emit
50 tons of lead.
The total quantity of pollution will decline. However, buying and selling the marketable permits will determine
exactly which firms reduce pollution and by how much. With a system of marketable permits, the firms that find it
least expensive to do so will reduce pollution the most.

Table 12.4 How Marketable Permits Work
Another application of marketable permits occurred when the U.S. government amended the Clean Air Act in 1990.
The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels
out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this case, the
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
291

marketable permits the federal government issued were free of charge (no pun intended) to electricity-generating
plants across the country, especially those that were burning coal (which produces sulfur dioxide). These permits were
of the “shrinkable” type; that is, the amount of pollution allowed by a given permit declined with time.
Better-Defined Property Rights
A clarified and strengthened idea of property rights can also strike a balance between economic activity and pollution.
Ronald Coase (1910–2013), who won the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics, offered a vivid illustration of an externality:
a railroad track running beside a farmer’s field where the railroad locomotive sometimes emits sparks and sets the
field ablaze. Coase asked whose responsibility it was to address this spillover. Should the farmer be required to
build a tall fence alongside the field to block the sparks, or should the railroad be required to place a gadget on the
locomotive’s smokestack to reduce the number of sparks?
Coase pointed out that one cannot resolve this issue until one clearly defines property rights—that is, the legal
rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation. Does the farmer have
a property right not to have a field burned? Does the railroad have a property right to run its own trains on its own
tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may squabble endlessly, doing nothing, and sparks will
continue to set the field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a well-defined legal responsibility,
then that party will seek out and pay for the least costly method of reducing the risk that sparks will hit the field. The
property right determines whether the farmer or the railroad pays the bills.
The property rights approach is highly relevant in cases involving endangered species. The U.S. government’s
endangered species list includes about 1,000 plants and animals, and about 90% of these species live on privately
owned land. The protection of these endangered species requires careful thinking about incentives and property
rights. The discovery of an endangered species on private land has often triggered an automatic reaction from
the government to prohibit the landowner from using that land for any purpose that might disturb the imperiled
creatures. Consider the incentives of that policy: If you admit to the government that you have an endangered species,
the government effectively prohibits you from using your land. As a result, rumors abounded of landowners who
followed a policy of “shoot, shovel, and shut up” when they found an endangered animal on their land. Other
landowners have deliberately cut trees or managed land in a way that they knew would discourage endangered
animals from locating there.
How effective are market-oriented environmental policy tools?
Environmentalists sometimes fear that market-oriented environmental tools are an excuse to weaken or
eliminate strict limits on pollution emissions and instead to allow more pollution. It is true that if pollution
charges are set very low or if marketable permits do not reduce pollution by very much then market-
oriented tools will not work well. However, command-and-control environmental laws can also be full of
loopholes or have exemptions that do not reduce pollution by much, either. The advantage of market-oriented
environmental tools is not that they reduce pollution by more or less, but because of their incentives and
flexibility, they can achieve any desired reduction in pollution at a lower cost to society.
A more productive policy would consider how to provide private landowners with an incentive to protect the
endangered species that they find and to provide a habitat for additional endangered species. For example, the
government might pay landowners who provide and maintain suitable habitats for endangered species or who restrict
the use of their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law built on incentives and flexibility
offers greater promise than a command-and-control approach when trying to oversee millions of acres of privately
owned land.
Applying Market-Oriented Environmental Tools
Market-oriented environmental policies are a tool kit. Specific policy tools will work better in some situations than in
others. For example, marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties are highly interested
in trading, as in the cases of oil refineries that trade lead permits or electrical utilities that trade sulfur dioxide
292

permits. However, for cases in which millions of users emit small amounts of pollution—such as emissions from
car engines or unrecycled soda cans—and have no strong interest in trading, pollution charges will typically offer a
better choice. We can also combine market-oriented environmental tools. We can view marketable permits as a form
of improved property rights. Alternatively, the government could combine marketable permits with a pollution tax on
any emissions not covered by a permit.
12.4 | The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Evaluate the benefits and costs of environmental protection
•
Explain the effects of ecotourism
•
Apply marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and marginal benefits of reducing pollution
Government economists have estimated that U.S. firms may pay more than $200 billion per year to comply with
federal environmental laws. That is a sizable amount of money. Is the money well spent?
Benefits and Costs of Clean Air and Clean Water
We can divide the benefits of a cleaner environment into four areas: (1) people may stay healthier and live longer;
(2) certain industries that rely on clean air and water, such as farming, fishing, and tourism, may benefit; (3) property
values may be higher; and (4) people may simply enjoy a cleaner environment in a way that does not need to involve
a market transaction. Some of these benefits, such as gains to tourism or farming, are relatively easy to value in
economic terms. It is harder to assign a monetary value to others, such as the value of clean air for someone with
asthma. It seems impossible to put a clear-cut monetary value on still others, such as the satisfaction you might feel
from knowing that the air is clear over the Grand Canyon, even if you have never visited the Grand Canyon.
Although estimates of environmental benefits are not precise, they can still be revealing. For example, a study by the
Environmental Protection Agency looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990. It found
that total costs over that time period were roughly $500 billion—a huge amount. However, it also found that a middle-
range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $22 trillion—about 44 times higher than the costs.
A more recent EPA study estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the Clean Air Act will exceed
their costs by a margin of four to one. The EPA estimated that “in 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will
total about $110 billion. This estimate represents the value of avoiding increases in illness and premature death which
would have prevailed.” Saying that overall benefits of environmental regulation have exceeded costs in the past,
however, is very different from saying that every environmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies suggest
that when breaking down emission reductions by type of contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh
the costs primarily for particulates and lead, but when looking at other air pollutants, the costs of reducing them may
be comparable to or greater than the benefits. Just because some environmental regulations have had benefits much
higher than costs does not prove that every individual regulation is a sensible idea.
Ecotourism: Making Environmentalism Pay
The definition of ecotourism is a little vague. Does it mean sleeping on the ground, eating roots, and getting close
to wild animals? Does it mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African wildlife, or a little of both?
The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination—“eco tourists”—are
the impetus to a big and growing business. The International Ecotourism Society estimates that international tourists
interested in seeing nature or wildlife will take 1.56 billion trips by 2020.
Visit The International Ecotourism Society’s website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ecotourism) to learn more
about The International Ecotourism Society, its programs, and tourism’s role in sustainable community
development.
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
293

Realizing the attraction of ecotourism, the residents of low-income countries may come to see that preserving wildlife
habitats is more lucrative than, say, cutting down forests or grazing livestock to survive. In South Africa, Namibia,
and Zimbabwe, for example, a substantial expansion of both rhinoceros and elephant populations is broadly credited
to ecotourism, which has given local communities an economic interest in protecting them. Some of the leading
ecotourism destinations include: Costa Rica and Panama in Central America; the Caribbean; Malaysia, and other
South Pacific destinations; New Zealand; the Serengeti in Tanzania; the Amazon rain forests; and the Galapagos
Islands. In many of these countries and regions, governments have enacted policies whereby they share revenues from
ecotourism with local communities, to give people in those local communities a kind of property right that encourages
them to conserve their local environment.
Ecotourism needs careful management, so that the combination of eager tourists and local entrepreneurs does
not destroy what the visitors are coming to see. However, whatever one’s qualms are about certain kinds of
ecotourism—such as the occasional practice of rich tourists shooting elderly lions with high-powered rifles—it is
worth remembering that the alternative is often that low-income people in poor countries will damage their local
environment in their effort to survive.
Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs
We can use the tools of marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and the marginal benefits of reducing
pollution. Figure 12.4 illustrates a theoretical model of this situation. When the quantity of environmental protection
is low so that pollution is extensive—for example, at quantity Qa—there are usually numerous relatively cheap
and easy ways to reduce pollution, and the marginal benefits of doing so are quite high. At Qa, it makes sense to
allocate more resources to fight pollution. However, as the extent of environmental protection increases, the cheap
and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease, and one must use more costly methods. The marginal cost
curve rises. Also, as environmental protection increases, one achieves the largest marginal benefits first, followed
by reduced marginal benefits. As the quantity of environmental protection increases to, say, Qb, the gap between
marginal benefits and marginal costs narrows. At point Qc the marginal costs will exceed the marginal benefits. At
this level of environmental protection, society is not allocating resources efficiently, because it is forfeiting too many
resources to reduce pollution.
294

Figure 12.4 Marginal Costs and Marginal Benefits of Environmental Protection
Reducing pollution is
costly—one must sacrifice resources. The marginal costs of reducing pollution are generally increasing, because one
can make the least expensive and easiest reductions, leaving the more expensive methods for later. The marginal
benefits of reducing pollution are generally declining, because one can take the steps that provide the greatest
benefit first, and steps that provide less benefit can wait until later.
As society draws closer to Qb, some might argue that it becomes more important to use market-oriented
environmental tools to hold down the costs of reducing pollution. Their objective would be to avoid environmental
rules that would provide the quantity of environmental protection at Qc, where marginal costs exceed marginal
benefits. The following Clear It Up feature delves into how the EPA measures its policies – and the monetary value
of our lives.
What's a life worth?
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must estimate the value of saving lives by reducing pollution
against the additional costs. In measuring the benefits of government environmental policies, the EPA’s
National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) values a statistical human life at $7.4 million (in 2006
U.S. dollars).
Economists value a human life on the basis of studies of the value that people actually place on human lives
in their own decisions. For example, some jobs have a higher probability of death than others, and these jobs
typically pay more to compensate for the risk. Examples are ocean fishery as opposed to fish farming, and ice
trucking in Alaska as opposed to truck driving in the “lower forty-eight” states.
Government regulators use estimates such as these when deciding what proposed regulations are
“reasonable,” which means deciding which proposals have high enough benefits to justify their cost. For
example, when the U.S. Department of Transportation makes decisions about what safety systems should be
required in cars or airplanes, it will approve rules only where the estimated cost per life saved is $3 million or
less.
Resources that we spend on life-saving regulations create tradeoff. A study by W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt
University estimated that when a regulation costs $50 million, it diverts enough spending in the rest of the
economy from health care and safety expenditures that it costs a life. This finding suggests that any regulation
that costs more than $50 million per life saved actually costs lives, rather than saving them.

12.5 | International Environmental Issues
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain biodiversity
•
Analyze the partnership of high-income and low-income countries in efforts to address international
externalities
Many countries around the world have become more aware of the benefits of environmental protection. Yet even if
most nations individually took steps to address their environmental issues, no nation acting alone can solve certain
environmental problems which spill over national borders. No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide
and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming—not without the cooperation of other nations.
Another issue is the challenge of preserving biodiversity, which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant
genetic material. Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders, no nation acting alone can protect
biodiversity around the world. Global warming and biodiversity are examples of international externalities.
Bringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations
between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities. If nations such as China, India, Brazil,
Mexico, and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest
and wildlife habitats, then the world’s high-income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases.
However, low-income countries, with some understandable exasperation, point out that high-income countries do not
have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic
growth. After all, high-income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by
burning fossil fuels—and still are today. It is hard to tell people who are living in a low-income country, where
adequate diet, health care, and education are lacking, that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a
cleaner environment.
Can rich and poor countries come together to address global environmental spillovers? At the initiative of the
European Union and the most vulnerable developing nations, the Durban climate conference in December 2011
launched negotiations to develop a new international climate change agreement that covers all countries. The outcome
of these negotiations was the Paris Climate Agreement, passed in 2016. The Paris Agreement committed participating
countries to significant limits on CO2 emissions. To date, 129 nations have signed on, including the two biggest
emitters of greenhouse gases—China and the United States. The U.S. contribution to the agreement was the Clean
Power Plan, which planned to reduce power plant CO2 emissions across the U.S. by 17% to pre-2005 levels by 2020,
and to further reduce emissions by a cumulative 32% by 2030. In early 2017, the Trump Administration announced
plans to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump opposes the Clean Power plan, opting instead to shift focus
to the use of natural gas. This represents a significant blow to the success of the Paris Agreement.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/EC) to learn more about the European Commission.
If high-income countries want low-income countries to reduce their greenhouse emission gases, then the high-income
countries may need to pay some of the costs. Perhaps some of these payments will happen through private markets.
For example, some tourists from rich countries will pay handsomely to vacation near the natural treasures of low-
296

income countries. Perhaps some of the transfer of resources can happen through making modern pollution-control
technology available to poorer countries.
The practical details of what such an international system might look like and how it would operate across
international borders are forbiddingly complex. However, it seems highly unlikely that some form of world
government will impose a detailed system of environmental command-and-control regulation around the world. As
a result, a decentralized and market-oriented approach may be the only practical way to address international issues
such as global warming and biodiversity.
12.6 | The Tradeoff between Economic Output and
Environmental Protection
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Apply the production possibility frontier to evaluate the tradeoff between economic output and the
environment
•
Interpret a graphic representation of the tradeoff between economic output and environmental
protection
We can analyze the tradeoff between economic output and the environment with a production possibility frontier
(PPF) such as the one in Figure 12.5. At one extreme, at a choice like P, a country would be selecting a high level of
economic output but very little environmental protection. At the other extreme, at a choice like T, a country would be
selecting a high level of environmental protection but little economic output. According to the graph, an increase in
environmental protection involves an opportunity cost of less economic output. No matter what their preferences, all
societies should wish to avoid choices like M, which are productively inefficient. Efficiency requires that the choice
should be on the production possibility frontier.
Figure 12.5 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection
Each society will have to
weigh its own values and decide whether it prefers a choice like P with more economic output and less environmental
protection, or a choice like T with more environmental protection and less economic output.
Economists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P, Q, R, S and T in Figure 12.5, all of which lie
along the production possibility frontier. Countries with low per capita gross domestic product (GDP), such as China,
place a greater emphasis on economic output—which in turn helps to produce nutrition, shelter, health, education,
and desirable consumer goods. Countries with higher income levels, where a greater share of people have access to
the basic necessities of life, may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection.
However, economists are united in their belief that an inefficient choice such as M is undesirable. Rather than
choosing M, a nation could achieve either greater economic output with the same environmental protection, as at
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
297

point Q, or greater environmental protection with the same level of output, as at point S. The problem with command-
and-control environmental laws is that they sometimes involve a choice like M. Market-oriented environmental tools
offer a mechanism for providing either the same environmental protection at lower cost, or providing a greater degree
of environmental protection for the same cost.
Keystone XL
How would an economist respond to claims of environmental damage caused by the Keystone XL project?
Clearly, we can consider the environmental cost of oil spills a negative externality, but how large would these
external costs be? Furthermore, are these costs “too high” when we measure them against any potential for
economic benefit?
As this chapter indicates, in deciding whether pipeline construction is a good idea, an economist would want
to know not only about the marginal benefits resulting from the additional pipeline construction, but also
the potential marginal costs—and especially the pipeline's marginal external costs. Typically these come in
the form of environmental impact statements, which are usually required for such projects. The most recent
impact statement, released in March 2013 by the Nebraska Department of State, considered the possibility of
fewer pipeline miles going over the aquifer system and avoiding completely environmentally fragile areas. It
indicated that pipeline construction would not harm "most resources".
The Obama Administration declined to approve construction of the Keystone XL project. However, the Trump
administration has already announced its willingness to do so. While we may fairly easily quantify the
economic benefits of additional oil in the United States, the social costs are more challenging to measure. It
seems that, in a period of less than robust economic growth, people are giving the benefit of the doubt that
the marginal costs of additional oil generation will be less than the marginal benefits.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
12.1 The Economics of Pollution
Economic production can cause environmental damage. This tradeoff arises for all countries, whether high-income or
low-income, and whether their economies are market-oriented or command-oriented.
An externality occurs when an exchange between a buyer and seller has an impact on a third party who is not part
of the exchange. An externality, which is sometimes also called a spillover, can have a negative or a positive impact
on the third party. If those parties imposing a negative externality on others had to account for the broader social
cost of their behavior, they would have an incentive to reduce the production of whatever is causing the negative
externality. In the case of a positive externality, the third party obtains benefits from the exchange between a buyer
and a seller, but they are not paying for these benefits. If this is the case, then markets would tend to under produce
output because suppliers are not aware of the additional demand from others. If the parties generating benefits to
others would somehow receive compensation for these external benefits, they would have an incentive to increase
production of whatever is causing the positive externality.
12.2 Command-and-Control Regulation
Command-and-control regulation sets specific limits for pollution emissions and/or specific pollution-control
technologies that firms must use. Although such regulations have helped to protect the environment, they have three
shortcomings: they provide no incentive for going beyond the limits they set; they offer limited flexibility on where
and how to reduce pollution; and they often have politically-motivated loopholes.
Chapter 12 | Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities
299

12.3 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools
Examples of market-oriented environmental policies, also called cap and trade programs, include pollution charges,
marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. Market-oriented environmental policies include taxes,
markets, and property rights so that those who impose negative externalities must face the social cost.
12.4 The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws
We can make a strong case, taken as a whole, that the benefits of U.S. environmental regulation have outweighed
the costs. As the extent of environment regulation increases, additional expenditures on environmental protection will
probably have increasing marginal costs and decreasing marginal benefits. This pattern suggests that the flexibility
and cost savings of market-oriented environmental policies will become more important.
12.5 International Environmental Issues
Certain global environmental issues, such as global warming and biodiversity, spill over national borders and require
addressing with some form of international agreement.
12.6 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection
Depending on their different income levels and political preferences, countries are likely to make different choices
about allocative efficiency—that is, the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the
production possibility frontier. However, all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows productive
efficiency—that is, the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it. Revisit
Choice in a World of Scarcity for more on these terms.

and Public Goods
Figure 13.1 View from Voyager I Launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, Voyager 1’s primary mission was to
provide detailed images of Jupiter, Saturn, and their moons. It took this photograph of Jupiter on its journey. In August
of 2012, Voyager I entered interstellar space—the first human-made object to do so—and it is expected to send data
and images back to earth until 2025. Such a technological feat entails many economic principles. (Credit: modification
of work by NASA/JPL)
The Benefits of Voyager I Endure
The rapid growth of technology has increased our ability to access and process data, to navigate through a
busy city, and to communicate with friends on the other side of the globe. The research and development
efforts of citizens, scientists, firms, universities, and governments have truly revolutionized the modern
economy. To get a sense of how far we have come in a short period of time, let’s compare one of humankind’s
greatest achievements to the smartphone most of us have in our coat pocket.
In 1977 the United States launched Voyager I, a spacecraft originally intended to reach Jupiter and Saturn,
to send back photographs and other cosmic measurements. Voyager I, however, kept going, and going—past
Jupiter and Saturn—right out of our solar system. At the time of its launch, Voyager had some of the most
sophisticated computing processing power NASA could engineer (8,000 instructions per second), but today,
we Earthlings use handheld devices that can process 14 billion instructions per second.
Still, the technology of today is a spillover product of the incredible feats NASA accomplished forty years
ago. NASA research, for instance, is responsible for the kidney dialysis and mammogram machines that we
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
309

use today. Research in new technologies not only produces private benefits to the investing firm, or in this
case to NASA, but it also creates benefits for the broader society. In this way, new knowledge often becomes
what economists refer to as a public good. This leads us to the topic of this chapter—technology, positive
externalities, public goods, and the role of government in encouraging innovation and the social benefits that
it provides.
Introduction to Positive Externalities and Public Goods
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Why the Private Sector Underinvests in Technologies
•
How Governments Can Encourage Innovation
•
Public Goods
Can you imagine a world in which you did not own a cellular phone or use Wikipedia? New technology changes how
people live and work and what they buy. Technology includes the invention of new products, new ways of producing
goods and services, and even new ways of managing a company more efficiently. Research and development of
technology is the difference between horses and automobiles, between candles and electric lights, between fetching
water in buckets and indoor plumbing, and between infection and good health from antibiotics.
In December 2009, ABC News compiled a list of some of the technological breakthroughs that have revolutionized
consumer products in the past 10 years:
•
GPS tracking devices, originally developed by the defense department and available to consumers in 2000,
give users up-to-date information on location and time through satellite technology.
•
In 2000, Toyota introduced the Prius hybrid car, which greatly improved fuel efficiency.
•
Also in 2000, AT&T offered its customers the ability to text on a mobile phone.
•
In 2001, Wikipedia launched a user-generated encyclopedia on the Web.
•
Even though Napster died in 2001, the company launched music downloading and file sharing, which
revolutionized how consumers obtain their music and videos.
•
Friendster kicked off the social networking business in 2003, and Twitter and Facebook followed.
•
In 2003, international scientists completed the Human Genome project. It helps to fight disease and launch
new pharmaceutical innovations.
•
Also in 2003, the search engine became a way of life for obtaining information quickly. The search engine
companies also became innovators in the digital software that dominates mobile devices.
•
In 2006, Nintendo launched Wii and changed the way we play video games. Players can now be drawn into
the action and use their bodies to respond rather than a handheld device.
•
Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 and launched an entire smartphone industry. In 2015, cell phones now
recognize human voices via artificial intelligence.
With all new technologies, however, there are new challenges. This chapter deals with some of these issues: Will
private companies be willing to invest in new technology? In what ways does new technology have positive
externalities? What motivates inventors? Does government have a role to play in encouraging research and
technology? Are there certain types of goods that markets fail to provide efficiently, and that only government
can produce? What happens when consumption or production of a product creates positive externalities? Why is it
unsurprising when we overuse a common resource, like marine fisheries?

13.1 | Why the Private Sector Underinvests in Innovation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the positive externalities of new technology.
•
Explain the difference between private benefits and social benefits and give examples of each.
•
Calculate and analyze rates of return
Market competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a firm can earn higher profits
by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want. As
Gregory Lee, CEO of Samsung said, “Relentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and
enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology.” An innovative firm knows that it will usually
have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above-normal profits before competitors can
catch up.
In certain cases, however, competition can discourage new technology, especially when other firms can quickly copy
a new idea. Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug. On average, it can cost $800 million
and take more than a decade to discover a new drug, perform the necessary safety tests, and bring the drug to market.
If the research and development (R&D) effort fails—and every R&D project has some chance of failure—then the
firm will suffer losses and could even be driven out of business. If the project succeeds, then the firm’s competitors
may figure out ways of adapting and copying the underlying idea, but without having to pay the costs themselves.
As a result, the innovative company will bear the much higher costs of the R&D and will enjoy at best only a small,
temporary advantage over the competition.
Many inventors over the years have discovered that their inventions brought them less profit than they might have
reasonably expected.
•
Eli Whitney (1765–1825) invented the cotton gin, but then southern cotton planters built their own seed-
separating devices with a few minor changes in Whitney’s design. When Whitney sued, he found that the
courts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights.
•
Thomas Edison (1847–1931) still holds the record for most patents granted to an individual. His first invention
was an automatic vote counter, and despite the social benefits, he could not find a government that wanted to
buy it.
•
Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put off applying for a patent and, by the
time he did apply, other scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle resulted, in which
Gould spent $100,000 on lawyers, before he eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977. Compared to
the enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively little financial reward.
•
In 1936, Alan Turing delivered a paper titled, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the “Universal
Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable of computing anything that is computable. The
central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing’s paper. Today scholars widely consider
Turing as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence; however, the UK government
prosecuted Turing in 1952 for homosexual acts and gave him the choice of chemical castration or prison.
Turing chose castration and died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning.
A variety of studies by economists have found that the original inventor receives one-third to one-half of the total
economic benefits from innovations, while other businesses and new product users receive the rest.
The Positive Externalities of New Technology
Will private firms in a market economy underinvest in research and technology? If a firm builds a factory or buys
a piece of equipment, the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments. However, when
a firm invests in new technology, the private benefits, or profits, that the firm receives are only a portion of the
overall social benefits. The social benefits of an innovation account for the value of all the positive externalities of
the new idea or product, whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole, as well as the private benefits the
firm that developed the new technology receives. As you learned in Environmental Protection and Negative
Externalities, positive externalities are beneficial spillovers to a third party, or parties.
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
311

Consider the example of the Big Drug Company, which is planning its R&D budget for the next year. Economists and
scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated
rates of return. (The rate of return is the estimated payoff from the project.) Figure 13.2 shows how the calculations
work. The downward-sloping DPrivate curve represents the firm’s demand for financial capital and reflects the
company’s willingness to borrow to finance research and development projects at various interest rates. Suppose that
this firm’s investment in research and development creates a spillover benefit to other firms and households. After all,
new innovations often spark other creative endeavors that society also values. If we add the spillover benefits society
enjoys to the firm’s private demand for financial capital, we can draw DSocial that lies above DPrivate.
If there were a way for the firm to fully monopolize those social benefits by somehow making them unavailable to the
rest of us, the firm’s private demand curve would be the same as society’s demand curve. According to Figure 13.2
and Table 13.1, if the going rate of interest on borrowing is 8%, and the company can receive the private benefits of
innovation only, then the company would finance $30 million. Society, at the same rate of 8%, would find it optimal
to have $52 million of borrowing. Unless there is a way for the company to fully enjoy the total benefits, then it will
borrow less than the socially optimal level of $52 million.
Figure 13.2 Positive Externalities and Technology Big Drug faces a cost of borrowing of 8%. If the firm receives
only the private benefits of investing in R&D, then we show its demand curve for financial capital by DPrivate, and the
equilibrium will occur at $30 million. Because there are spillover benefits, society would find it optimal to have $52
million of investment. If the firm could keep the social benefits of its investment for itself, its demand curve for
financial capital would be DSocial and it would be willing to borrow $52 million.

Table 13.1 Return and Demand for Capital
Big Drug’s original demand for financial capital (DPrivate) is based on the profits received the firm receives. However,
other pharmaceutical firms and health care companies may learn new lessons about how to treat certain medical
conditions and are then able to create their own competing products. The social benefit of the drug takes into account
the value of all the drug's positive externalities. If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other
companies, its demand for financial capital would shift to the demand curve DSocial, and it would be willing to borrow
and invest $52 million. However, if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits, the firm
will not spend as much on creating new products. The amount it would be willing to spend would fall somewhere in
between DPrivate and DSocial.

Why Invest in Human Capital?
The investment in anything, whether it is the construction of a new power plant or research in a new cancer treatment,
usually requires a certain upfront cost with an uncertain future benefit. The investment in education, or human capital,
is no different. Over the span of many years, a student and her family invest significant amounts of time and money
into that student’s education. The idea is that higher levels of educational attainment will eventually serve to increase
the student’s future productivity and subsequent ability to earn. Once the student crunches the numbers, does this
investment pay off for her?
Almost universally, economists have found that the answer to this question is a clear “Yes.” For example, several
studies of the return to education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a college education is
approximately 10-15%. Data in Table 13.2, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Usual Weekly Earnings of
Wage and Salary Workers, Third Quarter 2014, demonstrate that median weekly earnings are higher for workers who
have completed more education. While these rates of return will beat equivalent investments in Treasury bonds or
savings accounts, the estimated returns to education go primarily to the individual worker, so these returns are private
rates of return to education.

What does society gain from investing in the education of another student? After all, if the government is spending
taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education, society should expect some kind of return on that spending.
Economists like George Psacharopoulos have found that, across a variety of nations, the social rate of return on
schooling is also positive. After all, positive externalities exist from investment in education. While not always easy
to measure, according to Walter McMahon, the positive externalities to education typically include better health
outcomes for the population, lower levels of crime, a cleaner environment and a more stable, democratic government.
For these reasons, many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary, secondary, and higher
education. Education clearly benefits the person who receives it, but a society where most people have a good level
of education provides positive externalities for all.
Other Examples of Positive Externalities
Although technology may be the most prominent example of a positive externality, it is not the only one. For example,
vaccinations against disease are not only a protection for the individual, but they have the positive spillover of
protecting others who may become infected. When a number of homes in a neighborhood are modernized, updated,
and restored, not only does it increase the homes' value, but other property values in the neighborhood may increase
as well.
The appropriate public policy response to a positive externality, like a new technology, is to help the party creating
the positive externality receive a greater share of the social benefits. In the case of vaccines, like flu shots, an effective
policy might be to provide a subsidy to those who choose to get vaccinated.
Figure 13.3 shows the market for flu shots. The market demand curve DMarket for flu shots reflects only the marginal
private benefits (MPB) that the vaccinated individuals receive from the shots. Assuming that there are no spillover
costs in the production of flu shots, the market supply curve is given by the marginal private cost (MPC) of producing
the vaccinations.
The equilibrium quantity of flu shots produced in the market, where MPB is equal to MPC, is QMarket and the price of
flu shots is PMarket. However, spillover benefits exist in this market because others, those who chose not to purchase a
flu shot, receive a positive externality in a reduced chance of contracting the flu. When we add the spillover benefits
to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the marginal social benefit (MSB) of flu shots is given by DSocial. Because
the MSB is greater than MPB, we see that the socially optimal level of flu shots is greater than the market quantity
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
313

(QSocial exceeds QMarket) and the corresponding price of flu shots, if the market were to produce QSocial, would be at
PSocial. Unfortunately, the marketplace does not recognize the positive externality and flu shots will go under produced
and under consumed.
How can government try to move the market level of output closer to the socially desirable level of output? One
policy would be to provide a subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated. This voucher would
act as “income” that one could use purchase only a flu shot and, if the voucher were exactly equal to the per-unit
spillover benefits, would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of QSocial and a price of PSocial where MSB equals
MSC. Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of PSocial per vaccination, while consumers of flu shots would
redeem the voucher and only pay a price of PSubsidy. When the government uses a subsidy in this way, it produces the
socially optimal quantity of vaccinations.
Figure 13.3 The Market for Flu Shots with Spillover Benefits (A Positive Externality) The market demand curve
does not reflect the positive externality of flu vaccinations, so only QMarket will be exchanged. This outcome is
inefficient because the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. If the government provides a subsidy
to consumers of flu shots, equal to the marginal social benefit minus the marginal private benefit, the level of
vaccinations can increase to the socially optimal quantity of QSocial.
13.2 | How Governments Can Encourage Innovation
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the effects of intellectual property rights on social and private rates of return.
•
Identify three U.S. Government policies and explain how they encourage innovation
A number of different government policies can increase the incentives to innovate, including: guaranteeing
intellectual property rights, government assistance with the costs of research and development, and cooperative
research ventures between universities and companies.
Intellectual Property Rights
One way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or process.
Intellectual property rights include patents, which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make, use, or sell
the invention for a limited time, and copyright laws, which give the author an exclusive legal right over works of
literature, music, film/video, and pictures. For example, if a pharmaceutical firm has a patent on a new drug, then no
other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for 21 years, unless the firm with the patent grants permission. Without a
patent, the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products, and could earn no more
than a normal rate of profit. With a patent, a firm is able to earn monopoly profits on its product for a period of
time—which offers an incentive for research and development. In general, how long can “a period of time” be? The
314
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods

Clear It Up discusses patent and copyright protection timeframes for some works you might know.
How long is Mickey Mouse protected from being copied?
All patents and copyrights are scheduled to end someday. In 2003, copyright protection for Mickey Mouse
was scheduled to run out. Once the copyright had expired, anyone would be able to copy Mickey Mouse
cartoons or draw and sell new ones. In 1998, however, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term
Extension Act. For copyrights owned by companies or other entities, it increased or extended the copyright
from 75 years to 95 years after publication. For copyrights owned by individuals, it increased or extended the
copyright coverage from 50 years to 70 years after death. Along with protecting Mickey for another 20 years,
the copyright extension affected about 400,000 books, movies, and songs.
Figure 13.4 illustrates how the total number of patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
as well as the total number of patents granted, surged in the mid-1990s with the invention of the internet, and is still
going strong today.
Figure 13.4 Patents Filed and Granted, 1981–2012 The number of applications filed for patents increased
substantially beginning in the 1990s, due in part to the invention of the internet, which has led to many other
inventions and to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act. (Source: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/
us_stat.htm)
While patents provide an incentive to innovate by protecting the innovator, they are not perfect. For example:
•
In countries that already have patents, economic studies show that inventors receive only one-third to one-half
of the total economic value of their inventions.
•
In a fast-moving high-technology industry like biotechnology or semiconductor design, patents may be almost
irrelevant because technology is advancing so quickly.
•
Not every new idea can be protected with a patent or a copyright—for example, a new way of organizing a
factory or a new way of training employees.
•
Patents may sometimes cover too much or be granted too easily. In the early 1970s, Xerox had received over
1,700 patents on various elements of the photocopy machine. Every time Xerox improved the photocopier, it
received a patent on the improvement.
•
The 21-year time period for a patent is somewhat arbitrary. Ideally, a patent should cover a long enough period
of time for the inventor to earn a good return, but not so long that it allows the inventor to charge a monopoly
price permanently.
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
315

Because patents are imperfect and do not apply well to all situations, alternative methods of improving the rate
of return for inventors of new technology are desirable. The following sections describe some of these possible
alternative policies.
Policy #1: Government Spending on Research and Development
If the private sector does not have sufficient incentive to carry out research and development, one possibility is for
the government to fund such work directly. Government spending can provide direct financial support for research
and development (R&D) conducted at colleges and universities, nonprofit research entities, and sometimes by private
firms, as well as at government-run laboratories. While government spending on research and development produces
technology that is broadly available for firms to use, it costs taxpayers money and can sometimes be directed more
for political than for scientific or economic reasons.

column shows the total dollars of R&D funding by each source. The third column shows that, relative to the total
amount of funding, 22.7% comes from the federal government, about 69% of R&D is done by industry, and less than
4% is done by universities and colleges. (The percentages below do not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.)

statistics/2016/nsf16316/)
In the 1960s the federal government paid for about two-thirds of the nation’s R&D. Over time, the U.S. economy has
come to rely much more heavily on industry-funded R&D. The federal government has tried to focus its direct R&D
spending on areas where private firms are not as active. One difficulty with direct government support of R&D is that
it inevitably involves political decisions about which projects are worthy. The scientific question of whether research
is worthwhile can easily become entangled with considerations like the location of the congressional district in which
316
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods

the research funding is spent.
Policy #2: Tax Breaks for Research and Development
A complementary approach to supporting R&D that does not involve the government’s close scrutiny of specific
projects is to give firms a reduction in taxes depending on how much research and development they do. The federal
government refers to this policy as the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit. According to the Treasury
Department: “. . . the R&E Credit is also a cost-effective policy for stimulating additional private sector investment.
Most recent studies find that each dollar of foregone tax revenue through the R&E Tax Credit causes firms to invest
at least a dollar in R&D, with some studies finding a benefit to cost ratio of 2 or 2.96.”
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/REtaxcredit) for more information on how the R&E Tax Credit
encourages investment.
Policy #3 Cooperative Research
State and federal governments support research in a variety of ways. For example, United for Medical Research, a
coalition of groups that seek funding for the National Institutes of Health, (which is supported by federal grants),
states: “NIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone.”
The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical-related research spending $117 billion in 2011. Other
institutions, such as the National Academy of Scientists and the National Academy of Engineers, receive federal
grants for innovative projects. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) at the United States Department
of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural
problems, from food safety to childhood obesity. Cooperation between government-funded universities, academies,
and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries.
13.3 | Public Goods
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify a public good using nonexcludable and non-rival as criteria
•
Explain the free rider problem
•
Identify several sources of public goods
Even though new technology creates positive externalities so that perhaps one-third or one-half of the social benefit
of new inventions spills over to others, the inventor still receives some private return. What about a situation where
the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of the social benefit? We
call this kind of good a public good. Spending on national defense is a good example of a public good. Let’s begin
by defining the characteristics of a public good and discussing why these characteristics make it difficult for private
firms to supply public goods. Then we will see how government may step in to address the issue.
The Definition of a Public Good
Economists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not necessarily include all goods financed through
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
317

taxes. To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private good, like a piece
of pizza. We can buy and sell a piece of pizza fairly easily because it is a separate and identifiable item. However,
public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.
Instead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are nonexcludable and non-rival. The first characteristic,
that a public good is nonexcludable, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good.
If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna, from eating that pizza.
However, if national defense is provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly disagree with America’s
defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still protects you. You cannot choose to
be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and exclude you.
The second main characteristic of a public good, that it is non-rival, means that when one person uses the public
good, another can also use it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then Michelle cannot also eat
it; that is, the two people are rivals in consumption. With a public good like national defense, Max’s consumption of
national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so they are non-rival in this area.
A number of government services are examples of public goods. For instance, it would not be easy to provide fire
and police service so that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning and burglary of their
property, while others would not be protected at all. Protecting some necessarily means protecting others, too.
Positive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts. Public goods have positive externalities, like
police protection or public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive externalities, however, are public
goods. Investments in education have huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private company. Private
companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad and reap profits that may not capture all of the social
benefits. We can also describe patents as an attempt to make new inventions into private goods, which are excludable
and rivalrous, so that no one but the inventor can use them during the length of the patent.
The Free Rider Problem of Public Goods
Private companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good or service is nonexcludable, like national
defense, so that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or service, then how can a firm
charge people for it?
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/freerider) to read about a connection between free riders and
“bad music.”
When individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a free rider problem can arise, in which people have
an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to “free ride” on the purchases of others. We can express
the free rider problem in terms of the prisoner’s dilemma game, which we discuss as a representation of oligopoly
in Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly. When individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a
free rider problem can arise, in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then, since
once there is a provided public good it is available to all, to “free ride” on the purchases of others.
There is a dilemma with the Prisoner’s Dilemma, though. See the Work It Out feature.

The Problem with the Prisoner’s Dilemma
Suppose two people, Rachel and Samuel, are considering purchasing a public good. The difficulty with the
prisoner’s dilemma arises as each person thinks through his or her strategic choices.
Step 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then I would be a fool to contribute.
However, if Samuel does contribute, then I can come out ahead by not contributing.
Step 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope that I can be a free rider who uses the
public good paid for by Samuel.
Step 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.
Step 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets built, and there is no movement to
the option where everyone cooperates—which is actually best for all parties.
The Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods
The key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring that everyone will make a contribution and
to prevent free riders. For example, if people come together through the political process and agree to pay taxes and
make group decisions about the quantity of public goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by requiring, through
the law, that everyone contributes.
However, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. In some cases, markets can
produce public goods. For example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio signal is broadcast, it
would be very difficult to stop someone from receiving it. It is non-rival, since one person listening to the signal does
not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these features, it is practically impossible to charge listeners
directly for listening to conventional radio broadcasts.
Radio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which is an indirect way of “charging” listeners by
taking up some of their time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also paying for the radio
service, since the station builds in the cost of advertising into the product cost. In a more recent development, satellite
radio companies, such as SirusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming music without commercials. In
this case, however, the product is excludable—only those who pay for the subscription will receive the broadcast.
Some public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no charge along with fees for some purposes, like a
public city park that is free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car, for reserving certain picnic
grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment stand.
Read this article (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/governmentpay) to find out what economists say the government
should pay for.
In other cases, we can use social pressures and personal appeals, rather than the force of law, to reduce the number
of free riders and to collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes form an association to
Chapter 13 | Positive Externalities and Public Goods
319

carry out beautification projects or to patrol their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-income countries, where
social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate, farmers in a region may come together to work on a
large irrigation project that will benefit all. We can view many fundraising efforts, including raising money for local
charities and for the endowments of colleges and universities, as an attempt to use social pressure to discourage free
riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a public benefit.
Common Resources and the “Tragedy of the Commons”
There are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of private good or public good. While it is easy to
classify a pizza as a private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that is nonexcludable and
rivalrous, such as the queen conch?
In the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk that lives in shallow waters of sea grass. These waters are
so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is conch meat a local
delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but artists use the large ornate shells and craftsmen transform them.
Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can participate in the conch harvest, it is essentially
nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous. Once a diver catches one conch another diver cannot
catch it.
We call goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous common resources. Because the waters of the Caribbean are
open to all conch fishermen, and because any conch that you catch is conch that I cannot catch, fishermen tend to
overharvest common resources like the conch.
The problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag “Tragedy
of the Commons” to the problem in a 1968 article in the magazine Science. Economists view this as a problem of
property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no one individual has
an incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To address the issue of overharvesting conch and
other marine fisheries, economists typically advocate simple devices like fishing licenses, harvest limits, and shorter
fishing seasons. When the population of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the
harvest until biologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with
the conch, the harvesting of which the government has effectively banned in the United States since 1986.

Positive Externalities in Public Health Programs
One of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last several centuries is that people are living
longer. Thousands of years ago, scientists believe that human life expectancy ranged between 20 to 30 years. By 1900,
average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2015, life expectancy was 79 years. Most of the gains
in life expectancy in the history of the human race happened in the twentieth century.
The rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors. First, systems for providing clean water and
disposing of human waste helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in public behavior
have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century, for example, people learned the importance of boiling bottles
before using them for food storage and baby’s milk, washing their hands, and protecting food from flies. More recent
behavioral changes include reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and precautions to limit sexually
transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role. Scientists developed immunizations for diphtheria,
320

cholera, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever between 1890 and 1930. Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led
to a series of other antibiotic drugs for bringing infectious diseases under control. In recent decades, drugs that reduce
the risks of high blood pressure have had a dramatic effect in extending lives.
These advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive externalities and public goods. Public health
officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late 1900s.
Government funded many public sanitation systems and storm sewers because they have the key traits of public
goods. In the twentieth century, many medical discoveries emerged from government or university-funded research.
Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private inventors. The reason for requiring
immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of illness to others—as well as helping the
person immunized.
The Benefits of Voyager I Endure
While we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA’s space projects, we should also acknowledge that
those benefits are not shared equally. Economists like Tyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University,
are seeing increasing evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving
technology, and those who do not. According to Cowen, author of the recent book, Average Is Over: Powering
America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation, this inequality in access to technology and information is
going to deepen the inequality in skills, and ultimately, in wages and global standards of living.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
13.1 Why the Private Sector Underinvests in Innovation
Competition creates pressure to innovate. However, if one can easily copy new inventions, then the original inventor
loses the incentive to invest further in research and development. New technology often has positive externalities;
that is, there are often spillovers from the invention of new technology that benefit firms other than the innovator. The
social benefit of an invention, once the firm accounts for these spillovers, typically exceeds the private benefit to the
inventor. If inventors could receive a greater share of the broader social benefits for their work, they would have a
greater incentive to seek out new inventions.
13.2 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation
Public policy with regard to technology must often strike a balance. For example, patents provide an incentive for
inventors, but they should be limited to genuinely new inventions and not extend forever.
Government has a variety of policy tools for increasing the rate of return for new technology and encouraging
its development, including: direct government funding of R&D, tax incentives for R&D, protection of intellectual
property, and forming cooperative relationships between universities and the private sector.
13.3 Public Goods
A public good has two key characteristics: it is nonexcludable and non-rival. Nonexcludable means that it is costly or
impossible for one user to exclude others from using the good. Non-rival means that when one person uses the good,
it does not prevent others from using it. Markets often have a difficult time producing public goods because free riders
will attempt to use the public good without paying for it. One can overcome the free rider problem through measures
to assure that users of the public good pay for it. Such measures include government actions, social pressures, and
specific situations where markets have discovered a way to collect payments.

3. The Gizmo Company is planning to develop new household gadgets. Table 13.4 shows the company’s demand
for financial capital for research and development of these gadgets, based on expected rates of return from sales. Now,
say that every investment would have an additional 5% social benefit—that is, an investment that pays at least a 6%
return to the Gizmo Company will pay at least an 11% return for society as a whole; an investment that pays at least
7% for the Gizmo Company will pay at least 12% for society as a whole, and so on. Answer the questions that follow

PROBLEMS

HighFlyer Airlines wants to build new airplanes
with greatly increased cabin space. This will allow
HighFlyer Airlines to give passengers more comfort and
sell more tickets at a higher price. However, redesigning
the cabin means rethinking many other elements of the
airplane as well, like engine and luggage placement,
and the most efficient shape of the plane for moving
through the air. HighFlyer Airlines has developed a list
of possible methods to increase cabin space, along with
estimates of how these approaches would affect the
plane's operating costs and ticket sales. Based on these
estimates, Table 13.5 shows the value of R&D projects
that provide at least a certain private rate of return.
Column 1 = Private Rate of Return. Column 2 = Value

Becky and Sarah are sisters who share a room.
Their room can easily get messy, and their parents are
always telling them to tidy it. Here are the costs and
benefits to both Becky and Sarah, of taking the time to
clean their room: If both Becky and Sarah clean, they
each spends two hours and get a clean room. If Becky
decides not to clean and Sarah does all the cleaning, then
Sarah spends 10 hours cleaning (Becky spends 0) but
Sarah is exhausted. The same would occur for Becky
if Sarah decided not to clean—Becky spends 10 hours

14 | Poverty and Economic
Inequality
Figure 14.1 Occupying Wall Street On September 17, 2011, Occupy Wall Street began in New York City’s Wall
Street financial district. (Credit: modification of work by David Shankbone/Flickr Creative Commons)
Occupy Wall Street
In September 2011, a group of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Park in New York City to decry what they
perceived as increasing social and economic inequality in the United States. Calling their protest “Occupy
Wall Street,” they argued that the concentration of wealth among the richest 1% in the United States was both
economically unsustainable and inequitable, and needed to be changed. The protest then spread to other
major cities, and the Occupy movement was born.
Why were people so upset? How much wealth is concentrated among the top 1% in our society? How did
they acquire so much wealth? These are very real, very important questions in the United States now, and
this chapter on poverty and economic inequality will help us address the causes behind this sentiment.

Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality
The labor markets that determine the pay that workers receive do not take into account how much income a family
needs for food, shelter, clothing, and health care. Market forces do not worry about what happens to families when
a major local employer goes out of business. Market forces do not take time to contemplate whether those who are
earning higher incomes should pay an even higher share of taxes.
However, labor markets do create considerable income inequalities. In 2014, the median American family income
was $57,939 (the median is the level where half of all families had more than that level and half had less). According
to the U.S. Census Bureau, the federal government classified almost nine million U.S. families as below the poverty
line in that year. Think about a family of three—perhaps a single mother with two children—attempting to pay for
the basics of life on perhaps $17,916 per year. After paying for rent, healthcare, clothing, and transportation, such a
family might have $6,000 to spend on food. Spread over 365 days, the food budget for the entire family would be
about $17 per day. To put this in perspective, most cities have restaurants where $17 will buy you an appetizer for
one.
This chapter explores how the U.S. government defines poverty, the balance between assisting the poor without
discouraging work, and how federal antipoverty programs work. It also discusses income inequality—how
economists measure inequality, why inequality has changed in recent decades, the range of possible government
policies to reduce inequality, and the danger of a tradeoff that too great a reduction in inequality may reduce incentives
for producing output.
14.1 | Drawing the Poverty Line
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain economic inequality and how the poverty line is determined
•
Analyze the U.S. poverty rate over time, noting its prevalence among different groups of citizens
Comparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality and poverty. Poverty is
measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income—called the poverty line—that defines
the income one needs for a basic standard of living. Income inequality compares the share of the total income (or
wealth) in society that different groups receive. For example, compare the share of income that the top 10% receive
to the share of income that the bottom 10% receive.
In the United States, the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person: Mollie Orshansky. In
1963, Orshansky, who was working for the Social Security Administration, published an article called “Children of
the Poor” in a highly useful and dry-as-dust publication called the Social Security Bulletin. Orshansky’s idea was to
define a poverty line based on the cost of a healthy diet.
Her previous job had been at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where she had worked in an agency called the
Bureau of Home Economics and Human Nutrition. One task of this bureau had been to calculate how much it would
cost to feed a nutritionally adequate diet to a family. Orshansky found that the average family spent one-third of its
income on food. She then proposed that the poverty line be the amount one requires to buy a nutritionally adequate
diet, given the size of the family, multiplied by three.
The current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line, although the government adjusts
the dollar amounts to represent the same buying power over time. The U.S. poverty line in 2015 ranged from $11,790
for a single individual to $25,240 for a household of four people.
Figure 14.2 shows the U.S. poverty rate over time; that is, the percentage of the population below the poverty line
in any given year. The poverty rate declined through the 1960s, rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s, but seems
to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s. However, in no year in the last four decades has the poverty rate
been less than 11% of the U.S. population—that is, at best about one American in nine is below the poverty line.
In recent years, the poverty rate appears to have peaked at 15.9% in 2011 before dropping to 14.5% in 2013. Table
14.1 compares poverty rates for different groups in 2011. As you will see when we delve further into these numbers,
poverty rates are relatively low for whites, for the elderly, for the well-educated, and for male-headed households.
Poverty rates for females, Hispanics, and African Americans are much higher than for whites. While Hispanics and

Table 14.1 Poverty Rates by Group, 2013
The concept of a poverty line raises many tricky questions. In a vast country like the United States, should there be
a national poverty line? After all, according to the Federal Register, the median household income for a family of
four was $102,552 in New Jersey and $57,132 in Mississippi in 2013, and prices of some basic goods like housing
are quite different between states. The poverty line is based on cash income, which means it does not account for
government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non-cash form, like Medicaid (health care for low-
income individuals and families) and food aid. Also, low-income families can qualify for federal housing assistance.
(We will discuss these and other government aid programs in detail later in this chapter.)
Should the government adjust the poverty line to account for the value of such programs? Many economists and
policymakers wonder whether we should rethink the concept of what poverty means in the twenty-first century. The
following Clear It Up feature explains the poverty lines set by the World Bank for low-income countries around the
world.
How do economists measure poverty in low-income countries?
The World Bank sets two poverty lines for low-income countries around the world. One poverty line is set at an
income of $1.25/day per person. The other is at $2/day. By comparison, the U.S. 2015 poverty line of $20,090
annually for a family of three works out to $18.35 per person per day.
Clearly, many people around the world are far poorer than Americans, as Table 14.2 shows. China and India
both have more than a billion people; Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa; and Egypt is the most
populous country in the Middle East. In all four of those countries, in the mid-2000s, a substantial share of the
population subsisted on less than $2/day. About half the world lives on less than $2.50 a day, and 80 percent
of the world lives on less than $10 per day. (Of course, the cost of food, clothing, and shelter in those countries
can be very different from those costs in the United States, so the $2 and $2.50 figures may mean greater
purchasing power than they would in the United States.)

Any poverty line will be somewhat arbitrary, and it is useful to have a poverty line whose basic definition does not
change much over time. If Congress voted every few years to redefine poverty, then it would be difficult to compare
rates over time. After all, would a lower poverty rate change the definition, or that people were actually better off?
Government statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau have ongoing research programs to address questions like these.
14.2 | The Poverty Trap
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the poverty trap, noting how government programs impact it
•
Identify potential issues in government programs that seek to reduce poverty
•
Calculate a budget constraint line that represents the poverty trap
Can you give people too much help, or the wrong kind of help? When people are provided with food, shelter,
healthcare, income, and other necessities, assistance may reduce their incentive to work. Consider a program to fight
poverty that works in this reasonable-sounding manner: the government provides assistance to the poor, but as the
poor earn income to support themselves, the government reduces the level of assistance it provides. With such a
program, every time a poor person earns $100, the person loses $100 in government support. As a result, the person
experiences no net gain for working. Economists call this problem the poverty trap.
Consider the situation a single-parent family faces. Figure 14.3 illustrates a single mother (earning $8 an hour)
with two children. First, consider the labor-leisure budget constraint that this family faces in a situation without
government assistance. On the horizontal axis is hours of leisure (or time spent with family responsibilities) increasing
in quantity from right to left. Also on the horizontal axis is the number of hours at paid work, going from zero hours
on the right to the maximum of 2,500 hours on the left. On the vertical axis is the amount of income per year rising
from low to higher amounts of income. The budget constraint line shows that at zero hours of leisure and 2,500 hours
of work, the maximum amount of income is $20,000 ($8 × 2,500 hours). At the other extreme of the budget constraint
line, an individual would work zero hours, earn zero income, but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure. At point A on the
budget constraint line, by working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, the utility-maximizing choice is to work a total
of 2,000 hours per year and earn $16,000.
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
331

Now suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two children
$18,000 in income. This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $18,000. With this program, each time the
mother earns $1,000, the government will deduct $1,000 of its support. Table 14.3 shows what will happen at each
combination of work and government support.
Figure 14.3 The Poverty Trap in Action The original choice is 500 hours of leisure, 2,000 hours of work at point A,
and income of $16,000. With a guaranteed income of $18,000, this family would receive $18,000 whether it provides
zero hours of work or 2,000 hours of work. Only if the family provides, say, 2,300 hours of work does its income rise
above the guaranteed level of $18,000—and even then, the marginal gain to income from working many hours is
small.

Table 14.3 Total Income at Various Combinations of Work and Support
The new budget line, with the antipoverty program in place, is the horizontal and heavy line that is flat at $18,000. If
the mother does not work at all, she receives $18,000, all from the government. If she works full time, giving up 40
hours per week with her children, she still ends up with $18,000 at the end of the year. Only if she works 2,300 hours
in the year—which is an average of 44 hours per week for 50 weeks a year—does household income rise to $18,400.
Even in this case, all of her year’s work means that household income rises by only $400 over the income she would
receive if she did not work at all. She would need to work 50 hours a week to reach $20,000.
The poverty trap is even stronger than this simplified example shows, because a working mother will have extra
expenses like clothing, transportation, and child care that a nonworking mother will not face, making the economic
gains from working even smaller. Moreover, those who do not work fail to build up job experience and contacts,
which makes working in the future even less likely.
To reduce the poverty trap the government could design an antipoverty program so that, instead of reducing
332
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, the government would reduce payments by some smaller amount
instead. Imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and setting a time limit on benefits can
also reduce the harshness of the poverty trap.
Figure 14.4 illustrates a government program that guarantees $18,000 in income, even for those who do not work
at all, but then reduces this amount by 50 cents for each $1 earned. The new, higher budget line in Figure 14.4
shows that, with this program, additional hours of work will bring some economic gain. Because of the reduction in
government income when an individual works, an individual earning $8.00 will really net only $4.00 per hour. The
vertical intercept of this higher budget constraint line is at $28,000 ($18,000 + 2,500 hours × $4.00 = $28,000). The
horizontal intercept is at the point on the graph where $18,000 and 2500 hours of leisure is set. Table 14.4 shows the
total income differences with various choices of labor and leisure.
However, this type of program raises other issues. First, even if it does not eliminate the incentive to work by reducing
government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, enacting such a program may still reduce the incentive to work. At
least some people who would be working 2,000 hours each year without this program might decide to work fewer
hours but still end up with more income—that is, their choice on the new budget line would be like S, above and to
the right of the original choice P. Of course, others may choose a point like R, which involves the same amount of
work as P, or even a point to the left of R that involves more work.
The second major issue is that when the government phases out its support payments more slowly, the antipoverty
program costs more money. Still, it may be preferable in the long run to spend more money on a program that retains
a greater incentive to work, rather than spending less money on a program that nearly eliminates any gains from
working.
Figure 14.4 Loosening the Poverty Trap: Reducing Government Assistance by 50 Cents for Every $1
Earned On the original labor-leisure opportunity set, the lower budget set shown by the smaller dashed line in the
figure, the preferred choice P is 500 hours of leisure and $16,000 of income. Then, the government created an
antipoverty program that guarantees $18,000 in income even to those who work zero hours, shown by the larger
dashed line. In addition, every $1 earned means phasing out 50 cents of benefits. This program leads to the higher
budget set, which the diagram shows. The hope is that this program will provide incentives to work the same or more
hours, despite receiving income assistance. However, it is possible that the recipients will choose a point on the new
budget set like S, with less work, more leisure, and greater income, or a point like R, with the same work and greater
income.

Earned
The next module will consider a variety of government support programs focused specifically on the poor, including
welfare, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid, and the earned income tax credit (EITC).
Although these programs vary from state to state, it is generally a true statement that in many states from the 1960s
into the 1980s, if poor people worked, their level of income barely rose—or did not rise at all—after factoring in the
reduction in government support payments. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.
Calculating a Budget Constraint Line
Jason earns $9.00 an hour, and a government antipoverty program provides a floor of $10,000 guaranteed
income. The government reduces government support by $0.50 for each $1.00 earned. What are the
horizontal and vertical intercepts of the budget constraint line? Assume the maximum hours for work or leisure
is 2,500 hours.
Step 1. Determine the amount of the government guaranteed income. In this case, it is $10,000.
Step 2. Plot that guaranteed income as a horizontal line on the budget constraint line.
Step 3. Determine what Jason earns if he has no income and enjoys 2,500 hours of leisure. In this case, he
will receive the guaranteed $10,000 (the horizontal intercept).
Step 4. Calculate how much Jason’s salary will be reduced due to the reduction in government income. In
Jason’s case, it will be reduced by one half. He will, in effect, net only $4.50 an hour.
Step 5. If Jason works 1,000 hours, at a maximum what income will Jason receive? Jason will receive $10,000
in government assistance. He will net only $4.50 for every hour he chooses to work. If he works 1,000 hours at
$4.50, his earned income is $4,500 plus the $10,000 in government income. Thus, the total maximum income
(the vertical intercept) is $10,000 + $4,500 = $14,500.
14.3 | The Safety Net
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify the antipoverty government programs that comprise the safety net
•
Explain the the safety net programs' primary goals and how these programs have changed over time
•
Discuss the complexities of these safety net programs and why they can be controversial
The U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those who
have incomes just above the poverty line, to whom we refer as the near-poor. Such programs are called the safety
334

net, to recognize that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income.
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
From the Great Depression until 1996, the United States’ most visible antipoverty program was Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC), which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty
line. Many just called this program “welfare.” In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law
the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, more commonly called the “welfare reform
act.” The new law replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Clinton_speech) to watch a video of President Bill Clinton’s
Welfare Reform speech.
TANF brought several dramatic changes in how welfare operated. Under the old AFDC program, states set the level
of welfare benefits that they would pay to the poor, and the federal government guaranteed it would chip in some of
the money as well. The federal government’s welfare spending would rise or fall depending on the number of poor
people, and on how each state set its own welfare contribution.
Under TANF, however, the federal government gives a fixed amount of money to each state. The state can then use
the money for almost any program with an antipoverty component: for example, the state might use the money to give
cash to poor families, or to reduce teenage pregnancy, or even to raise the high school graduation rate. However, the
federal government imposed two key requirements. First, if states are to keep receiving the TANF grants, they must
impose work requirements so that most of those receiving TANF benefits are working (or attending school). Second,
no one can receive TANF benefits with federal money for more than a total of five years over his or her lifetime. The
old AFDC program had no such work requirements or time limits.
TANF attempts to avoid the poverty trap by requiring that welfare recipients work and by limiting the length of time
they can receive benefits. In its first few years, the program was quite successful. The number of families receiving
payments in 1995, the last year of AFDC, was 4.8 million. By 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service,
the average number of families receiving payments under TANF was 1.8 million—a decline of more than half.
TANF benefits to poor families vary considerably across states. For example, again according to the Congressional
Research Service, in 2011 the highest monthly payment in Alaska to a single mother with two children was $923,
while in Mississippi the highest monthly payment to that family was $170. These payments reflect differences in
states’ cost of living. Total spending on TANF was approximately $16.6 billion in 1997. As of 2012, spending was
at $12 billion, an almost 28% decrease, split about evenly between the federal and state governments. When you
take into account the effects of inflation, the decline is even greater. Moreover, there seemed little evidence that poor
families were suffering a reduced standard of living as a result of TANF—although, on the other side, there was not
much evidence that poor families had greatly improved their total levels of income, either.
The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
The earned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax
system. The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low-income groups, and projections for 2013 expected
26 million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of $50 billion. In 2013, for example, a single parent
with two children would have received a tax credit of $5,372 up to an income level of $17,530. The amount of the
tax break increases with the amount of income earned, up to a point. The earned income tax credit has often been
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
335

popular with both economists and the general public because of the way it effectively increases the payment received
for work.
What about the danger of the poverty trap that every additional $1 earned will reduce government support payments
by close to $1? To minimize this problem, the earned income tax credit is phased out slowly. According to the Tax
Policy Center, for a single-parent family with two children in 2013, the credit is not reduced at all (but neither is it
increased) as earnings rise from $13,430 to $17,530. Then, for every $1 earned above $17,530, the amount received
from the credit is reduced by 21.06 cents, until the credit phases out completely at an income level of $46,227.
Figure 14.5 illustrates that the earned income tax credits, child tax credits, and the TANF program all cost the federal
government money—either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues. CTC stands for the government tax cuts for
the child tax credit.
Figure 14.5 Real Federal Spending on CTC, EITC, and TANF, 1975-2013 EITC increased from more than $20
billion in 2000 to over an estimated $50 billion by 2013, far exceeding estimated 2013 outlays in the CTC (Child Tax
Credits) and TANF of over $20 billion and $10 billion, respectively. (Source: Office of Management and Budget)
In recent years, the EITC has become a hugely expensive government program for providing income assistance to the
poor and near-poor, costing about $60 billion in 2012. In that year, the EITC provided benefits to about 27 million
families and individuals and, on average, is worth about $2,296 per family (with children), according to the Tax Policy
Center. One reason that the TANF law worked as well as it did is that the government greatly expanded EITC in the
late 1980s and again in the early 1990s, which increased the returns to work for low-income Americans.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
Often called “food stamps,” Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded program,
started in 1964, in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food. The
amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income, number of children, and other factors but, in
general, households are expected to spend about 30% of their own net income on food, and if 30% of their net income
is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet, then those households are eligible for SNAP.
SNAP can contribute to the poverty trap. For every $100 earned, the government assumes that a family can spend
$30 more for food, and thus reduces its eligibility for food aid by $30. This decreased benefit is not a complete
disincentive to work—but combined with how other programs reduce benefits as income increases, it adds to the
problem. SNAP, however, does try to address the poverty trap with its own set of work requirements and time limits.
Why give debit cards and not just cash? Part of the political support for SNAP comes from a belief that since
recipients must spend the the cards on food, they cannot “waste” them on other forms of consumption. From an
economic point of view, however, the belief that cards must increase spending on food seems wrong-headed. After
all, say that a poor family is spending $2,500 per year on food, and then it starts receiving $1,000 per year in SNAP
aid. The family might react by spending $3,500 per year on food (income plus aid), or it might react by continuing to
spend $2,500 per year on food, but use the $1,000 in food aid to free up $1,000 that it can now spend on other goods.
336
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality

Thus, it is reasonable to think of SNAP cards as an alternative method, along with TANF and the earned income tax
credit, of transferring income to the working poor.
Anyone eligible for TANF is also eligible for SNAP, although states can expand eligibility for food aid if they wish
to do so. In some states, where TANF welfare spending is relatively low, a poor family may receive more in support
from SNAP than from TANF. In 2014, about 40 million people received food aid at an annual cost of about $76
billion, with an average monthly benefit of about $287 per person per month. SNAP participation increased by 70%
between 2007 and 2011, from 26.6 million participants to 45 million. According to the Congressional Budget Office,
the 2008-2009 Great Recession and rising food prices caused this dramatic rise in participation.
The federal government deploys a range of income security programs that it funds through departments such as Health
and Human Services, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (see Figure 14.6). According to
the Office of Management and Budget, collectively, these three departments provided an estimated $62 billion of aid
through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children, subsidized housing, and energy
assistance. The federal government also transfers funds to individual states through special grant programs.
Figure 14.6 Expenditure Comparison of TANF, SNAP, HUD, and Other Income Security Programs, 1988–2013
(est.) Total expenditures on income security continued to rise between 1988 and 2010, while payments for TANF
have increased from $13 billion in 1998 to an estimated $17.3 billion in 2013. SNAP has seen relatively small
increments. These two programs comprise a relatively small portion of the estimated $106 billion dedicated to income
security in 2013. Note that other programs and housing programs increased dramatically during the 2008 and 2010
time periods. (Source: Table 12.3 Section 600 Income Security, https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/
budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf)
The safety net includes a number of other programs: government-subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for
children from low-income families; the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC),
which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program, which provides help with home heating bills; housing assistance, which helps pay the rent; and
Supplemental Security Income, which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor.
Medicaid
Congress created Medicaid in 1965. This is a joint health insurance program between both the states and the
federal government. The federal government helps fund Medicaid, but each state is responsible for administering the
program, determining the level of benefits, and determining eligibility. It provides medical insurance for certain low-
income people, including those below the poverty line, with a focus on families with children, the elderly, and the
disabled. About one-third of Medicaid spending is for low-income mothers with children. While an increasing share
of the program funding in recent years has gone to pay for nursing home costs for the elderly poor. The program
ensures that participants receive a basic level of benefits, but because each state sets eligibility requirements and
provides varying levels of service, the program differs from state to state.
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
337

In the past, a common problem has been that many low-paying jobs pay enough to a breadwinner so that a family
could lose its eligibility for Medicaid, yet the job does not offer health insurance benefits. A poor parent considering
such a job might choose not to work rather than lose health insurance for his or her children. In this way, health
insurance can become a part of the poverty trap. Many states recognized this problem in the 1980s and 1990s and
expanded their Medicaid coverage to include not just the poor, but the near-poor earning up to 135% or even 185%
of the poverty line. Some states also guaranteed that children would not lose coverage if their parents worked.
These expanded guarantees cost the government money, of course, but they also helped to encourage those on welfare
to enter the labor force. As of 2014, approximately 69.7 million people participated in Medicaid. Of those enrolled,
almost half are children. Healthcare expenditures, however, are highest for the elderly population, which comprises
approximately 25% of participants. As Figure 14.7 (a) indicates, the largest number of households that enroll in
Medicaid are those with children. Lower-income adults are the next largest group enrolled in Medicaid at 28%. The
blind and disabled are 16% of those enrolled, and seniors are 9% of those enrolled. Figure 14.7 (b) shows how
much actual Medicaid dollars the government spends for each group. Out of total Medicaid spending, the government
spends more on seniors (20%) and the blind and disabled (44%). Thus, 64% of all Medicaid spending goes to seniors,
the blind, and disabled. Children receive 21% of all Medicaid spending, followed by adults at 15%.
Figure 14.7 Medicaid Enrollment and Spending Part (a) shows the Medicaid enrollment by different populations,
with children comprising the largest percentage at 47%, followed by adults at 28%, and the blind and disabled at
16%. Part (b) shows that Medicaid spending is principally for the blind and disabled, followed by the elderly. Although

economy

Poverty levels can be subjective based on the overall income levels of a country. Typically a government measures
poverty based on a percentage of the median income. Income inequality, however, has to do with the distribution of
that income, in terms of which group receives the most or the least income. Income inequality involves comparing
those with high incomes, middle incomes, and low incomes—not just looking at those below or near the poverty
line. In turn, measuring income inequality means dividing the population into various groups and then comparing the
groups, a task that we can be carry out in several ways, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.

How do you separate poverty and income inequality?
Poverty can change even when inequality does not move at all. Imagine a situation in which income for
everyone in the population declines by 10%. Poverty would rise, since a greater share of the population would
now fall below the poverty line. However, inequality would be the same, because everyone suffered the same
proportional loss. Conversely, a general rise in income levels over time would keep inequality the same, but
reduce poverty.
It is also possible for income inequality to change without affecting the poverty rate. Imagine a situation
in which a large number of people who already have high incomes increase their incomes by even more.
Inequality would rise as a result—but the number of people below the poverty line would remain unchanged.
Why did inequality of household income increase in the United States in recent decades? A trend toward greater
income inequality has occurred in many countries around the world, although the effect has been more powerful in the
U.S. economy. Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed
more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s. One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of
American households. The other focuses on greater inequality of wages, what some economists call “winner take
all” labor markets. We will begin with how we measure inequality, and then consider the explanations for growing
inequality in the United States.
Measuring Income Distribution by Quintiles
One common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income, from lowest to highest, and
then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people, known as quintiles. This calculation
allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total. The first quintile is
the lowest fifth or 20%, the second quintile is the next lowest, and so on. We can measure income inequality by
comparing what share of the total income each quintile earns.
U.S. income distribution by quintile appears in Table 14.5. In 2011, for example, the bottom quintile of the income
distribution received 3.2% of income; the second quintile received 8.4%; the third quintile, 14.3%; the fourth quintile,
23.0%; and the top quintile, 51.14%. The final column of Table 14.5 shows what share of income went to households
in the top 5% of the income distribution: 22.3% in 2011. Over time, from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, the top
fifth of the income distribution typically received between about 43% to 44% of all income. The share of income
that the top fifth received then begins to rise. Census Bureau researchers trace, much of this increase in the share of
income going to the top fifth to an increase in the share of income going to the top 5%. The quintile measure shows
how income inequality has increased in recent decades.

It can also be useful to divide the income distribution in ways other than quintiles; for example, into tenths or even
into percentiles (that is, hundredths). A more detailed breakdown can provide additional insights. For example, the
last column of Table 14.5 shows the income received by the top 5% percent of the income distribution. Between
1980 and 2013, the share of income going to the top 5% increased by 5.7 percentage points (from 16.5% in 1980 to
22.2% in 2013). From 1980 to 2013 the share of income going to the top quintile increased by 7.0 percentage points
(from 44.1% in 1980 to 51% in 2013). Thus, the top 20% of householders (the fifth quintile) received over half (51%)
of all the income in the United States in 2013.
Lorenz Curve
We can present the data on income inequality in various ways. For example, you could draw a bar graph that showed
the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution. Figure 14.8 presents an alternative way of
showing inequality data in a Lorenz curve. This curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal
axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis.
Figure 14.8 The Lorenz Curve A Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative shares of income received by everyone up to
a certain quintile. The income distribution in 1980 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income distribution in
2011—that is, the U.S. income distribution became more unequal over time.
Every Lorenz curve diagram begins with a line sloping up at a 45-degree angle. We show it as a dashed line in Figure
14.8. The points along this line show what perfect equality of the income distribution looks like. It would mean, for
example, that the bottom 20% of the income distribution receives 20% of the total income, the bottom 40% gets 40%
of total income, and so on. The other lines reflect actual U.S. data on inequality for 1980 and 2011.
The trick in graphing a Lorenz curve is that you must change the shares of income for each specific quintile, which
we show in the first column of numbers in Table 14.6, into cumulative income, which we show in the second column
of numbers. For example, the bottom 40% of the cumulative income distribution will be the sum of the first and
second quintiles; the bottom 60% of the cumulative income distribution will be the sum of the first, second, and third
340

quintiles, and so on. The final entry in the cumulative income column needs to be 100%, because by definition, 100%
of the population receives 100% of the income.

Table 14.6 Calculating the Lorenz Curve
In a Lorenz curve diagram, a more unequal distribution of income will loop farther down and away from the
45-degree line, while a more equal distribution of income will move the line closer to the 45-degree line. Figure
Figure 14.8 illustrates the greater inequality of the U.S. income distribution between 1980 and 2013 because the
Lorenz curve for 2013 is farther from the 45-degree line than for 1980. The Lorenz curve is a useful way of presenting
the quintile data that provides an image of all the quintile data at once. The next Clear It Up feature shows how income
inequality differs in various countries compared to the United States.
How does economic inequality vary around the world?
The U.S. economy has a relatively high degree of income inequality by global standards. As Table 14.7
shows, based on a variety of national surveys for a selection of years in the last five years of the 2000s
(with the exception of Germany, and adjusted to make the measures more comparable), the U.S. economy
has greater inequality than Germany (along with most Western European countries). The region of the world
with the highest level of income inequality is Latin America, illustrated in the numbers for Brazil and Mexico.
The level of inequality in the United States is lower than in some of the low-income countries of the world,
like China and Nigeria, or some middle-income countries like the Russian Federation. However, not all poor
countries have highly unequal income distributions. India provides a counterexample.

Causes of Growing Inequality: The Changing Composition of American
Households
In 1970, 41% of married women were in the labor force, but by 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
56.7% of married women were in the labor force. One result of this trend is that more households have two earners.
Moreover, it has become more common for one high earner to marry another high earner. A few decades ago, the
common pattern featured a man with relatively high earnings, such as an executive or a doctor, marrying a woman
who did not earn as much, like a secretary or a nurse. Often, the woman would leave paid employment, at least for a
few years, to raise a family. However, now doctors are marrying doctors and executives are marrying executives, and
mothers with high-powered careers are often returning to work while their children are quite young. This pattern of
households with two high earners tends to increase the proportion of high-earning households.
According to data in the National Journal, even as two-earner couples have increased, so have single-parent
households. Of all U.S. families, 13.1% were headed by single mothers. The poverty rate among single-parent
households tends to be relatively high.

These changes in family structure, including the growth of single-parent families who tend to be at the lower end of
the income distribution, and the growth of two-career high-earner couples near the top end of the income distribution,
account for roughly half of the rise in income inequality across households in recent decades.

wealth in the United States.
Causes of Growing Inequality: A Shift in the Distribution of Wages
Another factor behind the rise in U.S. income inequality is that earnings have become less equal since the late
1970s. In particular, the earnings of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor have increased. Winner-take-all
labor markets result from changes in technology, which have increased global demand for “stars,”—whether the best
CEO, doctor, basketball player, or actor. This global demand pushes salaries far above productivity differences versus
educational differences. One way to measure this change is to take workers' earnings with at least a four-year college
bachelor’s degree (including those who went on and completed an advanced degree) and divide them by workers'
earnings with only a high school degree. The result is that those in the 25–34 age bracket with college degrees earned
about 1.67 times as much as high school graduates in 2010, up from 1.59 times in 1995, according to U.S. Census
data. Winner-take-all labor market theory argues that the salary gap between the median and the top 1 percent is not
due to educational differences.
Economists use the demand and supply model to reason through the most likely causes of this shift. According to
the National Center for Education Statistics, in recent decades, the supply of U.S. workers with college degrees has
increased substantially. For example, 840,000 four-year bachelor’s degrees were conferred on Americans in 1970. In
2013-2014, 1,894,934 such degrees were conferred—an increase of over 90%. In Figure 14.9, this shift in supply
to the right, from S0 to S1, should result in a lower equilibrium wage for high-skilled labor. Thus, we can explain
the increase in the price of high-skilled labor by a greater demand, like the movement from D0 to D1. Evidently,
combining both the increase in supply and in demand has resulted in a shift from E0 to E1, and a resulting higher
wage.
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
343

Figure 14.9 Why Would Wages Rise for High-Skilled Labor? The proportion of workers attending college has
increased in recent decades, so the supply curve for high-skilled labor has shifted to the right, from S0 to S1. If the
demand for high-skilled labor had remained at D0, then this shift in supply would have led to lower wages for high-
skilled labor. However, the wages for high-skilled labor, especially if there is a large global demand, have increased
even with the shift in supply to the right. The explanation must lie in a shift to the right in demand for high-skilled
labor, from D0 to D1. The figure shows how a combination of the shift in supply, from S0 to S1, and the shift in
demand, from D0 to D1, led to both an increase in the quantity of high-skilled labor hired and also to a rise in the wage
for such labor, from W0 to W1.
What factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that while
the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many
workers to become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled workers like top business
managers, consultants, and design professionals. The new technologies have also helped to encourage globalization,
the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades, by making it more possible to learn about and
coordinate economic interactions all around the world. In turn, the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy
has opened up greater opportunities for high-skilled workers to sell their services around the world, and lower-skilled
workers have to compete with a larger supply of similarly skilled workers around the globe.
We can view the market for high-skilled labor as a race between forces of supply and demand. Additional education
and on-the-job training will tend to increase the high-skilled labor supply and to hold down its relative wage.
Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the demand for high-skilled
labor and push up its relative wage. We can view the greater inequality of wages as a sign that demand for skilled
labor is increasing faster than supply. Alternatively, if the supply of lower skilled workers exceeds the demand, then
average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will decrease. The combination of forces in the high-
skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased income disparity.
14.5 | Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the arguments for and against government intervention in a market economy
•
Identify beneficial ways to reduce the economic inequality in a society
•
Show the tradeoff between incentives and income equality
No society should expect or desire complete equality of income at a given point in time, for a number of reasons. First,
most workers receive relatively low earnings in their first few jobs, higher earnings as they reach middle age, and
then lower earnings after retirement. Thus, a society with people of varying ages will have a certain amount of income
inequality. Second, people’s preferences and desires differ. Some are willing to work long hours to have income for
large houses, fast cars and computers, luxury vacations, and the ability to support children and grandchildren.
344
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

These factors all imply that a snapshot of inequality in a given year does not provide an accurate picture of how
people’s incomes rise and fall over time. Even if we expect some degree of economic inequality at any point in time,
how much inequality should there be? There is also the difference between income and wealth, as the following Clear
It Up feature explains.
How do you measure wealth versus income inequality?
Income is a flow of money received, often measured on a monthly or an annual basis. Wealth is the sum
of the value of all assets, including money in bank accounts, financial investments, a pension fund, and the
value of a home. In calculating wealth, one must subtract all debts, such as debt owed on a home mortgage
and on credit cards. A retired person, for example, may have relatively little income in a given year, other
than a pension or Social Security. However, if that person has saved and invested over time, the person’s
accumulated wealth can be quite substantial.
In the United States, the wealth distribution is more unequal than the income distribution, because differences
in income can accumulate over time to make even larger differences in wealth. However, we can measure
the degree of inequality in the wealth distribution with the same tools we use to measure the inequality in the
income distribution, like quintile measurements. Once every three years the Federal Reserve Bank publishes
the Survey of Consumer Finance which reports a collection of data on wealth.
Even if they cannot answer the question of how much inequality is too much, economists can still play an important
role in spelling out policy options and tradeoffs. If a society decides to reduce the level of economic inequality, it has
three main sets of tools: redistribution from those with high incomes to those with low incomes; trying to assure that
a ladder of opportunity is widely available; and a tax on inheritance.
Redistribution
Redistribution means taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with lower
incomes. Earlier in this chapter, we considered some of the key government policies that provide support for the poor:
the welfare program TANF, the earned income tax credit, SNAP, and Medicaid. If a reduction in inequality is desired,
these programs could receive additional funding.
The federal income tax, which is a progressive tax system designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent
in income taxes than the poor funds the programs. Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the
top 1% of households had an average income of $1,219,700 per year in pre-tax income and paid an average federal
tax rate of 28.9%. The effective income tax, which is total taxes paid divided by total income (all sources of income
such as wages, profits, interest, rental income, and government transfers such as veterans’ benefits), was much lower.
The effective tax paid by that top 1% of householders paid was 20.4%, while the bottom two quintiles actually paid
negative effective income taxes, because of provisions like the earned income tax credit. News stories occasionally
report on a high-income person who has managed to pay very little in taxes, but while such individual cases exist,
according to the Congressional Budget Office, the typical pattern is that people with higher incomes pay a higher
average share of their income in federal income taxes.
Of course, the fact that some degree of redistribution occurs now through the federal income tax and government
antipoverty programs does not settle the questions of how much redistribution is appropriate, and whether more
redistribution should occur.
The Ladder of Opportunity
Economic inequality is perhaps most troubling when it is not the result of effort or talent, but instead is determined
by the circumstances under which a child grows up. One child attends a well-run grade school and high school and
heads on to college, while parents help out by supporting education and other interests, paying for college, a first
car, and a first house, and offering work connections that lead to internships and jobs. Another child attends a poorly
run grade school, barely makes it through a low-quality high school, does not go to college, and lacks family and
peer support. These two children may be similar in their underlying talents and in the effort they put forth, but their
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
345

economic outcomes are likely to be quite different.
Public policy can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that, even though all children will never come from
identical families and attend identical schools, each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in
society based on their interests, desires, talents, and efforts. Table 14.8 shows some of those initiatives.

Table 14.8 Public Policy Initiatives
Some have called the United States a land of opportunity. Although the general idea of a ladder of opportunity for all
citizens continues to exert a powerful attraction, specifics are often quite controversial. Society can experiment with
a wide variety of proposals for building a ladder of opportunity, especially for those who otherwise seem likely to
start their lives in a disadvantaged position. The government needs to carry out such policy experiments in a spirit
of open-mindedness, because some will succeed while others will not show positive results or will cost too much to
enact on a widespread basis.
Inheritance Taxes
There is always a debate about inheritance taxes. It goes like this: Why should people who have worked hard all
their lives and saved up a substantial nest egg not be able to give their money and possessions to their children and
grandchildren? In particular, it would seem un-American if children were unable to inherit a family business or a
family home. Alternatively, many Americans are far more comfortable with inequality resulting from high-income
people who earned their money by starting innovative new companies than they are with inequality resulting from
high-income people who have inherited money from rich parents.
The United States does have an estate tax—that is, a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance—which suggests a
willingness to limit how much wealth one can pass on as an inheritance. However, according to the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $5.43 million and
thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth.
The Tradeoff between Incentives and Income Equality
Government policies to reduce poverty or to encourage economic equality, if carried to extremes, can injure incentives
for economic output. The poverty trap, for example, defines a situation where guaranteeing a certain level of income
can eliminate or reduce the incentive to work. An extremely high degree of redistribution, with very high taxes on
the rich, would be likely to discourage work and entrepreneurship. Thus, it is common to draw the tradeoff between
economic output and equality, as Figure 14.10 (a) shows. In this formulation, if society wishes a high level of
economic output, like point A, it must also accept a high degree of inequality. Conversely, if society wants a high
level of equality, like point B, it must accept a lower level of economic output because of reduced incentives for
346
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality

production.
This view of the tradeoff between economic output and equality may be too pessimistic, and Figure 14.10 (b)
presents an alternate vision. Here, the tradeoff between economic output and equality first slopes up, in the vicinity of
choice C, suggesting that certain programs might increase both output and economic equality. For example, the policy
of providing free public education has an element of redistribution, since the value of the public schooling received
by children of low-income families is clearly higher than what low-income families pay in taxes. A well-educated
population, however, is also an enormously powerful factor in providing the skilled workers of tomorrow and helping
the economy to grow and expand. In this case, equality and economic growth may complement each other.
Moreover, policies to diminish inequality and soften the hardship of poverty may sustain political support for a market
economy. After all, if society does not make some effort toward reducing inequality and poverty, the alternative might
be that people would rebel against market forces. Citizens might seek economic security by demanding that their
legislators pass laws forbidding employers from ever laying off workers or reducing wages, or laws that would impose
price floors and price ceilings and shut off international trade. From this viewpoint, policies to reduce inequality may
help economic output by building social support for allowing markets to operate.
Figure 14.10 The Tradeoff between Incentives and Economic Equality (a) Society faces a trade-off where any
attempt to move toward greater equality, like moving from choice A to B, involves a reduction in economic output. (b)
Situations can arise like point C, where it is possible both to increase equality and also to increase economic output,
to a choice like D. It may also be possible to increase equality with little impact on economic output, like the
movement from choice D to E. However, at some point, too aggressive a push for equality will tend to reduce
economic output, as in the shift from E to F.
The tradeoff in Figure 14.10 (b) then flattens out in the area between points D and E, which reflects the pattern that
a number of countries that provide similar levels of income to their citizens—the United States, Canada, European
Union nations, Japan, and Australia—have different levels of inequality. The pattern suggests that countries in this
range could choose a greater or a lesser degree of inequality without much impact on economic output. Only if these
countries push for a much higher level of equality, like at point F, will they experience the diminished incentives that
lead to lower levels of economic output. In this view, while a danger always exists that an agenda to reduce poverty
or inequality can be poorly designed or pushed too far, it is also possible to discover and design policies that improve
equality and do not injure incentives for economic output by very much—or even improve such incentives.
Occupy Wall Street
The Occupy movement took on a life of its own over the last few months of 2011, bringing to light issues that
many people faced on the lower end of the income distribution. The contents of this chapter indicate that there
is a significant amount of income inequality in the United States. The question is: What should be done about
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality
347

it?
The 2008-2009 Great Recession caused unemployment to rise and incomes to fall. Many people attribute
the recession to mismanagement of the financial system by bankers and financial managers—those in the
1% of the income distribution—but those in lower quintiles bore the greater burden of the recession through
unemployment. This seemed to present the picture of inequality in a different light: the group that seemed
responsible for the recession was not the group that seemed to bear the burden of the decline in output. A
burden shared can bring a society closer together. A burden pushed off onto others can polarize it.
On one level, the problem with trying to reduce income inequality comes down to whether you still believe
in the American Dream. If you believe that one day you will have your American Dream—a large income,
large house, happy family, or whatever else you would like to have in life—then you do not necessarily
want to prevent anyone else from living out their dream. You certainly would not want to run the risk that
someone would want to take part of your dream away from you. Thus, there is some reluctance to engage in
a redistributive policy to reduce inequality.
However, when those for whom the likelihood of living the American Dream is very small are considered, there
are sound arguments in favor of trying to create greater balance. As the text indicated, a little more income
equality, gained through long-term programs like increased education and job training, can increase overall
economic output. Then everyone is made better off, and the 1% will not seem like such a small group any
more.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
14.1 Drawing the Poverty Line
Wages are influenced by Supply and demand in labor markets influence wages. This can lead to very low incomes for
some people and very high incomes for others. Poverty and income inequality are not the same thing. Poverty applies
to the condition of people who cannot afford the necessities of life. Income inequality refers to the disparity between
those with higher and lower incomes. The poverty rate is what percentage of the population lives below the poverty
line, which the amount of income that it takes to purchase the necessities of life determines. Choosing a poverty line
will always be somewhat controversial.
Chapter 14 | Poverty and Economic Inequality

14.2 The Poverty Trap
A poverty trap occurs when government-support payments for the poor decline as the poor earn more income. As
a result, the poor do not end up with much more income when they work, because the loss of government support
largely or completely offsets any income that one earns by working. Phasing out government benefits more slowly, as
well as imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and a time limit on benefits can reduce
the harshness of the poverty trap.
14.3 The Safety Net
We call the group of government programs that assist the poor the safety net. In the United States, prominent safety net
programs include Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), the earned income tax credit (EITC), Medicaid, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC).
14.4 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes
Measuring inequality involves making comparisons across the entire distribution of income, not just the poor. One
way of doing this is to divide the population into groups, like quintiles, and then calculate what share of income each
group receives. An alternative approach is to draw Lorenz curves, which compare the cumulative income actually
received to a perfectly equal distribution of income. Income inequality in the United States increased substantially
from the late 1970s and early 1980s into the 2000s. The two most common explanations that economists cite are
changes in household structures that have led to more two-earner couples and single-parent families, and the effect of
new information and communications technology on wages.
14.5 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality
Policies that can affect the level of economic inequality include redistribution between rich and poor, making it
easier for people to climb the ladder of opportunity; and estate taxes, which are taxes on inheritances. Pushing too
aggressively for economic equality can run the risk of decreasing economic incentives. However, a moderate push for
economic equality can increase economic output, both through methods like improved education and by building a
base of political support for market forces.
SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS
1. Describe how each of these changes is likely to affect poverty and inequality:
a.
Incomes rise for low-income and high-income workers, but rise more for the high-income earners.
b.
Incomes fall for low-income and high-income workers, but fall more for high-income earners.
2.
Jonathon is a single father with one child. He can work as a server for $6 per hour for up to 1,500 hours per
year. He is eligible for welfare, and so if he does not earn any income, he will receive a total of $10,000 per year.
He can work and still receive government benefits, but for every $1 of income, his welfare stipend is $1 less. Create
a table similar to Table 14.4 that shows Jonathan’s options. Use four columns, the first showing number of hours
to work, the second showing his earnings from work, the third showing the government benefits he will receive,
and the fourth column showing his total income (earnings + government support). Sketch a labor-leisure diagram of
Jonathan’s opportunity set with and without government support.
3. Imagine that the government reworks the welfare policy that was affecting Jonathan in question 1, so that for each
dollar someone like Jonathan earns at work, his government benefits diminish by only 30 cents. Reconstruct the table
from question 1 to account for this change in policy. Draw Jonathan’s labor-leisure opportunity sets, both for before
this welfare program is enacted and after it is enacted.
4. We have discovered that the welfare system discourages recipients from working because the more income they
earn, the less welfare benefits they receive. How does the earned income tax credit attempt to loosen the poverty
trap?
5. How does the TANF attempt to loosen the poverty trap?

The Increasing Value of a College Degree
Working your way through college used to be fairly common in the United States. According to a 2015 study
by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, 40% of college students work 30 hours or more
per week.
At the same time, the cost of college seems to rise every year. The data show that the cost of tuition, fees,
room and board has more than doubled since 1984. Thus, even full time employment may not be enough
to cover college expenses anymore. Working full time at minimum wage--40 hours per week, 52 weeks per
year—earns $15,080 before taxes, which is less than the $19,548 the College Board estimates it cost in 2016
for a year of college at a public university. The result of these costs is that student loan debt topped $1.3 trillion
this year.
Despite these disheartening figures, the value of a bachelor’s degree has never been higher. How do we
explain this? This chapter will tell us.

In a market economy like the United States, income comes from ownership of the means of production: resources or
assets. More precisely, one’s income is a function of two things: the quantity of each resource one owns, and the value
society places on those resources. Recall from the chapter on Production, Costs, and Industry Structure, each
factor of production has an associated factor payment. For the majority of us, the most important resource we own is
our labor. Thus, most of our income is wages, salaries, commissions, tips and other types of labor income. Your labor
income depends on how many hours you have to work and the wage rate an employer will pay you for those hours.
At the same time, some people own real estate, which they can either use themselves or rent out to other users. Some
people have financial assets like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, for which they earn interest, dividends or some
other form of income.
Each of these factor payments, like wages for labor and interest for financial capital, is determined in their respective
factor markets. For the rest of this chapter, we will focus on labor markets, but other factor markets operate similarly.
Later in Chapter 17 we will describe how this works for financial capital.
15.1 | Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets:
Unions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the concept of labor unions, including membership levels and wages
•
Evaluate arguments for and against labor unions
•
Analyze reasons for the decline in U.S. union membership
A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions. A
labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with
workers collectively, rather than as individuals. As such, a labor union operates like a monopoly in a labor market.
We sometimes call negotiations between unions and firms collective bargaining.
The subject of labor unions can be controversial. Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers’ primary line
of defense against efforts by profit-seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits. Critics of labor unions view them
as having a tendency to grab as much as they can in the short term, even if it means injuring workers in the long run
by driving firms into bankruptcy or by blocking the new technologies and production methods that lead to economic
growth. We will start with some facts about union membership in the United States.
Facts about Union Membership and Pay
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, about 10.7% of all U.S. workers belong to unions. Following
are some facts about unions for 2016:
•
11.2% of U.S. male workers belong to unions; 10.2% of female workers do
•
10.5% of white workers, 13% of black workers, and 8.8 % of Hispanic workers belong to unions
•
11.8% of full-time workers and 5.7% of part-time workers are union members
•
5.11% of workers ages 16–24 belong to unions, as do 13.9% of workers ages 45-54
•
Occupations in which relatively high percentages of workers belong to unions are the federal government
(27.4% belong to a union), state government (29.6%), local government (40.3%); transportation and utilities
356
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income

(15.1%); natural resources, construction, and maintenance (16.3%); and production, transportation, and
material moving (13.7%)
•
Occupations that have relatively low percentages of unionized workers are agricultural workers (1.3%),
financial services (2.4%), professional and business services (2.4%), leisure and hospitality (2.7%), and
wholesale and retail trade (4.2%)
In summary, the percentage of workers belonging to a union is higher for men than women; higher for blacks
than for whites or Hispanics; higher for the 45–64 age range; and higher among workers in government and
manufacturing than workers in agriculture or service-oriented jobs. Table 15.1 lists the largest U.S. labor unions and
their membership.

In terms of pay, benefits, and hiring, U.S. unions offer a good news/bad news story. The good news for unions and
their members is that their members earn about 20% more than nonunion workers, even after adjusting for factors
such as years of work experience and education level. The bad news for unions is that the share of U.S. workers who
belong to a labor union has been steadily declining for 50 years, as Figure 15.2 shows. About one-quarter of all U.S.
workers belonged to a union in the mid-1950s, but only 11.1% of U.S. workers are union members today. If you leave
out government workers (which includes teachers in public schools), only 6.6% of the workers employed by private
firms now work for a union.
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
357

Figure 15.2 Percentage of Wage and Salary Workers Who Are Union Members The share of wage and salary
workers who belong to unions rose sharply in the 1930s and 1940s, but has tailed off since then to 10.7% of all
workers in 2016.
The following section analyzes the higher pay union workers receive compared the pay rates for nonunion workers.
The section after that analyzes declining union membership levels. An overview of these two issues will allow us to
discuss many aspects of how unions work.
Higher Wages for Union Workers
How does a union affect wages and employment? Because a union is the sole supplier of labor, it can act like a
monopoly and ask for whatever wage rate it can obtain for its workers. If employers need workers, they have to meet
the union’s wage demand.
What are the limits on how much higher pay union workers can receive? To analyze these questions, let’s consider a
situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union, and no firm is allowed to hire nonunion
labor. If no labor union existed in this market, then equilibrium (E) in the labor market would occur at the intersection
of the demand for labor (D) and the supply of labor (S) as we see in Figure 15.3. This is the same result as we
showed in Figure 14.6 above. The union can, however, threaten that, unless firms agree to the wages they demand,
the workers will strike. As a result, the labor union manages to achieve, through negotiations with the firms, a union
wage of Wu for its members, above what the equilibrium wage would otherwise have been.
358
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

Figure 15.3 Union Wage Negotiations Without a union, the equilibrium at E would have involved the wage We and
the quantity of labor Qe. However, the union is able to use its bargaining power to raise the wage to Wu. The result is
an excess supply of labor for union jobs. That is, a quantity of labor supplied, Qs is greater than firms’ quantity
demanded for labor, Qd.
This labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product, but in this case a union is a
monopoly selling labor to firms. At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they
would have hired in equilibrium. Moreover, an excess supply of workers want union jobs, but firms will not be hiring
for such jobs.
From the union point of view, workers who receive higher wages are better off. However, notice that the quantity
of workers (Qd) hired at the union wage Wu is smaller than the quantity Qe that the firm would have hired at the
original equilibrium wage. A sensible union must recognize that when it pushes up the wage, it also reduces the
firms’ incentive to hire. This situation does not necessarily mean that union workers are fired. Instead, it may be that
when union workers move on to other jobs or retire, they are not always replaced, or perhaps when a firm expands
production, it expands employment somewhat less with a higher union wage than it would have done with the lower
equilibrium wage. Other situations could be that a firm decides to purchase inputs from nonunion producers, rather
than producing them with its own highly paid unionized workers, or perhaps the firm moves or opens a new facility
in a state or country where unions are less powerful.
From the firm’s point of view, the key question is whether union workers’ higher wages are matched by higher
productivity. If so, then the firm can afford to pay the higher union wages and, the demand curve for “unionized” labor
could actually shift to the right. This could reduce the job losses as the equilibrium employment level shifts to the
right and the difference between the equilibrium and the union wages will have been reduced. If worker unionization
does not increase productivity, then the higher union wage will cause lower profits or losses for the firm.
Union workers might have higher productivity than nonunion workers for a number of reasons. First, higher wages
may elicit higher productivity. Second, union workers tend to stay longer at a given job, a trend that reduces the
employer’s costs for training and hiring and results in workers with more years of experience. Many unions also offer
job training and apprenticeship programs.
In addition, firms that are confronted with union demands for higher wages may choose production methods that
involve more physical capital and less labor, resulting in increased labor productivity. Table 15.2 provides an
example. Assume that a firm can produce a home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor and
manufacturing equipment. Say that the firm pays labor $16 an hour (including benefits) and the machines for
manufacturing cost $200 each. Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise cycle will be
lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor and one machine, as the table shows. Now, suppose that a
union negotiates a wage of $20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it makes no difference to the firm whether it
uses more hours of labor and fewer machines or less labor and more machines, although it might prefer to use more
machines and to hire fewer union workers. (After all, machines never threaten to strike—but they do not buy the final
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
359

product or service either.)
In the final column of the table, the wage has risen to $24 an hour. In this case, the firm clearly has an incentive for
using the plan that involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines. If management responds to
union demands for higher wages by investing more in machinery, then union workers can be more productive because
they are working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical nonunion worker. However, the firm
will need to hire fewer workers.

Table 15.2 Three Production Choices to Manufacture a Home Exercise Cycle
In some cases, unions have discouraged the use of labor-saving physical capital equipment—out of the reasonable fear
that new machinery will reduce the number of union jobs. For example, in 2002, the union representing longshoremen
who unload ships and the firms that operate shipping companies and port facilities staged a work stoppage that shut
down the ports on the western coast of the United States. Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping
companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record-keeping and computer-operated cabs for loading
and unloading ships—changes which the union opposed, along with overtime pay. President Obama threatened to
use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947—commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act—where a court can
impose an 80-day “cooling-off period” in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a
work stoppage. Federal mediators were called in, and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate
agreement allowed the new technologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits high for workers. In the
past, presidential use of the Taft-Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative
but, in this case, it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.
In other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies. In one prominent example, during the
1950s and 1960s, the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor-saving machinery in
the mines. The mineworkers’ union realized that over time, the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the
mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became
more productive, and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity.
In fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new technology than nonunion workers, because
the union workers believe that the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas nonunion workers
may be more concerned that the new technology will replace their jobs. In addition, union workers, who typically
have higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and benefit more than non-union workers
from the introduction of new technology. Overall, it is hard to make a definitive case that union workers as a group
are always either more or less welcoming to new technology than are nonunion workers
The Decline in U.S. Union Membership
The proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined dramatically since the early 1950s. Economists have
offered a number of possible explanations:
•
The shift from manufacturing to service industries
•
The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign producers
•
A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws now in place
•
U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for unions to organize workers and expand their
membership

Let’s discuss each of these four explanations in more detail.
A first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S. workers belonging to unions involves the patterns
of job growth in the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy as Figure 15.4 shows. The U.S. economy
had about 15 million manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late 1970s and then declined
to 17 million in 2013. Meanwhile, the number of jobs in service industries and in government combined rose from
35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because over time
unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries, the growth in jobs was not happening where
the unions were. It is interesting to note that government workers comprise several of the biggest unions in the
country, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); the Service
Employees International Union; and the National Education Association. Table 15.3 lists the membership of
each of these unions. Outside of government employees, however, unions have not had great success in organizing
the service sector.
Figure 15.4 The Growth Service Jobs Jobs in services have increased dramatically in the last few decades. Jobs
in government have increased modestly until 1990 and then declined slightly since then. Jobs in manufacturing
peaked in the late 1970s and have declined more than a third since then.
A second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers looks at import competition. Starting in the
1960s, U.S. carmakers and steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European manufacturers. As
sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell. This industry is heavily
unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers, which was 975,000 in 1985, had fallen to
roughly 390,000 by 2015. Import competition not only decreases the employment in sectors where unions were once
strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in those sectors. However, as we have seen, unions that
organize public-sector workers, who are not threatened by import competition, have continued to see growth.
A third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers is that citizens often call on their elected
representatives to pass laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of pensions, and other
issues. Unions offered strong political support for these laws aimed at protecting workers but, in an ironic twist, the
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
361

passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.
These first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all somewhat plausible, but they have a common
problem. Most other developed economies have experienced similar economic and political trends, such as the
shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and increasing government social benefits and regulation of the
workplace. Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their acceptance of unions in the workplace.
The share of the population belonging to unions in other countries is very high compared with the share in the
United States. Table 15.3 shows the proportion of workers in a number of the world’s high-income economies who
belong to unions. The United States is near the bottom, along with France and Spain. The last column shows union
coverage, defined as including those workers whose wages are determined by a union negotiation even if the workers
do not officially belong to the union. In the United States, union membership is almost identical to union coverage.
However, in many countries, the wages of many workers who do not officially belong to a union are still determined
by collective bargaining between unions and firms.

Table 15.3 International Comparisons of Union Membership and Coverage in 2012 (Source, CIA World
Factbook, retrieved from www.cia.gov)
These international differences in union membership suggest a fourth reason for the decline of union membership in
the United States: perhaps U.S. laws are less friendly to the formation of unions than such laws in other countries.
The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S.
unions. The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the National Labor-Management
Relations Act of 1935, which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give
them a fair chance to do so. The U.S. government strongly encouraged forming unions during the early 1940s in the
belief that unions would help to coordinate the all-out production efforts needed during World War II. However, after
World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which gave states the power to allow workers to
opt out of the union in their workplace if they so desired. This law made the legal climate less encouraging to those
seeking to form unions, and union membership levels soon started declining.
The procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to country. For example, the procedures in the
United States and those in Canada are strikingly different. When a group of workers wish to form a union in the
United States, they announce this fact and set an election date when the firm's employees will vote in a secret ballot
on whether to form a union. Supporters of the union lobby for a “yes” vote, and the firm's management lobbies for
a “no” vote—often even hiring outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers to vote “no.” In Canada, by
contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of workers (usually about 60%) sign an official card saying
362
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

that they want a union. There is no separate “election date.” The management of Canadian firms is limited by law in
its ability to lobby against the union. In addition, although it is illegal to discriminate and fire workers based on their
union activity in the United States, the penalties are slight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union activity.
In short, forming unions is easier in Canada—and in many other countries—than in the United States.
In summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many other high-income countries, a difference
that may be due to different legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.

15.2 | Employment Discrimination
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Analyze earnings gaps based on race and gender
•
Explain the impact of discrimination in a competitive market
•
Identify U.S. public policies designed to reduce discrimination
Discrimination involves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior solely because of a factor
such as race, gender, or religion. There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination
in labor markets, which arises if workers with the same skill levels—as measured by education, experience, and
expertise—receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or
gender.
Earnings Gaps by Race and Gender
A possible signal of labor market discrimination is when an employer pays one group less than another. Figure 15.5
shows the average wage of black workers as a ratio of the average wage of white workers and the average wage
of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers. Research by the economists Francine Blau and
Laurence Kahn shows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in the 1970s, but has
declined since the 1980s. According to the U.S. Census, the gap between the earnings of blacks and whites diminished
in the 1970s, but has not changed in 50 years. In both gender and race, an earnings gap remains.
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
363

Figure 15.5 Wage Ratios by Sex and Race The ratio of wages for black workers to white workers rose
substantially in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, but has not changed much since then. The ratio of wages for
female to male workers changed little through the 1970s, but has risen substantially since the 1980s. In both cases, a
gap remains between the average wages of black and white workers and between the average wages of female and
male workers. Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
An earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove that discrimination is occurring in the
labor market. We need to apply the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees) involved. Gender
discrimination in the labor market occurs when employers pay women less than men despite having comparable levels
of education, experience, and expertise. (Read the Clear It Up about the sex-discrimination suit brought against Wal-
Mart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists when employers pay racially diverse employees less
than their coworkers of the majority race despite having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. To
bring a successful gender discrimination lawsuit, a female employee must prove the employer is paying her less than
a male employee who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise,
someone who wants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that the employer pays him or her
less than an employee of another race who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar
expertise.

What was the sex-discrimination case against Wal-Mart?
In one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S. history, 1.2 million female employees of
Wal-Mart claimed that the company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the Supreme
Court threw out the case on the grounds that the group was too large and too diverse to consider the case a
class action suit. Lawyers for the women regrouped and are now suing in smaller groups. Part of the difficulty
for the female employees is that the court said that local managers made pay and promotion decisions that
were not necessarily the company's policies as a whole. Consequently, female Wal-Mart employees in Texas
are arguing that their new suit will challenge the management of a “discrete group of regional district and
store managers.” They claim these managers made biased pay and promotion decisions. However, in 2013,
a federal district court rejected a smaller California class action suit against the company.
On other issues, Wal-Mart made the news again in 2013 when the National Labor Relations Board found Wal-
Mart guilty of illegally penalizing and firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Wal-Mart has
already paid $11.7 million in back wages and compensation damages to women in Kentucky who were denied
jobs due to their sex.
Investigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap
As a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid workforce in substantial numbers in the
mid- to late-twentieth century. By 2014, 58.1% of adult women held jobs while 72.0% of adult men did. Moreover,
along with entering the workforce, women began to ratchet up their education levels. In 1971, 44% of undergraduate
college degrees went to women. By 2014, women received 56% of bachelor’s degrees. In 1970, women received
5.4% of the degrees from law schools and 8.4% of the degrees from medical schools. By 2014, women were receiving
47% of the law degrees and 48.0% of the medical degrees. These gains in education and experience have reduced the
female/male wage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which women have not yet assumed
a substantial share of the positions at the top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.
There are factors that can lower women’s average wages. Women are likely to bear a disproportionately large share
of household responsibilities. A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force for several
years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a result, women in their 30s and 40s are likely, on average,
to have less job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the same education and experience
levels as men are typically paid comparably. However, women with families and children are typically paid about 7%
to 14% less than other women of similar education and work experience. (Meanwhile, married men earn about 10%
to 15% more than single men with comparable education and work experience.)
We possibly could call the different patterns of family responsibilities discrimination, but it is primarily rooted in
America’s social patterns of discrimination, which involve the roles that fathers and mothers play in child-rearing,
rather than discrimination by employers in hiring and salary decisions.

365

Investigating the Black/White Earnings Gap
Blacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century. Until the passage of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker, regardless of the credentials
or experience of that worker. Moreover, blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities, which in turn
meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs. At least one economic study has shown that the 1964
law is partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in black–white earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.
For example, the ratio of total earnings of black male workers to white male workers rose from 62% in 1964 to 75.3%
in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
However, the earnings gap between black and white workers has not changed as much as the earnings gap between
men and women has in the last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to continuing differences
in education levels and to the presence of discrimination. Table 15.4 shows that the percentage of blacks who
complete a four-year college degree remains substantially lower than the percentage of whites who complete college.
According to the U.S. Census, both whites and blacks have higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanics
and lower levels than Asians. The lower average levels of education for black workers surely explain part of the
earnings gap. In fact, black women who have the same levels of education and experience as white women receive, on
average, about the same level of pay. One study shows that white and black college graduates have identical salaries
immediately after college; however, the racial wage gap widens over time, an outcome that suggests the possibility
of continuing discrimination. Another study conducted a field experiment by responding to job advertisements with
fictitious resumes with either very African American sounding names or very white sounding names and found
out that white names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job
opportunities. Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is evidence to support that discrimination
in the housing market is connected to employment discrimination.

How is discrimination in the housing market connected to
employment discrimination?
In a recent study by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department, realtors show black homebuyers
18 percent fewer homes compared to white homebuyers. Realtors show Asians are shown 19 percent fewer
properties. Additionally, Hispanics experience more discrimination in renting apartments and undergo stiffer
366
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income

credit checks than white renters. In a 2012 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the
nonprofit Urban Institute study, Hispanic testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units received
information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven percent fewer units than white
renters. The $9 million study, based on research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant “door
slamming” forms of discrimination are on the decline but that the discrimination that does exist is harder to
detect, and as a result, more difficult to remedy. According to the Chicago Tribune, HUD Secretary Shaun
Donovan, who served in his role from 2009-2014, told reporters, “Just because it’s taken on a hidden form
doesn’t make it any less harmful. You might not be able to move into that community with the good schools.”
The lower levels of education for black workers can also be a result of discrimination—although it may
be pre-labor market discrimination, rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For
example, if discrimination in housing markets causes black families to live clustered together in certain
poorer neighborhoods, then the black children will continue to have lower educational attainment then their
white counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying jobs that require higher levels
of education. Another element to consider is that in the past, when blacks were effectively barred from
many high-paying jobs, obtaining additional education could have seemed somewhat pointless, because the
educational degrees would not pay off. Even though the government has legally abolished labor market
discrimination, it can take some time to establish a culture and a tradition of valuing education highly.
Additionally, a legacy of past discrimination may contribute to an attitude that blacks will have a difficult time
succeeding in academic subjects. In any case, the impact of social discrimination in labor markets is more
complicated than seeking to punish a few bigoted employers.
Competitive Markets and Discrimination
Gary Becker (b. 1930), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992, was one of the first to analyze discrimination
in economic terms. Becker pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some employers to practice
discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with incentives not to discriminate. Given these incentives,
Becker explored the question of why discrimination persists.
If a business is located in an area with a large minority population and refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut into its
own profits. If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on
their productivity, then other profit-seeking employers can hire these workers. In a competitive market, if the business
owners care more about the color of money than about the color of skin, they will have an incentive to make buying,
selling, hiring, and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.
Do not underestimate the power of markets to offer at least a degree of freedom to oppressed groups. In many
countries, cohesive minority groups like Jews and emigrant Chinese have managed to carve out a space for themselves
through their economic activities, despite legal and social discrimination against them. Many immigrants, including
those who come to the United States, have taken advantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves.
However, history teaches that market forces alone are unlikely to eliminate discrimination. After all, discrimination
against African Americans persisted in the market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between President
Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in 1863, and the passage of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964—and has continued since then, too.
Therefore, why does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker sought to explain this persistence.
Discriminatory impulses can emerge at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among customers.
Consider the situation of a manager who is not personally prejudiced, but who has many workers or customers who
are prejudiced. If that manager treats minority groups or women fairly, the manager may find it hurts the morale of
prejudiced co-workers or drives away prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of nondiscrimination could
reduce the firm’s profits. After all, a business firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal norms
is likely to suffer. Market forces alone are unlikely to overwhelm strong social attitudes about discrimination.

Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
367

Public Policies to Reduce Discrimination
A first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal. For example, the Equal Pay
Act of 1963 said that employers must pay men and women who do equal work the same. The Civil Rights Act of 1964
prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or
older. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination.
The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at prohibiting discrimination against women in the workplace
who are planning to get pregnant, are pregnant, or are returning after pregnancy. Passing a law, however, is only part
of the answer, since discrimination by prejudiced employers may be less important than broader social patterns.
These laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A 2007 Department of Labor study compared
salaries of men and women who have similar educational achievement, work experience, and occupation and found
that the gender wage gap is only 5%.
In the case of the earnings gap between blacks and whites (and also between Hispanics and whites), probably the
single largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close the earnings gap would be to reduce the
gap in educational achievement. Part of the answer to this issue involves finding ways to improve the performance of
schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself. In addition, the education gap is unlikely to close unless black
and Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their culture of support for educational achievement.
Affirmative action is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to
minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its limited and not
especially controversial form, means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for
jobs. In its more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required government and companies to hire
a specific number or percentage of minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against state
affirmative action laws. Today, the government applies affirmative action policies only to federal contractors who
have lost a discrimination lawsuit. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces this
type of redress.
An Increasingly Diverse Workforce
Racial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and work force. As Figure 15.6 shows, while the
white Americans comprised 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that whites will
comprise 69% of the U.S. population by 2060. Forecasters predict that the proportion of U.S. citizens who are of
Hispanic background to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition to expected changes in the population, workforce
diversity is increasing as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now moving up the
promotion ladders within their organizations.

Islander. “AIAN” stands for American Indian and Alaska Native. Source: US Department of Commerce
Regarding the future, optimists argue that the growing proportions of minority workers will break down remaining
discriminatory barriers. The economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from traditionally
disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill their potential. Pessimists worry that the social tensions
between men and women and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers will be less productive as a result.
Anti-discrimination policy, at its best, seeks to help society move toward the more optimistic outcome.

15.3 | Immigration
Most Americans would be outraged if a law prevented them from moving to another city or another state. However,
when the conversation turns to crossing national borders and are about other people arriving in the United States, laws
preventing such movement often seem more reasonable. Some of the tensions over immigration stem from worries
over how it might affect a country’s culture, including differences in language, and patterns of family, authority, or
gender relationships. Economics does not have much to say about such cultural issues. Some of the worries about
immigration do, however, have to do with its effects on wages and income levels, and how it affects government taxes
and spending. On those topics, economists have insights and research to offer.
Historical Patterns of Immigration
Supporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns. Those who express concern
about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like Figure 15.7 which shows total inflows of
immigrants decade by decade through the twentieth century. Clearly, the level of immigration has been high and rising
in recent years, reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century. However, those who are
less worried about immigration point out that the high immigration levels of the early twentieth century happened
when total population was much lower. Since the U.S. population roughly tripled during the twentieth century, the
seemingly high levels in immigration in the 1990s and 2000s look relatively smaller when they are divided by the
population.
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
369

Figure 15.7 Immigration Since 1900 The number of immigrants in each decade declined between 1900 and the
1940s, rose sharply through 2009 and started to decline from 2010 to the present. (Source: U.S. Department of
Homeland Security, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2011, Table 1)
From where have the immigrants come? Immigrants from Europe were more than 90% of the total in the first decade
of the twentieth century, but less than 20% of the total by the end of the century. By the 2000s, about half of U.S.
immigration came from the rest of the Americas, especially Mexico, and about a quarter came from various countries
in Asia.
Economic Effects of Immigration
A surge of immigration can affect the economy in a number of different ways. In this section, we will consider how
immigrants might benefit the rest of the economy, how they might affect wage levels, and how they might affect
government spending at the federal and local level.
To understand the economic consequences of immigration, consider the following scenario. Imagine that the
immigrants entering the United States matched the existing U.S. population in age range, education, skill levels,
family size, and occupations. How would immigration of this type affect the rest of the U.S. economy? Immigrants
themselves would be much better off, because their standard of living would be higher in the United States.
Immigrants would contribute to both increased production and increased consumption. Given enough time for
adjustment, the range of jobs performed, income earned, taxes paid, and public services needed would not be much
affected by this kind of immigration. It would be as if the population simply increased a little.
Now, consider the reality of recent immigration to the United States. Immigrants are not identical to the rest of the
U.S. population. About one-third of immigrants over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma. As a result, many
of the recent immigrants end up in jobs like restaurant and hotel work, lawn care, and janitorial work. This kind of
immigration represents a shift to the right in the supply of unskilled labor for a number of jobs, which will lead to
lower wages for these jobs. The middle- and upper-income households that purchase the services of these unskilled
workers will benefit from these lower wages. However, low-skilled U.S. workers who must compete with low-skilled
immigrants for jobs will tend to suffer from immigration.
The difficult policy questions about immigration are not so much about the overall gains to the rest of the economy,
which seem to be real but small in the context of the U.S. economy, as they are about the disruptive effects of
immigration in specific labor markets. One disruptive effect, as we noted, is that immigration weighted toward low-
skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers. A study by Michael S. Clune found that for each
10% rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market, high
school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3%. The effects on wages of low-skill workers are
370
Chapter 15 | Labor Markets and Income
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

not large—perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%. These effects are likely kept low, in part, because of the legal
floor of federal and state minimum wage laws. In addition, immigrants are also thought to contribute to increased
demand for local goods and services which can stimulate the local low skilled labor market. It is also possible that
employers, in the face of abundant low-skill workers may choose production processes which are more labor intensive
than otherwise would have been. These various factors would explain the small negative wage effect that the native
low-skill workers observed as a result of immigration.
Another potential disruptive effect is the impact on state and local government budgets. Many of the costs imposed
by immigrants are costs that arise in state-run programs, like the cost of public schooling and of welfare benefits.
However, many of the taxes that immigrants pay are federal taxes like income taxes and Social Security taxes. Many
immigrants do not own property (such as homes and cars), so they do not pay property taxes, which are one of
the main sources of state and local tax revenue. However, they do pay sales taxes, which are state and local, and
the landlords of property they rent pay property taxes. According to the nonprofit Rand Corporation, the effects of
immigration on taxes are generally positive at the federal level, but they are negative at the state and local levels in
places where there are many low-skilled immigrants.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nber) to obtain more context regarding immigration.
Proposals for Immigration Reform
The Congressional Jordan Commission of the 1990s proposed reducing overall levels of immigration and refocusing
U.S. immigration policy to give priority to immigrants with higher skill levels. In the labor market, focusing on high-
skilled immigrants would help prevent any negative effects on low-skilled workers' wages. For government budgets,
higher-skilled workers find jobs more quickly, earn higher wages, and pay more in taxes. Several other immigration-
friendly countries, notably Canada and Australia, have immigration systems where those with high levels of education
or job skills have a much better chance of obtaining permission to immigrate. For the United States, high tech
companies regularly ask for a more lenient immigration policy to admit a greater quantity of highly skilled workers
under the H1B visa program.
The Obama Administration proposed the so-called “DREAM Act” legislation, which would have offered a path to
citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. Despite bipartisan support, the
legislation failed to pass at the federal level. However, some state legislatures, such as California, have passed their
own Dream Acts.
Between its plans for a border wall, increased deportation of undocumented immigrants, and even reductions in the
number of highly skilled legal H1B immigrants, the Trump Administration has a much less positive approach to
immigration. Most economists, whether conservative or liberal, believe that while immigration harms some domestic
workers, the benefits to the nation exceed the costs. However, given the Trump Administration’s opposition, any
significant immigration reform is likely on hold.

The Increasing Value of a College Degree
The cost of college has increased dramatically in recent decades, causing many college students to take
student loans to afford it. Despite this, the value of a college degree has never been higher. How can we
explain this?
We can estimate the value of a bachelor’s degree as the difference in lifetime earnings between the average
holder of a bachelor’s degree and the average high school graduate. This difference can be nearly $1 million.
College graduates also have a significantly lower unemployment rate than those with lower educational
attainments.
While a college degree holder’s wages have increased somewhat, the major reason for the increase in value
of a bachelor’s degree has been the plummeting value of a high school diploma. In the twenty-first century,
the majority of jobs require at least some post-secondary education. This includes manufacturing jobs that in
the past would have afforded workers a middle class income with only a high school diploma. Those jobs are
increasingly scarce. This phenomenon has also no doubt contributed to the increasing inequality of income
that we observe in the U.S. today. We will discuss that topic next, in Chapter 15.

discrimination
KEY TERMS
active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring, promotion,
or access to education to make up for past discrimination
actions based on the belief that members of a certain group or groups are in some way inferior solely
because of a factor such as race, gender, or religion
KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
15.1 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions
A labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates as a group with employers over compensation and
work conditions. Union workers in the United States are paid more on average than other workers with comparable
education and experience. Thus, either union workers must be more productive to match this higher pay or the higher
pay will lead employers to find ways of hiring fewer union workers than they otherwise would. American union
membership has been falling for decades. Some possible reasons include the shift of jobs to service industries; greater
competition from globalization; the passage of worker-friendly legislation; and U.S. laws that are less favorable to
organizing unions.
15.2 Employment Discrimination
Discrimination occurs in a labor market when employers pay workers with the same economic characteristics, such as
education,experience, and skill, are paid different amounts because of race, gender, religion, age, or disability status.
In the United States, female workers on average earn less than male workers, and black workers on average earn less
than white workers. There is controversy over to which discrimination differences in factors like education and job
experience can explain these earnings gaps. Free markets can allow discrimination to occur, but the threat of a loss of
sales or a loss of productive workers can also create incentives for a firm not to discriminate. An employer can use
a range of public policies to reduce earnings gaps between men and women or between white and other racial/ethnic
groups: requiring equal pay for equal work, and attaining more equal educational outcomes.
15.3 Immigration
The recent level of U.S. immigration is at a historically high level if we measure it in absolute numbers, but not if we
measure it as a share of population. The overall gains to the U.S. economy from immigration are real but relatively
small. However, immigration also causes effects like slightly lower wages for low-skill workers and budget problems
for certain state and local governments.

Insurance
Figure 16.1 Former President Obama’s Health Care Reform The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has
become a controversial topic—one which relates strongly to the topic of this chapter. (Credit: modification of work by
Daniel Borman/Flickr Creative Commons)
What’s the Big Deal with Obamacare?
In August 2009, many members of the U.S. Congress used their summer recess to return to their home
districts and hold town hall-style meetings to discuss President Obama’s proposed changes to the U.S.
healthcare system. This was officially known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) or
as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but was more popularly known as Obamacare. The bill’s opponents’ claims
ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $750 billion to the deficit, to
extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so-called “death panels”
that decide which critically-ill patients receive care and which do not.
Why did people react so strongly? After all, the intent of the law is to make healthcare insurance more
affordable, to allow more people to obtain insurance, and to reduce the costs of healthcare. For each year from
2000 to 2011, these costs grew at least double the rate of inflation. In 2014, healthcare spending accounted for
around 24% of all federal government spending. In the United States, we spend more for our healthcare than
any other high-income nation, yet our health outcomes are worse than comparable high-income countries.
In 2015, over 32 million people in the United States, about 12.8% of the non-elderly adult population, were
without insurance. Even today, however, several years after the Act was signed into law and after the Supreme
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
377

Court mostly upheld it, a 2015 Kaiser Foundation poll found that 43% of likely voters viewed it unfavorably.
Why is this?
The debate over the ACA and healthcare reform could take an entire textbook, but what this chapter will do is
introduce the basics of insurance and the problems insurance companies face. It is these problems, and how
insurance companies respond to them that, in part, explain the ACA.
Introduction to Information, Risk, and Insurance
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information
•
Insurance and Imperfect Information
Every purchase is based on a belief about the satisfaction that the good or service will provide. In turn, these beliefs
are based on the information that the buyer has available. For many products, the information available to the buyer
or the seller is imperfect or unclear, which can either make buyers regret past purchases or avoid making future ones.
This chapter discusses how imperfect and asymmetric information affect markets. The first module of the chapter
discusses how asymmetric information affects markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. When buyers have less
information about the quality of the good (for example, a gemstone) than sellers do, sellers may be tempted to mislead
buyers. If a buyer cannot have at least some confidence in the quality of what he or she is purchasing, then he or she
will be reluctant or unwilling to purchase the products. Thus, we require mechanisms to bridge this information gap,
so buyers and sellers can engage in a transaction.
The second module of the chapter discusses insurance markets, which also face similar problems of imperfect
information. For example, a car insurance company would prefer to sell insurance only to those who are unlikely
to have auto accidents—but it is hard for the firm to identify those perfectly safe drivers. Conversely, car insurance
buyers would like to persuade the auto insurance company that they are safe drivers and should pay only a low price
for coverage. If insurance markets cannot find ways to grapple with these problems of imperfect information, then
even people who have low or average risks of making claims may not be able to purchase insurance. The chapter
on financial markets (markets for stocks and bonds) will show that the problems of imperfect information can be
especially poignant. We cannot eliminate imperfect information, but we can often manage it.
16.1 | The Problem of Imperfect Information and
Asymmetric Information
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Analyze the impact of both imperfect information and asymmetric information
•
Evaluate the role of advertisements in creating imperfect information
•
Identify ways to reduce the risk of imperfect information
•
Explain how imperfect information can affect price, quantity, and quality
Consider a purchase that many people make at important times in their lives: buying expensive jewelry. In May 1994,
celebrity psychologist Doree Lynn bought an expensive ring from a jeweler in Washington, D.C., which included
an emerald that cost $14,500. Several years later, the emerald fractured. Lynn took it to another jeweler who found
that cracks in the emerald had been filled with an epoxy resin. Lynn sued the original jeweler in 1997 for selling her
a treated emerald without telling her, and won. The case publicized a number of little-known facts about precious
stones. Most emeralds have internal flaws, and so they are soaked in clear oil or an epoxy resin to hide the flaws and
make the color more deep and clear. Clear oil can leak out over time, and epoxy resin can discolor with age or heat.
However, using clear oil or epoxy to “fill” emeralds is completely legal, as long as it is disclosed.
After Doree Lynn’s lawsuit, the NBC news show “Dateline” bought emeralds at four prominent jewelry stores in New
378
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance

York City in 1997. All the sales clerks at these stores, unaware that they were being recorded on a hidden camera,
said the stones were untreated. When the emeralds were tested at a laboratory, however, technicians discovered they
had all been treated with oil or epoxy. Emeralds are not the only gemstones that are treated. Diamonds, topaz, and
tourmaline are also often irradiated to enhance colors. The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be
revealed, but often sellers do not disclose this. As such, many buyers face a situation of asymmetric information,
where two parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information (one party knows
much more than the other).
Many economic transactions occur in a situation of imperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller, or
both, are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying and selling. Also, one may characterize
the transaction as asymmetric information, in which one party has more information than the other regarding the
economic transaction. Let’s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in
goods, labor, and financial capital markets. The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices
or quantities of products sold. However, buyers and sellers also have incentives to create mechanisms that will allow
them to make mutually beneficial transactions even in the face of imperfect information.
If you are unclear about the difference between asymmetric information and imperfect information, read the following
Clear It Up feature.
What
is
the
difference
between
imperfect
and
asymmetric
information?
For a market to reach equilibrium sellers and buyers must have full information about the product’s price and
quality. If there is limited information, then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make
poor decisions.
Imperfect information refers to the situation where buyers and/or sellers do not have all of the necessary
information to make an informed decision about the product's price or quality. The term imperfect information
simply means that the buyers and/or sellers do not have all the information necessary to make an informed
decision. Asymmetric information is the condition where one party, either the buyer or the seller, has more
information about the product's quality or price than the other party. In either case (imperfect or asymmetric
information) buyers or sellers need remedies to make more informed decisions.
“Lemons” and Other Examples of Imperfect Information
Consider Marvin, who is trying to decide whether to buy a used car. Let’s assume that Marvin is truly clueless about
what happens inside a car’s engine. He is willing to do some background research, like reading Consumer Reports or
checking websites that offer information about used cars makes and models and what they should cost. He might pay
a mechanic to inspect the car. Even after devoting some money and time collecting information, however, Marvin still
cannot be absolutely sure that he is buying a high-quality used car. He knows that he might buy the car, drive it home,
and use it for a few weeks before discovering that car is a “lemon,” which is slang for a defective product (especially
a car).
Imagine that Marvin shops for a used car and finds two that look very similar in terms of mileage, exterior
appearances, and age. One car costs $4,000, while the other car costs $4,600. Which car should Marvin buy?
If Marvin were choosing in a world of perfect information, the answer would be simple: he should buy the cheaper
car. However, Marvin is operating in a world of imperfect information, where the sellers likely know more about the
car’s problems than he does, and have an incentive to hide the information. After all, the more problems the sellers
disclose, the lower the car’s selling price.
What should Marvin do? First, he needs to understand that even with imperfect information, prices still reflect
information. Typically, used cars are more expensive on some dealer lots because the dealers have a trustworthy
reputation to uphold. Those dealers try to fix problems that may not be obvious to their customers, in order to create
good word of mouth about their vehicles’ long term reliability. The short term benefits of selling their customers a
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
379

“lemon” could cause a quick collapse in the dealer’s reputation and a loss of long term profits. On other lots that are
less well-established, one can find cheaper used cars, but the buyer takes on more risk when a dealer’s reputation
has little at stake. The cheapest cars of all often appear on Craigslist, where the individual seller has no reputation to
defend. In sum, cheaper prices do carry more risk, so Marvin should balance his appetite for risk versus the potential
headaches of many more unanticipated trips to the repair shop.
Similar problems with imperfect information arise in labor and financial capital markets. Consider Greta, who is
applying for a job. Her potential employer, like the used car buyer, is concerned about ending up with a “lemon”—in
this case a poor quality employee. The employer will collect information about Greta’s academic and work history.
In the end, however, a degree of uncertainty will inevitably remain regarding Greta’s abilities, which are hard to
demonstrate without actually observing her on the job. How can a potential employer screen for certain attributes,
such as motivation, timeliness, and ability to get along with others? Employers often look to trade schools and
colleges to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate unless he has a degree and,
sometimes, a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other
accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Employers may also seek references for insights into
key attributes such as energy level and work ethic.
How Imperfect Information Can Affect Equilibrium Price and Quantity
The presence of imperfect information can discourage both buyers and sellers from participating in the market. Buyers
may become reluctant to participate because they cannot determine the product's quality. Sellers of high-quality or
medium-quality goods may be reluctant to participate, because it is difficult to demonstrate the quality of their goods
to buyers—and since buyers cannot determine which goods have higher quality, they are likely to be unwilling to pay
a higher price for such goods.
Economists sometimes refer to a market with few buyers and few sellers as a thin market. By contrast, they call a
market with many buyers and sellers a thick market. When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are
discouraged from participating, markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers
attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price.
When Price Mixes with Imperfect Information about Quality
A buyer confronted with imperfect information will often believe that the price reveals something about the product's
quality. For example, a buyer may assume that a gemstone or a used car that costs more must be of higher quality,
even though the buyer is not an expert on gemstones. Think of the expensive restaurant where the food must be good
because it is so expensive or the shop where the clothes must be stylish because they cost so much, or the gallery
where the art must be great, because the price tags are high. If you are hiring a lawyer, you might assume that a lawyer
who charges $400 per hour must be better than a lawyer who charges $150 per hour. In these cases, price can act as a
signal of quality.
When buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the products' quality, then markets may have trouble
reaching an equilibrium price and quantity. Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that
do not seem to be selling, and so the dealer decides to cut the car prices to sell a greater quantity. In a market with
imperfect information, many buyers may assume that the lower price implies low-quality cars. As a result, the lower
price may not attract more customers. Conversely, a dealer who raises prices may find that customers assume that
the higher price means that cars are of higher quality. As a result of raising prices, the dealer might sell more cars.
(Whether or not consumers always behave rationally, as an economist would see it, is the subject of the following
Clear It Up feature.)
The idea that higher prices might cause a greater quantity demanded and that lower prices might cause a lower
quantity demanded runs exactly counter to the basic model of demand and supply (as we outlined in the Demand
and Supply chapter). These contrary effects, however, will reach natural limits. At some point, if the price is
high enough, the quantity demanded will decline. Conversely, when the price declines far enough, buyers will
increasingly find value even if the quality is lower. In addition, information eventually becomes more widely known.
An overpriced restaurant that charges more than the quality of its food is worth to many buyers will not last forever.

Is consumer behavior rational?
There is much human behavior that mainstream economists have tended to call “irrational” since it is
consistently at odds with economists’ utility maximizing models. The typical response is for economists to
brush these behaviors aside and call them “anomalies” or unexplained quirks.
“If only you knew more economics, you would not be so irrational,” is what many mainstream economists seem
to be saying. A group known as behavioral economists has challenged this notion, because so much of this
so-called “quirky” behavior is extremely common among us. For example, a conventional economist would
say that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also received an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly
neutral. After all, –$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral
economists have conducted research that shows many people will feel some negative emotion—anger or
frustration—after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. Economists
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 Econometrica paper called this "loss aversion", where
a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us. This has implications for investing, as people tend
to “overplay” the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains.
Behavioral economics also tries to explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions in the presence of
different situations, or how they "frame" the decision. We outline a popular example here: Imagine you have
the opportunity to buy an alarm clock for $20 in Store A. Across the street, you learn, is the exact same clock
at Store B for $10. You might say it is worth your time—a five-minute walk—to save $10. Now, take a different
example: You are in Store A buying a $300 phone. Five minutes away, at Store B, the same phone is $290.
You again save $10 by taking a five-minute walk. Do you do it?
Surprisingly, it is likely that you would not. Mainstream economists would say “$10 is $10” and that it would be
irrational to make a five minute walk for $10 in one case and not the other. However, behavioral economists
have pointed out that most of us evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point—here the cost of the
product—and think of gains and losses as percentages rather than using actual savings.
Which view is right? Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least shed a light on trying
to describe and explain systematic behavior which some previously had dismissed as irrational. If most of us
are engaged in some “irrational behavior,” perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in
the first place.
Mechanisms to Reduce the Risk of Imperfect Information
If you were selling a good like emeralds or used cars where imperfect information is likely to be a problem, how
could you reassure possible buyers? If you were buying a good where imperfect information is a problem, what would
it take to reassure you? Buyers and sellers in the goods market rely on reputation as well as guarantees, warrantees,
and service contracts to assure product quality. The labor market uses occupational licenses and certifications to
assure competency, while the financial capital market uses cosigners and collateral as insurance against unforeseen,
detrimental events.
In the goods market, the seller might offer a money-back guarantee, an agreement that functions as a promise of
quality. This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail-order catalogs or over
the web, whose customers cannot see the actual products, because it encourages people to buy something even if they
are not certain they want to keep it.
L.L. Bean started using money-back-guarantees in 1911, when the founder stitched waterproof shoe rubbers together
with leather shoe tops, and sold them as hunting shoes. He guaranteed satisfaction. However, the stitching came apart
and, out of the first batch of 100 pairs that were sold, customers returned 90 pairs. L.L. Bean took out a bank loan,
repaired all of the shoes, and replaced them. The L.L. Bean reputation for customer satisfaction began to spread.
Many firms today offer money-back-guarantees for a few weeks or months, but L.L. Bean offers a complete money-
back guarantee. Customers can always return anything they have bought from L.L. Bean, no matter how many years
later or what condition the product is in, for a full money-back guarantee.
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
381

L.L. Bean has very few stores. Instead, most of its sales are made by mail, telephone, or, now, through their website.
For this kind of firm, imperfect information may be an especially difficult problem, because customers cannot see
and touch what they are buying. A combination of a money-back guarantee and a reputation for quality can help for
a mail-order firm to flourish.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/guarantee) to read about the origin of Eddie Bauer’s 100%
customer satisfaction guarantee.
Sellers may offer a warranty, which is a promise to fix or replace the good, at least for a certain time period. The
seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a service contract, where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller
agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period. Service contracts are often an option for buyers of large
purchases such as cars, appliances and even houses.
Guarantees, warranties, and service contracts are examples of explicit reassurance that sellers provide. In many cases,
firms also offer unstated guarantees. For example, some movie theaters might refund the ticket cost to a customer
who walks out complaining about the show. Likewise, while restaurants do not generally advertise a money-back
guarantee or exchange policies, many restaurants allow customers to exchange one dish for another or reduce the
price of the bill if the customer is not satisfied.
The rationale for these policies is that firms want repeat customers, who in turn will recommend the business to others.
As such, establishing a good reputation is of paramount importance. When buyers know that a firm is concerned about
its reputation, they are less likely to worry about receiving a poor-quality product. For example, a well-established
grocery store with a good reputation can often charge a higher price than a temporary stand at a local farmer’s market,
where the buyer may never see the seller again.
Sellers of labor provide information through resumes, recommendations, school transcripts, and examples of their
work. The labor market also uses occupational licenses to establish quality in the labor market. Occupational
licenses, which government agencies typically issue, show that a worker has completed a certain type of education
or passed a certain test. Some of the professionals who must hold a license are doctors, teachers, nurses, engineers,
accountants, and lawyers. In addition, most states require a license to work as a barber, an embalmer, a dietitian, a
massage therapist, a hearing aid dealer, a counselor, an insurance agent, and a real estate broker. Some other jobs
require a license in only one state. Minnesota requires a state license to be a field archeologist. North Dakota has a
state license for bait retailers. In Louisiana, one needs a state license to be a “stress analyst” and California requires
a state license to be a furniture upholsterer. According to a 2013 study from the University of Chicago, about 29% of
U.S. workers have jobs that require occupational licenses.
Occupational licenses have their downside as well, as they represent a barrier to entry to certain industries. This makes
it more difficult for new entrants to compete with incumbents, which can lead to higher prices and less consumer
choice. In occupations that require licenses, the government has decided that the additional information provided by
licenses outweighs the negative effect on competition.

Are advertisers allowed to benefit from imperfect information?
Many advertisements seem full of imperfect information—at least by what they imply. Driving a certain car,
drinking a particular soda, or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun
automatically, if at all. The government rules on advertising, enforced by the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a
product. They, however, also demand that if one presents a claim as a fact, it must be true.
Legally, deceptive advertising dates back to the 1950s when Colgate-Palmolive created a television
advertisement that seemed to show Rapid Shave shaving cream being spread on sandpaper and then the
sand was shaved off the sandpaper. What the television advertisement actually showed was sand sprinkled
on Plexiglas—without glue—and then scraped aside by the razor.
In the 1960s, in magazine advertisements for Campbell’s vegetable soup, the company was having problems
getting an appetizing soup picture, because the vegetables kept sinking. To remedy this, they filled a bowl with
marbles and poured the soup over the top, so that the bowl appeared to be crammed with vegetables.
In the late 1980s, the Volvo Company filmed a television advertisement that showed a monster truck driving
over cars, crunching their roofs—all except for the Volvo, which did not crush. However, the FTC found in
1991 that the Volvo's roof from the filming had been reinforced with an extra steel framework, while they cut
the roof supports on the other car brands.
The Wonder Bread Company ran television advertisements featuring “Professor Wonder,” who said that
because Wonder Bread contained extra calcium, it would help children’s minds work better and improve their
memory. The FTC objected, and in 2002 the company agreed to stop running the advertisements.
As we can see in each of these cases, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) often checks factual claims about
the product’s performance, at least to some extent. Language and images that are exaggerated or ambiguous,
but not actually false, are allowed in advertising. Untrue “facts” are not permitted. In any case, an old Latin
saying applies when watching advertisements: Caveat emptor—that is, “let the buyer beware.”
On the buyer’s side of the labor market, a standard precaution against hiring a “lemon” of an employee is to specify
that the first few months of employment are officially a trial or probationary period, and that the employer can dismiss
the worker for any reason or no reason after that time. Sometimes workers also receive lower pay during this trial
period.
In the financial capital market, before a bank makes a loan, it requires a prospective borrower to fill out forms
regarding incomes sources. In addition, the bank conducts a credit check on the individual’s past borrowing. Another
approach is to require a cosigner on a loan; that is, another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all
of the money if the original borrower does not do so. Another approach is to require collateral, often property or
equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if borrower does not repay the loan.
Buyers of goods and services cannot possibly become experts in evaluating the quality of gemstones, used cars,
lawyers, and everything else they buy. Employers and lenders cannot be perfectly omniscient about whether possible
workers will turn out well or potential borrowers will repay loans on time. However, the mechanisms that we
mentioned above can reduce the risks associated with imperfect information so that the buyer and seller are willing to
proceed.

Insurance is a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant detrimental
financial effect. Generally, households or firms with insurance make regular payments, called premiums. The
insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of
people. Members of the group who then suffer a specified bad experience receive payments from this pool of money.
Many people have several kinds of insurance: health insurance that pays when they receive medical care; car
insurance that pays if their car is in an automobile accident; house or renter’s insurance that pays for stolen
possessions or items damaged by fire; and life insurance, which pays for the family if the insured individual dies.
Table 16.1 lists a set of insurance markets.

Table 16.1 Some Insurance Markets
All insurance involves imperfect information in both an obvious way and in a deeper way. At an obvious level, we
cannot predict future events with certainty. For example, we cannot know with certainty who will have a car accident,
become ill, die, or have his home robbed in the next year. Imperfect information also applies to estimating the risk
that something will happen to any individual. It is difficult for an insurance company to estimate the risk that, say, a
particular 20-year-old male driver from New York City will have an accident, because even within that group, some
drivers will drive more safely than others. Thus, adverse events occur out of a combination of people’s characteristics
and choices that make the risks higher or lower and then the good or bad luck of what actually happens.
How Insurance Works
A simplified example of automobile insurance might work this way. Suppose we divide a group of 100 drivers into
three groups. In a given year, 60 of those people have only a few door dings or chipped paint, which costs $100 each.
Another 30 of the drivers have medium-sized accidents that cost an average of $1,000 in damages, and 10 of the
drivers have large accidents that cost $15,000 in damages. For the moment, let’s imagine that at the beginning of any
year, there is no way of identifying the drivers who are low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk. The total damage incurred
by car accidents in this group of 100 drivers will be $186,000, that is:
384
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

Total damage  = (60 × $100) + (30 × $1,000) + (10 × $15,000)
 = $6,000 + $30,000 + $150,000
 = $186,000
If each of the 100 drivers pays a $1,860 premium each year, the insurance company will collect the $186,000 that is
needed to cover the costs of the accidents that occur.
Since insurance companies have such a large number of clients, they are able to negotiate with health care and other
service providers for lower rates than the individual would be able to get, thus increasing the benefit to consumers of
becoming insured and saving the insurance company itself money when it pays out claims.
Insurance companies receive income, as Figure 16.2 shows, from insurance premiums and investment income. The
companies derive income from investing the funds that insurance companies received in the past but did not pay out
as insurance claims in prior years. The insurance company receives a rate of return from investing these funds or
reserves. The companies typically invest in fairly safe, liquid (easy to convert into cash) investments, as the insurance
companies need to be able to readily access these funds when a major disaster strikes.
Figure 16.2 An Insurance Company: What Comes In, What Goes Out
Money flows into an insurance company
through premiums and investments and out through the payment of claims and operating expenses.
Government and Social Insurance
Federal and state governments run a number of insurance programs. Some of the programs look much like private
insurance, in the sense that the members of a group make steady payments into a fund, and those in the group who
suffer an adverse experience receive payments. Other programs protect against risk, but without an explicit fund set
up. Following are some examples.
•
Unemployment insurance: Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance, which
goes into a fund to pay benefits to workers who lose their jobs and do not find new jobs, for a period of time,
usually up to six months.
•
Pension insurance: Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small
fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, which pays
at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and cannot pay the pensions it has
promised.
•
Deposit insurance: Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, which goes into a fund that pays depositors the value of their bank deposits up to
$250,000 (the amount was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in 2008) if the bank should go bankrupt.
•
Workman’s compensation insurance: Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries
that they pay into funds, typically run at the state level, that pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on
the job.
•
Retirement insurance: All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare,
which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are not
literally “insurance” in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits. They
function like insurance, however, in the sense that individuals make regular payments into the programs today
in exchange for benefits they will receive in the case of a later event—either becoming old or becoming sick
when old. A name for such programs is “social insurance.”
The major additional costs to insurance companies, other than the payment of claims, are the costs of running a
business: the administrative costs of hiring workers, administering accounts, and processing insurance claims. For
most insurance companies, the insurance premiums coming in and the claims payments going out are much larger
than the amounts earned by investing money or the administrative costs.
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
385

Thus, while factors like investment income earned on reserves, administrative costs, and groups with different risks
complicate the overall picture, a fundamental law of insurance must hold true: The average person’s payments into
insurance over time must cover 1) the average person’s claims, 2) the costs of running the company, and 3) leave
room for the firm’s profits.
Risk Groups and Actuarial Fairness
Not all of those who purchase insurance face the same risks. Some people may be more likely, because of genetics or
personal habits, to fall sick with certain diseases. Some people may live in an area where car theft or home robbery
is more likely than in other areas. Some drivers are safer than others. We can define a risk group can be defined as a
group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring.
Insurance companies often classify people into risk groups, and charge lower premiums to those with lower risks. If
people are not separated into risk groups, then those with low risk must pay for those with high risks. In the simple
example of how car insurance works, 60 drivers had very low damage of $100 each, 30 drivers had medium-sized
accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. If all 100 of these drivers
pay the same $1,860, then those with low damages are in effect paying for those with high damages.
If it is possible to classify drivers according to risk group, then the insurance company can charge each group
according to its expected losses. For example, the insurance company might charge the 60 drivers who seem safest of
all $100 apiece, which is the average value of the damages they cause. Then the intermediate group could pay $1,000
apiece and the high-cost group $15,000 each. When the level of insurance premiums that someone pays is equal to
the amount that an average person in that risk group would collect in insurance payments, the level of insurance is
said to be “actuarially fair.”
Classifying people into risk groups can be controversial. For example, if someone had a major automobile accident
last year, should the insurance company classify that person as a high-risk driver who is likely to have similar
accidents in the future, or as a low-risk driver who was just extremely unlucky? The driver is likely to claim to be
low-risk, and thus someone who should be in a risk group with those who pay low insurance premiums in the future.
The insurance company is likely to believe that, on average, having a major accident is a signal of being a high-risk
driver, and thus try to charge this driver higher insurance premiums. The next two sections discuss the two major
problems of imperfect information in insurance markets—called moral hazard and adverse selection. Both problems
arise from attempts to categorize those purchasing insurance into risk groups.
The Moral Hazard Problem
Moral hazard refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not
have insurance. For example, if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor, you may be less
likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor’s visit. If you have car insurance, you
will worry less about driving or parking your car in ways that make it more likely to get dented. In another example,
a business without insurance might install absolute top-level security and fire sprinkler systems to guard against theft
and fire. If it is insured, that same business might only install a minimum level of security and fire sprinkler systems.
We cannot eliminate moral hazard, but insurance companies have some ways of reducing its effect. Investigations to
prevent insurance fraud are one way of reducing the extreme cases of moral hazard. Insurance companies can also
monitor certain kinds of behavior. To return to the example from above, they might offer a business a lower rate
on property insurance if the business installs a top-level security and fire sprinkler system and has those systems
inspected once a year.
Another method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs. For example,
insurance policies often have deductibles, which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of his
or her own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying. For example, auto insurance might pay for all losses
greater than $500. Health insurance policies often have a copayment, in which the policyholder must pay a small
amount. For example, a person might have to pay $20 for each doctor visit, and the insurance company would cover
the rest. Another method of cost sharing is coinsurance, which means that the insurance company covers a certain
percentage of the cost. For example, insurance might pay for 80% of the costs of repairing a home after a fire, but the
homeowner would pay the other 20%.
All of these forms of cost sharing discourage moral hazard, because people know that they will have to pay something
out of their own pocket when they make an insurance claim. The effect can be powerful. One prominent study found
that when people face moderate deductibles and copayments for their health insurance, they consume about one-third
386
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance

less in medical care than people who have complete insurance and do not pay anything out of pocket, presumably
because deductibles and copayments reduce the level of moral hazard. However, those who consumed less health care
did not seem to have any difference in health status.
A final way of reducing moral hazard, which is especially applicable to health care, is to focus on healthcare provider
incentives of providers rather than consumers. Traditionally, most health care in the United States has been provided
on a fee-for-service basis, which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid
more if they provide additional services. However, in the last decade or so, the structure of healthcare provision has
shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A health maintenance organization (HMO)
provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan—regardless of how many services
are provided. In this case, a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care, but the healthcare provider,
which is receiving only a fixed payment, has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity
of care provided—as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later. Today, many doctors are
paid with some combination of managed care and fee-for-service; that is, a flat amount per patient, but with additional
payments for the treatment of certain health conditions.
Imperfect information is the cause of the moral hazard problem. If an insurance company had perfect information on
risk, it could simply raise its premiums every time an insured party engages in riskier behavior. However, an insurance
company cannot monitor all the risks that people take all the time and so, even with various checks and cost sharing,
moral hazard will remain a problem.

care and behavioral economics.
The Adverse Selection Problem
Adverse selection refers to the problem in which insurance buyers have more information about whether they
are high-risk or low-risk than the insurance company does. This creates an asymmetric information problem for
the insurance company because buyers who are high-risk tend to want to buy more insurance, without letting the
insurance company know about their higher risk. For example, someone purchasing health insurance or life insurance
probably knows more about their family’s health history than an insurer can reasonably find out even with a costly
investigation. Someone purchasing car insurance may know that he or she are a high-risk driver who has not yet had
a major accident—but it is hard for the insurance company to collect information about how people actually drive.
To understand how adverse selection can strangle an insurance market, recall the situation of 100 drivers who are
buying automobile insurance, where 60 drivers had very low damages of $100 each, 30 drivers had medium-sized
accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. That would equal
$186,000 in total payouts by the insurance company. Imagine that, while the insurance company knows the overall
size of the losses, it cannot identify the high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk drivers. However, the drivers themselves
know their risk groups. Since there is asymmetric information between the insurance company and the drivers, the
insurance company would likely set the price of insurance at $1,860 per year, to cover the average loss (not including
the cost of overhead and profit). The result is that those with low risks of only $100 will likely decide not to buy
insurance; after all, it makes no sense for them to pay $1,860 per year when they are likely only to experience losses of
$100. Those with medium risks of a $1,000 accident will not buy insurance either. Therefore, the insurance company
ends up only selling insurance for $1,860 to high-risk drivers who will average $15,000 in claims apiece, and as
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
387

a consequence, the insurance company ends up losing considerable money. If the insurance company tries to raise
its premiums to cover the losses of those with high risks, then those with low or medium risks will be even more
discouraged from buying insurance.
Rather than face such a situation of adverse selection, the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance in this
market at all. If an insurance market is to exist, then one of two things must happen. First, the insurance company
might find some way of separating insurance buyers into risk groups with some degree of accuracy and charging them
accordingly, which in practice often means that the insurance company tries not to sell insurance to those who may
pose high risks. Another scenario is that those with low risks must buy insurance, even if they have to pay more than
the actuarially fair amount for their risk group. The notion that people can be required to purchase insurance raises
the issue of government laws and regulations that influence the insurance industry.
U.S. Health Care in an International Context
The United States is the only high-income country in the world where private firms pay and provide for most health
insurance. Greater government involvement in the provision of health insurance is one possible way of addressing
moral hazard and adverse selection problems.
The moral hazard problem with health insurance is that when people have insurance, they will demand higher
quantities of health care. In the United States, private healthcare insurance tends to encourage an ever-greater demand
for healthcare services, which healthcare providers are happy to fulfill. Table 16.2 shows that on a per-person
basis, U.S. healthcare spending towers above healthcare spending of other countries. Note that while healthcare
expenditures in the United States are far higher than healthcare expenditures in other countries, the health outcomes
in the United States, as measured by life expectancy and lower rates of childhood mortality, tend to be lower. Health
outcomes, however, may not be significantly affected by healthcare expenditures. Many studies have shown that a
country’s health is more closely related to diet, exercise, and genetic factors than to healthcare expenditure. This fact
further emphasizes that the United States is spending very large amounts on medical care with little obvious health
gain.
In the U.S. health insurance market, the main way of solving this adverse selection problem is that health insurance is
often sold through groups based on place of employment, or, under The Affordable Care Act, from a state government
sponsored health exchange market. From an insurance company’s point of view, selling insurance through an
employer mixes together a group of people—some with high risks of future health problems and some with lower
risks—and thus reduces the insurance firm’s fear of attracting only those who have high risks. However, many small
companies do not provide health insurance to their employees, and many lower-paying jobs do not include health
insurance. Even after we take into account all U.S. government programs that provide health insurance for the elderly
and the poor, approximately 32 million Americans were without health insurance in 2015. While a government-
controlled system can avoid the adverse selection problem entirely by providing at least basic health insurance for
all, another option is to mandate that all Americans buy health insurance from some provider by preventing providers
from denying individuals based on preexisting conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act adopted
this approach, which we will discuss later on in this chapter.

At its best, the largely private U.S. system of health insurance and healthcare delivery provides an extraordinarily high
quality of care, along with generating a seemingly endless parade of life-saving innovations. However, the system
also struggles to control its high costs and to provide basic medical care to all. Other countries have lower costs and
more equal access, but they often struggle to provide rapid access to health care and to offer the near-miracles of
the most up-to-date medical care. The challenge is a healthcare system that strikes the right balance between quality,
access, and cost.
Government Regulation of Insurance
The U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level. Since 1871 there has been a National Association
of Insurance Commissioners that brings together these state regulators to exchange information and strategies. The
state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things: to keep the price of insurance low and to ensure
that everyone has insurance. These goals, however, can conflict with each other and also become easily entangled in
politics.
If insurance premiums are set at actuarially fair levels, so that people end up paying an amount that accurately reflects
their risk group, certain people will end up paying considerable amounts. For example, if health insurance companies
were trying to cover people who already have a chronic disease like AIDS, or who were elderly, they would charge
these groups very high premiums for health insurance, because their expected health care costs are quite high. Women
in the age bracket 18–44 consume, on average, about 65% more in health care spending than men. Young male drivers
have more car accidents than young female drivers. Thus, actuarially fair insurance would tend to charge young men
much more for car insurance than young women. Because people in high-risk groups would find themselves charged
so heavily for insurance, they might choose not to buy insurance at all.
State insurance regulators have sometimes reacted by passing rules that attempt to set low premiums for insurance.
Over time, however, the fundamental law of insurance must hold: the average amount individuals receive cannot
exceed the average amount paid in premiums. When rules are passed to keep premiums low, insurance companies try
to avoid insuring any high-risk or even medium-risk parties. If a state legislature passes strict rules requiring insurance
companies to sell to everyone at low prices, the insurance companies always have the option of withdrawing from
doing business in that state. For example, the insurance regulators in New Jersey are well-known for attempting to
keep auto insurance premiums low, and more than 20 different insurance companies stopped doing business in the
state in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Similarly, in 2009, State Farm announced that it was withdrawing from selling
property insurance in Florida.
In short, government regulators cannot force companies to charge low prices and provide high levels of insurance
coverage—and thus take losses—for a sustained period of time. If insurance premiums are set below the actuarially
fair level for a certain group, some other group will have to make up the difference. There are two other groups who
can make up the difference: taxpayers or other insurance buyers.
In some industries, the U.S. government has decided free markets will not provide insurance at an affordable price,
and so the government pays for it directly. For example, private health insurance is too expensive for many people
whose incomes are too low. To combat this, the U.S. government, together with the states, runs the Medicaid program,
which provides health care to those with low incomes. Private health insurance also does not work well for the elderly,
because their average health care costs can be very high. Thus, the U.S. government started the Medicare program,
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance
389

which provides health insurance to all those over age 65. Other government-funded health-care programs are aimed
at military veterans, as an added benefit, and children in families with relatively low incomes.
Another common government intervention in insurance markets is to require that everyone buy certain kinds of
insurance. For example, most states legally require car owners to buy auto insurance. Likewise, when a bank loans
someone money to buy a home, the person is typically required to have homeowner’s insurance, which protects
against fire and other physical damage (like hailstorms) to the home. A legal requirement that everyone must buy
insurance means that insurance companies do not need to worry that those with low risks will avoid buying insurance.
Since insurance companies do not need to fear adverse selection, they can set their prices based on an average for
the market, and those with lower risks will, to some extent, end up subsidizing those with higher risks. However,
even when laws are passed requiring people to purchase insurance, insurance companies cannot be compelled to sell
insurance to everyone who asks—at least not at low cost. Thus, insurance companies will still try to avoid selling
insurance to those with high risks whenever possible.
The government cannot pass laws that make the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection disappear, but the
government can make political decisions that certain groups should have insurance, even though the private market
would not otherwise provide that insurance. Also, the government can impose the costs of that decision on taxpayers
or on other buyers of insurance.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In March of 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). The
government started to phase in this highly contentious law over time starting in October of 2013. The goal of the act
is to bring the United States closer to universal coverage. Some of the key features of the plan include:
•
Individual mandate: All individuals, who do not receive health care through their employer or through a
government program (for example, Medicare), are required to have health insurance or pay a fine. The
individual mandate's goal was to reduce the adverse selection problem and keep prices down by requiring all
consumers—even the healthiest ones—to have health insurance. Without the need to guard against adverse
selection (whereby only the riskiest consumers buy insurance) by raising prices, health insurance companies
could provide more reasonable plans to their customers.
•
Each state is required to have health insurance exchanges, or utilize the federal exchange, whereby insurance
companies compete for business. The goal of the exchanges is to improve competition in the market for health
insurance.
•
Employer mandate: All employers with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to their
employees.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is funded through additional taxes that include:
•
Increasing the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent and adding a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high income
taxpayers.
•
Charging an annual fee on health insurance providers.
•
Imposing other taxes such as a 2.3% tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.
Many people and politicians, including Donald Trump, have sought to overturn the bill. Those who oppose the bill
believe it violates an individual’s right to choose whether to have insurance or not. In 2012, a number of states
challenged the law on the basis that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional. In June 2012, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled in a 5–4 decision that the individual mandate is actually a tax, so it is constitutional as the federal
government has the right to tax the populace.
What’s the Big Deal with Obamacare?
What is it that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will actually do? To begin with, we should note that it is a
massively complex law, with a large number of parts, some of which the Obama administration implemented
immediately, and others that the government is supposed to phase in every year from 2013 through 2020.
390
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance

Three of these parts are coverage for the uninsured—those without health insurance, coverage for individuals
with preexisting conditions, and the so-called employer and individual mandates, which require employers to
offer and people to purchase health insurance. However, with the new Trump administration, the ACA is under
scrutiny and many components face repeal or drastic overhauling.
As we noted in the chapter, people face ever-increasing healthcare costs in the United States. Over the years,
the ranks of the uninsured in the United States have grown as rising prices have pushed employers and
individuals out of the market. Insurance companies have increasingly used pre-existing medical conditions to
determine if someone is high risk, for whom insurance companies either charge higher prices, or they choose
to deny insurance coverage to these individuals. Whatever the cause, we noted at the beginning of the chapter
that prior to the ACA, more than 32 million Americans were uninsured. People who are uninsured tend to use
emergency rooms for treatment—the most expensive form of healthcare, which has contributed significantly
to rising costs.
The ACA introduced regulations designed to control increases in healthcare costs. One example is a cap on
the amount healthcare providers can spend on administrative costs. Another is a requirement that healthcare
providers switch to electronic medical records (EMRs), which will reduce administrative costs.
The ACA required that states establish health insurance exchanges, or markets, where people without health
insurance, and businesses that do not provide it for their employees, can shop for different insurance plans.
The purpose of these exchanges was to increase competition in insurance markets and thus reduce prices of
policies.
Finally, the ACA mandated that people with preexisting conditions could no longer be denied health insurance.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the those without insurance in the US has
fallen from 20.3% in 2012 to 11.5% in 2016. Accordingly, 20 million Americans gained coverage under the
ACA.
What was the cost of this increased coverage and how was it paid? An insurance policy works by insuring
against the possibility of needing healthcare. If there are high risk individuals in the insurance pool, the pool
must be expanded to include enough low risk individuals to keep average premiums affordable. To that end,
the ACA imposed the individual mandate, requiring all individuals to purchase insurance (or pay a penalty)
whether they were high risk or not. Many young adults would choose to skip health insurance since the
likelihood of their needing significant healthcare is small. The individual mandate brought in a significant
amount of money to pay for the ACA. In addition, there were three other funding sources. The ACA took $716
billion which otherwise would have gone to Medicare spending. The ACA also increased the Medicare tax
that wealthy Americans paid by an additional 0.9%. Furthermore, the government levied a 40% excess tax
on high end (Cadillac) healthcare plans valued above a certain amount. Despite these funding sources, the
Congressional Budget Office estimates that the ACA will increase the federal debt by $137 billion over the
next decade.
The impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been a rise in Americans with health
insurance. However, the increased costs for those buying Premium (Cadillac) health insurance plans,
increased tax on the wealthy, and increased deficit spending, the ACA faces substantial opposition. The
Trump administration vowed to repeal it on the campaign trail but no alternative bill has made its way before
congress. Only time will tell if the Affordable Care Act will leave a legacy or will quickly be swept by the
wayside, jeopardizing the 20 million newly insured Americans.
At the time of this writing, the final impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is not clear. Millions
of previously uninsured Americans now have coverage, but the increased cost of premium health insurance
plans, increased Medicare tax on the wealthy and increased deficit spending have created significant political
opposition. The Trump administration vowed to repeal the ACA, but his administration has not announced an
alternative. Only time will tell.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
16.1 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information
Many make economic transactions in a situation of imperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller, or both
392
Chapter 16 | Information, Risk, and Insurance

are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying or selling. When information about the quality
of products is highly imperfect, it may be difficult for a market to exist.
A “lemon” is a product that turns out, after the purchase, to have low quality. When the seller has more accurate
information about the product's quality than the buyer, the buyer will be hesitant to buy, out of fear of purchasing a
“lemon.”
Markets have many ways to deal with imperfect information. In goods markets, buyers facing imperfect information
about products may depend upon money-back guarantees, warranties, service contracts, and reputation. In labor
markets, employers facing imperfect information about potential employees may turn to resumes, recommendations,
occupational licenses for certain jobs, and employment for trial periods. In capital markets, lenders facing imperfect
information about borrowers may require detailed loan applications and credit checks, cosigners, and collateral.
16.2 Insurance and Imperfect Information
Insurance is a way of sharing risk. People in a group pay premiums for insurance against some unpleasant event, and
those in the group who actually experience the unpleasant event then receive some compensation. The fundamental
law of insurance is that what the average person pays in over time cannot be less than what the average person gets
out. In an actuarially fair insurance policy, the premiums that a person pays to the insurance company are the same as
the average amount of benefits for a person in that risk group. Moral hazard arises in insurance markets because those
who are insured against a risk will have less reason to take steps to avoid the costs from that risk.
Many insurance policies have deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. A deductible is the maximum amount that the
policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the bill. A copayment is a flat fee
that an insurance policy-holder must pay before receiving services. Coinsurance requires the policyholder to pay a
certain percentage of costs. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance reduce moral hazard by requiring the insured
party to bear some of the costs before collecting insurance benefits.
In a fee-for-service health financing system, medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the cost of
services they provide. An alternative method of organizing health care is through health maintenance organizations
(HMOs), where medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the number of patients they handle, and it
is up to the providers to allocate resources between patients who receive more or fewer health care services. Adverse
selection arises in insurance markets when insurance buyers know more about the risks they face than does the
insurance company. As a result, the insurance company runs the risk that low-risk parties will avoid its insurance
because it is too costly for them, while high-risk parties will embrace it because it looks like a good deal to them.

Figure 17.1 Building Home Equity Many people choose to purchase their home rather than rent. This chapter
explores how the global financial crisis has influenced home ownership. (Credit: modification of work by Diana

The Housing Bubble and the 2007 Financial Crisis
In 2006, housing equity in the United States peaked at $13 trillion. That means that the market prices of
homes, less what was still owed on the loans they used to buy these houses, equaled $13 trillion. This was a
very good number, since the equity represented the value of the financial asset most U.S. citizens owned.
However, by 2008 this number declined to $8.8 trillion, and it plummeted further still in 2009. Combined
with the decline in value of other financial assets held by U.S. citizens, by 2010, U.S. homeowners’ wealth
had shrunk $14 trillion! This is a staggering result, and it affected millions of lives: people had to alter their
retirement, housing, and other important consumption decisions. Just about every other large economy in the
world suffered a decline in the market value of financial assets, as a result of the 2008-2009 global financial
crisis.
This chapter will explain why people purchase houses (other than as a place to live), why they buy other types
of financial assets, and why businesses sell those financial assets in the first place. The chapter will also give
us insight into why financial markets and assets go through boom and bust cycles like the one we described
here.

How Businesses Raise Financial Capital

How Households Supply Financial Capital
•
How to Accumulate Personal Wealth
When a firm needs to buy new equipment or build a new facility, it often must go to the financial market to raise funds.
Usually firms will add capacity during an economic expansion when profits are on the rise and consumer demand is
high. Business investment is one of the critical ingredients needed to sustain economic growth. Even in the sluggish
2009 economy, U.S. firms invested $1.4 trillion in new equipment and structures, in the hope that these investments
would generate profits in the years ahead.
Between the end of the recession in 2009 through the second quarter 2013, profits for the S&P 500 companies grew
to 9.7 % despite the weak economy, with cost cutting and reductions in input costs driving much of that amount,
according to the Wall Street Journal. Figure 17.2 shows corporate profits after taxes (adjusted for inventory and
capital consumption). Despite the steep decline in quarterly net profit in 2008, profits have recovered and surpassed
pre-recession levels.
Figure 17.2 Corporate Profits After Tax (Adjusted for Inventory and Capital Consumption) Prior to 2008,
corporate profits after tax more often than not increased each year. There was a significant drop in profits during 2008
and into 2009. The profit trend has since continued to increase each year, though at a less steady or consistent rate.

Many firms, from huge companies like General Motors to startup firms writing computer software, do not have the
financial resources within the firm to make all the desired investments. These firms need financial capital from outside
investors, and they are willing to pay interest for the opportunity to obtain a rate of return on the investment for that
financial capital.
On the other side of the financial capital market, financial capital suppliers, like households, wish to use their savings
in a way that will provide a return. Individuals cannot, however, take the few thousand dollars that they save in any
given year, write a letter to General Motors or some other firm, and negotiate to invest their money with that firm.
Financial capital markets bridge this gap: that is, they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate
financial capital suppliers and transform it into the funds of financial capital demanders desire. Such financial markets
include stocks, bonds, bank loans, and other financial investments.

Our perspective then shifts to consider how these financial investments appear to capital suppliers such as the
households that are saving funds. Households have a range of investment options: bank accounts, certificates of
deposit, money market mutual funds, bonds, stocks, stock and bond mutual funds, housing, and even tangible assets
like gold. Finally, the chapter investigates two methods for becoming rich: a quick and easy method that does not
work very well at all, and a slow, reliable method that can work very well over a lifetime.
17.1 | How Businesses Raise Financial Capital
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Describe financial capital and how it relates to profits
•
Discuss the purpose and process of borrowing, bonds, and corporate stock
•
Explain how firms choose between sources of financial capital
Firms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future.
Examples include when a firm buys a machine that will last 10 years, or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years,
or starts a research and development project. Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in
four main ways: (1) from early-stage investors; (2) by reinvesting profits; (3) by borrowing through banks or bonds;
and (4) by selling stock. When business owners choose financial capital sources, they also choose how to pay for
them.
Early-Stage Financial Capital
Firms that are just beginning often have an idea or a prototype for a product or service to sell, but few customers,
or even no customers at all, and thus are not earning profits. Such firms face a difficult problem when it comes to
raising financial capital: How can a firm that has not yet demonstrated any ability to earn profits pay a rate of return
to financial investors?
For many small businesses, the original source of money is the business owner. Someone who decides to start a
restaurant or a gas station, for instance, might cover the startup costs by dipping into his or her own bank account,
or by borrowing money (perhaps using a home as collateral). Alternatively, many cities have a network of well-to-
do individuals, known as “angel investors,” who will put their own money into small new companies at an early
development stage, in exchange for owning some portion of the firm.
Venture capital firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size, but
that have potential to grow substantially. These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional
investors, including banks, institutions like college endowments, insurance companies that hold financial reserves,
and corporate pension funds. Venture capital firms do more than just supply money to small startups. They also
provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees. Typically, a venture capital fund invests in a
number of firms, and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs.
The amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year: as one example, venture
capital firms invested more than $48.3 billion in 2014, according to the National Venture Capital Association. All
early-stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big; many of them will go out
of business within a few months or years. They also know that getting in on the ground floor of a few huge successes
like a Netflix or an Amazon.com can make up for multiple failures. Therefore, early-stage investors are willing to
take large risks in order to position themselves to gain substantial returns on their investment.
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
399

Profits as a Source of Financial Capital
If firms are earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), they can choose to reinvest some of these profits in
equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting their own profits
is one primary source of financial capital. Companies and firms just getting started may have numerous attractive
investment opportunities, but few current profits to invest. Even large firms can experience a year or two of earning
low profits or even suffering losses, but unless the firm can find a steady and reliable financial capital source so that
it can continue making real investments in tough times, the firm may not survive until better times arrive. Firms often
need to find financial capital sources other than profits.
Borrowing: Banks and Bonds
When a firm has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm can make
a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms have two main
borrowing methods: banks and bonds.
A bank loan for a firm works in much the same way as a loan for an individual who is buying a car or a house. The
firm borrows an amount of money and then promises to repay it, including some rate of interest, over a predetermined
period of time. If the firm fails to make its loan payments, the bank (or banks) can often take the firm to court and
require it to sell its buildings or equipment to make the loan payments.
Another source of financial capital is a bond. A bond is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount
that it borrowed and also an interest rate over a period of time in the future. A corporate bond is issued by firms,
but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, a municipal bond is issued by cities, a state
bond by U.S. states, and a Treasury bond by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
A bond specifies an amount that one will borrow, the interest rate that one will pay, and the time until repayment.
A large company, for example, might issue bonds for $10 million. The firm promises to make interest payments at an
annual rate of 8%, or $800,000 per year and then, after 10 years, will repay the $10 million it originally borrowed.
When a firm issues bonds, the total amount it divides. A firm seeks to borrow $50 million by issuing bonds, might
actually issue 10,000 bonds of $5,000 each. In this way, an individual investor could, in effect, loan the firm $5,000,
or any multiple of that amount. Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a bondholder.
If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments, the bondholders can take the firm to court
and require it to pay, even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment. However, there is
no guarantee the firm will have sufficient assets to pay off the bonds. The bondholders may recoup only a portion of
what it loaned the firm.
Bank borrowing is more customized than issuing bonds, so it often works better for relatively small firms. The bank
can get to know the firm extremely well—often because the bank can monitor sales and expenses quite accurately
by looking at deposits and withdrawals. Relatively large and well-known firms often issue bonds instead. They use
bonds to raise new financial capital that pays for investments, or to raise capital to pay off old bonds, or to buy other
firms. However, the idea that firms or individuals use banks for relatively smaller loans and bonds for larger loans is
not an ironclad rule: sometimes groups of banks make large loans and sometimes relatively small and lesser-known
firms issue bonds.
Corporate Stock and Public Firms
A corporation is a business that “incorporates”—that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the
company's debt but share in its profits (and losses). Corporations may be private or public, and may or may not have
publicly traded stock. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising capital through
selling stock or issuing bonds.
Those who buy the stock become the firm's owners, or shareholders. Stock represents firm ownership; that is, a
person who owns 100% of a company’s stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The company's stock is divided
into shares. Corporate giants like IBM, AT&T, Ford, General Electric, Microsoft, Merck, and Exxon all have millions
of stock shares. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the stock shares. Instead, large
numbers of shareholders—even those who hold thousands of shares—each have only a small slice of the firm's overall
ownership.
When a large number of shareholders own a company, there are three questions to ask:
1.
How and when does the company obtain money from its sale?
400
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

2.
What rate of return does the company promise to pay when it sells stock?
3.
Who makes decisions in a company owned by a large number of shareholders?
First, a firm receives money from the stock sale only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the public
includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). We call a firm’s first stock sale to the
public an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO, and any stock issued
thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own treasury) or new stock issued
later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage investors, like the angel investors and the
venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40% ownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the
venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to the public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO
is that it provides the established company with financial capital for substantially expanding its operations.
However, most of the time when one buys and sells corporate stock the firm receives no financial return at all. If you
buy General Motors stock, you almost certainly buy them from the current share owner, and General Motors does not
receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house, the current
owner receives your money, not the original house builder. Similarly, when you buy stock shares, you are buying a
small slice of the firm's ownership from the existing owner—and the firm that originally issued the stock is not a part
of this transaction.
Second, when a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of return.
That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called a dividend.
Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell it to someone
else for $60, for $15 gain. We call the increase in the stock value (or of any asset) between when one buys and sells it
a capital gain.
Third: Who makes the decisions about when a firm will issue stock, or pay dividends, or re-invest profits? To
understand the answers to these questions, it is useful to separate firms into two groups: private and public.
A private company is owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis. Individuals can run a private company.
We call this a sole proprietorship. If a group runs it, we call it a partnership. A private company can also be a
corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one person, even if it employs some other
lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. Partners may jointly own a larger law firm. Most private companies are
relatively small, but there are some large private corporations, with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that
do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products dealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel
engineering and construction firm.
When a firm decides to sell stock, which financial investors can buy and sell, we call it a public company.
Shareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of thousands or
even millions of investors, the shareholders vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top executives to run the
firm on a day-to-day basis. The more stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that shareholder is entitled to cast for
the company’s board of directors.
In theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm runs in the interests of the true owners—the shareholders.
However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates who will serve on their
board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have enough personal incentive to spend
energy and money nominating alternative board members.
How Firms Choose between Financial Capital Sources
There are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. We can explain these patterns in terms of imperfect
information, which as we discussed in Information, Risk, and Insurance, is a situation where buyers and sellers
in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will almost always
have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside investors who provide
financial capital.
Any young startup firm is a risk. Some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm’s
founders inevitably have better information about how hard they are willing to work, and whether the firm is likely
to succeed, than anyone else. When the founders invested their own money into the firm, they demonstrate a belief in
its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to overcome the imperfect information, at
least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan personally and by giving them advice.
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
401

Accurate information is sometimes not available because corporate governance, the name economists give to the
institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, fails, as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman
Brothers shows.
How did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman
Brothers failure?
In 2008, Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest U.S. investment bank, with 25,000 employees. The firm had
been in business for 164 years. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. There are many causes of the Lehman Brothers failure. One area of apparent failure was the
lack of oversight by the Board of Directors to keep managers from undertaking excessive risk. We can
attribute part of the oversight failure, according to Tim Geithner’s April 10, 2010, testimony to Congress, to
the Executive Compensation Committee’s emphasis on short-term gains without enough consideration of the
risks. In addition, according to the court examiner’s report, the Lehman Brother’s Board of Directors paid
too little attention to the details of the operations of Lehman Brothers and also had limited financial service
experience.
The board of directors, elected by the shareholders, is supposed to be the first line of corporate governance
and oversight for top executives. A second institution of corporate governance is the auditing firm the company
hires to review the company's financial records and certify that everything looks reasonable. A third institution
of corporate governance is outside investors, especially large shareholders like those who invest large mutual
funds or pension funds. In the case of Lehman Brothers, corporate governance failed to provide investors with
accurate financial information about the firm’s operations.
As a firm becomes at least somewhat established and its strategy appears likely to lead to profits in the near future,
knowing the individual managers and their business plans on a personal basis becomes less important, because
information has become more widely available regarding the company’s products, revenues, costs, and profits. As a
result, other outside investors who do not know the managers personally, like bondholders and shareholders, are more
willing to provide financial capital to the firm.
At this point, a firm must often choose how to access financial capital. It may choose to borrow from a bank, issue
bonds, or issue stock. The great disadvantage of borrowing money from a bank or issuing bonds is that the firm
commits to scheduled interest payments, whether or not it has sufficient income. The great advantage of borrowing
money is that the firm maintains control of its operations and is not subject to shareholders. Issuing stock involves
selling off company ownership to the public and becoming responsible to a board of directors and the shareholders.
The benefit of issuing stock is that a small and growing firm increases its visibility in the financial markets and can
access large amounts of financial capital for expansion, without worrying about repaying this money. If the firm is
successful and profitable, the board of directors will need to decide upon a dividend payout or how to reinvest profits
to further grow the company. Issuing and placing stock is expensive, requires the expertise of investment bankers and
attorneys, and entails compliance with reporting requirements to shareholders and government agencies, such as the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
17.2 | How Households Supply Financial Capital
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Show the relationship between savers, banks, and borrowers
•
Calculate bond yield
•
Contrast bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and assets
•
Explain the tradeoffs between return and risk

The ways in which firms would prefer to raise funds are only half the story of financial markets. The other half is what
those households and individuals who supply funds desire, and how they perceive the available choices. The focus
of our discussion now shifts from firms on the demand side of financial capital markets to households on the supply
side of those markets. We can divide the mechanisms for savings available to households into several categories:
deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds; stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and
other tangible assets like owning gold. We need to analyze each of these investments in terms of three factors: (1) the
expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the
investment's liquidity, which refers to how easily one can exchange money or financial assets for a good or service.
We will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below. First, however, we need to
understand the difference between expected rate of return, risk, and actual rate of return.
Expected Rate of Return, Risk, and Actual Rate of Return
The expected rate of return refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor, either
in future interest payments, capital gains, or increased profitability. It is usually the average return over a period of
time, usually in years or even decades. We normally measure it as a percentage rate. Risk measures the uncertainty of
that project’s profitability. There are several types of risk, including default risk and interest rate risk. Default risk, as
its name suggests, is the risk that the borrower fails to pay back the bond or loan. Interest rate risk is the danger that
you might buy a long term bond at a 6% interest rate right before market rates suddenly rise, so had you waited, you
could have received a similar bond that paid 9%. A high-risk investment is one for which a wide range of potential
payoffs is reasonably probable. A low-risk investment may have actual returns that are fairly close to its expected rate
of return year after year. A high-risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate
of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years. The actual rate of return refers to the
total rate of return, including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a time period.
Bank Accounts
An intermediary is one who stands between two other parties. For example, a person who arranges a blind date
between two other people is one kind of intermediary. In financial capital markets, banks are an example of a
financial intermediary—that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a
borrower who receives a loan from that bank. When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the situation
with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet. In fact, it is not even possible to make direct
connections between those who deposit funds in banks and those who borrow from banks, because all deposited funds
end up in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends out.
Figure 17.3 illustrates the position of banks as a financial intermediary, with a pattern of deposits flowing into a
bank and loans flowing out, and then repayment of the loans flowing back to the bank, with interest payments for the
original savers.
Figure 17.3 Banks as Financial Intermediaries Banks are a financial intermediary because they stand between
savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.
Borrowers receive loans from banks, and repay the loans with interest.
Banks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs. A checking account typically pays little or no interest, but
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets

it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money, either by writing a check or by using a debit card
(that is, a card which works like a credit card, except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking
account rather than billed separately through a credit card company). A savings account typically pays some interest
rate, but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine (or you
can access the funds electronically). The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple
of decades, as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you
keep a certain minimum amount in the account, or conversely, offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least
a few checks per month.
Another way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a certificate of deposit (CD). With a CD, you agree to deposit a
certain amount of money, often measured in thousands of dollars, in the account for a stated period of time, typically
ranging from a few months to several years. In exchange, the bank agrees to pay a higher interest rate than for a
regular savings account. While you can withdraw the money before the allotted time, as the advertisements for CDs
always warn, there is “a substantial penalty for early withdrawal.”
Figure 17.4 shows the annual rate of interest paid on a six-month, one-year, and five-year CD since 1984, as reported
by Bankrate.com. The interest rates that savings accounts pay are typically a little lower than the CD rate, because
financial investors need to receive a slightly higher rate of interest as compensation for promising to leave deposits
untouched for a period of time in a CD, and thus forfeiting some liquidity.
Figure 17.4 Interest Rates on Six-Month, One-Year, and Five-Year Certificates of Deposit The interest rates on
certificates of deposit have fluctuated over time. The high interest rates of the early 1980s are indicative of the
relatively high inflation rate in the United States at that time. Interest rates fluctuate with the business cycle, typically
increasing during expansions and decreasing during a recession. Note the steep decline in CD rates since 2008, the
beginning of the Great Recession.
The great advantages of bank accounts are that financial investors have very easy access to their money, and also
money in bank accounts is extremely safe. In part, this safety arises because a bank account offers more security
than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer. In addition, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protects the savings of the average person. Every bank is required by law to pay a fee
to the FDIC, based on the size of its deposits. Then, if a bank should go bankrupt and not be able to repay depositors,
the FDIC guarantees that all customers will receive their deposits back up to $250,000.
The bottom line on bank accounts looks like this: low risk means low rate of return but high liquidity.

Bonds
An investor who buys a bond expects to receive a rate of return. However, bonds vary in the rates of return that they
offer, according to the riskiness of the borrower. We always can divide an interest rate into three components (as
we explained in Choice in a World of Scarcity): compensation for delaying consumption, an adjustment for an
inflationary rise in the overall level of prices, and a risk premium that takes the borrower’s riskiness into account.
The U.S. government is an extremely safe borrower, so when the U.S. government issues Treasury bonds, it can pay
a relatively low interest rate. Firms that appear to be safe borrowers, perhaps because of their sheer size or because
they have consistently earned profits over time, will still pay a higher interest rate than the U.S. government. Firms
that appear to be riskier borrowers, perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky, will pay
the highest interest rates when they issue bonds. We call bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their
relatively high chance of default high yield bonds or junk bonds. A number of today’s well-known firms issued junk
bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow, including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bondsecurities) to read about Treasury bonds.
A bond issued by the U.S. government or a large corporation may seem to be relatively low risk: after all, the bond
issuer has promised to make certain payments over time, and except for rare bankruptcy cases, these payments will
occur. If a corporate bond issuer fails to make the payments that it owes to its bondholders, the bondholders can
require that the company declare bankruptcy, sell off its assets, and pay them as much as it can. Even in the case of
junk bonds, a wise investor can reduce the risk by purchasing bonds from a wide range of different companies since,
even if a few firms go broke and do not pay, they are not all likely to go bankrupt.
As we noted before, bonds carry an interest rate risk. For example, imagine you decide to buy a 10-year bond that
would pay an annual interest rate of 8%. Soon after you buy the bond, interest rates on bonds rise, so that now similar
companies are paying an annual rate of 12%. Anyone who buys a bond now can receive annual payments of $120 per
year, but since your bond was issued at an interest rate of 8%, you have tied up $1,000 and receive payments of only
$80 per year. In the meaningful sense of opportunity cost, you are missing out on the higher payments that you could
have received. Furthermore, you can calculate the amount you should be willing to pay now for future payments. To
place a present discounted value on a future payment, decide what you would need in the present to equal a certain
amount in the future. This calculation will require an interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 25%, then a
payment of $125 a year from now will have a present discounted value of $100—that is, you could take $100 in the
present and have $125 in the future. (We discuss this further in the appendix on Present Discounted Value.)
In financial terms, a bond has several parts. A bond is basically an “I owe you” note that an investor receives in
exchange for capital (money). The bond has a face value. This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor
at maturity. The bond has a coupon rate or interest rate, which is usually semi-annual, but can be paid at different
times throughout the year. (Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that investors clipped and turned in to
the bank to receive interest.) The bond has a maturity date when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as
its last interest payment. Combining the bond’s face value, interest rate, and maturity date, and market interest rates,
allows a buyer to compute a bond’s present value, which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given
bond. This may or may not be the same as the face value.
The bond yield measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time. Investors can buy bonds when they
are issued and they can buy and sell them during their lifetimes. When buying a bond that has been around for a few
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
405

years, investors should know that the interest rate printed on a bond is often not the same as the bond yield, even on
new bonds. Read the next Work It Out feature to see how this happens.
Calculating the Bond Yield
You have bought a $1,000 bond whose coupon rate is 8%. To calculate your return or yield, follow these steps:
1.
Assume the following:
Face value of a bond: $1,000
Coupon rate: 8 %
Annual payment: $80 per year
2.
Consider the risk of the bond. If this bond carries no risk, then it would be safe to assume that the bond
will sell for $1,000 when it is issued and pay the purchaser $80 per year until its maturity, at which
time the final interest payment will be made and the original $1,000 will be repaid. Now, assume that
over time the interest rates prevailing in the economy rise to 12% and that there is now only one year
left to this bond’s maturity. This makes the bond an unattractive investment, since an investor can find
another bond that perhaps pays 12%. To induce the investor to buy the 8% bond, the bond seller will
lower its price below its face value of $1,000.
3.
Calculate the bond's price when its interest rate is less than the market interest rate. The expected
payments from the bond one year from now are $1,080, because in the bond’s last year the bond's
issuer will make the final interest payment and then also repay the original $1,000. Given that interest
rates are now 12%, you know that you could invest $964 in an alternative investment and receive
$1,080 a year from now; that is, $964(1 + 0.12) = $1080. Therefore, you will not pay more than $964
for the original $1,000 bond.
4.
Consider that the investor will receive the $1,000 face value, plus $80 for the last year’s interest
payment. The yield on the bond will be ($1080 – $964)/$964 = 12%. The yield, or total return, means
interest payments, plus capital gains. Note that the interest or coupon rate of 8% did not change. When
interest rates rise, bonds previously issued at lower interest rates will sell for less than face value.
Conversely, when interest rates fall, bonds previously issued at higher interest rates will sell for more
than face value.
Figure 17.5 shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds: 10-year Treasury bonds (which are officially called “notes”)
and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by Moody’s, an
independent firm that publishes such ratings. Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate, because firms
are riskier borrowers than the federal government, the rates tend to rise and fall together. Treasury bonds typically pay
more than bank accounts, and corporate bonds typically pay a higher interest rate than Treasury bonds.

Figure 17.5 Interest Rates for Corporate Bonds and Ten-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds The interest rates for
corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury bonds (officially “notes”) rise and fall together, depending on conditions for
borrowers and lenders in financial markets for borrowing. The corporate bonds always pay a higher interest rate, to
make up for the higher risk they have of defaulting compared with the U.S. government.
The bottom line for bonds: rate of return—low to moderate, depending on the borrower's risk; risk—low to moderate,
depending on whether interest rates in the economy change substantially after the bond is issued; liquidity—moderate,
because the investor needs to sell the bond before the investor regains the cash.
Stocks
As we stated earlier, the rate of return on a financial investment in a share of stock can come in two forms: as
dividends paid by the firm and as a capital gain achieved by selling the stock for more than you paid. The range of
possible returns from buying stock is mind-bending. Firms can decide to pay dividends or not. A stock price can rise
to a multiple of its original price or sink all the way to zero. Even in short periods of time, well-established companies
can see large movements in their stock prices. For example, in July 1, 2011, Netflix stock peaked at $295 per share;
one year later, on July 30, 2012, it was at $53.91 per share; in 2015, it had recovered to $414. When Facebook went
public, its shares of stock sold for around $40 per share, but in 2015, they were selling for slightly over $83.
We will discuss the reasons why stock prices fall and rise so abruptly below, but first you need to know how we
measure stock market performance. There are a number of different ways to measure the overall performance of the
stock market, based on averaging different subsets of companies' stock prices. Perhaps the best-known stock market
measure is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on 30 large U.S. companies' stock prices. Another stock
market performance gauge, the Standard & Poor’s 500, follows the stock prices of the 500 largest U.S. companies.
The Wilshire 5000 tracks the stock prices of essentially all U.S. companies that have stock the public can buy and
sell.
Other stock market measures focus on where stocks are traded. For example, the New York Stock Exchange monitors
the performance of stocks that are traded on that exchange in New York City. The Nasdaq stock market includes about
3,600 stocks, with a concentration of technology stocks. Table 17.1 lists some of the most commonly cited measures
of U.S. and international stock markets.

Table 17.1 Some Stock Market Measures
The trend in the stock market is generally up over time, but with some large dips along the way. Figure 17.6 shows
the path of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (which is measured on the left-hand vertical axis) and the Dow Jones
Index (which is measured on the right-hand vertical axis). Broad stock market measures, like the ones we list here,
tend to move together. The S&P 500 Index is the weighted average market capitalization of the firms selected to be
in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the price weighted average of 30 industrial stocks tracked on the
New York Stock Exchange.
When the Dow Jones average rises from 5,000 to 10,000, you know that the average price of the stocks in that index
has roughly doubled. Figure 17.6 shows that stock prices did not rise much in the 1970s, but then started a steady
climb in the 1980s. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended up at about the same level.

Table 17.2 shows the total annual rate of return an investor would have received from buying the stocks in the S&P
500 index over recent decades. The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies and also capital
gains arising from increases in the stock value. (For technical reasons related to how we calculate the numbers, the
dividends and capital gains do not add exactly to the total return.) From the 1950s to the 1980s, the average firm
paid annual dividends equal to about 4% of its stock value. Since the 1990s, dividends have dropped and now often
provide a return closer to 1% to 2%. In the 1960s and 1970s, the gap between percent earned on capital gains and
dividends was much closer than it has been since the 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, capital gains were far higher than
dividends. In the 2000s, dividends remained low and, while stock prices fluctuated, they ended the decade roughly
where they had started.

The overall pattern is that stocks as a group have provided a high rate of return over extended periods of time, but
this return comes with risks. The market value of individual companies can rise and fall substantially, both over short
time periods and over the long run. During extended periods of time like the 1970s or the first decade of the 2000s,
the overall stock market return can be quite modest. The stock market can sometimes fall sharply, as it did in 2008.
The bottom line on investing in stocks is that the rate of return over time will be high, but the risks are also high,
especially in the short run. Liquidity is also high since one can sell stock in publicly held companies readily for
spendable money.
Mutual Funds
Buying stocks or bonds issued by a single company is always somewhat risky. An individual firm may find itself
buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions. Thus,
a standard recommendation from financial investors is diversification, which means buying stocks or bonds from
a wide range of companies. A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb: “Don’t put all your eggs in one
basket.” In any broad group of companies, some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse—but the
diversification has a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value.
Purchasing a diversified group of stocks or bonds has become easier in the internet age, but it remains something of
a task. To simplify the process, companies offer mutual funds, which consist of a variety of stocks or bonds from
different companies. The financial investor buys mutual fund shares, and then receives a return based on how the fund
as a whole performs. In 2012, according to the Investment Company Factbook, about 44% of U.S. households had a
financial investment in a mutual fund—including many people who have their retirement savings or pension money
invested in this way.
Mutual funds can focus in certain areas: one mutual fund might invest only in company stocks based in Indonesia, or
only in bonds issued by large manufacturing companies, or only in biotechnology companies' stock. At the other end
of the spectrum, a mutual fund might be quite broad. At the extreme, some mutual funds own a tiny share of every
firm in the stock market, and thus the mutual fund's value will fluctuate with the overall stock market's average. We
call a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the market's overall performance an index fund.
Diversification can offset some of the risks of individual stocks rising or falling. Even investors who buy an indexed
mutual fund designed to mimic some measure of the broad stock market, like the Standard & Poor’s 500, had better
prepare against some ups and downs, like those the stock market experienced in the first decade of the 2000s. In
2008 average U.S. stock funds declined 38%, reducing individual and household wealth. This steep drop in value hit
hardest those who were close to retirement and were counting on their stock funds to supplement retirement income.
The bottom line on investing in mutual funds is that the rate of return over time will be high. The risks are also high,
but the risks and returns for an individual mutual fund will be lower than those for an individual stock. As with stocks,
liquidity is also high provided the mutual fund or stock index fund is readily traded.
Housing and Other Tangible Assets
Households can also seek a rate of return by purchasing tangible assets, especially housing. About two-thirds of U.S.
households own their own home. An owner’s equity in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after
selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans he or she used to buy the house. For example, imagine
that you buy a house for $200,000, paying 10% of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the
remaining $180,000. Over time, you pay off some of your bank loan, so that only $100,000 remains, and the house's
value on the market rises to $250,000. At that point, your equity in the home is the value of the home minus the value
of the loan outstanding, which is $150,000. For many middle-class Americans, home equity is their single greatest
410
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets

financial asset. The total value of all home equity held by U.S. households was $11.3 trillion at the end of 2015,
according to Federal Reserve data.
Investment in a house is tangibly different from bank accounts, stocks, and bonds because a house offers both a
financial and a nonfinancial return. If you buy a house to live in, part of the return on your investment occurs from
your consumption of “housing services”—that is, having a place to live. (Of course, if you buy a home and rent it
out, you receive rental payments for the housing services you provide, which would offer a financial return.) Buying
a house to live in also offers the possibility of a capital gain from selling the house in the future for more than you
paid for it. There can, however, be different outcomes, as the Clear It Up on the housing market shows.
Housing prices have usually risen steadily over time. For example, the median sales price for an existing one-family
home was $122,900 in 1990, but 232,000 at the end of December 2016, according to FRED® Economic Data. Over
these 24 years, home prices increased an average of 3.1% per year, which is an average financial return over this time.
Figure 17.7 shows U.S. Census data for the median average sales price of a house in the United States over this time
period.
Go to this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/investopedia) to experiment with a compound annual growth
rate calculator.
However, the possible capital gains from rising housing prices are riskier than these national price averages. Certain
regions of the country or metropolitan areas have seen drops in housing prices over time. The median housing price
for the United States as a whole fell almost 7% in 2008 and again in 2009, dropping the median price from $247,900
to $216,700. As of 2016, home values had recovered and even exceeded their pre-recession levels.

Figure 17.7 The Median Average Sales Price for New Single-Family Homes, 1990–2015 The median price is the
price where half of sales prices are higher and half are lower. The median sales price for a new one-family home was
$122,900 in 1990. It rose as high as $248,000 in 2007, before falling to $232,000 in 2008. In 2015, the median sales
price was $294,000. Of course, this national figure conceals many local differences, like the areas where housing
prices are higher or lower, or how housing prices have risen or fallen at certain times. (Source: U.S. Census)
Investors can also put money into other tangible assets such as gold, silver, and other precious metals, or in duller
commodities like sugar, cocoa, coffee, orange juice, oil, and natural gas. The return on these investments derives
from the saver’s hope of buying low, selling high, and receiving a capital gain. Investing in, say, gold or coffee offers
relatively little in the way of nonfinancial benefits to the user (unless the investor likes to caress gold or gaze upon a
warehouse full of coffee). Typically, investors in these commodities never even see the physical good. Instead, they
sign a contract that takes ownership of a certain quantity of these commodities, which are stored in a warehouse, and
later they sell the ownership to someone else. As one example, from 1981 to 2005, the gold prices generally fluctuated
between about $300 and $500 per ounce, but then rose sharply to over $1,100 per ounce by early 2010. In January
2017, prices were hovering around $1,191 per ounce.
A final area of tangible assets consists of “collectibles” like paintings, fine wine, jewelry, antiques, or even baseball
cards. Most collectibles provide returns both in the form of services or of a potentially higher selling price in the
future. You can use paintings by hanging them on the wall; jewelry by wearing it; baseball cards by displaying
them. You can also hope to sell them someday for more than you paid for them. However, the evidence on prices of
collectibles, while scanty, is that while they may go through periods where prices skyrocket for a time, you should
not expect to make a higher-than-average rate of return over a sustained period of time from investing in this way.
The bottom line on investing in tangible assets: rate of return—moderate, especially if you can receive nonfinancial
benefits from, for example, living in the house; risk—moderate for housing or high if you buy gold or baseball cards;
liquidity—low, because it often takes considerable time and energy to sell a house or a piece of fine art and turn your
capital gain into cash. The next Clear It Up feature explains the issues in the recent U.S. housing market crisis.
What was all the commotion in the recent U.S. housing market?
The cumulative average annual growth rate in housing prices from 1981 to 2000 was 5.1%. The price of
an average U.S. home then took off from 2003 to 2005, rising more than 10% per year. No serious analyst
believed this rate of growth was sustainable; after all, if housing prices grew at, say, 11% per year over time,
the average price of a home would more than double every seven years. However, at the time many serious
analysts saw no reason for deep concern. After all, housing prices often change in fits and starts, like all
412
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets

prices, and a price surge for a few years is often followed by prices that are flat or even declining a bit as local
markets adjust.
The sharp rise in housing prices was driven by a high level of demand for housing. Interest rates were low, so
financial institutions encouraged people to borrow money to buy a house. Banks became much more flexible
in their lending, making what were called “subprime” loans. Banks loaned money with low, or sometimes
no down payment. They offered loans with very low payments for the first two years, but then much higher
payments after that. The idea was that housing prices would keep rising, so the borrower would just refinance
the mortgage two years in the future, and thus would not ever have to make the higher payments. Some banks
even offered so-called NINJA loans, which meant a financial institution issued loan even though the borrower
had no income, no job, nor assets.
In retrospect, these loans seem nearly crazy. Many borrowers figured, however, that as long as housing
prices kept rising, it made sense to buy. Many lenders used a process called “securitizing,” in which they sold
their mortgages to financial companies, which put all the mortgages into a big pool, creating large financial
securities, and then re-sold these mortgage-backed securities to investors. In this way, the lenders off-loaded
the mortgage risks to investors. Investors were interested in mortgage-backed securities as they appeared to
offer a steady stream of income, provided the borrowers repaid them. Investors relied on the ratings agencies
to assess the credit risk associated with the mortgage-backed securities. In hindsight, it appears that the credit
agencies were far too lenient in their ratings of many of the securitized loans. Bank and financial regulators
watched the steady rise in the market for mortgage-backed securities, but saw no reason at the time to
intervene.
When housing prices turned down, many households that had borrowed when prices were high found that
what they owed the bank was more than what their home was worth. Many banks believed that they had
diversified by selling their individual loans and instead buying securities based on mortgage loans from all
over the country. After all, banks thought back in 2005, the average house price had not declined at any time
since the Great Depression in the 1930s. These securities based on mortgage loans, however, turned out to
be far riskier than expected. The bust in housing prices weakened both bank and household finances, and
thus helped bring on the 2008-2009 Great Recession.
The Tradeoffs between Return and Risk
The discussion of financial investments has emphasized the expected rate of return, the risk, and the liquidity of each
investment. Table 17.3 summarizes these characteristics.

The household investment choices listed here display a tradeoff between the expected return and the degree of risk
involved. Bank accounts have very low risk and very low returns; bonds have higher risk but higher returns; and
stocks are riskiest of all but have the potential for still higher returns. In effect, the higher average return compensates
for the higher degree of risk. If risky assets like stocks did not also offer a higher average return, then few investors
would want them.
This tradeoff between return and risk complicates the task of any financial investor: Is it better to invest safely or to
take a risk and go for the high return? Ultimately, choices about risk and return will be based on personal preferences.
However, it is often useful to examine risk and return in the context of different time frames.
The high returns of stock market investments refer to a high average return that we can expect over a period of several
years or decades. The high risk of such investments refers to the fact that in shorter time frames, from months to a
few years, the rate of return may fluctuate a great deal. Thus, a person near retirement age, who already owns a house,
may prefer reduced risk and certainty about retirement income. For young workers, just starting to make a reasonably
profitable living, it may make sense to put most of their savings for retirement in mutual funds. Mutual funds are able
to take advantage of their buying and selling size and thereby reduce transaction costs for investors. Stocks are risky
in the short term, to be sure, but when the worker can look forward to several decades during which stock market ups
and downs can even out, stocks will typically pay a much higher return over that extended period than will bonds or
bank accounts. Thus, one must consider tradeoffs between risk and return in the context of where the investor is in
life.
17.3 | How to Accumulate Personal Wealth
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the random walk theory
•
Calculate simple and compound interest
•
Evaluate how capital markets transform financial capital
Getting rich may seem straightforward enough. Figure out what companies are going to grow and earn high profits
in the future, or figure out what companies are going to become popular for everyone else to buy. Those companies
are the ones that will pay high dividends or whose stock price will climb in the future. Then, buy stock in those
companies. Presto! Multiply your money!
Why is this path to riches not as easy as it sounds? This module first discusses the problems with picking stocks, and
then discusses a more reliable but undeniably duller method of accumulating personal wealth.
Why It Is Hard to Get Rich Quick: The Random Walk Theory
The chief problem with attempting to buy stock in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many
other financial investors are trying to do the same thing. Thus, in attempting to get rich in the stock market, it is no
help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same
conclusion, because the stock price will already be high, based on the expected high level of future profits.
The idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication. If
expectations determine stock price, then shifts in expectations will determine shifts in the stock price. Thus, what
matters for predicting whether the stock price of a company will do well is not whether the company will actually earn
profits in the future. Instead, you must find a company that analysts widely believe at present to have poor prospects,
but that will actually turn out to be a shining star. Brigades of stock market analysts and individual investors are
carrying out such research 24 hours a day.
The fundamental problem with predicting future stock winners is that, by definition, no one can predict the future
news that alters expectations about profits. Because stock prices will shift in response to unpredictable future news,
these prices will tend to follow what mathematicians call a “random walk with a trend.” The “random walk” part
means that, on any given day, stock prices are just as likely to rise as to fall. “With a trend” means that over time, the
upward steps tend to be larger than the downward steps, so stocks do gradually climb.
If stocks follow a random walk, then not even financial professionals will be able to choose those that will beat
the average consistently. While some investment advisers are better than average in any given year, and some even

succeed for a number of years in a row, the majority of financial investors do not outguess the market. If we look back
over time, it is typically true that half or two-thirds of the mutual funds that attempted to pick stocks which would rise
more than the market average actually ended up performing worse than the market average. For the average investor
who reads the newspaper business pages over a cup of coffee in the morning, the odds of doing better than full-time
professionals is not very good at all. Trying to pick the stocks that will gain a great deal in the future is a risky and
unlikely way to become rich.
Getting Rich the Slow, Boring Way
Many U.S. citizens can accumulate a large amount of wealth during their lifetimes, if they make two key choices.
The first is to complete additional education and training. In 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau reported median earnings
for households where the main earner had only a high school degree of $33,124; for those with a two-year associate
degree, median earnings were $40,560 and for those with a four-year bachelor’s degree, median income was $54,340.
Learning is not only good for you, but it pays off financially, too.
The second key choice is to start saving money early in life, and to give the power of compound interest a chance.
Imagine that at age 25, you save $3,000 and place that money into an account that you do not touch. In the long run,
it is not unreasonable to assume a 7% real annual rate of return (that is, 7% above the rate of inflation) on money
invested in a well-diversified stock portfolio. After 40 years, using the formula for compound interest, the original
$3,000 investment will have multiplied nearly fifteen fold:
3, 000(1 + .07)40 = $44,923
Having $45,000 does not make you a millionaire. Notice, however, that this tidy sum is the result of saving $3,000
exactly once. Saving that amount every year for several decades—or saving more as income rises—will multiply
the total considerably. This type of wealth will not rival the riches of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, but remember that
only half of Americans have any money in mutual funds at all. Accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars by
retirement is a perfectly achievable goal for a well-educated person who starts saving early in life—and that amount
of accumulated wealth will put you at or near the top 10% of all American households. The following Work It Out
feature shows the difference between simple and compound interest, and the power of compound interest.
Simple and Compound Interest
Simple interest is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount.
Step 1. Learn the formula for simple interest:
Principal × Rate × Time = Interest
Step 2. Practice using the simple interest formula.
Example 1: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for one year is:
$100 × 0.05 × 1 = $5
Simple interest in this example is $15.
Example 2: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for three years is:
$100 × 0.05 × 3 = $15
Simple interest in this example is $5.
Step 3. Calculate the total future amount using this formula:
Total future amount = principal + interest
Step 4. Put the two simple interest formulas together.
Total future amount (with simple interest) = Principal + (Principal × Rate × Time)
Step 5. Apply the simple interest formula to our three year example.
Total future amount (with simple interest) = $100 + ($100 × 0.05 × 3) = $115
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
415

Compound interest is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest.
Step 6. To find the compound interest, we determine the difference between the future value and the present
value of the principal. This is accomplished as follows:
Future Value = Principal × (1 + interest rate)time
Compound interest = Future Value – Present Valve
Step 7. Apply this formula to our three-year scenario. Follow the calculations in
Table 17.4

$100 + ($100 × 0.5)

$115.75
$110.25 + ($110.25 × .05)
Compound interest
$115.75 – $100 = $15.75
Table 17.4
Step 8. Note that, after three years, the total is $115.76. Therefore the total compound interest is $15.76. This
is $0.76 more than we obtained with simple interest. While this may not seem like much, keep in mind that
we were only working with $100 and over a relatively short time period. Compound interest can make a huge
difference with larger sums of money and over longer periods of time.
Obtaining additional education and saving money early in life obviously will not make you rich overnight. Additional
education typically means deferring earning income and living as a student for more years. Saving money often
requires choices like driving an older or less expensive car, living in a smaller apartment or buying a smaller house,
and making other day-to-day sacrifices. For most people, the tradeoffs for achieving substantial personal wealth will
require effort, patience, and sacrifice.
How Capital Markets Transform Financial Flows
Financial capital markets have the power to repackage money as it moves from those who supply financial capital
416

to those who demand it. Banks accept checking account deposits and turn them into long-term loans to companies.
Individual firms sell shares of stock and issue bonds to raise capital. Firms make and sell an astonishing array of
goods and services, but an investor can receive a return on the company’s decisions by buying stock in that company.
Financial investors sell and resell stocks and bonds to one another. Venture capitalists and angel investors search
for promising small companies. Mutual funds combine the stocks and bonds—and thus, indirectly, the products and
investments—of many different companies.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/austerebaltic/) to read an article about how austerity can work.
In this chapter, we discussed the basic mechanisms of financial markets. (A more advanced course in economics or
finance will consider more sophisticated tools.) The fundamentals of those financial capital markets remain the same:
Firms are trying to raise financial capital and households are looking for a desirable combination of rate of return, risk,
and liquidity. Financial markets are society’s mechanisms for bringing together these forces of demand and supply.
The Housing Bubble and the Financial Crisis of 2007
The housing boom and bust in the United States, and the resulting multi-trillion-dollar decline in home equity,
began with the fall of home prices starting in 2007. As home values dipped, many home prices fell below the
amount the borrower owed on the mortgage and owners stopped paying and defaulted on their loan. Banks
found that their assets (loans) became worthless. Many financial institutions around the world had invested
in mortgage-backed securities, or had purchased insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When housing
prices collapsed, the value of those financial assets collapsed as well. The asset side of the banks’ balance
sheets dropped, causing bank failures and bank runs. Around the globe, financial institutions were bankrupted
or nearly so. The result was a large decrease in lending and borrowing, or a freezing up of available credit.
When credit dries up, the economy is on its knees. The crisis was not limited to the United States. Iceland,
Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Greece all had similar housing boom and bust cycles, and
similar credit freezes.
If businesses cannot access financial capital, they cannot make physical capital investments. Those
investments ultimately lead to job creation. When credit dried up, businesses invested less, and they ultimately
laid off millions of workers. This caused incomes to drop, which caused demand to drop. In turn businesses
sold less, so they laid off more workers. Compounding these events, as economic conditions worsened,
financial institutions were even less likely to make loans.
To make matters even worse, as businesses sold less, their expected future profit decreased, and this led to
a drop in stock prices. Combining all these effects led to major decreases in incomes, demand, consumption,
and employment, and to the Great Recession, which in the United States officially lasted from December 2007
to June 2009. During this time, the unemployment rate rose from 5% to a peak of 10.1%. Four years after the
recession officially ended, unemployment was still stubbornly high, at 7.6%, and 11.8 million people were still
unemployed.
Chapter 17 | Financial Markets
417

As the world’s leading consumer, if the United States goes into recession, it usually drags other countries
down with it. The Great Recession was no exception. With few exceptions, U.S. trading partners also entered
into recessions of their own, of varying lengths, or suffered slower economic growth. Like the United States,
many European countries also gave direct financial assistance, so-called bailouts, to the institutions that make
up their financial markets. There was good reason to do this. Financial markets bridge the gap between
demanders and suppliers of financial capital. These institutions and markets need to function in order for an
economy to invest in new financial capital.
However, much of this bailout money was borrowed, and this borrowed money contributed to another crisis
in Europe. Because of the impact on their budgets of the financial crisis and the resulting bailouts, many
countries found themselves with unsustainably high deficits. They chose to undertake austerity measures,
large decreases in government spending and large tax increases, in order to reduce their deficits. Greece,
Ireland, Spain, and Portugal have all had to undertake relatively severe austerity measures. The ramifications
of this crisis have spread. Economists have even call into question the euro's viability into question.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
17.1 How Businesses Raise Financial Capital
Companies can raise early-stage financial capital in several ways: from their owners’ or managers’ personal savings,
or credit cards and from private investors like angel investors and venture capital firms.
A bond is a financial contract through which a borrower agrees to repay the amount that it borrowed. A bond specifies
an amount that one will borrow, the amounts that one will repay over time based on the interest rate when the bond is
issued, and the time until repayment. Corporate bonds are issued by firms; municipal bonds are issued by cities, state
bonds by U.S. states, and Treasury bonds by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Stock represents firm ownership. A company's stock is divided into shares. A firm receives financial capital when it
sells stock to the public. We call a company’s first stock sale to the public the initial public offering (IPO). However,
a firm does not receive any funds when one shareholder sells stock in the firm to another investor. One receives the
rate of return on stock in two forms: dividends and capital gains.
A private company is usually owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis, although hired managers can run
it. We call a private company owned and run by an individual a sole proprietorship, while a firm owned and run by
a group is a partnership. When a firm decides to sell stock that financial investors can buy and sell, then the firm is
owned by its shareholders—who in turn elect a board of directors to hire top day-to-day management. We call this
a public company. Corporate governance is the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch
over top executives, though it does not always work.

17.2 How Households Supply Financial Capital
We can categorize all investments according to three key characteristics: average expected return, degree of risk,
and liquidity. To obtain a higher rate of return, an investor must typically accept either more risk or less liquidity.
Banks are an example of a financial intermediary, an institution that operates to coordinate supply and demand in
the financial capital market. Banks offer a range of accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and
certificates of deposit. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), banks purchase insurance against
the risk of a bank failure.
A typical bond promises the financial investor a series of payments over time, based on the interest rate at the time
the financial institution issues the bond, and when the borrower repays it. Bonds that offer a high rate of return but
also a relatively high chance of defaulting on the payments are called high-yield or junk bonds. The bond yield is the
rate of return that a bond promises to pay at the time of purchase. Even when bonds make payments based on a fixed
interest rate, they are somewhat risky, because if interest rates rise for the economy as a whole, an investor who owns
bonds issued at lower interest rates is now locked into the low rate and suffers a loss.
Changes in the stock price depend on changes in expectations about future profits. Investing in any individual firm
is somewhat risky, so investors are wise to practice diversification, which means investing in a range of companies.
A mutual fund purchases an array of stocks and/or bonds. An investor in the mutual fund then receives a return
depending on the fund's overall performance as a whole. A mutual fund that seeks to imitate the overall behavior of
the stock market is called an index fund.
We can also regard housing and other tangible assets as forms of financial investment, which pay a rate of return in
the form of capital gains. Housing can also offer a nonfinancial return—specifically, you can live in it.
17.3 How to Accumulate Personal Wealth
It is extremely difficult, even for financial professionals, to predict changes in future expectations and thus to choose
the stocks whose price will rise in the future. Most Americans can accumulate considerable financial wealth if they
follow two rules: complete significant additional education and training after graduating from high school and start
saving money early in life.

In The Logic of Collective Action (1965), economist Mancur Olson challenged the popular idea that, in a
democracy, the majority view will prevail, and in doing so launched the modern study of public economy,
sometimes referred to as public choice, a subtopic of microeconomics. In this chapter, we will look at the
economics of government policy, why smaller, more organized groups have an incentive to work hard to enact
certain policies, and why lawmakers ultimately make decisions that may result in bad economic policy.

Flaws in the Democratic System of Government
As President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his 1863 Gettysburg Address, democratic governments are supposed
to be “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” Can we rely on democratic governments to enact sensible
economic policies? After all, they react to voters, not to analyses of demand and supply curves. The main focus of
an economics course is, naturally enough, to analyze the characteristics of markets and purely economic institutions.
However, political institutions also play a role in allocating society’s scarce resources, and economists have played an
active role, along with other social scientists, in analyzing how such political institutions work.
Other chapters of this book discuss situations in which market forces can sometimes lead to undesirable results:
monopoly, imperfect competition, and antitrust policy; negative and positive externalities; poverty and inequality of
incomes; failures to provide insurance; and financial markets that may go from boom to bust. Many of these chapters
suggest that the government's economic policies could address these issues.
However, just as markets can face issues and problems that lead to undesirable outcomes, a democratic system of
government can also make mistakes, either by enacting policies that do not benefit society as a whole or by failing
to enact policies that would have benefited society as a whole. This chapter discusses some practical difficulties of
democracy from an economic point of view: we presume the actors in the political system follow their own self-
interest, which is not necessarily the same as the public good. For example, many of those who are eligible to vote do
not, which obviously raises questions about whether a democratic system will reflect everyone’s interests. Benefits or
costs of government action are sometimes concentrated on small groups, which in some cases may organize and have
a disproportionately large impact on politics and in other cases may fail to organize and end up neglected. A legislator
who worries about support from voters in his or her district may focus on spending projects specific to the district
without sufficient concern for whether this spending is in the nation's interest.
When more than two choices exist, the principle that the majority of voters should decide may not always make
logical sense, because situations can arise where it becomes literally impossible to decide what the “majority” prefers.
Government may also be slower than private firms to correct its mistakes, because government agencies do not face
competition or the threat of new entry.
18.1 | Voter Participation and Costs of Elections
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain the significance of rational ignorance
•
Evaluate the impact of election expenses
In U.S. presidential elections over the last few decades, about 55% to 65% of voting-age citizens actually voted,
according to the U.S. Census. In congressional elections when there is no presidential race, or in local elections, the
turnout is typically lower, often less than half the eligible voters. In other countries, the share of adults who vote is
often higher. For example, in national elections since the 1980s in Germany, Spain, and France, about 75% to 80% of
those of voting age cast ballots. Even this total falls well short of 100%. Some countries have laws that require voting,
among them Australia, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Singapore, and most Latin American nations. At the time the
United States was founded, voting was mandatory in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Georgia. Even if the law can
require people to vote, however, no law can require that each voter cast an informed or a thoughtful vote. Moreover,
in the United States and in most countries around the world, the freedom to vote has also typically meant the freedom
not to vote.
Why do people not vote? Perhaps they do not care too much about who wins, or they are uninformed about who is
running, or they do not believe their vote will matter or change their lives in any way. These reasons are probably tied
together, since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed or care who wins.
Economists have suggested why a utility-maximizing person might rationally decide not to vote or not to become
informed about the election. While a single vote may decide a few elections in very small towns, in most elections
of any size, the Board of Elections measures the margin of victory in hundreds, thousands, or even millions of votes.
A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference. This theory of rational
ignorance holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high, or they feel their
vote will not be decisive in the election.

In a 1957 work, An Economic Theory of Democracy, the economist Anthony Downs stated the problem this way: “It
seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy, rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in
political information per se. No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen
by his free information, or how uncertain he is about which party to support, he realizes that his vote has almost no
chance of influencing the outcome… He will not even utilize all the free information available, since assimilating it
takes time.” In his classic 1948 novel Walden Two, the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly
via one of his characters, who states: “The chance that one man’s vote will decide the issue in a national election…is
less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls.” The following Clear It Up feature explores another
aspect of the election process: spending.
How much is too much to spend on an election?
According to a report from CBS News, the 2016 elections for president, Congress, and state and local offices,
saw a total of about $6.8 billion spent. The money raised went to the campaigns, including advertising,
fundraising, travel, and staff. Many people worry that politicians spend too much time raising money and
end up entangled with special interest groups that make major donations. Critics would prefer a system
that restricts what candidates can spend, perhaps in exchange for limited public campaign financing or free
television advertising time.
How much spending on campaigns is too much? Five billion dollars will buy many potato chips, but in the
U.S. economy, which exceeded $18 trillion in 2016, the $6.8 billion spent on political campaigns was about 1/
25 of 1% of the overall economy. Here is another way to think about campaign spending. Total government
spending programs in 2016, including federal and state governments, was about $7 trillion, so the cost of
choosing the people who would determine how to spend this money was less than 1/10 of 1% of that. In the
context of the enormous U.S. economy, $6.8 billion is not as much money as it sounds. U.S. consumers spend
about $2 billion per year on toothpaste and $7 billion on hair care products. In 2016, Proctor and Gamble
spent $7.2 billion on advertising. It may not be sensible to believe the United States is going to decide its
presidential elections for much less than Proctor and Gamble spends on advertisements.
Whatever we believe about whether candidates and their parties spend too much or too little on elections,
the U.S. Supreme Court has placed limits on how government can limit campaign spending. In a 1976
decision, Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court emphasized that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
specifies freedom of speech. The federal government and states can offer candidates a voluntary deal in
which government makes some public financing available to candidates, but only if the candidates agree to
abide by certain spending limits. Of course, candidates can also voluntarily agree to set certain spending limits
if they wish. However, government cannot forbid people or organizations to raise and spend money above
these limits if they choose.
In 2002, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act (BCRA). The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy
disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns. However, some controversial portions of the Act limit the
ability of individuals and groups to make certain kinds of political donations and they ban certain kinds of
advertising in the months leading up to an election. Some called these bans into question after the release
of two films: Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 and Citizens United’s Hillary: The Movie. At question was
whether each film sought to discredit political candidates for office too close to an election, in violation of
the BCRA. The lower courts found that Moore’s film did not violate the Act, while Citizens United’s did. The
fight reached the Supreme Court, as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, saying that the First
Amendment protects the rights of corporations as well as individuals to donate to political campaigns. The
Court ruled, in a 5–4 decision, that the spending limits were unconstitutional. This controversial decision,
which essentially allows unlimited contributions by corporations to political action committees, overruled
several previous decisions and will likely be revisited in the future, due to the strength of the public reaction.
For now, it has resulted in a sharp increase in election spending.

While many U.S. adults do not bother to vote in presidential elections, more than half do. What motivates them?
Research on voting behavior has indicated that people who are more settled or more “connected” to society tend to
vote more frequently. According to the Washington Post, more married people vote than single people. Those with
a job vote more than the unemployed. Those who have lived longer in a neighborhood are more likely to vote than
newcomers. Those who report that they know their neighbors and talk to them are more likely to vote than socially
isolated people. Those with a higher income and level of education are also more likely to vote. These factors suggest
that politicians are likely to focus more on the interests of married, employed, well-educated people with at least a
middle-class level of income than on the interests of other groups. For example, those who vote may tend to be more
supportive of financial assistance for the two-year and four-year colleges they expect their children to attend than they
are of medical care or public school education aimed at families of the poor and unemployed.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/votergroups) to see a breakdown of how different groups voted
in 2012.
There have been many proposals to encourage greater voter turnout: making it easier to register to vote, keeping the
polls open for more hours, or even moving Election Day to the weekend, when fewer people need to worry about jobs
or school commitments. However, such changes do not seem to have caused a long-term upward trend in the number
of people voting. After all, casting an informed vote will always impose some costs of time and energy. It is not clear
how to strengthen people’s feeling of connectedness to society in a way that will lead to a substantial increase in voter
turnout. Without greater voter turnout, however, politicians elected by the votes of 60% or fewer of the population
may not enact economic policy in the best interests of 100% of the population. Meanwhile, countering a long trend
toward making voting easier, many states have recently erected new voting laws that critics say are actually barriers to
voting. States have passed laws reducing early voting, restricting groups who are organizing get-out-the-vote efforts,
enacted strict photo ID laws, as well as laws that require showing proof of U.S. citizenship. The ACLU argues that
while these laws profess to prevent voter fraud, they are in effect making it harder for individuals to cast their vote.
18.2 | Special Interest Politics
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain how special interest groups and lobbyists can influence campaigns and elections
•
Describe pork-barrel spending and logrolling
Many political issues are of intense interest to a relatively small group, as we noted above. For example, many U.S.
drivers do not much care where their car tires were made—they just want good quality as inexpensively as possible.
In September 2009, President Obama and Congress enacted a tariff (taxes added on imported goods) on tires imported
from China that would increase the price by 35 percent in its first year, 30 percent in its second year, and 25 percent
in its third year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step, because most of them
also import tires from China and other countries. (See Globalization and Protectionism for more on tariffs.)
However, the United Steelworkers union, which had seen jobs in the tire industry fall by 5,000 over the previous five
years, lobbied fiercely for the tariff. With this tariff, the cost of all tires increased significantly. (See the closing Bring
It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire tariff.)

Special interest groups are groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well organized and
focused on a specific issue. A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit
society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large companies $8 million
each, for a total cost of $80 million. The social benefits from enacting this rule provide an average benefit of $10 for
every person in the United States, for a total of about $3 trillion. Even though the benefits are far higher than the costs
for society as a whole, the 10 companies are likely to lobby much more fiercely to avoid $8 million in costs than the
average person is to argue for $10 worth of benefits.
As this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue we raised in
Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities about economic policy with respect to negative
externalities and pollution—the problem called regulatory capture (which we defined in Monopoly and Antitrust
Policy). In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in
taxes, or rules for safety in the workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations, you can be sure
the specific industry affected has lobbyists who study every word and every comma. They talk with the legislators
who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording. They contribute to the campaigns of legislators on
the key committees—and may even offer those legislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As a result, it
often turns out that those regulated can exercise considerable influence over the regulators.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lobbying) to read about lobbying.
In the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for Medicare, a government program
that provides health insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a powerful interest group. They
donate money and time to political campaigns, and in the 2012 presidential election, 70% of those over age 65 voted,
while just 49% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot, according to the U.S. Census.
In 2003, Congress passed and President George Bush signed into law a substantial expansion of Medicare that helped
the elderly to pay for prescription drugs. The prescription drug benefit cost the federal government about $40 billion
in 2006, and the Medicare system projected that the annual cost would rise to $121 billion by 2016. The political
pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high, while the political pressure to
assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One reason might be that the American
Association for Retired People AARP, a well-funded and well-organized lobbying group represents senior citizens,
while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance.
In the battle over passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became known as “Obamacare,” there
was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. However, labor unions and
community groups financed a lobby group, Health Care for America Now (HCAN), to offset corporate lobbying.
HCAN, spending $60 million dollars, was successful in helping pass legislation which added new regulations on
insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014. The following Work It
Out feature further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence.
Chapter 18 | Public Economy

Paying To Get Your Way
Suppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain factories in a small town of 10,000 people.
Congress estimates the tax will reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each resident by an
equivalent of $300. The tax will also reduce profits to the town’s two large factories by $1 million each. How
much should the factory owners be willing to spend to fight the tax passage, and how much should the
townspeople be willing to pay to support it? Why is society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?
Step 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose $1 million if the tax passes, so each should be willing to
spend up to that amount to prevent the passage, a combined sum of $2 million. Of course, in the real world,
there is no guarantee that lobbying efforts will be successful, so the factory owners may choose to invest an
amount that is substantially lower.
Step 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by $300 if the tax passes. Theoretically, then,
they should be willing to spend up to $3 million (10,000 × $300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the real world
with no guarantees of success, they may choose to spend less.)
Step 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in such a way as to influence public policy.
Since each person stands to gain only $300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.
Step 4. The two factory owners, however, find it very easy and profitable to coordinate their activities, so they
have a greater incentive to do so.
Special interests may develop a close relationship with one political party, so their ability to influence legislation rises
and falls as that party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a political party if it appears to a
number of voters that the relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that has been under-represented
in the past may find that it can tip the election one way or another—so that group will suddenly receive considerable
attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political parties and interests and thus offer both
opportunities for special interests and ways of counterbalancing those interests over time.
Identifiable Winners, Anonymous Losers
A number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are partly or
entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system probably has a bias toward
those who are identifiable.
For example, policies that impose price controls—like rent control—may look as if they benefit renters and impose
costs only on landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the
area, a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units
were available. These would-be renters have experienced a cost of rent control, but it is hard to identify who they are.
Similarly, policies that block imports will benefit the firms that would have competed with those imports—and
workers at those firms—who are likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to purchase the
imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the protectionist policy, are much less visible.
Specific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners and impose costs on others who are hard
to identify. Special interests are more likely to arise from a group that is easily identifiable, rather than from a group
where some of those who suffer may not even recognize they are bearing costs.
Pork Barrels and Logrolling
Politicians have an incentive to ensure that they spend government money in their home state or district, where it will
benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a
piece of legislation, they commonly ask each other to include pork-barrel spending, legislation that benefits mainly
a single political district. Pork-barrel spending is another case in which concentrated benefits and widely dispersed
costs challenge democracy: the benefits of pork-barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters, while the
costs are spread over the entire country. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more information on pork-barrel
spending.
430

How much impact can pork-barrel spending have?
Many observers widely regard U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who was originally elected to the
Senate in 1958 and served until 2010, as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a steady stream
of federal funds to his home state. A journalist once compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least
partly government funded and named after Byrd: “the Robert C. Byrd Highway; the Robert C. Byrd Locks and
Dam; the Robert C. Byrd Institute; the Robert C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors
Scholarship Program; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced
Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse; the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center;
the Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology Center; the Robert C. Byrd United Technical Center; the Robert
C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C. Byrd Drive; the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex; the Robert C.
Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource Center; the Robert C. Byrd Rural Health Center.” This
list does not include government-funded projects in West Virginia that were not named after Byrd. Of course,
we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in detail to figure out whether we should treat them as
pork-barrel spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that reach beyond West Virginia. At least
some of them, or a portion of them, certainly would fall into that category. Because there are currently no term
limits for Congressional representatives, those who have been in office longer generally have more power to
enact pork-barrel projects.
The amount that government spends on individual pork-barrel projects is small, but many small projects can add up
to a substantial total. A nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government Waste, produces an
annual report, the Pig Book that attempts to quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending, focusing on items that only
one member of Congress requested, that were passed into law without any public hearings, or that serve only a local
purpose. Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial. Interestingly, the 2016 Congressional Pig
Book exposed 123 earmarks in FY 2016, an increase of 17.1 percent from the 105 in FY 2015. The cost of earmarks
in FY 2016 was $5.1 billion, an increase of 21.4 percent from the $4.2 billion in FY 2015. While the increase in cost
over one year is disconcerting, the two-year rise of 88.9 percent over the $2.7 billion in FY 2014 causes concern.
Logrolling, an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated
laws that they individually favor, can encourage pork barrel spending. For example, if one member of the U.S.
Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district, the other members might
oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can pass a bill that includes a bridge or hospital for
every one of their districts.
As a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts, the U.S. government has typically spread out
its spending on military bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the country. In part, the
government does this to help create a situation that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of defense
spending.
18.3 | Flaws in the Democratic System of Government
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Assess the median voter theory
•
Explain the voting cycle
•
Analyze the interrelationship between markets and government
Most developed countries today have a democratic system of government: citizens express their opinions through
votes and those votes affect the direction of the country. The advantage of democracy over other systems is that
it allows everyone in a society an equal say and therefore may reduce the possibility of a small group of wealthy
oligarchs oppressing the masses. There is no such thing as a perfect system, and democracy, for all its popularity, is
not without its problems, a few of which we will examine here.
Chapter 18 | Public Economy
431

We sometimes sum up and oversimplify democracy in two words: “Majority rule.” When voters face three or more
choices, however, then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers.
As one example, consider an election in a state where 60% of the population is liberal and 40% is conservative. If
there are only two candidates, one from each side, and if liberals and conservatives vote in the same 60–40 proportions
in which they are represented in the population, then the liberal will win. What if the election ends up including two
liberal candidates and one conservative? It is possible that the liberal vote will split and victory will go to the minority
party. In this case, the outcome does not reflect the majority’s preference.
Does the majority view prevail in the case of sugar quotas? Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the United
States than sugar producers, but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby (www.sugarcane.org) has successfully argued for
protection against imports since 1789. By law, therefore, U.S. cookie and candy makers must use 85% domestic sugar
in their products. Meanwhile quotas on imported sugar restrict supply and keep the domestic sugar price up—raising
prices for companies that use sugar in producing their goods and for consumers. The European Union allows sugar
imports, and prices there are 40% lower than U.S. sugar prices. Sugar-producing countries in the Caribbean repeatedly
protest the U.S. quotas at the World Trade Organization meetings, but each bite of cookie, at present, costs you more
than if there were no sugar lobby. This case goes against the theory of the “median” voter in a democracy. The median
voter theory argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences. If we
think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right, the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum. This
theory argues that actual policy will reflect “middle of the road.” In the case of sugar lobby politics, the minority, not
the median, dominates policy.
Sometimes it is not even clear how to define the majority opinion. Step aside from politics for a moment and think
about a choice facing three families (the Ortegas, the Schmidts, and the Alexanders) who are planning to celebrate
New Year’s Day together. They agree to vote on the menu, choosing from three entrees, and they agree that the
majority vote wins. With three families, it seems reasonable that one producing choice will get a 2–1 majority. What
if, however, their vote ends up looking like Table 18.1?
Clearly, the three families disagree on their first choice. However, the problem goes even deeper. Instead of looking at
all three choices at once, compare them two at a time. (See Figure 18.2) In a vote of turkey versus beef, turkey wins
by 2–1. In a vote of beef versus lasagna, beef wins 2–1. If turkey beats beef, and beef beats lasagna, then it might
seem only logical that turkey must also beat lasagna. However, with the preferences, lasagna is preferred to turkey
by a 2–1 vote, as well. If lasagna is preferred to turkey, and turkey beats beef, then surely it must be that lasagna
also beats beef? Actually, no. Beef beats lasagna. In other words, the majority view may not win. Clearly, as any car
salesmen will tell you, the way one presents choices to us influences our decisions.
Figure 18.2 A Voting Cycle Given these choices, voting will struggle to produce a majority outcome. Turkey is
favored over roast beef by 2–1 and roast beef is favored over lasagna by 2–1. If turkey beats roast beef and roast
beef beats lasagna, then it might seem that turkey must beat lasagna, too. However, given these preferences,
lasagna is favored over turkey by 2–1.

We call the situation in which Choice A is preferred by a majority over Choice B, Choice B is preferred by a majority
over Choice C, and Choice C is preferred by a majority over Choice A a voting cycle. It is easy to imagine sets of
government choices—say, perhaps the choice between increased defense spending, increased government spending
on health care, and a tax cut—in which a voting cycle could occur. The result will be determined by the order in
which stakeholders present and vote on choices, not by majority rule, because every choice is both preferred to some
alternative and also not preferred to another alternative.

Where Is Government’s Self-Correcting Mechanism?
When a firm produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors, the firm is
likely to suffer losses. If it cannot change its ways, it will go out of business. This self-correcting mechanism in the
marketplace can have harsh effects on workers or on local economies, but it also puts pressure on firms for good
performance.
Government agencies, however, do not sell their products in a market. They receive tax dollars instead. They are not
challenged by competitors as are private-sector firms. If the U.S. Department of Education or the U.S. Department
of Defense is performing poorly, citizens cannot purchase their services from another provider and drive the existing
government agencies into bankruptcy. If you are upset that the Internal Revenue Service is slow in sending you a tax
refund or seems unable to answer your questions, you cannot decide to pay your income taxes through a different
organization. Of course, elected politicians can assign new leaders to government agencies and instruct them to
reorganize or to emphasize a different mission. The pressure government faces, however, to change its bureaucracy,
to seek greater efficiency, and to improve customer responsiveness is much milder than the threat of being put out of
business altogether.
This insight suggests that when government provides goods or services directly, we might expect it to do so with
less efficiency than private firms—except in certain cases where the government agency may compete directly with
private firms. At the local level, for example, government can provide directly services like garbage collection, using
private firms under contract to the government, or by a mix of government employees competing with private firms.
A Balanced View of Markets and Government
The British statesman Sir Winston Churchill (1874–1965) once wrote: “No one pretends that democracy is perfect or
Chapter 18 | Public Economy
433

all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all of the other forms
which have been tried from time to time.” In that spirit, the theme of this discussion is certainly not that we should
abandon democratic government. A practical student of public policy needs to recognize that in some cases, like
the case of well-organized special interests or pork-barrel legislation, a democratic government may seek to enact
economically unwise projects or programs. In other cases, by placing a low priority on the problems of those who are
not well organized or who are less likely to vote, the government may fail to act when it could do some good. In these
and other cases, there is no automatic reason to believe that government will necessarily make economically sensible
choices.
“The true test of a first-rate mind is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time,” wrote the American
author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940). At this point in your study of microeconomics, you should be able to go one
better than Fitzgerald and hold three somewhat contradictory ideas about the interrelationship between markets and
government in your mind at the same time.
First, markets are extraordinarily useful and flexible institutions through which society can allocate its scarce
resources. We introduced this idea with the subjects of international trade and demand and supply in other chapters
and reinforced it in all the subsequent discussions of how households and firms make decisions.
Second, markets may sometimes produce unwanted results. A short list of the cases in which markets produce
unwanted results includes monopoly and other cases of imperfect competition, pollution, poverty and inequality of
incomes, discrimination, and failure to provide insurance.
Third, while government may play a useful role in addressing the problems of markets, government action is also
imperfect and may not reflect majority views. Economists readily admit that, in settings like monopoly or negative
externalities, a potential role exists for government intervention. However, in the real world, it is not enough to point
out that government action might be a good idea. Instead, we must have some confidence that the government is
likely to identify and carry out the appropriate public policy. To make sensible judgments about economic policy,
we must see the strengths and weaknesses of both markets and government. We must not idealize or demonize
either unregulated markets or government actions. Instead, consider the actual strengths and weaknesses of real-world
markets and real-world governments.
These three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions. As the famous British economist Joan
Robinson wrote some decades ago: “[E]conomic theory, in itself, preaches no doctrines and cannot establish any
universally valid laws. It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions.” The study of economics is
neither politically conservative, nor moderate, nor liberal. There are economists who are Democrats, Republicans,
libertarians, socialists, and members of every other political group you can name. Of course, conservatives may tend
to emphasize the virtues of markets and the limitations of government, while liberals may tend to emphasize the
shortcomings of markets and the need for government programs. Such differences only illustrate that the language
and terminology of economics is not limited to one set of political beliefs, but can be used by all.
Chinese Tire Tariffs
In April 2009, the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. International
Trade Commission (ITC), asking it to investigate tire imports from China. Under U.S. trade law, if imports from
a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States, as determined by the
ITC, then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption. In this case, the ITC determined that
from 2004 to 2008, U.S. tire manufacturers suffered declines in production, financial health, and employment
as a direct result of increases in tire imports from China. The ITC recommended placing an additional tax on
tire imports from China. President Obama and Congress agreed with the ITC recommendation, and in June
2009 tariffs on Chinese tires increased from 4% to 39%.
Why would U.S. consumers buy imported tires from China in the first place? Most likely, because they are
cheaper than tires produced domestically or in other countries. Therefore, this tariff increase should cause
U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for tires, either because Chinese tires are now more expensive, or
because U.S. consumers are pushed by the tariff to buy more expensive tires made by U.S. manufacturers or
434

those from other countries. In the end, this tariff made U.S. consumers pay more for tires.
Was this tariff met with outrage expressed via social media, traditional media, or mass protests? Were there
“Occupy Wall Street-type” demonstrations? The answer is a resounding “No”. Most U.S. tire consumers were
likely unaware of the tariff increase, although they may have noticed the price increase, which was between $4
and $13 depending on the type of tire. Tire consumers are also potential voters. Conceivably, a tax increase,
even a small one, might make voters unhappy. However, voters probably realized that it was not worth their
time to learn anything about this issue or cast a vote based on it. They probably thought their vote would not
matter in determining the outcome of an election or changing this policy.
Estimates of the impact of this tariff show it costs U.S. consumers around $1.11 billion annually. Of this
amount, roughly $817 million ends up in the pockets of foreign tire manufacturers other than in China, and
the remaining $294 million goes to U.S. tire manufacturers. In other words, the tariff increase on Chinese tires
may have saved 1,200 jobs in the domestic tire sector, but it cost 3,700 jobs in other sectors, as consumers
had to reduce their spending because they were paying more for tires. People actually lost their jobs as a
result of this tariff. Workers in U.S. tire manufacturing firms earned about $40,000 in 2010. Given the number
of jobs saved and the total cost to U.S. consumers, the cost of saving one job amounted to $926,500!
This tariff caused a net decline in U.S. social surplus. (We discuss total surplus in the Demand and Supply
chapter, and tariffs in the The International Trade and Capital Flows (http://cnx.org/content/m64021/
latest/) chapter.) Instead of saving jobs, it cost jobs, and those jobs that it saved cost many times more than
the people working in them could ever hope to earn. Why would the government do this?
The chapter answers this question by discussing the influence special interest groups have on economic
policy. The steelworkers union, whose members make tires, saw increasingly more members lose their jobs as
U.S. consumers consumed increasingly more cheap Chinese tires. By definition, this union is relatively small
but well organized, especially compared to tire consumers. It stands to gain much for each of its members,
compared to what each tire consumer may have to give up in terms of higher prices. Thus, the steelworkers
union (joined by domestic tire manufacturers) has not only the means but the incentive to lobby economic
policymakers and lawmakers. Given that U.S. tire consumers are a large and unorganized group, if they even
are a group, it is unlikely they will lobby against higher tire tariffs. In the end, lawmakers tend to listen to those
who lobby them, even though the results make for bad economic policy.

disproportionate effect on political outcomes
the situation in which a majority prefers A over B, B over C, and C over A
KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
18.1 Voter Participation and Costs of Elections
The theory of rational ignorance says voters will recognize that their single vote is extremely unlikely to influence
the outcome of an election. As a consequence, they will choose to remain uninformed about issues and not vote. This
theory helps explain why voter turnout is so low in the United States.
18.2 Special Interest Politics
Special interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose members
has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes considerable time and energy to lobbying for the group’s preferred
choice. Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in this issue, pays no
attention.
We define pork--barrel spending as legislation whose benefits are concentrated on a single district while the costs are
spread widely over the country. Logrolling refers to a situation in which two or more legislators agree to vote for each
other’s legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many districts.
18.3 Flaws in the Democratic System of Government
Majority votes can run into difficulties when more than two choices exist. A voting cycle occurs when, in a situation
with at least three choices, choice A is preferred by a majority vote to choice B, choice B is preferred by a majority
vote to choice C, and choice C is preferred by a majority vote to choice A. In such a situation, it is impossible to
identify what the majority prefers. Another difficulty arises when the vote is so divided that no choice receives a
majority.
A practical approach to microeconomic policy will need to take a realistic view of the specific strengths and
weaknesses of markets as well as government, rather than making the easy but wrong assumption that either the
market or government is always beneficial or always harmful.

Figure 19.1 Apple or Samsung iPhone? While the iPhone is readily recognized as an Apple product, 26% of the
component costs in it come from components made by rival phone-maker, Samsung. In international trade, there are
often “conflicts” like this as each country or company focuses on what it does best. (Credit: modification of work by
Yutaka Tsutano Creative Commons)
Just Whose iPhone Is It?
The iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone components, nor does it assemble
them. The assembly is done by Foxconn Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factory in Sengzhen,
China. But, Samsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually supplies many of the parts that
make up an iPhone—representing about 26% of the costs of production. That means, that Samsung is both
the biggest supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to produce the
iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms
do, that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world’s largest electronics parts
suppliers. Apple lets Samsung focus on making the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its
strength—designing elegant products that are easy to use. If each company (and by extension each country)
focuses on what it does best, there will be gains for all through trade.

The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade
We live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from France, and
bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The clothes you wear
might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The
car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might be refined from crude oil
from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery, airplanes, cars,
scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty proportion of the
sales of your employer—and hence the money that pays your salary—comes from export sales. We are all linked by
international trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically in the last few decades.
The first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over
that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in 1913. As
the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:
It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world
markets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth century.
Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might well choose
1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were completed. By the eve
of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for standardized commodities, like
wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global flow of information was better
than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to realize: the first submarine telegraph
cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the world’s major economic regions could
effectively communicate instantaneously.
This first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many economic
connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies
by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade. Global flows of goods and
financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early 1980s that global economic
forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as they were before World War I.
19.1 | What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute
Advantage in All Goods
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage
•
Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade
•
Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs
What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is typical
for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment, and the most
up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than a
low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board, will there still be gains from
trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even when one country
has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade come
from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.
Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage
Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 19.1. In this example, it
takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes one U.S.
worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States has an absolute
440
Chapter 19 | International Trade

advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United
States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of refrigerators.

produce 1,000 units — Shoes

Table 19.1 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators
Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question, “How
many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly
differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, “How much am I giving up
to produce this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage identifies the
good for which the producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer’s absolute productivity
disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as
Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many workers (one versus
four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is relatively
greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is
least, is in the production of shoes.
Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage
When nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both countries
can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.
Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as Table 19.2 shows,
if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers in the
United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes,
then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making refrigerators, and each
worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be produced.

Table 19.2 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization
As always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one refrigerator
in terms of foregone shoe production–when labor is transferred from producing the latter to producing the former (see
Figure 19.2).
Chapter 19 | International Trade
441

Figure 19.2 Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000
shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a
maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the
production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current resources.
Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where they end
up after trade.
Let’s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators
that is shown at point A. Table 19.3 shows the output of each good for each country and the total output for the two
countries.

Table 19.3 Total Production at Point A before Trade
Continuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of
comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing
refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of
refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative
advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production
of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 ×
1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are
relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as shown in Table 19.4. The reduction of shoe
production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while
the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in
the United States.

Table 19.4 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage Raises Total Output
This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country has an
absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both countries can
still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and
shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage. The United
States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.
How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade
This example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By
using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades that would benefit
each country.
Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see
Figure 19.2 and Table 19.3). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its
comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can export no
more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators
(a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be
unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000
pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production toward its comparative advantage,
producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators
in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be
unambiguously better off.
The range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 19.5. For example, a trade where the U.S. exports
4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the sense that both
countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.
The U.S. economy, after specialization, will
benefit if it:
The Mexican economy, after specialization, will
benefit if it:
Exports fewer than 6,000 refrigerators
Imports at least 2,500 refrigerators
Imports at least 1,500 pairs of shoes
Exports no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes
Table 19.5 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico
Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to
produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production.
If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the
opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost
of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of
refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take
advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.
The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative advantages. It
shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and producing at a lower
opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and
Chapter 19 | International Trade
443

the way to apply them to a country’s production.
Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage
In Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce
60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.
Country

Lumber (tons)

Table 19.6
a.
Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?
b.
Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?
c.
Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?
d.
In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?
e.
In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?
Step 1. Make a table like Table 19.6.
Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in
Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber.
One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce
only 20.
Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both
countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor
time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is
equivalent to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the
opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one
additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela:
60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/
2 lumber. Because 1/2 lumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.
Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of
the equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide
each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent
labor time will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an
opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.
Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute
and comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.
Step 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which
is lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and
Venezuela will be exporting oil and importing lumber.
Comparative Advantage Goes Camping
To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples that
involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go camping
444
Chapter 19 | International Trade

together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular, Jethro, has done
lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all aspects of camping: he is
faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a meal, and washing up.
So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the
work?
Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals,
only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be an
unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of comparative
advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative advantage—that is, the area
of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For example, it may be that Jethro is
80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering firewood and 10%
faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend
to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their
efforts according to comparative advantage, they can all gain.
19.2 | Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading
•
Explain the relationship between economies of scale and intra-industry trade
Absolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns. For example, they help
to explain the patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh fruit from
Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to sell a substantial
proportion of their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and North America. Comparative
advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns of
international trade.
The Prevalence of Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies
The theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large differences in
opportunity costs of production. Roughly half of all world trade involves shipping goods between the fairly similar
high-income economies of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and China (see Table
19.7).

Moreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain
products, and then exchange those products. A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry trade—that is,
trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. For example, the United States produces and
exports autos and imports autos. Table 19.8 shows some of the largest categories of U.S. exports and imports. In all
of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a substantial importer of goods from the same

industry. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States exported $146 billion worth of
autos, and imported $327 billion worth of autos. About 60% of U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry
trade.

Why do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit of having
workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped across
the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The division of
labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.
Gains from Specialization and Learning
Consider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes
in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but importing
machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United States, Japan, or
Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S., German, or Japanese
firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and particular
products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.
Specialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in international
trade, which economists call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good is produced in
stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering the
phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China, and advertising and marketing
in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication technology, sharing information, and
transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead of production in a single large factory, different
firms operating in various places and even different countries can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the
value chain, international trade often does not involve nations trading whole finished products like automobiles or
refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving
that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows
workers and firms to learn and innovate on particular products—and often to focus on very particular parts of the
value chain.

assembly of the iPhone.

Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety
A second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies
of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in Production, Costs and Industry Structure,
means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline—at least up to a point. Figure 19.3
illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the quantity
of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost of
production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of
$30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50 units, and has an average cost of production
of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an average cost of production of only $10 per
toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.
In this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a very
large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a lower price.
In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional scale of production
does not continue to reduce average costs of production.
Figure 19.3 Economies of Scale Production Plant S, has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven.
Production plant M has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production plant L has an average
cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of production of $10 per
toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of economies
of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the
economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V, despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on
average than plant L.
The concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or two large
producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the
cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a
country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no international trade, then consumers in that country
would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the paint and other nonessential
options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.
International trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies of
scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries can
Chapter 19 | International Trade
447

make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players in the
U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than when U.S.
carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai,
BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to what consumers want.
America’s car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the reason is
competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.
Dynamic Comparative Advantage
The sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies—namely, the learning that comes from a
high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale—do not contradict the
earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.
In intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the general
level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about specialized
products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker productivity. In this vision,
comparative advantage can be dynamic—that is, it can evolve and change over time as one develops new skills and
as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests that countries are not destined
to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in
comparative advantage.
19.3 | The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International
Trade
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain tarrifs as barriers to trade
•
Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade
Tariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include
protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were
used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The World Trade
Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world’s nations meet through the WTO to
negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in “rounds,” where all
countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off, and then start negotiating a new
agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because it was officially launched in Doha,
the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank summarized recent research
and found that the Doha round of negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by $160 billion to $385
billion per year, depending on the precise deal that ended up being negotiated.
In the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this
amount is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth
remembering two points.
•
First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember that
this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.
•
Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not measured
especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential advantages to
consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition among producers.
Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries, especially when firms are
splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge that can involve skills in
production, technology, management, finance, and law.
Low-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy
has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within its economy.
However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East,
and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their immediate regions. Without
448
Chapter 19 | International Trade

international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the value chain,
or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer competitive firms making goods within their
economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and prices that consumers want.
The economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains
from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for gains from trade
may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.
Visit this website (http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tradebenefits) for a list of some benefits of trade.
From Interpersonal to International Trade
Most people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process all of
their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so on. Instead,
we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.
The benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor could
increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of production
where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product become more
productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and
community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that interpersonal, intercommunity, and
interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.
International trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe. Any
economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and controversy. This
chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy
arguments over whether to restrict international trade.
It’s Apple’s (Global) iPhone
Apple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of
comparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United
States. The United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing
products, and sacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a
comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative
advantage in producing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better
ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production.
Apple, in turn, benefits because it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly
line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.

19.4 | What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute
Advantage in All Goods
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage
•
Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade
•
Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs
What happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is typical
for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment, and the most
up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than a
low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board, will there still be gains from
trade? But good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even when one
country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade
come from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.
Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage
Consider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 19.9. In this example, it
takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes one U.S.
worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States has an absolute
advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United
States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of refrigerators.

produce 1,000 units — Shoes
Number of Workers needed to produce
1,000 units — Refrigerators
United
States
4 workers
1 worker
Mexico
5 workers
4 workers
Table 19.9 Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators
Absolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question, “How
many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly
differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, “How much am I giving up
to produce this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage identifies the
good for which the producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer’s absolute productivity
disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as
Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many workers (one versus
four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is relatively
greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is
least, is in the production of shoes.
Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage
When nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both countries
can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.
Consider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as Table 19.10 shows,
if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers in the
United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes,
then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making refrigerators, and each
worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be produced.

Table 19.10 Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization
As always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one refrigerator
in terms of foregone shoe production–when labor is transferred from producing the latter to producing the former (see
Figure 19.4).
Figure 19.4 Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000
shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a
maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the
production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current resources.
Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where they end
up after trade.
Let’s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators
that is shown at point A. Table 19.11 shows the output of each good for each country and the total output for the two
countries.

Table 19.11 Total Production at Point A before Trade
Continuing with this scenario, each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage.
For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result,
U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by
Chapter 19 | International Trade
451

6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10
workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico
falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that when
both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their
combined production of both goods rises, as shown in Table 19.12. The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs
in the United States is more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500
refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.

Table 19.12 Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage Raises Total Output
This numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country has an
absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both countries can
still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and
shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage. The United
States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.
How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade
This example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By
using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades that would benefit
each country.
Mexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see
Figure 19.4 and Table 19.11). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its
comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can export no
more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators
(a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be
unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000
pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production toward its comparative advantage,
producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators
in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be
unambiguously better off.
The range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 19.13. For example, a trade where the U.S.
exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the sense that
both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.
The U.S. economy, after specialization, will
benefit if it:
The Mexican economy, after specialization, will
benefit if it:
Exports fewer than 6,000 refrigerators
Imports at least 2,500 refrigerators
Imports at least 1,500 pairs of shoes
Exports no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes
Table 19.13 The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico
Trade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to
produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production.
If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the
452
Chapter 19 | International Trade

opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost
of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of
refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take
advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.
The theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative advantages. It
shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and producing at a lower
opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and
the way to apply them to a country’s production.
Calculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage
In Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce
60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.

a.
Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?
b.
Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?
c.
Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?
d.
In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?
e.
In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?
Step 1. Make a table like Table 19.14.
Step 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in
Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber.
One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce
only 20.
Step 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both
countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor
time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is
equivalent to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the
opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one
additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela:
60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/
2 lumber. Because 1/2 lumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.
Step 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of
the equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide
each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent
labor time will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an
opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.
Step 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute
and comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.
Step 6. Canada should specialize in what it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and
Chapter 19 | International Trade
453

Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be
exporting oil and importing lumber.
Comparative Advantage Goes Camping
To build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples that
involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go camping
together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular, Jethro, has done
lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all aspects of camping: he is
faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a meal, and washing up.
So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the
work?
Of course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like most mortals,
only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be an
unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of comparative
advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative advantage—that is, the area
of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For example, it may be that Jethro is
80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering firewood and 10%
faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend
to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their
efforts according to comparative advantage, they can all gain.

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
19.1 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods
Even when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade. Gains from trade
come about as a result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it gives up the least to produce, a
country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in the area of their
comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower opportunity
cost of production in other countries.
19.2 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies
A large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-educated
workers and advanced technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they import and export the
same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of intra-industry trade between
economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from specialized learning in very particular tasks
and from economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means that several stages of producing a good take place in
different countries around the world.
19.3 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade
Tariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and for
protection against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested economic,
social, and cultural interests. The WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and negotiate in order
to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are very large, especially for smaller countries, but are
beneficial to all.

comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower opportunity
cost of production in other countries.

Protectionism
Figure 20.1 Flat Screen Competition The market for flat-panel displays in the United States is huge. The
manufacturers of flat screens in the United States must compete against manufacturers from around the world.
(Credit: modification of work by “Jemimus”/Flickr Creative Commons)
What’s the Downside of Protection?
Governments are motivated to limit and alter market outcomes for political or social ends. While governments
can limit the rise in prices of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how much
firms are willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations
can redirect economic forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.
Flat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and flat screen televisions, are an example
of such an enduring principle. In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in U.S.-
manufactured laptops were imported, primarily from Japan. The small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-
display industry filed a dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that Japanese firms
were selling displays at “less than fair value,” which made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument
for trade protection is referred to as anti-dumping. Other arguments for protection in this complaint included
national security. After a preliminary determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese firms
were dumping, the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a 63% dumping margin (or tax) on the
import of flat-panel displays. Was this a successful exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think after
reading the chapter.

Introduction to Globalism and Protectionism
In this chapter, you will learn about:
•
Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers
•
International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions
•
Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports
•
How Trade Policy Is Enacted: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally
•
The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy
The world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially economically. In 1970, imports and exports
made up 11% of U.S. GDP, while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size, is less
internationally connected than most countries. For example, according to the World Bank, 97% of Botswana’s
economic activity is connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy—the laws and strategies a country uses to
regulate international trade. This topic is not without controversy.
As the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in high-income countries like the United States,
Japan, or the nations of the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in medium-income countries
like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have lower costs of living and therefore pay lower wages. Firms and workers
in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete against more productive workers and advanced
technology in high-income countries.
On a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational firms may evade environmental protection laws
by moving their production to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading a clean environment
for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country may become overly dependent on key imported products, like oil,
which in a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears influence governments to reach the same
basic policy conclusion: to protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs, or security, imports of foreign products
should be restricted. This chapter analyzes such arguments. First, however, it is essential to learn a few key concepts
and understand how the demand and supply model applies to international trade.
20.1 | Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from
Consumers to Producers
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain protectionism and its three main forms
•
Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium
•
Calculate the effects of trade barriers
When a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in protectionism.
Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition.
Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.
Recall from International Trade that tariffs are taxes that governments impose on imported goods and services.
This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in recent years large, flat-
screen televisions imported to the U.S. from China have faced a 5% tariff rate.
Another way to control trade is through import quotas, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products
that a country can import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed a quota on
the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United States, found
themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled workers, so producers
were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to “manage” this loss of jobs and income, the
developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided the market for textile
exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers. The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004,
462
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed country would accept from each low-income country.
A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United States, which are still governed by quotas.
Nontariff barriers are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to
make it more costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as
effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff barriers in the form of “rules-of-
origin” regulations; these rules describe the “Made in Country X” label as the one in which the last substantial change
in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions may try to change the production
process so that the last big change in the product happens in his or her own country. For example, certain textiles are
made in the United States, shipped to other countries, combined with textiles made in those other countries to make
apparel—and then re-exported back to the United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a
“Made in the USA” label.
Despite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is imported
rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated
the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell from 666,360 in 2007 to 385,240 in 2012, a 42% decline. Even
more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs. However, domestic jobs that are saved by import
quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up
paying billions of dollars more for clothing each year.
When the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that product
elsewhere in the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will likely result in
some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the economy and hence
increase the number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the poorest countries of the world
who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced its barriers
to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013
Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a horrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified
analysis in the chapter will not capture.
Realizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came together in
1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We’ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the
chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose membership
includes about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. It is the primary international mechanism through
which nations negotiate their trade rules—including rules about tariffs, quotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section
examines the results of such protectionism and develops a simple model to show the impact of trade policy.
Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism
To the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign producers
and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not operate in a vacuum.
Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are business suppliers), who are also
affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of
domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as well.
Consider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply and
demand for sugar, as Table 20.1 details and Figure 20.2 illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the equilibrium price
of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade in the United States, the
equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. We label these equilibrium
points as point E in each part of the figure.
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
463

Figure 20.2 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States Before trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in
Brazil is 12 cents a pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed, businesses will
buy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in
the United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15
tons of sugar and the United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between the countries, it
will lead to an outcome between the free-trade and no-trade possibilities.

Table 20.1 The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States
If international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will spot an
opportunity: buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States. As sugar is shipped from
Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian consumption (with
the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less than the amount of U.S.
consumption (with the extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will reduce the sugar supply in
464
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism

Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar supply, lowering its price. When the
sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade further. As Figure 20.2 shows, the equilibrium
with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price, the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40
tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.
The extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the demand curve and the supply curve
in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce a quantity
of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers,
shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is supplied by imported
sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall gains from
trade, as Figure 20.3 shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in Demand and Supply and Demand,
Supply, and Efficiency in terms of consumer and producer surplus, Figure 20.3 (a) shows that producers in Brazil
gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while Figure 20.3 (b) shows consumers in the United States benefit
from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade
consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S. producers of sugar are worse off. There are gains
from trade—an increase in social surplus in each country. That is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than
they would be without trade. The following Clear It Up feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income
countries.
Figure 20.3 Free Trade of Sugar Free trade results in gains from trade. Total surplus increases in both countries,
as the two blue-shaded areas show. However, there are clear income distribution effects. Producers gain in the
exporting country, while consumers lose; and in the importing country, consumers gain and producers lose.

Why are there low-income countries?
Why are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise
you: the trade policies of the high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities which the
international aid organization, Oxfam International has widely publicized.
High-income countries of the world—primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union,
and Japan—subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $360 billion per year. By contrast, the total
amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to the poor countries of the world is about $70
billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why does this matter?
It matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of
farmers in low-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton,
rice, sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm subsidies in the high-
income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in
supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production. As Michael Gerson of the
Washington Post describes it: “[T]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic . . .
keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton
farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a dollar a day. . . . Who benefits from the current
system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers, with an average annual income of more than
$125,000.”
As if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block agricultural exports from low-income
countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries,
having bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries
and drive local farmers out of business altogether.
For example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship
for Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of
low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just
by domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers—and for many agricultural products, those foreign
producers are the world’s poor.
Now, let’s look at what happens with protectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they could
be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar production, more
jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the United States government
sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the result will be that the quantity of sugar
traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in each country will return to the levels before trade
was allowed.
Blocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons.
The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no more than
seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20 cents, which is
466
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil
can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14 cents per pound, which is the price
where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic demand.
In general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be
somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following Work It Out
explores the impact of these trade barriers.
Effects of Trade Barriers
Let’s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient
to eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller
quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can
measure the effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we
developed in Demand, Supply, and Efficiency: consumer surplus and producer surplus.
Figure 20.4 U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand
When there is free trade, the equilibrium is at point A.
When there is no trade, the equilibrium is at point E.
Step 1. Look at Figure 20.4, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the
United States.
Step 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic
Quantity Demanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of PTrade.
Step 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.
Step 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get beyond what they paid for when they
buy a product. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer
surplus in the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points PTrade, A, and B.
Step 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit—it is the income producers get above
the cost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade
is the area of the triangle formed by the points Ptrade, C, and D.
Step 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to PNoTrade.
Look what happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity
supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the
producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and D.
Step 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.
Step 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
467

instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle PNoTrade, E, and B.
Step 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area Ptrade, C, E, PNoTrade. The loss
of consumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area Ptrade, A, E, PNoTrade. In other words, consumers lose
more than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.
Who Benefits and Who Pays?
Using the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in each of
the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly positive. Without a
need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For consumers in the country
with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is clearly negative. They end up buying
a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to the equilibrium price
and quantity with trade. The following Clear It Up feature considers why a country might outsource jobs even for a
domestic product.
Why are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?
In 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio.
Starting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion Life
Savers a year, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it would close the
Michigan plant and move Life Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.
One reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that
are not linked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the
sugar price high for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and
strict quotas on imported sugar. According to the Coalition for Sugar Reform, from 2009 to 2012, the price of
refined sugar in the United States ranged from 64% to 92% higher than the world price. Life Saver production
uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.
A number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production.
From 1997 to 2011, sugar-using industries eliminated some 127,000 jobs, or more than seven times the total
employment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the
costs are spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because
of elevated sugar costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business.
Because of the sugar subsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output
profitably, or at all, in the United States market.
The fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not always
acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic producers, there
would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a method of requiring
consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers pay for it through higher prices, rather
than a direct government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers. However, protectionism works like a
subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined “tariff” this way in his 1911 book, The Devil’s
Dictionary: “Tariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his
consumer.”
The effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When a government uses
an import quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower price for the sugar they
sell in Brazil—but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United States. Notice that some of
the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of foreign producers in this case.
Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of sugar that they pay
(compared to the free-trade situation). On the other hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work
468

as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes and jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes,
Brazilian consumers would miss out on better prices for imported goods—which do not appear in our single-market
example of sugar protectionism.
The effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a
product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers
of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been able
to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts
that we discuss in International Trade.
20.2 | International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages,
and Working Conditions
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Discuss how international trade influences the job market
•
Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism
•
Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and working conditions
In theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor working
conditions. Let’s consider these in turn.
Fewer Jobs?
In the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with
Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States,
Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments,
that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a “giant sucking sound” as U.S. employers
relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in Mexico were, at that time, about
one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it
took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job growth and low
unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs
were proven wrong.
This result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for decades, not
just since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs, then the United States should have been seeing
a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment
rates—according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2007 to late 2009, the unemployment rate rose from
4.4% to 10%. It has since fallen back to under 5% as of the end of 2016—the number of jobs is not falling over
extended periods of time. The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 145 million in 2014.
Protectionism certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in other
unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they inevitably have
less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries. Second, if a firm
sells the protected product to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input, then those
firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs.
The hidden opportunity cost of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries.
This is why the United States International Trade Commission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing
trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import
protections to industries that are protected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.
Moreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have
attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism. Table 20.2 shows a
sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through protectionism
typically costs much more than the actual worker’s salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence
that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry would cost $199,000 per job saved.
In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to be unemployed and the cost would only be
half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This result is not unique to textiles and

Table 20.2 Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism
(Source: Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas)
Why does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra money that
consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government imposes tariffs on steel
imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment, pay
bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees—and also avoid firing some additional workers.
Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when an industry is protected, the
economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage—in other words, producing what it is
best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which
we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what we discussed in Labor and Financial Markets.
There’s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: “Buy
American—Save U.S. Jobs.” If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: “Block Imports—Save
Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.”
Trade and Wages
Even if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues about
the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade.
Because trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their comparative
advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who can produce more
will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the right, and increase wages
in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an economy.
However, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in
industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for their labor decreases
and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade. Conversely, workers in
industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their labor shifts out to the right, so
that trade raises their wages.

trade coffee.
One concern is that while globalization may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States, it
may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit
from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United
States has a comparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low-
wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the wages of low-skilled
U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that while globalization has helped
some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans.
First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S. trades similar goods with other high-wage
economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2
million cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported several million cars from other countries.
Most U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages—and many of them do quite well in
the world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a small
impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor market is. In
other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect of trade on low-
wage workers depends considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt in other parts of the
economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the
impact of trade on low income workers is small.
Second, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports from low-wage countries cannot replace. For
example, we cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from countries long
distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the primary determinant of their
wages.
Finally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer
due to protectionism in all the industries—even those in which they do not work. For example, food and clothing are
protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic necessities and as such their
dollar stretches over fewer goods.
The benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the economy.
However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a whole—and thus
helped to raise the average level of wages.
Labor Standards and Working Conditions
Workers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker
in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid less
than the United States minimum wage. For example, in the United States, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A
typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per day, or often much less. Moreover, working
conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may
involve the child labor or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These concerns over foreign labor standards
do not affect most of U.S. trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have
labor standards similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
471

In thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is truly
unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little difficulty with the idea
that production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support
aggressive efforts to eliminate such practices—including shutting out imported products made with such labor. Many
cases, however, are less clear-cut. An opinion article in the New York Times several years ago described the case of
Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of
school in second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his
co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as Ahmed
says of his carpet-weaving job: “This makes much more money and is more comfortable.”
Other workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real
problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their lives worse,
but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar situations during the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
In closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards
in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to protect employees.
According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. is
the only one of 41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for new parents, and among the 40 countries
that do mandate paid leave, the minimum duration is about two months. Many European workers receive six weeks
or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States, vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European
countries accused the United States of using unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced
that they would shut out all U.S. imports until the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national
holidays, and doubled vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about
restricting imports from poor countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a
very similar argument. This is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue.
They are. However, linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real
question to ask: “What are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world
over?”
20.3 | Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of restricting imports, including the infant
industry argument, the anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the unsafe
consumer products argument, and the national interest argument
•
Explain dumping and race to the bottom
•
Evaluate the significance of countries’ perceptions on the benefits of growing trade
As we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product to pay higher prices to benefit
domestic producers of that product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic gains achieved
through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale. With these overall
costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support restricting imports.
The Infant Industry Argument
Imagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a low
enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians, business leaders,
and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed to face international
competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills, management, technology, and
economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the infant industry
argument for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before
it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit Macroeconomic Policy Around the World
(http://cnx.org/content/m64022/latest/) for more information on the infant industry argument.)
The infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy
472
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy industry.
Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to senility and
obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the protectionism that was
supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.
As one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an
attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of computer products
for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers. However, by the mid-1980s, due
to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date industry, typically lagging behind world
standards for price and performance by three to five years—a long time in this fast-moving industry. After more than
a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid
the costs and Brazil’s computer industry never competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant
industry policy for the computer industry.
Protectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has provided
little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in East Asia offer an
exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a package of indirect
and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign competition and government
loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example, subsidies helped get their
domestic steel and auto industries up and running.
Why did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early 1990
World Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:
1.
Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where your
country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.
2.
Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on
having the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on
many other industries.
3.
Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.
In Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in
global markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government could phase out
protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the government could phase
out protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.
Following these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will receive
the benefits of treatment as “infants” and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies. Also, if the
country's government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few key industries, it
has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions, and government support
of research and development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is not the only or even the best way
to support key industries.

The Anti-Dumping Argument
Dumping refers to selling goods below their cost of production. Anti-dumping laws block imports that are sold
below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of
production. Since dumping is not allowed under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, nations that believe they
are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO. Anti-dumping complaints have risen
in recent years, from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s.
Note that dumping cases are countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case
filings go down. Individual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S.
government has dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2009, for example, some U.S.
imports that were under anti-dumping orders included pasta from Turkey, steel pipe fittings from Thailand, pressure-
sensitive plastic tape from Italy, preserved mushrooms and lined paper products from India, and cut-to-length carbon
steel and non-frozen apple juice concentrate from China.
Why Might Dumping Occur?
Why would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production—which presumably means taking a loss?
This question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.
The innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps demand
for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to low levels—even
below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example, it may sell goods at
below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of steel or computer chips or
machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of production—this may be the market in action.
The sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the
cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S. competition, they then
raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we discuss in the Monopoly chapter.
Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?
Anti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in economic theory? How much sense do
they make as practical policy?
In terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and supply, the
government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are difficult for producers,
but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign producers have driven out
domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign
producers typically continue competing hard against each other and providing low prices to consumers. In short, it is
difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms exporting to the United States.
Even if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short term,
and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping investigations
often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged with calculating the
appropriate “cost of production,” which can be as much an art as a science.
For example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it count part of the factory’s cost in this year’s
cost of production? When a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like China for example,
how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly enough, government
regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern has arisen where a domestic
industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in imports, and then the
domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-dumping cases often appear to be little more than
a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.
In the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost all
the anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and
India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping cases
has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the anti-dumping
actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping laws.
The Environmental Protection Argument
The potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an
474
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col23750/1.2

environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: “The consequences of globalization for the environment are not
good. … Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess
that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy enough of the planet’s basic biological
and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically compromised.”
If free trade meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism! While
globalization—and economic activity of all kinds—can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible that, with
the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize the environmental impacts of trade. In some cases, trade may
even bring environmental benefits.
In general, high-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Japan, and the nations of the European Union
have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and low-income countries like Brazil, Nigeria,
India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view of the governments of such countries is that
environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life
expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such as sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air
pollution from factory smokestacks, and national parks to protect wildlife.
This gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome
possibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the “race to the bottom” scenario and the question of how quickly
environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.
The Race to the Bottom Scenario
The race to the bottom scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this. Profit-seeking multinational
companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak
standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. Faced with such behavior, countries reduce their
environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all, provide jobs and economic clout. As a result,
global production becomes concentrated in countries where firms can pollute the most and environmental laws
everywhere “race to the bottom.”
Although the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial
incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker environmental rules does
not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they look at many different factors:
the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable suppliers of the inputs that they
need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation, communications, and electrical power
networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the local government. The cost of environmental
regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are no more than 1 to 2% of the costs that a large
industrial plant faces. The other factors that determine location are much more important to these companies than
trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.
When an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental laws, it
typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter environmental standards.
Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex and costly task, and so if a plant
works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design everywhere. Also, companies realize
that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely to cost them a substantial amount of
money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales—by building up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize
such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned plants in low-income countries often have a better record of
compliance with environmental laws than do locally-owned plants.
Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards
In some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce their
environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure these countries
into adopting stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income countries, along with
stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping to reduce the illegal poaching
of elephants in certain African countries.
However, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to dictate
to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or how they
should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries
want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options other than the threat of
protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution equipment in low-income countries,
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
475

or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help pay for and carry out the scientific and
economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income countries to make a more persuasive case for the
economic benefits of protecting the environment.
After all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income
countries—agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like “this
tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe” or “this product made only with wood not taken from rainforests,” so
that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also reinforces these values, by
sponsoring treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming, the preservation of biodiversity, the
spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries that share a national border or are within a
region often sign environmental agreements about air and water rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware
of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.
Finally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more strict
environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other high-income
countries. Many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries than the United States.
The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument
One argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer rights
groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their health and
safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the subject in this way:
“It allows countries to set their own standards.” It also says “regulations must be based on science. . . . And they
should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.”
Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States to pass laws requiring that all food
products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards approved by the United States government,
whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards. However, such standards must have some scientific
basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety standards for domestically produced goods but a different
set of standards for imports, or one set of standards for imports from Europe and a different set of standards for
imports from Latin America.
In 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead in the
paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. More recently, in 2013,
Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included
in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.
The National Interest Argument
Some argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products, such
as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. On closer consideration,
this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.
As an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all the energy and 25% of the oil used in the United
States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East have shifted
the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt across the United States
economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports. If the United States needs to
be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would be to import 100% of the
petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut off. It might also
be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an emergency, as the United States government did
by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to discourage people from using
oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to
raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no sense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States
economy, then the United States should shut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S.
domestic oil production is increasing. Shale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.
Whether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to national
security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons’ builders are not confident that they can
continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use this key product,
or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech components or materials to
last through an armed conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that has built up reserves of many
476
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism

materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although
many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent years). Think every country is pro-trade? How about
the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.
How does the United States really feel about expanding trade?
How do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew
Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing
trade ties between countries. Table 20.3 shows the percentages who answered either “very good” or
“somewhat good” for some of countries surveyed.
For those who think of the United States as the world’s leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey
results may be perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between
countries is “very good” or “somewhat good,” Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing
globalization, while the Chinese and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed,
the United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.

One final reason why economists often treat the national interest argument skeptically is that lobbyists and
politicians can tout almost any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became worried that
it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be “strategic
materials” and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although the government removed wool from
the official list of “strategic” materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for almost 40 years until the
government repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too often, the national interest argument has
become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to certain industries or companies. After all,
politicians, not nonpartisan analysts make decisions about what constitutes a key strategic material.

Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
•

•

•
Evaluate long-term trends in barriers to trade
These public policy arguments about how nations should react to globalization and trade are fought out at several
levels: at the global level through the World Trade Organization and through regional trade agreements between pairs
or groups of countries.
The World Trade Organization
The World Trade Organization (WTO) was officially born in 1995, but its history is much longer. In the years after the
Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the
world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest
people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues raised by international financial
transactions, were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was to be an International Trade Organization,
which would manage international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a
forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the
GATT transformed into the WTO.
The GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while,
and then start negotiating the next agreement. Table 20.4 shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO.
Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of countries, and
focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks have taken years,
included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.

Table 20.4 The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization
The sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman’s Agreement to
Talk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having dozens
of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain industries,
like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the low-income countries. There were rules,
exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in every case. Like the
GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on others. The total staff
of the WTO in 2014 is 640 people and its annual budget (as of 2014) is $197 million, which makes it smaller in size
than many large universities.
Regional Trading Agreements
There are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging from free trade agreements, in which
participants allow each other’s imports without tariffs or quotas, to common markets, in which participants have a
common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to full economic unions, in which, in addition
to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations belong both to the World Trade
Organization and to regional trading agreements.
The best known of these regional trading agreements is the European Union. In the years after World War II, leaders
of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they might be more
likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association, evolved into a common
market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the European Union. The EU, as it is
often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it introduced a common currency for Europe, the
euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of money like the German mark and the French franc, though
a few have retained their own currency. Another key element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of
goods, labor, and capital across Europe.
For the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading agreements,
like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries, and a free trade
agreement with Israel.
The world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now in
place. Table 20.5 lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just agreements to continue talking. Others set
specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described the current trade
treaties as a “spaghetti bowl,” which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries with trade treaties looks
like.
There is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise free
trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from anywhere
else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of the World Trade
Organization.

Trade Policy at the National Level
Yet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and regional trade agreements, happens at the national
level. The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such imports would drive
down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the United States Department
of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from other countries. The United States International Trade
Commission—a government agency—determines whether the dumping has substantially injured domestic industries,
and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.
In the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and
international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or negotiate
agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously negotiating to reduce
trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements offer a method for countries to
restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on
imports: “Sure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement just won’t let me.”

If consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because
it is easier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group
that has diffuse interests (consumers). This is a question about trade policy theory. Visit this website
(http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tradepolicy) and read the article by Jonathan Rauch.
Long-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade
In newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and acrimony. Countries are almost constantly
threatening to challenge other nations' “unfair” trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute settlement
procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements. Politicians in national
legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will “establish a fair playing field” or “prevent
unfair trade”—although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing more restrictions on
trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international trade.
Through all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average
level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990, after decades of
GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing
on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been reduced so dramatically there was
not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern: After rising sharply during the Great
Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the century. Although measures of import quotas and
nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they generally appear to be at lower levels than they had been
previously, too.
Thus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs,
import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have made international
trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information management. The result has been the
powerful surge of international trade.
20.5 | The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
•
Asses the complexity of international trade
•
Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade
•
Explain disruptive market change
Economists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time,
the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and higher wages
because of the benefits of specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from
shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices. The “average person,”
however, is hypothetical, not real—representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who have done all
right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or
on the success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate. Workers in other countries, the environment,
and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national economy are also all
Chapter 20 | Globalization and Protectionism
481

legitimate issues.
The common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with the costs
and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.
To gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called
Technotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and quality
of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in
this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers—and some of the competing firms will even go
bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it illegal
for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies would oppose trying
to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for society providing temporary
support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would argue for government support
of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills. Government might also support research and
development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new technology
altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused
so much disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical
technology because they might cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people
view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.
Now, imagine that Technotron’s new “technology” is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from
another country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective situation is
now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron’s new technology—which in this case is importing goods
from another county—other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as it would have been
inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it
down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of international trade by trying to
restrict trade.
Some workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented economy,
some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons. Corporate
management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more or less productive. Tough domestic
competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new product is a hit with
consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad
luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for expanding productivity and jobs; for other
firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not fundamentally different
from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings of a market economy.
In other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or
does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular disruptive market change—a new
technology—that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any of the other possible
costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do not involve
protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues resulting from these
disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur.
What’s the Downside of Protection?
The domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin
tax. Flat-panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers—as much
as 50%. Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-
manufactured laptops. As a result of the ITC’s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for
Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing
plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead
deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case, rather than having the desired effect
of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured
elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing completely out of the country. Many

KEY CONCEPTS AND SUMMARY
20.1 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers
There are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a country
places limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses tariffs, quotas, or nontariff barriers, it is said
to be practicing protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected good in the domestic market, which
causes domestic consumers to pay more, but domestic producers to earn more.
20.2 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions
As international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that economy does not
have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The degree to
which trade affects labor markets has much to do with the structure of the labor market in that country and the
adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by increasing productivity.
However, this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain jobs and industries and losses
to others.

In thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is unpleasant to
think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long working hours in poor countries
are unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be the best option open
to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many countries refuse to import
products made using these practices.
20.3 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports
There are a number of arguments that support restricting imports. These arguments are based around industry and
competition, environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.
The infant industry argument for protectionism is that small domestic industries need to be temporarily nurtured and
protected from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into strong competitors. In some cases, notably
in East Asia, this approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never grow up. On the other hand,
arguments against dumping (which is setting prices below the cost of production to drive competitors out of the
market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for imposing protectionism.
Low-income countries typically have lower environmental standards than high-income countries because they are
more worried about immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However, except for a small number
of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner environment.
Finally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, countries
are allowed to set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the standards must be the same for domestic
products as for imported products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The national interest argument
for protectionism holds that it is unwise to import certain key products because if the nation becomes dependent on
key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a cutoff. However, it is often wiser to stockpile resources and to use
foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively restricting foreign supplies so as not to become dependent
on them.
20.4 How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally
Governments determine trade policy at many different levels: administrative agencies within government, laws
passed by the legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations (sometimes just two), and global
negotiations through the World Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century, trade barriers
have, in general, declined quite substantially in the United States economy and in the global economy. One reason
why countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves to free trade is to give themselves protection
against their own special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from foreign producers, politicians can
point out that, because of the trade treaty, their hands are tied.
20.5 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy
International trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or international
competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise and fall. Government has a role
to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it would be unwise in the long
term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic markets, it would be unwise to
clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it economic benefits.

37.
What are some ways that governments can help
people who lose from trade?
CRITICAL THINKING QUESTIONS
38.
Show graphically that for any tariff, there is an
equivalent quota that would give the same result. What
would be the difference, then, between the two types of
trade barriers? Hint: It is not something you can see from
the graph.
39. From the Work It Out "Effects of Trade Barriers,"
you can see that a tariff raises the price of imports.
What is interesting is that the price rises by less than
the amount of the tariff. Who pays the rest of the tariff
amount? Can you show this graphically?
40.
If trade barriers hurt the average worker in an
economy (due to lower wages), why does government
create trade barriers?
41.
Why do you think labor standards and working
conditions are lower in the low-income countries of the
world than in countries like the United States?
42.
How would direct subsidies to key industries be
preferable to tariffs or quotas?
43. How can governments identify good candidates for
infant industry protection? Can you suggest some key
characteristics of good candidates? Why are industries
like computers not good candidates for infant industry
protection?
44.
Microeconomic
theory
argues
that
it
is
economically rationale (and profitable) to sell additional
output as long as the price covers the variable costs of
production. How is this relevant to the determination of
whether dumping has occurred?
45.
How do you think Americans would feel if other
countries began to urge the United States to increase
environmental standards?
46. Is it legitimate to impose higher safety standards on
imported goods that exist in the foreign country where
the goods were produced?
47. Why might the unsafe consumer products argument
be a more effective strategy (from the perspective of the
importing country) than using tariffs or quotas to restrict
imports?
48.
Why might a tax on domestic consumption of
resources critical for national security be a more
efficient approach than barriers to imports?
49. Why do you think that the GATT rounds and, more
recently, WTO negotiations have become longer and
more difficult to resolve?
50.
An economic union requires giving up some
political autonomy to succeed. What are some examples
of political power countries must give up to be members
of an economic union?
51.
What are some examples of innovative products
that have disrupted their industries for the better?
52. In principle, the benefits of international trade to a
country exceed the costs, no matter whether the country
is importing or exporting. In practice, it is not always
possible to compensate the losers in a country, for
example, workers who lose their jobs due to foreign
imports. In your opinion, does that mean that trade
should be inhibited to prevent the losses?
53.
Economists sometimes say that protectionism is
the “second-best” choice for dealing with any particular
problem. What they mean is that there is often a policy
choice that is more direct or effective for dealing with
the problem—a choice that would still allow the benefits
of trade to occur. Explain why protectionism is a
“second-best” choice for:
a.
helping workers as a group
b.
helping industries stay strong
c.
protecting the environment
d.
advancing national defense
54. Trade has income distribution effects. For example,
suppose
that
because
of
a
government-negotiated
reduction in trade barriers, trade between Germany and
the Czech Republic increases. Germany sells house
paint to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic sells
alarm clocks to Germany. Would you expect this pattern
of trade to increase or decrease jobs and wages in the
paint industry in Germany? The alarm clock industry in
Germany? The paint industry in Czech Republic? The
alarm clock industry in Czech Republic? What has to
happen for there to be no increase in total unemployment
in both countries?

A | The Use of Mathematics
in Principles of Economics
(This appendix should be consulted after first reading Welcome to Economics!) Economics is not math. There is
no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool that can be
used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Instead of a picture,
think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive insights about economic
issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.
There are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a
nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you specify
exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you reduce a model
to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are necessarily based on
simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack the nuances
which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even always the
best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school
algebra and graphs. You will need to know:
•
What a function is
•
How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)
•
How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)
•
How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)
•
How to read and manipulate a graph
In this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math
in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has diminishing
returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge
that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider learning a little calculus. It
will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.
Algebraic Models
Often economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function?
A function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your
professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn +
Margaret.
Often in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained
(“the effect”). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For example, suppose your GPA
was determined as follows:
GPA = 0.25 × combined_SAT + 0.25 × class_attendance + 0.50 × hours_spent_studying
This equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the
number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined_SAT
score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping
class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you
have (presumably) already taken the SATs.

Most of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:
Appendix A
489

y = b + mx
Expressing Equations Graphically
Graphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display statistics or
data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.
To a mathematician or an economist, a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In
the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical
axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this equation works, consider
a numerical example:
y = 9 + 3x
In this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3. Table
A1 shows the values of x and y for this given equation. Figure A1 shows this equation, and these values, in a graph.
To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of y results. In the
figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.

Table A1 Values for the Slope Intercept Equation
Figure A1 Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines This line graph has x on the horizontal axis and y on the
vertical axis. The y-intercept—that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line is 3;
that is, there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all
along a straight line.
This example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The
490
Appendix A

b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line
intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for
the line is the slope. Remember that slope is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one
point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each
time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a
y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although
it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line
can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.
Interpreting the Slope
The concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A
positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases,
y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line
rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in Figure A3 later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn
in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when
the price is higher.
A negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x
decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right,
the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in Figure A4 later in this appendix, has a negative slope.
We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less
when the price is higher.
A slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over
the run. Figure A5 of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many
line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other
segments where the slope is close to zero.
The slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by
designating one point as the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then calculating the rise
over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points
representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:
Rise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)
 = 0.100 – 0.307
 = –0.207
Run: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)
= 6,000 – 4,000
= 2,000
Thus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000
meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next 1,000 meters.
Suppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line
were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was positive or negative
to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a
flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper
downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has an infinite slope.
Suppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to
the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.
Solving Models with Algebra
Economists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the economy
grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the “system” of equations that represent the
model.
Suppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:
Appendix A
491

Qd = 16 – 2P
where Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price of
pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:
Qs = 2 + 5P
where Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).
Finally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or
Qd = Qs
We now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and P), which we can solve with algebra:
Since Qd = Qs, we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:
Qd  = Qs
16 – 2P  = 2 + 5P
Subtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:
16 – 2P – 2  = 2 + 5P – 2
14 – 2P  = 5P
14 – 2P + 2P  = 5P + 2P
14  = 7P
14
7
 = 7P
7
2  = P
In other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?
Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:
Qd  = 16 – 2P
 = 16 – 2(2)
 = 16 – 4
 = 12
So if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will producers supply? Taking the price of $2, and
plugging it into the supply equation, we get:
Qs  = 2 + 5P
 = 2 + 5(2)
 = 2 + 10
 = 12
So if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas. This means we did our math correctly, since Qd
= Qs.
Solving Models with Graphs
If algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and
graph them on the same set of axes as shown in Figure A2. Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve
each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 – 0.5Qd and the demand curve is P = –0.4 + 0.2Qs. Note that
the vertical intercepts are 8 and –0.4, and the slopes are –0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you draw the graphs
carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12, just like the algebra
predicted.

Figure A2 Supply and Demand Graph The equations for Qd and Qs are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.
We will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.
Growth Rates
Growth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage change in
some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It could be a nation’s GDP. The formula for
computing a growth rate is straightforward:
Percentage change  = Change in quantity
Quantity
Suppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per
hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.
To compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP
over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined
the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when
we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the
period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is
harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation’s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03
trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion)
divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:
 = 
$1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion
($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion) / 2
 = 
0.03
1.015
 = 0.0296
 = 2.96% growth
Note that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion
= 3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough
approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.
A few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means the
quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A negative growth
rate means the quantity is decreasing.
The same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth
rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or
16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is
this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.
Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph
Graphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They
Appendix A
493

condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen
more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long
list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching
through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal
population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and
for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.
Three types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also
provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the relationships in the data.
Line Graphs
The graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs, because they show a relationship between two variables:
one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.
Sometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in Table A2 is displayed in
Figure A3 which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby boys
and girls during the first three years of life. (The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half
weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis.
For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19
pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship
for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child’s physical development
is roughly on track.
Figure A3 The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls
The line graph shows the relationship
between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28
inches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis).
These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.

Table A2 Length to Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls
Not all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves. Figure A4 presents another example of a
line graph, representing the data from Table A3. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when
you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The
vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic
meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is
heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. Figure A4 shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude
of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude increases, air density
decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms.
The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of
a mountain.
Figure A4 Altitude-Air Density Relationship This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in
meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density
declines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the
horizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).

Table A3 Altitude to Air Density Relationship
The length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent averages. If
you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations
will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather
conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line
graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below.
In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way
that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics
and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical
underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some
point.
One common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis
displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. Figure A5 shows the
unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who
want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in each year are plotted

on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate has moved up and down since
1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during this time period
was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s
to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the
recession from 2008–2009.
Figure A5 U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975–2014 This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment
data. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.
Pie Graphs
A pie graph (sometimes called a pie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle
represents a group as a whole. The slices of this circular “pie” show the relative sizes of subgroups.
Figure A6 shows how the U.S. population was divided among children, working age adults, and the elderly in 1970,
2000, and what is projected for 2030. The information is first conveyed with numbers in Table A4, and then in three
pie charts. The first column of Table A4 shows the total U.S. population for each of the three years. Columns 2–4
categorize the total in terms of age groups—from birth to 18 years, from 19 to 64 years, and 65 years and above.
In columns 2–4, the first number shows the actual number of people in each age category, while the number in
parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by that age group.

Figure A6 Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions)
The three pie graphs illustrate the
division of total population into three age groups for the three different years.
In a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be half
of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs in Figure A6 show that the share of the U.S.
population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the different age
groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers and percentages in the
table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the population into groups by age, income
level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into categories by size, industry, number of employees;
and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main categories.
Bar Graphs
A bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities. Table A5 lists the 12 most populous countries in
the world. Figure A7 provides this same data in a bar graph. The height of the bars corresponds to the population of
each country. Although you may know that China and India are the most populous countries in the world, seeing how
the bars on the graph tower over the other countries helps illustrate the magnitude of the difference between the sizes
of national populations.

Bar graphs can be subdivided in a way that reveals information similar to that we can get from pie charts. Figure
A8 offers three bar graphs based on the information from Figure A6 about the U.S. age distribution in 1970, 2000,
and 2030. Figure A8 (a) shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket
for each year. Figure A8 (b) shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside
the bar. In Figure A8 (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures percentages rather than the number
of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height, representing 100% of the population, with each bar
divided according to the percentage of population in each age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run his or
her eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.
Appendix A

Figure A8 U.S. Population with Bar Graphs Population data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows
three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just
one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a
measure of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is
divided according to the percentage of population in each age group.
Figure A7 and Figure A8 show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can
represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and other
quantitative categories.
Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs
Now that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for your
data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if a pie graph
has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.
Bar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of
different countries, as in Figure A7, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of multiple
countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different groups within the
population.
A line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both
changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate over time.

Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold,
the size of the economy.
How Graphs Can Be Misleading
Graphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can
be done, consider the line graphs of Figure A9, Figure A10, and Figure A11. These graphs all illustrate the
unemployment rate—but from different perspectives.

Figure A11 Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate Simply changing the
width and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.
Suppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that
large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in Figure A9 (a).
Figure A9 (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in Figure A5, but stretches the horizontal axis
out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise
in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted
to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can
stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in Figure A9 (b), which makes all rises and falls in
unemployment appear larger.
A similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical
axis. In Figure A10 (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in Figure A10 (d), the vertical
axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to Figure A5, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, Figure A10 (c)
makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while Figure A10 (d) makes it look larger.
Another way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points
plotted on the graph. Figure A10 (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging
out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the
unemployment rate is reported monthly, and Figure A11 (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate
more than the five-year average. Figure A11 (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of
data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points.
Appendix A
503

Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive
sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.
A final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending
points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show
a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s,
early 2000s, and late 2000s. Figure A11 (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an
impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back
up to its “original” level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.
These kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”— are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart
with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used to produce these
slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can
make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more
or less.
Being able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or point
of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick impression
from a graph. View with caution.
Key Concepts and Summary
Math is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using
algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and
y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is
the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic
variables.
Economic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They
can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an
intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown
on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of
money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of
the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like
a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.
Any graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such
as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal
axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically,
remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.

B | Indifference Curves
Economists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people’s preferences. In Consumer Choices, the
level of utility that a person receives is described in numerical terms. This appendix presents an alternative approach
to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using numbers to measure
utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility—an assumption that many students
and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic—the indifference curve framework helps to clarify the logic of the
underlying model.
What Is an Indifference Curve?
People cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify what
choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows combinations
of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example, Figure B1 presents three indifference
curves that represent Lilly’s preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main relaxation activities: eating
doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh) represents one level of utility.
First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then we will look at the indifference curves
as a group.
Figure B1 Lilly’s Indifference Curves Lilly would receive equal utility from all points on a given indifference curve.
Any points on the highest indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points like A, B, C, and D on
the middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility
than any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.
The Shape of an Indifference Curve
The indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents a set
of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged according to her
personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84 doughnuts (point B)
from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D). She would also receive the
same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference curve.
Appendix B
505

Indifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right; 2)
they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The
downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of the other,
while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um, which means
that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, the marginal utility that Lilly would gain from, say,
increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her
consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84—so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A
and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve as the marginal rate of substitution, which is the rate at which a
person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same.
Indifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape involves
diminishing marginal utility—the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal utility from each
additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide Lilly an equal amount
of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C and D. In both choices, Lilly
consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts falls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and
between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this difference is that points A and C are different
starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal utility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many
doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will be relatively high while the marginal utility of additional
doughnuts is relatively low—so on the margin, it will take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility
from the marginal book. At point C, however, Lilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point,
her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional
doughnuts would be relatively high—so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset
the change of one marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of
substitution—that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant—also
changes, as a result of diminishing marginal utility of both goods.
The Field of Indifference Curves
Each indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will have its
own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly’s preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves lying nestled
together on the diagram—even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three levels of utility, appear
on Figure B1. In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn on this diagram—but you
should remember that they exist.
Higher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. In Figure B1, indifference curve Ul
can be thought of as a “low” level of utility, while Um is a “medium” level of utility and Uh is a “high” level of utility.
All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um, which in turn
are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.
To understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference curve Um
to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three) and doughnuts
(100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference curve—that all the
points on the curve have the same level of utility—if point F on indifference curve Uh is preferred to point B on
indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh have a higher level of utility than
all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve, like Ul, you can identify a point on a
higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of both goods. Since one point on the higher
indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and since all the points on a given indifference curve
have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on higher indifference curves have greater utility than all
points on lower indifference curves.
These arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not require any
numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on the assumptions that
when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if they are keeping the same
level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they receive from additional units of that
good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference curves can be mapped out to describe the
preferences of any individual.
The Individuality of Indifference Curves
Each person determines his or her own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same general
shape—they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right—the specific shape of indifference
506
Appendix B

curves can be different for every person. Figure B1, for example, applies only to Lilly’s preferences. Indifference
curves for other people would probably travel through different points.
Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves
People seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference curve.
However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually possible.
Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve
Return to the situation of Lilly’s choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6, doughnuts
are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in
Figure B2. Along with the budget line are shown the three indifference curves from Figure B1. What is Lilly’s
utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.
Figure B2 Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint Lilly’s preferences are shown by the indifference curves.
Lilly’s budget constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is shown by the straight line. Lilly’s
optimal choice will be point B, where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly would have more
utility at a point like F on the higher indifference curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher indifference
curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on indifference
curve Ul and thus provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.
The choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference curve
Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly’s budget constraint. The choice of H with
three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside Lilly’s budget set, and
as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself. Choices B and G are both on
the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower indifference curve Ul than choice
B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If Lilly were to start at choice G, and
then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from doughnuts and books, she would decide that
some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her happier—which would cause her to move toward her
preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly’s personal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves,
and Lilly’s opportunity set, which is determined by prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.
The highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an infinite
number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there will always
exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher indifference curves,
like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that indifference curve would provide
Appendix B
507

higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower indifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget
line in two separate places. When one indifference curve crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be
another, higher, attainable indifference curve sitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.
Changes in Income
A rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the new budget constraint will
now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction in income will cause
the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve, representing
a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how much will a person alter consumption of
books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%, or will the quantity of one good rise substantially,
while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even declines?
Since personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response to
changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in Figure B3
(a) and Figure B3 (b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts that cost $1
and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on Manuel’s preferences,
as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set occurs where his
opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with three movies and 28 yogurts, while
Natasha’s utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be seven movies and 12 yogurts.
Figure B3 Manuel and Natasha’s Indifference Curves Manuel and Natasha originally face the same budget
constraints; that is, same prices and same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their preferences
are not the same. (a) Manuel’s original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the
higher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha’s original choice (Y)
involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when
budget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in
response to a change in income.
Now, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As
shown in Figure B3 (a), Manuel’s new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts—that is,
Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha’s new utility maximizing choice at Z will
be eight movies and 28 yogurts—that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In this way, the
indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are normal goods, then
the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them—although exactly how much more
is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response to a higher level of income
508
Appendix B

will be to purchase less of it.
Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income
Effects
A higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower indifference
curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the opportunity set to
shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an increased level of utility. Exactly
how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good will depend on personal preferences.
Anyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an income
effect. The substitution effect is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out substitutes. If oranges
become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins. Conversely,
when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If oranges get cheaper, people fire up their
juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The income effect refers to how a change in the price of a
good alters the effective buying power of one’s income. If the price of a good that you have been buying falls, then
in effect your buying power has risen—you are able to purchase more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that
you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given amount of income is diminished. (One common source
of confusion is that the “income effect” does not refer to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation
in which the price of a good changes, and thus the quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of
income change. It might be more accurate to call the “income effect” a “buying power effect,” but the “income effect”
terminology has been used for decades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price
changes, consumers feel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.
Using indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. In Figure B4, Ogden
faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost $6, and he has
$120 to spend.
Figure B4 Substitution and Income Effects The original choice is A, the point of tangency between the original
budget constraint and indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between the new budget
constraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows
the new higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The substitution effect is the shift from A to C,
which means getting fewer haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction in
buying power that causes a shift from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative prices
remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed of both goods. Both substitution and income
effects cause fewer haircuts to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and income effect cancel
out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.
The price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higher opportunity set and the higher indifference
curve. After the price of pizza increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve.
Appendix B
509

Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with three haircuts and 10 personal
pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back only on haircuts, while leaving his
consumption of pizza unchanged.
The dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect. To
understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would Ogden change
his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative prices did not affect his
utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two goods; thus, the slope of the
original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of the new budget line is determined
by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a graphical tool inserted in a specific way: It
is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to
the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original level of utility or buying power.
Thus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that Ogden
would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set and the dashed
line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference curve). The substitution
effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively more expensive—in Ogden’s
case, the haircuts on the vertical axis—and toward the good which has become relatively less expensive—in this case,
the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with “s” for “substitution effect,” one on each axis, show the
direction of this movement.
The income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his buying
power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the relative prices
(because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where the price of one good
increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both goods should fall (if they
are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to believe otherwise). The two arrows
labeled with “i” for “income effect,” one on each axis, show the direction of this income effect movement.
Now, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed less of
it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume less and the
income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza increased, Ogden
consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza meant that haircuts became
relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume
more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza meant that he wished to consume less of both
goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown in Figure
B4, in this particular example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden’s consumption of haircuts are
offsetting—so he ends up consuming the same quantity of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.
The size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual
preferences. For example, if Ogden’s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially strong,
and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts. This
case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the relevant
indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the substitution effect away from pizza and
toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react
to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods. In this case, his optimal choice after the price change
will be above and to the left of choice B on the new budget constraint.
Although the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be remembered
that they are twin components of a single cause—a change in price. Although you can analyze them separately, the
two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.
Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal
Choices
The concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure choice
or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each indifference
curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an intertemporal choice,
each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that provide a certain level of

utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves—downward sloping, steeper on the left and flatter on the
right—also remain the same.
A Labor-Leisure Example
Petunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family responsibilities and
sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in Figure B5, the highest level of utility
for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the lower indifference curve (Ul).
Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income of $600 per week (that is, 50 hours
of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her
new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget constraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh.
At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and works 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours
of work at $20 per hour).
Figure B5 Effects of a Change in Petunia’s Wage Petunia starts at choice A, the tangency between her original
budget constraint and the lower indifference curve Ul. The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to the right, so
that she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this
case, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more
income, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income effect in this
example leads to greater consumption of both goods. Overall, in this example, income rises because of both
substitution and income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution effect but increases because of
the income effect—leading, in Petunia’s case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure consumed.
Substitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly wage. The
dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.
The substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that income
was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at the same level of
utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a labor-leisure diagram is determined by the wage rate. Thus, the dashed
line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new
wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or “buying power.” The
shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the
dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income. The
“s” arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of Figure B5 show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.
The income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it possible
for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point B; that is,
it shows how Petunia’s behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or “buying power,” with the
wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget constraint). The income
effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn with arrows on the horizontal
and vertical axis of Figure B5.
Appendix B
511

Putting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This
movement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made income
relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it possible to have more
income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more leisure because, according to
Petunia’s preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure is stronger than the substitution effect
that encourages choosing less leisure.
Figure B5 represents only Petunia’s preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a person
whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a higher wage
with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of the higher wages in
the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose substitution effect on leisure
outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice like F, where the response to higher
wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent these different preferences, you could easily
draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget constraint at D or F, rather than at B.
An Intertemporal Choice Example
Quentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and
then will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn
a total 80% rate of return. Figure B6 shows Quentin’s budget constraint and his indifference curves between
present consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his original
intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for the future, and
expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000 in current financial
savings plus the 80% rate of return).
However, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic
expectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget constraint
has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will Quentin react to the
lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of substitution and income
effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various choices. The dashed line, which is
a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully inserted with the same slope as the new
opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so that
it shows no change in utility or “buying power.”
The substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return
makes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The movement
from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present consumption and less
future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The substitution arrows on the
horizontal and vertical axes of Figure B6 show the direction of the substitution effect motivation. The substitution
effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should consume more in the present and less in the
future.
Quentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left,
which means that Quentin’s utility or “buying power” is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods)
encourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present and
future consumption in this example is shown with “i” arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of Figure B6.
512
Appendix B

Figure B6 Indifference Curve and an Intertemporal Budget Constraint
The original choice is A, at the tangency
between the original budget constraint and the original indifference curve Uh. The dashed line is drawn parallel to the
new budget set, so that its slope reflects the lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference curve. The
movement from A to C is the substitution effect: in this case, future consumption has become relatively more
expensive, and present consumption has become relatively cheaper. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that
is, the reduction in utility or “buying power” that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the relative
price the same. It means less present and less future consumption. In the move from A to B, the substitution effect on
present consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is more present consumption. Notice that
the lower indifference curve could have been drawn tangent to the lower budget constraint point D or point F,
depending on personal preferences.
Taking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less future
consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is encouraging him to less
present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him to a lower level of utility. For
Quentin’s personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall, he reacts to the lower rate of return
with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However, other people might have different preferences.
They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same level of present consumption and savings at choice
D, or by choosing less present consumption and more savings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences,
the income effect of a lower rate of return on present consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution
effect would be relatively weaker.
Sketching Substitution and Income Effects
Indifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility.
They eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making
utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the complementary
motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return—namely, the substitution and income
effects.
If you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the points of
tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.
Step 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call “candy”
and “movies.” Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be tangent—but
it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. See Figure B7.
Appendix B
513

Figure B7
Step 2. Now the price of movies changes: let’s say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that the
higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower indifference curve.
But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. See Figure B8.
Figure B8
Step 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line, parallel to the
new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two changes: (1) the effect
on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices—with the level of utility remaining unchanged—which is the
substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting from one indifference curve to the
other—with relative prices staying unchanged—which is the income effect. The dashed line is inserted in this step.
The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A, but not directly through point A. See Figure
B9.
514
Appendix B

Figure B9
Step 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget line and
to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where the original
indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve through A and C. The
substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as prices change but the level
of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to less consumed of the good that is
relatively more expensive, as shown by the “s” (substitution) arrow on the vertical axis, and more consumed of the
good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the “s” arrow on the horizontal axis. See Figure B10.
Figure B10
Step 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set. When
you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger impact on the
good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical line with point A
(as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect on the horizontal axis.
If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the substitution effect will exceed the
income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A, then the income effect will exceed
Appendix B
515

the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B, showing how choices shifted as a result of
the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels of utility, with relative prices remaining the same.
With normal goods, the negative income effect means less consumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the
“i” (income effect) arrows on the vertical and horizontal axes. See Figure B11.
Figure B11
In sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following variations:
(1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the horizontal axis;
(3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income effect exceeds the
substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.
One final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the original
budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line. Some students
find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative sizes of the substitution
and income effects, however, should be the same.
Key Concepts and Summary
An indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All points
along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent higher levels
of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points along the curve, a
reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an increase in the quantity of the
good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on the far left and flatter on the far right,
because of diminishing marginal utility.
The utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget constraint
touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a substitution
effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy less of what is
relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect motivation encourages a utility-
maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if utility falls (if they are both normal
goods).
In a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of a wage
increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity cost has increased.
The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they are both normal goods. The
substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.
In an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect. The
substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now cheaper to earn
516

future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost of present consumption
in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an interest rate increase is to
choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income
effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.

C | Present Discounted
Value
As explained in Financial Markets, the prices of stocks and bonds depend on future events. The price of a bond
depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and the
repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the
firm. The concept of a present discounted value (PDV), which is defined as the amount you should be willing to
pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks
and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what amount of money you would
need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation will require an interest rate. For
example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year from now will have a present discounted value of
$100—that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the
idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we will show how to apply it to a bond.
Applying Present Discounted Value to a Stock
Consider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that the
founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be disbanded.
The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in the present,
$20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as dividends to
shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock in this company?
A financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an interest
rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment opportunities, which is the
opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is, using a higher interest rate than the
rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In this example, say that the financial investor
decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future payments is 15%.
Table C1 shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when a
benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:
Present discounted value = Future value received years in the future
(1 + Interest rate)numbers of years t
Payments from Firm
Present Value
$15 million in present
$15 million
$20 million in one year
$20 million/(1 + 0.15)1 = $17.4 million
$25 million in two years
$25 million/(1 + 0.15)2 = $18.9 million
Total
$51.3 million
Table C1 Calculating Present Discounted Value of a Stock
Next, add up all the present values for the different time periods to get a final answer. The present value calculations
ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that a different PDV
calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide the PDV of total profits
by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price per share should be about
$256,500 per share.
Of course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest rate
Appendix C
519

to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital gains from
the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these issues are exactly
why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are more optimistic about its
future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to pay in the present for a stream
of benefits to be received in the future.
Applying Present Discounted Value to a Bond
A similar calculation works in the case of bonds. Financial Markets explains that if the interest rate falls after a
bond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face value.
Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate, and the bond
will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.
Think about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year, the
bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 × 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in interest, plus the
$3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate is 8%. Then, recalculate
if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these calculations, look at the stream of
payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what they are worth in present discounted value
terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are shown in Table C2.

Table C2 Computing the Present Discounted Value of a Bond
The first calculation shows that the present value of a $3,000 bond, issued at 8%, is just $3,000. After all, that is how
much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the lender. The
bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want to borrow in the
present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present value of what will be
repaid to the lender.
The second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar payments in
the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value of those payments,
now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments that the bond is receiving
have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment’s value has fallen.
Again, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in the
market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the price of a
bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.
Other Applications
Present discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business thinks
about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that investment to the
present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to, for example, add safety
features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits received in the future. Some academic
disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon dioxide emissions because of the risk that they
will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades in the future, turn on how one compares present costs

of pollution control with long-run future benefits. Someone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string
of payments over 30 years might be interested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments.
Whenever a string of costs and benefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted
value becomes an indispensable tool of analysis.

1.Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. Supply is limited because
resources are limited. Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it seems human nature to want
more.
2.100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if all residents produce ham. Since
consumption is limited by production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per month is 10.

9.The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it has less need to trade internationally than the
other countries mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower ratios than Belgium or Sweden.)
One additional reason is that each of the other countries is a member of the European Union, where trade between
members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs and quotas.

1. The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket.
Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers.
The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the
opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the
opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50.
You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is flatter than the original one. If Alphonso
spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the horizontal intercept of the
budget constraint is the same. If he spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so
the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the horizontal intercept,
flattening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.

2.Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of healthcare.
In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would make the PPF steeper,
corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources devoted to education would now
mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.
3.No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production
possibilities frontier.
4.Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff between
having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the slope of the constraint
(budget or PPF).
5.When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus another, they
are behaving approximately like the model describes.
6.Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.
7.Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or bad, but

1.Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550 gallons and
the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of demand and supply,
respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the gasoline market of 640 – 550 = 90
gallons.
2.To make it easier to analyze complex problems. Ceteris paribus allows you to look at the effect of one factor at a
time on what it is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors individually, you add the results
together to get the final answer.
3.
a.
An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production will cause an increase in supply.
Alternatively, you can think of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply any quantity. Either
way, this can be shown as a rightward (or downward) shift in the supply curve.
b.
An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in tastes or preferences, meaning consumers
demand more paint at any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If this seems counterintuitive,
note that demand in the future for the longer-lasting paint will fall, since consumers are essentially shifting
demand from the future to the present.
c.
An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward shift in the demand curve.
d.
Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in the present. Technically, this is an increase
in the cost of production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts to the left.
4.
a.
More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This causes a leftward shift in the demand for
gasoline and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the equilibrium price and

quantity both fall.
b.
Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a rightward shift in the demand for heating oil
and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium price and quantity both
rise.
c.
A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be shown as a rightward shift in the supply
curve, which will cause a decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the equilibrium quantity.
(The supply curve shifts down the demand curve so price and quantity follow the law of demand. If price goes
down, then the quantity goes up.)
d.
When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less input, including energy, which is
used in the production of virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be reflected as a decrease
in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift in demand for oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply
curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will fall.
e.
Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This leftward shift in the supply curve will show a
movement up the demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of oil and a decrease in the
equilibrium quantity.
f.
Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This leftward shift in the demand for oil causes a
movement down the supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.
g.
Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar energy becomes cheaper, the demand for oil will
decrease as consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil will be shown as a leftward
shift in the demand curve. As the demand curve shifts down the supply curve, both equilibrium price and
quantity for oil will fall.
h.
A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The increase in demand will be shown as a
rightward shift in demand, raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.
5. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity.
Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of producing air travel, so an increase in
jet fuel price affects supply. Step 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused a decrease in the cost of air travel. We
show this as a downward or rightward shift in supply. Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down
the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium price of air travel and increasing the equilibrium quantity.
6. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity.
Step 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a cost of production, so this affects
supply. Step 3. A tariff reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production, which we can show as a
rightward (or downward) shift in supply. Step 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand
curve, lowering the equilibrium price and raising the equilibrium quantity.
7.A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity
supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.
8.A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. People may or may not obey the
price ceiling, so the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price ceiling does not change the
equilibrium price.
9.A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a legal minimum price and, consequently, it would
leave room for the price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price floor below equilibrium will not be
binding and will have no effect.
10.Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that Qd
will be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will fall to Qs. This
is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be above the equilibrium
price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions will fall
to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is less.
11.Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative. Since the
Answer Key
525

lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus, social surplus falls.
Chapter 4
1.Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in anything else
that affects demand for labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process that use more or less labor,
government regulation) causes a shift in the demand curve.
2.Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in anything else
that affects supply of labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be, government policy to promote
training in the field) causes a shift in the supply curve.
3.Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a price floor (assuming, of course, that it is followed).
If the living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at that wage rate.
4.Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change
in anything else (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital (e.g., changes in confidence about the
future, changes in needs for borrowing) would shift the demand curve.
5.Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change
in anything else that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable) such as income or future needs would
shift the supply curve.
6.If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the
equilibrium interest rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate, and the quantity of loans
would be lower than the equilibrium quantity, causing a shortage of loans.
7.b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand, lenders will not be able to charge as much, and with
more available lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.
8. a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to borrow will result in more loans being given,
as will more people who want to lend.
9. A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level, but has no effect on prices above that level. It will
have its biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire area inside the dotted lines on the graph,
from D to S) if it is substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the following figure.
It will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the next figure.
526

It will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially below the equilibrium price, since an equilibrium price
above a price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following figure illustrates these situations.
10. A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level, but has no effect on prices below that level. It
will have its biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially below the equilibrium price. The following
figure illustrates these situations.
Answer Key
527

When the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the equilibrium price, it will have no effect on creating
excess demand. The following figure illustrates these situations.
11.Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded or
supplied. A price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price floor is set above the
equilibrium, it will cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than the quantity demanded on the
demand curve, leading to excess supply.
12.Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is demanded or
supplied. A price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price ceiling is set below
the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be greater than the quantity supplied on
the supply curve, leading to excess demand.

The supply curve is inelastic in this region of the supply curve.
3.The demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because at high prices, a one percent decrease in price
results in more than a one percent increase in quantity. As we move down the demand curve, price drops and the one
percent decrease in price causes less than a one percent increase in quantity.
4.The constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve slopes upward and both price and quantity are
increasing proportionally.
5.Carmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for these cars is inelastic. If the demand for these
cars is elastic, then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.
6. If the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the company to lower its price on the product, since a

would advise the company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the decrease in number of units sold, but
increase your total revenue. If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already maximized, and you would advise that the
company maintain its current price level.
7.The percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given percentage change in the price of gasoline.

Percentage change in income
= [(change in income)/(original income)] × 100
= [38,000 – 25,000]/[(38,000 + 25,000)/2] × 100
= 13/31.5 × 100

In this example, bread is an inferior good because its consumption falls as income rises.
9. The formula for cross-price elasticity is % change in Qd for apples / % change in P of oranges. Multiplying both

1. The rows of the table in the problem do not represent the actual choices available on the budget set; that is, the
combinations of round trips and phone minutes that Jeremy can afford with his budget. One of the choices listed in
the problem, the six round trips, is not even available on the budget set. If Jeremy has only $10 to spend and a round
trip costs $2 and phone calls cost $0.05 per minute, he could spend his entire budget on five round trips but no phone
calls or 200 minutes of phone calls, but no round trips or any combination of the two in between. It is easy to see all
of his budget options with a little algebra. The equation for a budget line is:
Budget = PRT×  QRT  +  PPC  ×  QPC
where P and Q are price and quantity of round trips (RT) and phone calls (PC) (per minute). In Jeremy’s case the
equation for the budget line is:
$10 = $2 × QRT  +  $.05 × QPC
$10
$.05
=
$2QRT  +   $.05QPC  
$.05
200 = 40QRT  +  QPC
QPC = 200 -  40QRT

afforded with the budget (column 3). The total utility figures are given in the table below.

Adding up total utility for round trips and phone minutes at different points on the budget line gives total utility at
each point on the budget line. The highest possible utility is at the combination of one trip and 160 minutes of phone
time, with a total utility of 1120.
2. The first step is to use the total utility figures, shown in the table below, to calculate marginal utility, remembering
that marginal utility is equal to the change in total utility divided by the change in trips or minutes.

Start at the bottom of the table where the combination of round trips and phone minutes is (5, 0). This starting point
is arbitrary, but the numbers in this example work best starting from the bottom. Suppose we consider moving to the
next point up. At (4, 40), the marginal utility per dollar spent on a round trip is 25. The marginal utility per dollar
spent on phone minutes is 190. Since 25 < 190, we are getting much more utility per dollar spent on phone minutes,
so let’s choose more of those. At (3, 80), MU/PRT is 30 < 150 (the MU/PM), but notice that the difference is narrowing.
We keep trading round trips for phone minutes until we get to (1, 160), which is the best we can do. The MU/P
comparison is as close as it is going to get (40 vs. 70). Often in the real world, it is not possible to get MU/P exactly
equal for both products, so you get as close as you can.

3.This is the opposite of the example explained in the text. A decrease in price has a substitution effect and an income
effect. The substitution effect says that because the product is cheaper relative to other things the consumer purchases,
he or she will tend to buy more of the product (and less of the other things). The income effect says that after the price
decline, the consumer could purchase the same goods as before, and still have money left over to purchase more. For
both reasons, a decrease in price causes an increase in quantity demanded.
4.This is a negative income effect. Because your parents’ check failed to arrive, your monthly income is less than
normal and your budget constraint shifts in toward the origin. If you only buy normal goods, the decrease in your
income means you will buy less of every product.
5. This problem is straightforward if you remember leisure hours plus work hours are limited to 50 hours total. If you

Suppose Sid starts with 50 hours of leisure and 0 hours of work. As Sid moves up the table, he trades 10 hours of
leisure for 10 hours of work at each step. At (40, 10), his MULeisure = 50, which is substantially less than his MUIncome
of 500. This shortfall signals Sid to keep trading leisure for work/income until at (10, 40) the marginal utility of both
is equal at 200. This is the sign that he should stop here, confirming the answer in question 1.
7.An increase in expected income would cause an outward shift in the intertemporal budget constraint. This would
likely increase both current consumption and saving, but the answer would depend on one’s time preference, that is,
how much one is willing to wait to forgo current consumption. Children are notoriously bad at this, which is to say
they might simply consume more, and not save any. Adults, because they think about the future, are generally better
at time preference—that is, they are more willing to wait to receive a reward.
Answer Key

8.Lower interest rates would make lending cheaper and saving less rewarding. This would be reflected in a flatter
intertemporal budget line, a rotation around the amount of current income. This would likely cause a decrease
in saving and an increase in current consumption, though the results for any individual would depend on time
preference.

a.
Total revenues in this example will be a quantity of five units multiplied by the price of $25/unit, which
equals $125. Total costs when producing five units are $130. Thus, at this level of quantity and output the firm
experiences losses (or negative profits) of $5.
b.
If price is less than average cost, the firm is not making a profit. At an output of five units, the average cost is
$26/unit. Thus, at a glance you can see the firm is making losses. At a second glance, you can see that it must
be losing $1 for each unit produced (that is, average cost of $26/unit minus the price of $25/unit). With five
units produced, this observation implies total losses of $5.
c.
When producing five units, marginal costs are $30/unit. Price is $25/unit. Thus, the marginal unit is not adding
to profits, but is actually subtracting from profits, which suggests that the firm should reduce its quantity
produced.
6. The new table should look like this:
Labor Cost
Machine Cost
Total Cost
Cost of technology 1
10 × $40 = $400
2 × $50 = $100
$500
Cost of technology 2
7 × $40 = $280
4 × $50 = $200
$480
Cost of technology 3
3 × $40 = $120
7 × $50 = $350
$470
The firm should choose production technology 3 since it has the lowest total cost. This makes sense since, with
cheaper machine hours, one would expect a shift in the direction of more machines and less labor.

increased (relative to the previous question), you would expect a shift toward less capital and more labor.
8.This is the situation that existed in the United States in the 1970s. Since there is only demand enough for 2.5 firms
to reach the bottom of the average cost curve, you would expect one firm will not be around in the long run, and at
least one firm will be struggling.
Chapter 8
1.No, you would not raise the price. Your product is exactly the same as the product of the many other firms in the
market. If your price is greater than that of your competitors, then your customers would switch to them and stop
buying from you. You would lose all your sales.
2.Possibly. Independent truckers are by definition small and numerous. All that is required to get into the business
is a truck (not an inexpensive asset, though) and a commercial driver’s license. To exit, one need only sell the truck.
All trucks are essentially the same, providing transportation from point A to point B. (We’re assuming we not talking
about specialized trucks.) Independent truckers must take the going rate for their service, so independent trucking
does seem to have most of the characteristics of perfect competition.
3.Holding total cost constant, profits at every output level would increase.
4.When the market price increases, marginal revenue increases. The firm would then increase production up to the
point where the new price equals marginal cost, at a quantity of 90.
5.If marginal costs exceeds marginal revenue, then the firm will reduce its profits for every additional unit of output
it produces. Profit would be greatest if it reduces output to where MR = MC.
6.The firm will be willing to supply fewer units at every price level. In other words, the firm’s individual supply curve
decreases and shifts to the left.
7.With a technological improvement that brings about a reduction in costs of production, an adjustment process will
take place in the market. The technological improvement will result in an increase in supply curves, by individual
firms and at the market level. The existing firms will experience higher profits for a while, which will attract other
firms into the market. This entry process will stop whenever the market supply increases enough (both by existing
and new firms) so profits are driven back to zero.
8.When wages increase, costs of production increase. Some firms would now be making economic losses and would
shut down. The supply curve then starts shifting to the left, pushing the market price up. This process ends when all
firms remaining in the market earn zero economic profits. The result is a contraction in the output produced in the
market.
9.Perfect competition is considered to be “perfect” because both allocative and productive efficiency are met at the
same time in a long-run equilibrium. If a market structure results in long-run equilibrium that does not minimize
average total costs and/or does not charge a price equal to marginal cost, then either allocative or productive (or both)
efficiencies are not met, and therefore the market cannot be labeled “perfect.”
10.Think of the market price as representing the gain to society from a purchase, since it represents what someone is
Answer Key
535

willing to pay. Think of the marginal cost as representing the cost to society from making the last unit of a good. If P >
MC, then the benefits from producing more of a good exceed the costs, and society would gain from producing more
of the good. If P < MC, then the social costs of producing the marginal good exceed the social benefits, and society
should produce less of the good. Only if P = MC, the rule applied by a profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm,
will society’s costs and benefits be in balance. This choice will be the option that brings the greatest overall benefit to
society.

3.Because of economies of scale, each firm would produce at a higher average cost than before. (They would each
have to build their own power lines.) As a result, they would each have to raise prices to cover their higher costs. The
policy would fail.
4.Shorter patent protection would make innovation less lucrative, so the amount of research and development would
likely decline.
5.If price falls below AVC, the firm will not be able to earn enough revenues even to cover its variable costs. In such
a case, it will suffer a smaller loss if it shuts down and produces no output. By contrast, if it stayed in operation and
produced the level of output where MR = MC, it would lose all of its fixed costs plus some variable costs. If it shuts
down, it only loses its fixed costs.
6.This scenario is called “perfect price discrimination.” The result would be that the monopolist would produce more
output, the same amount in fact as would be produced by a perfectly competitive industry. However, there would
be no consumer surplus since each buyer is paying exactly what they think the product is worth. Therefore, the
monopolist would be earning the maximum possible profits.
Chapter 10
1.An increase in demand will manifest itself as a rightward shift in the demand curve, and a rightward shift in
marginal revenue. The shift in marginal revenue will cause a movement up the marginal cost curve to the new
intersection between MR and MC at a higher level of output. The new price can be read by drawing a line up from
the new output level to the new demand curve, and then over to the vertical axis. The new price should be higher. The
increase in quantity will cause a movement along the average cost curve to a possibly higher level of average cost.
The price, though, will increase more, causing an increase in total profits.
2.As long as the original firm is earning positive economic profits, other firms will respond in ways that take away
the original firm’s profits. This will manifest itself as a decrease in demand for the original firm’s product, a decrease
in the firm’s profit-maximizing price and a decrease in the firm’s profit-maximizing level of output, essentially
unwinding the process described in the answer to question 1. In the long-run equilibrium, all firms in monopolistically
competitive markets will earn zero economic profits.

3.
a.
If the firms form a cartel, they will act like a monopoly, choosing the quantity of output where MR = MC.
Drawing a line from the monopoly quantity up to the demand curve shows the monopoly price. Assuming that
fixed costs are zero, and with an understanding of cost and profit, we can infer that when the marginal cost
curve is horizontal, average cost is the same as marginal cost. Thus, the cartel will earn positive economic
profits equal to the area of the rectangle, with a base equal to the monopoly quantity and a height equal to
the difference between price (on the demand above the monopoly quantity) and average cost, as shown in the
following figure.
b.
The firms will expand output and cut price as long as there are profits remaining. The long-run equilibrium
will occur at the point where average cost equals demand. As a result, the oligopoly will earn zero economic
profits

4.Firm B reasons that if it cheats and Firm A does not notice, it will double its money. Since Firm A’s profits will
decline substantially, however, it is likely that Firm A will notice and if so, Firm A will cheat also, with the result that
Firm B will lose 90% of what it gained by cheating. Firm A will reason that Firm B is unlikely to risk cheating. If
neither firm cheats, Firm A earns $1000. If Firm A cheats, assuming Firm B does not cheat, A can boost its profits
only a little, since Firm B is so small. If both firms cheat, then Firm A loses at least 50% of what it could have earned.
The possibility of a small gain ($50) is probably not enough to induce Firm A to cheat, so in this case it is likely that
both firms will collude.
Chapter 11
1.Yes, it is true. The HHI example is easy enough: since the market shares of all firms are included in the HHI
calculation, a merger between two of the firms will change the HHI. For the four-firm concentration ratio, it is quite
possible that a merger between, say, the fifth and sixth largest firms in the market could create a new firm that is then
Answer Key
537

ranked in the top four in the market. In this case, a merger of two firms, neither in the top four, would still change the
four-firm concentration ratio.
2.No, it is not true. The HHI includes the market shares of all firms in its calculation, but the squaring of the market
shares has the effect of making the impact of the largest firms relatively bigger than in the 4-firm or 8-firm ratio.
3.The bus companies wanted the broader market definition (i.e., the second definition). If the narrow definition had
been used, the combined bus companies would have had a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus service. But
they had only a sliver of the market for intercity transportation when everything else was included. The merger was
allowed.
4.The common expectation is that the definition of markets will become broader because of greater competition from
faraway places. However, this broadening doesn’t necessarily mean that antitrust authorities can relax. There is also
a fear that companies with a local or national monopoly may use the new opportunities to extend their reach across
national borders, and that it will be difficult for national authorities to respond.
5.Because outright collusion to raise profits is illegal and because existing regulations include gray areas which firms
may be able to exploit.
6. Yes, all curves have normal shapes.
7.Yes it is a natural monopoly because average costs decline over the range that satisfies the market demand. For
example, at the point where the demand curve and the average cost curve meet, there are economies of scale.
8.Improvements in technology that allowed phone calls to be made via microwave transmission, communications

8. First, if each firm is required to reduce its garbage output by one-fourth, then Elm will reduce five tons at a cost of
$5,500; Maple will reduce 10 tons at a cost of $13,500; Oak will reduce three tons at a cost of $22,500; and Cherry
will reduce four tons at a cost of $18,000. Total cost of this approach: $59,500. If the system of marketable permits
is put in place, and those permits shrink the weight of allowable garbage by one-quarter, then pollution must still
be reduced by the same overall amount. However, now the reduction in pollution will take place where it is least
expensive.

Thus, the overall pattern of reductions here will be that Elm reduces garbage by 20 tons and has 15 tons of permits to
sell. Maple reduces by five tons and needs to buy five tons of permits. Oak does not reduce garbage at all, and needs
to buy 15 tons of permits. Cherry reduces garbage by 25 tons, which leaves it with five tons of permits to sell. The
total cost of these reductions would be $56,300, a definite reduction in costs from the $59,500 cost of the command-
and-control option.

losses of 2 if we protect, but have zero if we do not protect, so again, we will not protect it. Country A will reason in a
similar manner. The result is that both countries choose to not protect, even though they will achieve the largest social
benefits—a combined benefit of 12 for the two countries—if they both choose to protect. Environmental treaties can
be viewed as a way for countries to try to extricate themselves from this situation.

a.
b.
Of the choices provided, P, R, and S demonstrate productive efficiency. These are the choices on the
production possibility frontier.
c.
Allocative efficiency is determined by the preferences—in this case by the preferences of society as expressed
through government and other social institutions. Because you do not have information about these
preferences, you really cannot say much about allocative efficiency.
d.
In the choice between T and R, R should clearly be preferred, because it has both more corn and more trees.
This answer illustrates why productive efficiency is beneficial. Compared with choices inside the PPF, it
means more of one or both goods.
e.
In the choice between T and S, it is not possible to say which choice is better. True, S is on the PPF and
T is not—but that only addresses the issue of productive efficiency. If a society has a strong preference for
economic output and places a lower value on trees, then allocative efficiency may lead to a choice of T
over S. Of course, the reverse could also be true, leading to a choice of S. Without information on society’s
preferences to judge allocative efficiency, this question cannot be answered.
f.
Compared with command-and-control policies, market-oriented policies allow either more output with the
same environmental protection or more environmental protection with the same level of output—or more of
both environmental protection and output. Thus, a choice like Q inside the PPF is more likely to represent a
command-and-control policy demand than a choice like S on the frontier of the PPF.

families earn above the poverty level, the earned income tax credit is gradually reduced. For those near-poor families,

6.A useful first step is to rank the households by income, from lowest to highest. Then, since there are 10 households
total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the third and fourth
households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income for the data provided are
shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income distribution for 2005, the top quintile
in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S. distribution and the bottom quintile has a larger
share. This pattern usually means that the income distribution in the example is more equal than the U.S. distribution.

7.Just from glancing at the quintile information, it is fairly obvious that income inequality increased in the United
Kingdom over this time: The top quintile is getting a lot more, and the lowest quintile is getting a bit less. Converting
this information into a Lorenz curve, however, is a little trickier, because the Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative
distribution, not the amount received by individual quintiles. Thus, as explained in the text, you have to add up the
individual quintile data to convert the data to this form. The following table shows the actual calculations for the share
of income in 1979 versus 1991. The figure following the table shows the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curves
for 1979 and 1991. As shown, the income distribution in 1979 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income
distribution in 1991—that is, the United Kingdom income distribution became more unequal over time.

8.In the market for low-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for low-wage labor to the left. One
reason is that technology can often substitute for low-wage labor in certain kinds of telephone or bookkeeping
jobs. In addition, information technology makes it easier for companies to manage connections with low-wage
workers in other countries, thus reducing the demand for low-wage workers in the United States. In the market
for high-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for high-wage labor to the right. By using the
new information and communications technologies, high-wage labor can become more productive and can oversee
more tasks than before. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. The combination of lower wages
for
low-wage
labor
and
higher
wages
for
high-wage
labor
means
greater
inequality.
9.In the market for low-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the left, which will tend to drive up
wages for the remaining low-skill workers. In the market for high-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply
to the right (because after the training program there are now more high-skilled workers at every wage), which
will tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers. The combination of these two programs will result in a
lesser degree of inequality. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. In the market for high-wage
labor, a skills program will shift supply to the right, which will tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers.

10.A very strong push for economic equality might include extremely high taxes on high-wage earners to pay for
extremely large government social payments for the poor. Such a policy could limit incentives for the high-wage
workers, lock the poor into a poverty trap, and thus reduce output. The PPF in this case will have the standard
appearance: it will be downward sloping.
11.For the second hypothesis, a well-funded social safety net might make people feel that even if their company goes
bankrupt or they need to change jobs or industries, they will have some degree of protection. As a result, people may
be more willing to allow markets to work without interference, and not to lobby as hard for rules that would prevent
layoffs, set price controls, or block foreign trade. In this case, safety net programs that increase equality could also
allow the market to work more freely in a way that could increase output. In this case, at least some portion of the
PPF between equality and economic output would slope up.
12.Pure redistribution is more likely to cause a sharp tradeoff between economic output and equality than policies
aimed at the ladder of opportunity. A production possibility frontier showing a strict tradeoff between economic
output and equality will be downward sloping. A PPF showing that it is possible to increase equality, at least to some
extent, while either increasing output or at least not diminishing it would have a PPF that first rises, perhaps has a flat
area, and then falls.
13.Many view the redistribution of income to achieve greater equality as taking away from the rich to pay the poor,
or as a “zero sum” game. By taking taxes from one group of people and redistributing them to another, the tax system
is robbing some of the American Dream.

a.
Firms have a profit incentive to sell to everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.
b.
A business that needs to hire workers to expand may also find that if it draws only from its accustomed pool
of workers—say, white men—it lacks the workers it needs to expand production. Such a business would have
an incentive to hire more women and minorities.
c.
A discriminatory business that is underpaying its workers may find those workers leaving for jobs with
another employer who offers better pay. This market pressure could cause the discriminatory business to
behave better.
3.No. The earnings gap does not prove discrimination because it does not compare the wages of men and women in
the same job who have the same amounts of education, experience, and productivity.
4.If a large share of immigrants have relatively low skills, then reducing the number of immigrants would shift the
supply curve of low-skill labor back to the left, which would tend to raise the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor.

a.
Imperfect information is relatively low; after all, you can see the apples.
b.
Imperfect information is relatively low. The neighborhood restaurant probably has a certain local reputation.
c.
Imperfect information is relatively high. How can you tell whether the computer is really in good working
order? Why are they selling it?
d.
Imperfect information is relatively high. What do those flowers really look like?
2.Asymmetric information often exists in the labor market because employers cannot observe many key employee
attributes until after the person is hired. Employees, however, know whether they are energetic or detailed-oriented.
Employers, therefore, often seek schools to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate
unless he has a degree and often a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high grade
point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Finally, employers seek
references for insights into key attributes such as energy level, work ethic, and so on.
3.It is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as life expectancy was the result of personal
preferences that might affect health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior, and consumption of
certain items like tobacco, or the result of expenditures on health care (for example, annual check-ups).
Chapter 17
1.
a.
The management of small companies might rather do an IPO right away, but until they get the company up
and running, most people would pay very much for the stock because of the risks involved.
b.
A small company may be earning few or zero profits, and its owners want to reinvest their earnings in the
future growth of the company. If this company issues bonds or borrows money, it is obligated to make interest
payments, which can eat up the company’s cash. If the company issues stock, it is not obligated to make
payments to anyone (although it may choose to pay dividends).
c.
Venture capitalists are private investors who can keep close tabs on the management and strategy of the
company—and thus reduce the problems of imperfect information about whether the firm is being well run.
Venture capitalists often own a substantial portion of the firm and have much better information than a typical
shareholder would.
2.From a firm’s point of view, a bond is very similar to a bank loan. Both are ways of borrowing money. Both require
paying interest. The major difference is who must be persuaded to lend money: a bank loan requires persuading the
bank, while issuing bonds requires persuading a number of separate bondholders. Since a bank often knows a great
deal about a firm (especially if the firm has its accounts with that bank), bank loans are more common where imperfect
information would otherwise be a problem.
3.
a.
Remember, equity is the market value of the house minus what is still owed to the bank. Thus: the value of
the house is $200,000, Fred owes $180,000 to the bank, and his equity is $20,000.
b.
The value of Freda’s house is $250,000. It does not matter what price she bought it for. She owes zero to the
bank, so her equity is the whole $250,000.
c.
The value of Frank’s house is $160,000. He owes $60,000 to the bank (the original $80,000 minus the $20,000
he has paid off the loan). His equity is $100,000.
4.Over a sustained period of time, stocks have an average return higher than bonds, and bonds have an average return
higher than a savings account. This is because in any given year the value of a savings account changes very little. In
contrast, stock values can grow or decline by a very large amount (for example, the S&P 500 increased 26% in 2009
after declining 37% in 2008. The value of a bond, which depends largely on interest rate fluctuations, varies far less
than a stock, but more than a savings account.
5.When people believe that a high-risk investment must have a low return, they are getting confused between what
548

risk and return mean. Yes, a high-risk investment might have a low return, but it might also have a high return. Risk
refers to the fact that a wide range of outcomes is possible. However, a high-risk investment must, on average, expect
a relatively high return or else no one would be willing to take the risk. Thus, it is quite possible—even likely—for
an investment to have high risk and high return. Indeed, the reason that an investment has a high expected return is
that it also has a high risk.
6. Principal + (principal × rate × time) $5,000 + ($5,000 × 0.06 × 3) = $5,900
7.Principal + (principal × rate × time); Interest = Principal × rate × time; $500 = $10,000 × rate × 5 years; $500 =
$50,000 × rate; $500/$50,000 = rate; Rate = 1%

3.The costs of organization and the small benefit to the individual.
4.Domestic cotton producers would lobby heavily to protect themselves from the competition, whereas the consumers
have little incentive to organize.
5.True. This is exactly what occurs in a voting cycle. That is, the majority can prefer policy A to policy B, policy B
to policy C, but also prefer policy C to policy A. Then, the majority will never reach a conclusive outcome.
6.The problem is an example of a voting cycle. The group will vote for mountain biking over canoeing by 2–1. It
will vote for canoeing over the beach by 2–1. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and canoeing is preferred
to the beach, it might seem that it must be true that mountain biking is the favorite. But in a vote of the beach versus
mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2–1 vote. When a voting cycle occurs, choosing a single favorite that is always
preferred by a majority becomes impossible.
7.The four Coca-Cola candidates compete with each other for Coca-Cola voters, whereas everyone who prefers Pepsi
had only one candidate to vote for. Thus the will of the majority is not satisfied.

1.(a) In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an absolute
advantage in the production of both goods.
(b) Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German workers will
reduce video camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional television set in Poland requires six
workers, and shifting those workers from the other good reduces output of video cameras by 6/12 of a camera, or 1/
2. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing televisions is lower in Poland, so Poland has the comparative advantage in
the production of televisions. Note: Do not let the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video camera bother you.
If either country was to expand television production by a significant amount—that is, lots more than one unit—then
we will be talking about whole cameras and not fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing that
Poland’s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in televisions, because Poland needs twice as many workers to
produce a television but three times as many to produce a video camera, so the product with the relatively lower
absolute disadvantage is Poland’s comparative advantage.
(c) Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and shifting those four workers away from television
production has an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video camera in Poland requires 12 workers, and
shifting those 12 workers away from television production has an opportunity cost of two television sets. Thus, the
opportunity cost of producing video cameras is lower in Germany, and video cameras will be Germany’s comparative
advantage.
Answer Key

(d) In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative advantage. Germany has the absolute advantage in
the production of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the production of televisions. (e) Germany
should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of video cameras, export video cameras, and import
televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of televisions, export
televisions, and import video cameras.
2.There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade. Both nations can take advantage of extreme
specialization and learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like gas-efficient cars, luxury cars, sport-
utility vehicles, higher- and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take advantage of economies of
scale, so that large companies will compete against each other across international borders, providing the benefits of
competition and variety to customers. This same argument applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often
buy products made by people of other states, even though a similar product is made within the boundaries of their
own state. All states—and all countries—can benefit from this kind of competition and trade.
3. (a) Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then drawing a line through them. The following figure
illustrates the average costs of production of semiconductors.
The curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the scale increases—that is, as production at this particular
factory goes up—the average cost of production declines. The economies of scale exist up to an output of 40,000
semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of production does not seem to decline any further.
(b) At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take full advantage of economies of scale; that is, it
can produce at the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was quite high, like 500,000, then there
could be a number of different factories all taking full advantage of economies of scale and competing with each
other. If the quantity demanded falls below 40,000, then the economy by itself, without foreign trade, cannot take full
advantage of economies of scale.
(c) The simplest answer to this question is that the small country could have a large enough factory to take full
advantage of economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For semiconductors, countries like Taiwan and
Korea have recently fit this description. Moreover, this country could also import semiconductors from other countries
which also have large factories, thus getting the benefits of competition and variety. A slightly more complex answer
is that the country can get these benefits of economies of scale without producing semiconductors, but simply by
buying semiconductors made at low cost around the world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end
up specializing and producing a few items on a large scale, but then trading those items for other items produced on a
large scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by trade, as well as by direct production.
4.A nation might restrict trade on imported products to protect an industry that is important for national security. For
example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with ambitions of increased political and economic
strength. Even if nation Y has comparative advantage in the production of missile defense systems, it is unlikely that
nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation X. It is also the case that, for some nations, the production of a

particular good is a key component of national identity. In Japan, the production of rice is culturally very important.
It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a nation like Vietnam, even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage
in rice production.
5.(a) In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an absolute

(b) Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German workers will

1.This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced tariff is like a decrease in the cost of production,
which is shown by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.
2.A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve down (or to the right), driving the price of
sugar down. If the subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost of production faced by foreign
producers, which means they will lose money on any sugar they produce and sell.
3.Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other industries, it raises
their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower sales lead to lower employment.
Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their customers pay higher prices, which reduce demand
for other consumer products and thus employment in those industries.
4.Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce the
incomes of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country’s comparative advantage, trade barriers
do the opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the average wage economy-
wide.
5.By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not (yet) be
equivalent to those in high-income countries.
6.They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much as they
would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.
7.Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.
8.Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.
Answer Key

9.If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would have to match those prices to be competitive.
By definition, matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore, losing money. Firms cannot sustain
losses forever. When they leave the industry, importers can “take over,” raising prices to monopoly levels to cover
their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.
10.Because low-income countries need to provide necessities—food, clothing, and shelter—to their people. In other
words, they consider environmental quality a luxury.
11.Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their environmental standards to attract business to their
countries. This could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would lead to greater environmental
damage. While pollution management is a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to other costs, like labor and adequate
infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to locate far away from their customers, which many low-income countries
are.
12.The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies the same
way as domestic companies. It should be based on science.
13.Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything, it makes it worse since it implies using up
domestic sources of the products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national security argument can be used to
support protection of nearly any product, not just things critical to our national security.
14.The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small exporting country. The supply curve of toys will
shift to the left. Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise prices. So the effect on the price of
toys is the same. A tariff is a “second best” policy and also affects other sectors. However, a common standard across
countries is a “first best” policy that attacks the problem at its root.
15.A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but each country can determine its own trade policy
outside the association. A common market requires a common external trade policy in addition to free trade within
the group. An economic union is a common market with coordinated fiscal and monetary policy.
16.International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to domestic special interests, thereby preventing
stronger protectionist measures.
17.Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved transportation, and communication media have
made people more aware of what is available in the rest of the world.
18.Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a business’s profits, and may drive it out of
business. Workers would similarly lose income or even their jobs.
19.Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the better or cheaper products increase their
profits. Employees of those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh the losses to a nation.
