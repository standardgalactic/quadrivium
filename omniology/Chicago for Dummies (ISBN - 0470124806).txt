About the Author
Laura Tiebert is a freelance writer whose travels have taken her
from the frozen tundra of Dawson City in Yukon Territory to the
wide beaches of Muscat, Oman. A native Midwesterner, she lived
in New York City for years before returning to Chicago. Today, she
stays a bit closer to home in Evanston, Illinois, where she lives
with her husband and two young sons.


Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to acknowledge the inspiration for this book. My
grandparents, Ray and Monie Johnston, met in the late 1920s on
the Burlington Northern commuter train between Chicago and the
western suburbs and spent 60 years together. The colorful stories
they told, about John Dillinger, the stockyards, the Loop, and
nights out at the Palmer House Hilton, make me feel connected to
the city today.
This book is better because of the insightful editing of William
Travis and Kathleen Warnock. Thank you!

Introduction
L
et’s get one thing straight upfront: Chicago is the best-kept big-city
secret in the United States. A bold statement, you say? It may be,
but it’s fitting for this straight-shooting metropolis on the prairie.
Chicago is loud and smart, crude and glamorous, brash and refined. In
some ways it’s casually elegant, and in others, unabashedly goofy. You
can see the contrasts in the glamour of Michigan Avenue’s elegant hotels
and the boisterousness of the fans screaming for “Da Bears” at Soldier
Field. Flashy sports cars idle curbside at Rush Street’s hot spots, while
farther west, art-school hipsters look for the offbeat in Wicker Park.
Then again, you can find Midwesterners in their conservative pullovers
and khakis just trying to make sense of it all.
The third-largest city in the United States, Chicago constantly revises
itself and, in the last two decades, has reinvented itself to become a
vibrant, cosmopolitan place. It has been said that Chicago is the most
livable city in the United States. It’s also one of the most visitable. Firmly
rooted on Midwestern soil, Chicago is very much its own kind of town. I
think it’ll be your kind of town, too. In this book, I give you the resources
to make your Chicago experience a singular, memorable one.
About This Book
My favorite way to travel is with a person who has lived in that place.
That’s my intention for you. Sure, I hit the must-see destinations, and I
highlight the sights that actually merit their popularity. But I also point
you to lesser-known places that Chicagoans frequent. The beauty of this
approach is that in Chicago, unlike New York and Los Angeles, you can
actually get into these places. Chicago is much less elitist, less con-
cerned with the trendy, than those cities. The City of Big Shoulders also
has open arms.
This is a guidebook and also a reference book. You can read it cover to
cover, or you can jump in anywhere to find the information you want
about a specific task (such as finding a hotel) or an aspect of your trip
(such as dining). Whether you’re sitting in your living room trying to
make a reservation or standing on the corner of State and Madison won-
dering where to eat, Chicago For Dummies, 4th Edition, is set up so you
can get the facts, descriptions, and recommendations you want, quickly.
You can open it to any chapter and dig in to get the information you
need without any hassles.

For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
I provide a page reference in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area,
it may not be mapped.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. I suggest that you write or
call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors,
editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the experiences of
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we
encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a
close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all favorite targets of
thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions. As I
describe each, I often use abbreviations for commonly accepted credit
cards. Take a look at the following list for an explanation of each:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
DISC: Discover
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
I divide the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty seal
of approval. Don’t be shy about considering the runner-up hotels if you
can’t get a room at one of my favorites or if your preferences differ from
mine. The amenities that the runners-up offer and the services that each
provides make all these accommodations good choices to consider as
you determine where to rest your head at night.
Chicago For Dummies, 4th Edition 
2
Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll find information that you’ll want to reference as you
plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-
try walking tour. Mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book
to help make your trip planning easier!

I also include some general pricing information to help you decide where
to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine. I use a system of dollar
signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel (in a double room)
or a meal at a restaurant (included in the cost of each meal is an appe-
tizer, entree, and nonalcoholic beverage). Check out the following table
to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$125 and under
$20 and under
$$
$126–$200
$21–$35

Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what I assumed about you:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Chicago and how to plan it.
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Chicago and wants expert advice when you get a chance to
enjoy the city.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Chicago or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses
on the places that give you the best or most unusual experience in
Chicago.
If you fit any of these criteria, Chicago For Dummies, 4th Edition, gives
you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts covering the major aspects of your
trip. Each part is broken down into specific components so you can go
right to the subtopic you want (you don’t have to read all about nightlife
if you’re just looking for a jazz club, for example). Following are brief
summaries of the parts.
Part I: Introducing Chicago
Get a panoramic view of Chicago as I scan the city’s highlights, the not-
to-be-missed attractions and activities. It’s an exciting era in the city’s
Introduction 3

history, and I help you decide when to go, based on weather considera-
tions and event schedules.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago
By nature, I’m a planner. In fact, for me, planning the trip is half the fun.
Ah, the possibilities! If you’re a planner too, you’ll love this part. I debate
the pros and cons of your travel options and even review airports. In
this part, you can plan your budget; contemplate using trains, planes, or
automobiles; join in a tour; and find particular advice for those with spe-
cial travel needs and interests.
Part III: Settling into Chicago
Being in a new city can be a bit like groping around in the dark. After
reading this part, you’ll be navigating the city like a native. (You may
even find yourself giving directions to hapless tourists!) You also get the
lowdown on Chicago’s hotels and restaurants — what’s the latest and
greatest, what’s getting shabby around the edges, what offers the ulti-
mate in luxury or the biggest bargain.
Part IV: Exploring Chicago
In this part, I guide you through Chicago’s attractions. I point out the
major sights and show you additional attractions, in case you have the
time, energy, and inclination. If you want to take a piece of Chicago home
with you, turn to the chapter on shopping. And if this jumble of things to
do and see is just too much for you, I provide a variety of ready-made
itineraries.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: Chicago Nightlife
Chicago offers culture vultures options that stack up favorably against
anything you’ll find anywhere else. In this part, I cover the best of the
sights and sounds of nighttime Chicago. I run the gamut of information
on Chicago’s live theater and performing-arts scene (including its world-
class symphony, opera, and dance), as well as Chicago’s best bars and
clubs.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this part, I provide lists of information to help you craft your perfect
vacation — from the top ten Chicago experiences to ten creative ideas
for days when the weather isn’t cooperating. Most important, you dis-
cover indispensable tips for experiencing Chicago as the locals do.
In the back of this book, I include an appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need, like phone numbers
and addresses for emergency personnel or area hospitals and pharma-
cies, lists of local newspapers and magazines, protocol for sending mail 
Chicago For Dummies, 4th Edition

or finding taxis, and more. Check out this appendix when searching for
answers to lots of questions that may come up as you travel. You can find
the Quick Concierge easily, because it’s printed on yellow paper.

—Carl Sandburg, “Chicago”
I
n this chapter, you get a sampling of the qualities that make Chicago
the most American of American cities. Today, you’d hardly recognize
Chicago by Sandburg’s description. No longer home to stockyards, the
city is a cosmopolitan, vibrant place. But Chicago retains its unique
identity: big and brawling, inventive, and wonderfully diverse. Chicago is
the least pretentious and most livable metropolis in the United States —
and maybe the best to visit, too.
Some activities just say, “Chicago.” They’re the quintessential Chicago
experiences, and no visit is complete without them. Read on for some of
the activities that make Chicago a special place to visit. Throughout the
book, the Best of the Best icon is attached to those places or activities
mentioned in this chapter.
The Best Hotels
Most Family Friendly: With cribs, laundry service, free hot breakfast,
and every room a suite, the Embassy Suites Hotel Chicago–Downtown/
Lakefront is ideal for families looking for more space than the typical

hotel room provides. The in-room Nintendo, indoor pool, and location
near Navy Pier — plus hamburger joint P. J. Clarke’s in the same building
complex — should keep Junior happy, too.
Best Room with a View: This isn’t an easy call. Peering over the ele-
vated tracks, The Silversmith in the Loop offers a distinctly urban vista.
But consider several other hotels for their mix of lake and city views: the
Four Seasons Hotel Chicago, The Drake, the Ritz-Carlton Chicago, and
Park Hyatt Chicago.
Best Bet for Romance: A hip hotel that’s known for its sense of romance
and whimsy is Hotel Burnham. During the holidays, you’re right across
the street from the world-famous windows at Macy’s (formerly Marshall
Field’s) and within viewing distance of the massive Christmas tree at
Daley Plaza. Inside, you get a feel for the handcrafted beauty of the
former Reliance Insurance building, one of the city’s first skyscrapers.
Windows are huge — you won’t feel left in the dark or cramped here.
Rooms are clubby but glamorous, with plush beds, mahogany writing
desks, and chaise longues.
Best Place to Splurge: You want luxury? You’ve got luxury at three of
Chicago’s hotels, which are among the best in the world. The Peninsula
Chicago was named Conde Nast Traveler’s “Number One Hotel in the
World,” in 2006, as well as Travel + Leisure magazine’s 2006 “Number 
One Urban Hotel Spa.” The attention to detail, regal pampering, and well-
connected concierges you’ll find at the ultra-luxe Ritz-Carlton Chicago
and Four Seasons Hotel Chicago make them the hotels of choice for
travelers who want to feel like royalty.
Best Place to Save a Buck: Red Roof Inn Chicago Downtown offers a
fabulous location for a bargain price. But the Hampton Inn & Suites
Chicago–Downtown gets bonus points for being a bargain stay and for
having a pool.
Best Swimming Pool: With its dazzling, all-tile, junior Olympic-size pool
constructed in 1929, the InterContinental Chicago takes this award
easily.
For more information on the hotels listed in this section, see Chapter 9.
The Best Restaurants
Best New Restaurant: How can you give this title to any restaurant other
than Grant Achatz’s Alinea, named best restaurant in the nation by
Gourmet magazine in 2006? Of course, if you don’t have hundreds of dol-
lars to drop on a meal, you may want to try something that’s both well-
recommended and affordable (but still hopping), such as Avec, which is
garnering kudos from foodies nationwide for its Mediterranean small-
plate dining. It’s small, it’s crowded (you share a table with other
diners), but it’s a truly unique experience.
Part I: Introducing Chicago 
10

Best View: A location right on the Magnificent Mile means The Hancock
Observatory (Chapter 11) offers an up-close-and-personal view of the
city from its observation deck. For lunch, visit the Signature Room at
the 95th, a sleek restaurant that offers a delicious lunch buffet. On a
clear day, you can see 50 miles and part of three surrounding states —
Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin. (Ladies, make sure to visit the rest-
room — it’s got the best views in the restaurant!)
Best Ice Cream: Since the 1920s, Margie’s Candies has been serving
mammoth sundaes in conch-shell-shaped dishes. Margie is gone now,
but her husband, Peter, still mans the cash register. Don’t miss the
homemade hot fudge, real butterscotch, and caramel. The place is
frozen in time — about 1940, to be exact — and is stuffed with kitschy
dolls, boxes of homemade candy, stuffed animals, and news clippings
from through the years.
Best Outdoor Dining: Long tables and family-style dining reign in
Greektown, making it a comfortable, fun destination for families and
large groups. At Pegasus, a rooftop garden affords diners a panoramic
view of the Chicago skyline. The restaurant is so family- and large-group-
oriented, that when I called to make a reservation for a group of ten, the
host replied, “Ten is not a big group!” So there you have it.
Best Burger: The hamburger at Mike Ditka’s Restaurant tastes more like
chopped steak and can easily feed two. Sports fans will be entertained
by football memorabilia, and Bears fans can relive the glory days of
former coach Mike Ditka, who owns the place. Take your kids to the
main dining room, though, because the bar vicinity tends to get a little
foggy with cigar smoke.
Best Barbecue: At longtime city favorite Carson’s, $20 gets you a full slab
(nearly 2 pounds’ worth) of incredible baby-back ribs, accompanied by a
bowl of Carson’s almost-as-famous coleslaw and a choice of potatoes.
Best Vegetarian: Vegetarians and veggie lovers alike will delight in the
twist on fine dining served up at Green Zebra. The restaurant features
“small plates” of veggie specialties, such as fennel risotto cake with a
syrah reduction, and Hawaiian heart of palm with Kaffir lime and Thai
basil chile.
Best Beer Garden: Chicago’s favorite hometown beer, Goose Island, has
a wonderful brewery and restaurant with a fantastic beer garden that
welcomes families, too. Sample some of the brews on tap (and Goose
Island’s own root beer, for those not imbibing).
Best Family-Style Dining: Maggiano’s is a mecca for Italian family-style
dining. Heaping plates of pasta meant to be shared make Maggiano’s a
good choice for a budget-conscious (and hungry!) family. Everything on
the menu is super-sized. Most steaks are more than a pound, and the full
pasta dishes weigh in at over 25 ounces. (You can also get half-portions:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Chicago 11

You’d be amazed at how large even a 14-ounce portion of pasta can be!)
You’re expected to share dishes, pass things around, and try a little bit
of everything.
Best Hot Dog: Gold Coast Dogs, a River North fast-food stand, serves up
the authentic item, meaning a Vienna All-Beef Frank slathered with mus-
tard, green relish, chopped onion, sliced tomato, hot peppers, and
celery salt. Your kids may be brave enough to ask for and receive
ketchup, but as an adult, I wouldn’t risk the disapproving, raised-eye-
brow look you’ll get from the counter staff. You can round out the meal
with cheese fries, made from Idaho potatoes and topped with a generous
glob of Wisconsin cheddar.
Best Pizza: In the town where deep-dish pies were born, Chicagoans
take their out-of-town relatives to Gino’s East or Lou Malnati’s to taste
the real thing: mouthwatering slabs of pizza loaded with fresh ingredi-
ents atop delectably sweet crusts. Lou’s fan base is so enamored that
the restaurant has instituted a popular overnight mail-order business to
get expat Chicagoans with a deep-dish jones over the hump.
Best Fast Food: Even though you’re in the hometown of McDonald’s, my
vote goes to foodlife in Water Tower Place, a food court exemplar with
everything from Asian noodles to pizza to smoothies.
Best Brunch: Cajun and Southern cooking is in store for you at Wishbone.
Outsider art, bright colors, and a bustling crowd make this a great place
for kids. A diverse crowd, from Harpo Studios employees (Oprah is head-
quartered around the corner) to businesspeople in suits and ad-agency
types, frequent the place. For brunch, try the salmon cakes.
Best Neighborhood Hangout: Stanley’s is a classic Lincoln Park restau-
rant with a family-friendly bent. When you walk in, there’s a bar, but the
adjacent dining room feels as though you’ve entered someone’s family
room, decorated with photos, quilts, bowling trophies, and children’s
drawings. On Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., there’s an all-
you-can-eat brunch buffet, featuring make-your-own omelets, build-your-
own-Belgian waffles, home-fried potatoes, fried chicken, and mashed
potatoes. Daily specials are posted on the chalkboard out front.
For more information on the restaurants listed in this section, see
Chapter 10.
The Best Museums
Best Museum for Older Children: Yes, the biggest T. rex fossil ever
unearthed resides at Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History. As
long as you’re going to see “Sue” (if you’re on a first-name basis with 
the famous T. rex), you can check out an entire “campus” of museums
nearby, including the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum and 
Part I: Introducing Chicago 
12

the John G. Shedd Aquarium. Farther south in Hyde Park, the incompa-
rable Museum of Science and Industry wows kids and adults with a
real-life U-boat submarine that’s been completely refurbished and placed
in a new indoor exhibit, as well as an airplane, an ant colony, a doll-
house, and more.
Best Museum for Younger Children: The Shedd, the nation’s largest
(and oldest) indoor aquarium, is housed in a spectacular 1929 Beaux
Arts structure. The aquarium revamped and improved facilities to cele-
brate its 75th anniversary in 2005.
Best Art Museum: Downtown, the Art Institute of Chicago is a great
starting point for seeing masterpieces.
Best Museum for Exploring the Outdoors Indoors: Located in Lincoln
Park, the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum is an environmental museum
for the 21st century and boasts kid-friendly hands-on exhibits.
For more information on the museums in this section, see Chapter 11.
The Best Nature
Best Park: The city’s latest and greatest urban project welcomed flocks
of visitors in its first month alone, and for good reason. The 25-acre
Millennium Park sets a new standard for what an urban park can be.
With sculptures you can touch and feel (and in one case, splash around
in), it’s also home to a spectacular Frank Gehry–designed band shell and
pedestrian bridge. And of course, the sentimental favorite is Lincoln
Park, worth at least a few hours’ stroll.
Best Golf Course: Within Grant Park on Monroe Street between
Columbus and Lake Shore drives, you may want to putt around at The
Green at Grant Park, an 18-hole putting course (and with its beautifully
landscaped greens, you’ll recognize immediately that this is not your
usual miniature-golf course).
Best Beach: In Lincoln Park, stroll the lakefront path, and whether you’re
coming from the north or south, eventually, you’ll see the North Avenue
pedestrian bridge that crosses Lake Shore Drive. Walk over the lanes of
traffic, and you’ll find Chicago’s number-one summer-fun destination:
North Avenue Beach. Join Chicagoans at the lake in a game of beach
volleyball, or simply walk, run, or relax.
Best View: Lively, renovated Navy Pier has become the city’s number-
one tourist destination over the last decade. The view as you walk out
on the pier, and then turn and watch the city glimmer in the twilight, is
among the best in the world.
For more information on the listings in this section, see Chapters 11 
and 14.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Chicago 13

The Best Culture
Best Opera: A perennial favorite is the Lyric Opera, one of the nation’s
best opera companies, which amazes with top-notch productions at the
Civic Opera House on the banks of the Chicago River in the Loop. The
opera sells out every performance, but don’t worry: Subscription hold-
ers hand in unused tickets before the performance, so you can still get
some great seats if you know where to look.
Best Symphony: Now under the direction of Dutch-born principal con-
ductor Bernard Haitink (well-known conductor Daniel Barenboim’s term
ended in 2006), the Chicago Symphony Orchestra is world-class.
Best Ballet: Chicago has adopted the Joffrey Ballet, which does a sump-
tuous production of The Nutcracker each holiday season in the spectacu-
lar setting of the Auditorium Theatre, one of Chicago’s architectural
gems.
Best Theater: Excellent theater companies include the Goodman,
Steppenwolf, and Victory Gardens theaters. Steppenwolf, in Lincoln
Park, focuses on new American works, as well as adaptations and recon-
sidered revivals of older plays. The Goodman has a more traditional
repertoire and includes some musicals each season. Victory Gardens
stages world-premier plays, which the rest of the U.S. theater scene
keeps an eye on, in a new home, the former Biograph Theater in Lincoln
Park. Other theater highlights include the refurbished Oriental and
Palace theaters and two top-notch facilities in their respective genres,
the Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier and the Old Town
School of Folk Music theater and education center, which presents tra-
ditional and contemporary folk music from around the world.
If you skip Chicago’s theater scene, you just may miss out on the next
Broadway hit. Two of the most widely applauded Broadway productions
of the past few years started at the Goodman Theater: Arthur Miller’s
Death of a Salesman, starring Brian Dennehy, and Eugene O’Neill’s Moon

Second City, Third Coast
Although it may surprise residents of the first two coasts (East and West, that is),
Chicagoans consider themselves residents of the Third Coast — Lake Michigan’s
shore. Thanks to the foresight of city founders who, in 1836, wrote that the lakefront
was a public ground “to remain forever open, clear, and free” from construction, the
shore has no warehouses or shipping docks. More than half of Chicago’s 2,800 acres
of lakefront were created by filling in the lake and building a string of splendid
lakeshore parks. The result? Thirty miles of sand beaches, green lawns, beds of flow-
ers, and bicycle paths.

for the Misbegotten, with Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne. The Producers,
starring Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, debuted in Chicago before
taking New York by storm.
Best Comedy: Nobody does comedy better than The Second City, a
training ground for comedians such as John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Bill
Murray, and Chris Farley. Other companies are on the rise: Improv fans
should also check out ImprovOlympics, located near Wrigley Field, for
cutting-edge comedy performed by teams.
For more information on the performing arts events listed in this sec-
tion, refer to Chapters 15 and 16.
The Best Live Music
Best Blues: Chicago is the blues capital of the world. And if you get to
know this style of music, you may gain a greater appreciation for other
popular forms, such as jazz and rock ’n’ roll. Nothing is quite as sweet as
hanging out at Buddy Guy’s Legends on a Thursday night and discover-
ing that the man seated next to you is B. B. King’s drummer, visiting
Chicago on a rare night off. Even if you don’t love the blues, do yourself
a favor and check it out when you’re here.
Best Rock: You can’t do better than Metro, housed on North Clark Street
in an old theater (they just removed all the seats). It’s one of Chicago’s
best live-music venues, intimate but not too small, and the launching
pad for great local bands gone international, like the Smashing Pumpkins
and Ministry.
Best Small Venues: One of the city’s most intimate rooms for live music
is at Schuba’s Tavern and the Harmony Grill on North Southport
Avenue. The style here is eclectic, with sounds ranging from rock to funk
to the occasional mariachi band. You’ll find everything from local bands
on their way up to national acts still loyal to Schuba’s. It’s general admis-
sion (mostly standing, with some seats) and has the added bonus of
having the Harmony Grill connected to it — this atmospheric former
Schlitz Brewery tap house built around 1900 still offers Schlitz beer in
bottles.
Best Eclectic Music: Elbo Room is one of the top venues for music in the
city, located on North Lincoln Avenue. Upstairs, there’s a cocktail lounge
with a full bar. Downstairs, you’ll find the stage, with seating along the
walls. It’s sweaty, crowded, and filled with lovers of live music from ska
to hip-hop.
For more information on music venues, head to Chapter 16.

Building Blocks: Local Architecture
One advantage to having your city burn to the ground: You can rebuild it
with style. Thanks to the Great Fire of 1871, Chicago’s architects were
able to start over and “make no small plans,” as city planner and vision-
ary Daniel Burnham said. Chicago is the birthplace of modern architec-
ture and the skyscraper. Chicago is home to 45 Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe buildings and 75 Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, plus dozens by the
first Chicago school and the second Chicago school. Enough said? The
Chicago Architecture Foundation helps visitors discover the city’s
architectural gems (see Chapter 11).
Taste of Chicago: Local Cuisine
If you have to eat while you’re here, you’re in luck. Food doesn’t get
much better than the Mexican cuisine at Frontera Grill, the ribs at Twin
Anchors, the burgers at Mike Ditka’s Restaurant, the sushi at Mirai
Sushi, or the Italian at Tuscany on Taylor in Little Italy. And if that’s not
enough, how about steak and mammoth baked potatoes slathered in
butter at Gibson’s or deep-dish pizza at Gino’s East? Oh, I can’t neglect
to mention Italian beef sandwiches and garlicky Chicago hot dogs. (See
Chapter 10 for restaurants and light bites.) And don’t forget to finish off
your meal with a conch-shell sundae oozing with warm, homemade hot
fudge (or, yum, homemade butterscotch) from Margie’s Candies. Feeling
hungry yet?
Word to the Wise: The Local Lingo
National news anchors aspire to the flat vowels and plain language of the
Midwest. You should have no problem understanding the inhabitants of
this, the most Midwestern of cities. With the exception of “Da Bears” and
a few other local phrases, Chicago-ese is easy on the ears.
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
So many great American writers have come from Chicago, lived here
during their productive years, or set their work within the city’s confines
that it’s impossible to recommend a single book that says everything
about Chicago. However, here are a few suggestions to get you started.
Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle tells the tale of a young immigrant encounter-
ing the filthy, brutal city. Its 1906 publication caused an uproar that led

Master builders: Sullivan, 
Wright, and Mies
Visitors from around the world flock to Chicago to see the groundbreaking work of
three major architects: Sullivan, Wright, and Mies. They all lived and worked in the
Windy City, leaving behind a legacy of innovative structures that still inspire architects
today. Here’s the rundown on each of them:
Louis Sullivan (1865–1924)
Quote: “Form ever follows function.”
Chicago buildings: Auditorium Building, 430 S. Michigan Ave. (Adler & Sullivan,
1887–1889); James Charnley House, 1365 Astor St. (Adler & Sullivan, with Frank 
Lloyd Wright, 1892); and Carson Pirie Scott & Co., 1 S. State St. (1899, 1903, with later
additions).
Innovations: Father of the Chicago school, Sullivan was perhaps at his most original
in the creation of his intricate, nature-inspired ornamentation, examples of which
cover the entrance to Carson Pirie Scott & Co.
Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959)
Quote: “Nature is my manifestation of God.”
Chicago buildings: Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, 951 Chicago Ave., Oak Park
(1889–1911); Unity Temple, 875 Lake St., Oak Park (1905–1908); The Rookery, 209 S.
LaSalle St. (interior renovation, 1907); and Frederick C. Robie House, 5757 S. Woodlawn
Ave., Hyde Park (1909).
Innovations: While in Chicago, Wright developed the architecture of the Prairie School,
a largely residential style combining natural materials, an intercommunication
between interior and exterior spaces, and the sweeping horizontals of the Midwestern
landscape. (For tours of Wright’s home and studio, see Chapter 11.)
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969)
Quote: “Less is more.”
Chicago buildings: 860–880 N. Lake Shore Dr. (1949–1951); S. R. Crown Hall, 3360 S.
State St. (1956); and Chicago Federal Center, Dearborn Street between Adams Street
and Jackson Boulevard (1959–1974).
Innovations: Mies van der Rohe brought the office tower of steel and glass to the
United States. His stark facades don’t immediately reveal his careful attention to details
and materials.

to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. James T. Farrell’s trilogy
Studs Lonigan, published in the 1930s, explores the power of ethnic and
neighborhood identity in Chicago. Other novels set in Chicago include
Saul Bellow’s The Adventures of Augie March and Humboldt’s Gift,
Theodore Dreiser’s Sister Carrie, and Richard Wright’s Native Son.
For an engrossing overview of the city’s history, read City of the Century
by Donald Miller; an excellent PBS special based on the book is also
available on video and DVD. For a contemporary look at life in Chicago,
take a look at two books that give a human face to the city’s shameful
public-housing history: Daniel Coyle’s Hardball: A Season in the Projects,
the true story of youngsters on a Little League baseball team from
Cabrini Green; and Alex Kotlowitz’s There Are No Children Here, a por-
trait of children growing up in the Robert Taylor homes.
And, of course, no one has given a voice to the people of Chicago as
have the estimable Studs Terkel, whose books Division Street: America,
Working, and Chicago are based on interviews with Chicagoans from
every neighborhood and income level; and the late newspaper columnist
Mike Royko, author of perhaps the definitive account of Chicago
machine politics, Boss. His columns have been collected in One More
Time: The Best of Mike Royko and For The Love of Mike: More of the Best
of Mike Royko.
Chicago became a popular setting for feature films and television shows
in the 1980s and 1990s, and the trend continues today. For a look at
Chicago on the silver screen, check out Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986),
the ultimate teenage wish-fulfillment fantasy; The Fugitive (1993), which
used the city’s El trains as an effective backdrop; and My Best Friend’s
Wedding (1997).
For many Chicagoans, though, the quintessential hometown movie
scene is the finale to The Blues Brothers (1980), which features a multicar
pileup in the center of downtown Daley Plaza. Of course, others argue
that the Oscar-winning musical Chicago (2002) sings the praises of
Chicago — 1920s Chicago, that is — like no other. And don’t forget
Barbershop (2002) and its sequel, Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004),
both offering a view of contemporary South Side Chicago from a seat in
a neighborhood barbershop. And millions of people visit Chicago (or 
at least its fictional “County General” hospital) each week on the long-
running TV series ER.

W
hen should you go to Chicago? That depends. What kind of
weather do you like? Chicago has it all — sometimes within a
day! No doubt you’ve heard the wisecracks about Chicago’s weather
(that is, the city has only two seasons — winter and August) It’s a bit of
a cliché, but like many of those, there’s some truth to it.
Chicago weather does hit the extremes. And it’s oh-so-changeable. I’ve
left my apartment on a sunny, summer day in jeans and a T-shirt only to
witness the temperature drop 15°F in 15 minutes and find myself pining
for a sweater. In this chapter, I tell you what you need to know about the
city’s ever-changing seasons, as well as its many festivals, so you can
determine your ideal time to go.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Most Chicago visitors find the ideal times to visit are late spring and
early fall. In the spring, you soak up blossoms, blooms, and equable tem-
peratures. Spring in Chicago may be short, but it’s invigorating and
widely welcomed. Some Chicagoans, eager for warm weather, lie out on
roof-deck lounge chairs in 55°F April weather. Fall, with its golds, reds,
and browns, provides crisp, clear days with idyllic balmy interludes.
Pleasant weather sometimes lingers into late November.
Chicago has a reputation for being extremely cold in the winter.
Daunting days of subzero temperatures and –40°F wind chills do occur.
Salt trucks rumble incessantly over Chicago’s frozen streets, and pot-
holes almost large enough to swallow cars bring rush-hour traffic to a
halt. Summer isn’t exactly a piece of cake, either: During the dog days,
you may have whole strings of days when temperatures stay in the 90s
and high humidity drains your energy.

But those are the extremes. Lake Michigan has a moderating effect on
Chicago weather, air-conditioning the city in summer and warming the
cold in the winter. (Of course, in the Windy City, the lake also has a nega-
tive effect — the same breeze that cuts the humidity in the summer can
bite straight through the thickest down jacket in the winter.)
Table 3-1 gives you the lowdown on the average temperatures in Chicago.
Remember, though, that these are only averages. You may want to pack
an outfit or two for cooler or warmer weather, depending on when you
plan to travel. For all of my tips on packing, see Chapter 7.

What follows is a rundown of the pros and cons of each season.
Springtime in Chicago
Many of Chicago’s 33 million annual visitors choose spring for their trav-
els. What follows are the best reasons to go to Chicago in the springtime:
 It’s warming up! Days are longer. The city begins to wake up after a
long winter’s nap.
 Chicago plants thousands of tulips and daffodils, which pop up
optimistically during the season and brighten the streetscape.
But keep in mind the following springtime pitfalls:
 Just because the days are warming up doesn’t mean that the
weather is necessarily nice. Strong winds can blow, and buckets 
of rain can fall during long strings of gray days.
 Spring is the time of year (along with winter) when theater shows
may close for a week. Remember: Performers need vacations, too.
 You’re a bit in limbo as far as events go. Festivals don’t start until
June, and you’re too late for the holiday season and the decorations.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 23

Summer in the city
Ahhh, summer. Lazy days and quiet nights. . . . Well, not in Chicago!
Summer is festival time. Knowing what lies on the other side of the cal-
endar (winter!), Chicagoans jam-pack their summers full of outdoor
activities — so much so that the choice of activities on weekends can 
be overwhelming. Consider these points:
 The air may be hot and humid, but you can usually count on a cool
lake breeze. If you’re venturing to the suburbs, however, the tem-
peratures there can be 10°F higher.
 Everyone is outside, soaking up the good weather. People stay out
late, eating and drinking at sidewalk cafes.
 The weather is often perfect for taking boat cruises, strolling along
Navy Pier, and enjoying other activities on the lakefront.
But, again, keep in mind the following:
 Festivals can be hot and cramped. (Then again, that’s the point,
right?)
 Because of the heat, everyone is at the lake, making the area a con-
gested free-for-all: inline skaters skating into bikers who are biking
into runners who are running into Fido, who just broke off his
leash!
 School is out, and the kid-oriented attractions are swarming. Be
prepared to leave extra time for parking and standing in line at
attractions such as the John G. Shedd Aquarium, Sears Tower
Skydeck, and Museum of Science and Industry.
A fall to remember
In my opinion, fall is a beautiful time of year — no matter where you are.
Here are some autumn bonuses for the Chicago scene:
 You get the best weather in the fall — still warm enough, but not so
hot and humid that you’re going to have a meltdown. You have the
best shot at an uninterrupted string of beautiful days.
 The cultural scene is back in swing, with openings for the opera
and symphony seasons.
You should look out for some things, however:
 Convention season is in full swing. Getting a hotel room or restau-
rant table can be a challenge. And if you do, you may find yourself
surrounded by dozens of computer geeks . . . or dentists . . . or
restaurant owners. Then again, you may enjoy that!
 Beware of unpredictable September or October Indian summer
heat waves. (Don’t forget the shorts and sunscreen — just in case.)

Winter in the Midwest
Winter brings visions of softly falling snowflakes, but the reality is that
those lovely snowflakes result in slick roads and salt trucks. Consider
the following when planning a winter vacation in Chicago:
 During the holidays, the city looks beautiful. All of Michigan Avenue
is lit up. Chicago goes all-out with Christmas decorations.
 Hotel prices sink during the slowest weeks of the winter (post-
holidays, that is), making the search for that good room at a great
rate much easier.
 After Christmas, a peaceful hush settles over the city. You can have
Michigan Avenue to yourself on the weekdays. After-holiday sales
keep the stores busy on the weekends, but otherwise, you can pre-
tend that the city is all yours.
 Mayor Daley has made an effort to make Chicago attractive to
tourists in the winter with events such as WinterBreak Chicago,
which fills the month of February with a series of blues concerts
and more.
Winter does have its downsides, however. Consider the following:
 December is a bad month for crowds. Michigan Avenue is packed,
literally — so much so that making your way down the street can
be a challenge.
 Between conventions, family vacations, and savvy travelers, winter
is rapidly becoming a more popular time to visit. Tourists are dis-
covering that winter is Chicago’s bargain season, but (so far) the
cold months are still the least crowded.
 Did I mention winter’s chilly temperatures?
 Because business is slow, hotels, restaurants, and stores take the
opportunity to renovate, meaning that various areas that serve the
public may be closed for maintenance purposes.
 Winter is the other time of year (along with springtime) when
shows may close for a week.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Chicago abounds with ethnic parades and other lively events — most of
them free and packed with locals. You can choose from among a wide
array of events, no matter what the month. The food, music, art, and
flower fairs have established niches in the city’s yearly schedule, along
with the parades and street celebrations staged by many of Chicago’s
numerous ethnic groups. Pick your time, choose your interest, and enjoy.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 25

The best way to stay on top of the current crop of events is to ask the
Chicago Office of Tourism (% 312-744-2400) or the Illinois Bureau of
Tourism (% 800-2CONNECT) to mail you a copy of Chicago Calendar of
Events, an excellent quarterly publication that lists and describes special
events, including museum exhibitions, concert and theatrical perform-
ances, parades, and street festivals. Also ask to be sent the latest material
produced by the Mayor’s Office of Special Events (% 312-744-3315) or
the Special Events Hot Line (% 312-744-3370), which keeps current with
citywide and neighborhood festivals. The Chicago and Illinois offices of
tourism also jointly operate a useful Web site at www.877chicago.com.
Remember that new events may be added every year and that some
events may be discontinued or rescheduled. Call ahead to the sponsor-
ing organization, the Chicago Office of Tourism, or the Mayor’s Office of
Special Events to verify dates, times, and locations.

bird’s-eye view of Chicago from the Ferris wheel (those who are less
fond of heights can stay closer to earth on the carousel), when they
start spinning again after a long winter’s sleep. Another seasonal event
along the water is Pier Walk, a temporary installation of more than 150
large-scale sculptures displayed along the pier’s South Dock. May
through October.
June
The 57th Street Art Fair (% 773-493-3247; www.57thstreetartfair.
org), at 57th and Kimbark streets in Hyde Park, is the oldest juried art

kids will enjoy the festival, which also features arts-and-crafts projects

Chicago Gospel Festival (% 312-744-3315; www.chicagogospel
festival.com), based at the Petrillo Music Shell, at Jackson Drive and
Columbus Drive in Grant Park, is the largest outdoor, free-admission

Jackson, were Southsiders. This three-day festival offers music on three
stages with more than 40 performances. Early June.
Entertainment, readings, food, and books galore abound at Printers Row

Chicago, is the open-air summer home of the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and many visiting performers, from Lyle Lovett to Tony
Bennett to B. B. King. Summer wouldn’t be summer without Ravinia —
it’s a Chicago tradition. Basically, it’s an outdoor concert venue with a
covered pavilion and plenty of lawn seating. Offerings range from classi-
cal to pop. Pack a picnic, jump on the Metra commuter railroad, and join
the crowds sitting under the stars on the lawn. Warning: Ravinia is so
popular that many of the first-rate visiting orchestras, chamber ensem-
bles, pop artists, and dance companies sell out in advance. June through
September.
Fine art from more than 200 painters, sculptors, and jewelry designers,
plus an art auction, garden walk, food and drink, and children’s art activ-
ities can all be found at the Old Town Art Fair (% 312-337-1938; www.
oldtowntriangle.com), in the Old Town neighborhood at Lincoln Park

Lincoln Park. Last Sunday in June at noon.
Sample Carson’s ribs, Eli’s cheesecake, and Pizzeria Uno’s pizza at Taste
of Chicago (% 312-744-3315; www.tasteofchicago.us). This festival

tors. The busiest day is July 3, because of the Independence Day fire-
works that evening over the lake. Late June to early July.
The Chicago Country Music Festival (% 312-744-3315; www.chicago
countryfestival.com), held in Grant Park, is less claustrophobic than
the Taste of Chicago, and it’s held at the same time — best of all, it’s
free. You’ll see big-name entertainers of the country-music genre. Late
June (during the first weekend of Taste of Chicago).
July
Fireworks (launched from barges in Monroe Harbor), concerts, and spir-
ited marches mark the Independence Day Celebration (% 312-744-
3315) in Grant Park. Running concurrently with Taste of Chicago, its
crowds are enormous: Take public transportation. July 3.
The 33-year-old Sheffield Garden Walk (% 773-929-9255; www.
sheffieldfestivals.org) allows you to snoop around the private 
gardens of Lincoln Park homeowners who live around Sheffield and
Webster avenues. Food and drink vendors, live bands, and more make
this a hopping event for Lincoln Park singles. Mid-July.
You won’t believe the crowds — or the big-name bands — that the city’s
oldest church turns out for the Old St. Patrick’s World’s Largest Block
Party, 700 W. Adams at Des Plaines Avenue (% 312-648-1021; www.
worldslargestblockparty.com). The admission price is steep —
around $35 — but we’re talking six bands over two nights on two stages,
plus all the beer you can drink (and people do drink all they possibly
can). Mid-July.
The Venetian Night Boat Parade (% 312-744-3315; www.cityof
chicago.org/specialevents) of beautifully decorated and illuminated
boats takes place to elaborate fireworks and music by the Grant Park
Symphony Orchestra, performing works by Italian composers. Events
take place along the water at Monroe Harbor. End of July.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 29

August
The Chicago Air & Water Show (% 312-744-3315; www.cityof
chicago.org/specialevents) showcases action on, in, and over Lake
Michigan, with stunt pilots and skydivers, wing walkers and precision
flyers, plus water-skiing, windsurfing, and air-sea rescue. You’ll have a
hard time ignoring the show (unless you’re oblivious to sonic booms, 
C-130 cargo planes, stealth bombers, and F-16 fighters roaring over your
head). Hugely popular are the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, who usually
make an appearance. If you bring a portable radio, you can tune into
WBBM (780 AM) to hear the show. Then, you can plant yourself on any
beach up and down the lakefront and avoid the crowds at North Avenue
Beach. Mid-August.
The Chicago Jazz Festival (% 312-744-3315; www.chicagojazz
festival.org), in Grant Park, attracts national names. Jam sessions 
at local jazz clubs stretch into the wee hours. Labor Day weekend.
September
Boulevard Lakefront Bike Tour (% 312-42-PEDAL; www.chicagobike
fed.org) is a 10-mile leisurely tour that lets you explore the city, from
neighborhoods and the lakefront to Chicago’s historic link of parks and
boulevards. It starts and ends at the University of Chicago in Hyde Park,
which hosts the annual Bike Expo, with vendors and entertainment, the
same day. A Sunday in mid-September.
Around the Coyote (% 773-342-6777; www.aroundthecoyote.org)
hosts one of the nation’s largest concentrations of artists. Tour hun-
dreds of artists’ studios and see music performances and fashion shows
in the Wicker Park and Bucktown neighborhoods. Second weekend in
September.
Chicago is home to the nation’s second-largest Mexican-American popula-
tion, and the Mexican Independence Day Parade (% 312-744-3315),
along Dearborn Street between Wacker Drive and Van Buren Street, is
always a big event. Another parade (% 773-521-5387), is held on the next
day on 26th Street in the Little Village neighborhood. Mid-September.
A relative newcomer to the scene, World Music Festival Chicago
(% 312-744-6630; www.ci.chi.il.us/WorldMusic) — the City’s
Department of Cultural Affairs’ major undertaking — brings in top 
performers from Zimbabwe to Sri Lanka and Hungary and points in
between. It’s been hugely popular, so call early for schedules and tickets;
many performances sell out. Shows are a mix of free and ticketed per-
formances (most are $10 or less). The Museum of Contemporary Art, 
the Chicago Cultural Center, the Old Town School of Folk Music, and the
Hot House host many of the performances. Throughout September.
Celtic Fest Chicago (% 312-744-3315; www.cityofchicago.org/
specialevents), at the Petrillo Music Shell in Grant Park, at Jackson
Part I: Introducing Chicago 
30

Drive and Columbus Drive, is the city’s newest music festival, celebrat-
ing the music and dance of Celtic traditions from around the world. 
Mid-September.
October
One of Chicago’s largest parades — the Columbus Day Parade (% 312-
828-0010) — lasts two hours, includes more than 200 bands and floats,
and features a celebrity grand marshal. (President George H. W. Bush
and Barbara Bush have served, as did the late Joe DiMaggio.) The route
is Columbus Drive from Balbo to Monroe streets. Closest Monday to
October 12, at around noon.
The world-class Chicago Marathon (% 312-904-9800; www.chicago
marathon.com) begins and ends in Grant Park and usually attracts many
elite runners who hope to attempt world-record times because the course
is flat and, therefore, fast. Mid-October.
The Chicago International Film Festival (% 312-332-3456; www.chicago
filmfestival.org), the oldest competitive film festival in the country,
has screenings for more than two weeks at theaters across the city. Mid-
to late October.
November
State Street Thanksgiving Parade (% 312-751-5681; www.chicago
festivals.org) is an annual event that takes place on Thanksgiving
morning beginning at 8:30 a.m. The parade marches up State Street, from
Congress to Randolph. Fourth Thursday in November.
Disney sponsors the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival (% 312-642-3570;
www.themagnificentmile.com), a colorful parade of characters that
makes its way south on Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to the Chicago
River. As the parade passes, lights are illuminated block by block.
Carolers, elves, and minstrels appear with Santa along the avenue all day
and into the evening. Saturday before Thanksgiving.
Chicago Humanities Festival (% 312-661-1028; www.chfestival.org)
takes over locations all over downtown, from libraries to concert halls.
Over 11 days, the festival presents performances, readings, and sympo-
siums tied to an annual theme (recent themes included “Brains &
Beauty” and “Crime & Punishment”). Expect appearances by major
authors, scholars, and policymakers, all at a very reasonable price ($5
per event). Early November.
The Christmas Tree Lighting (% 312-744-3315), at Daley Center Plaza
in the Loop, is magical, as the switch is flipped around dusk. Day after
Thanksgiving.
Colorful illuminated displays brighten long nights during the holidays at
the Zoo Lights Festival (% 312-742-2000; www.lpzoo.com), at Lincoln
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 31

Park Zoo, 2200 N. Cannon Dr. Another special tradition is the annual
Caroling to the Animals, a daylong songfest on a Saturday early in the
month. Late November through the first week in January.
December

hicago has a way of eating up your money: dinner at Harry Caray’s
(Chapter 10), cabs, admission fees, tips for the bellhop and house-
keeping, the bottle of water at Navy Pier (Chapter 11), coffee at Corner
Bakery (Chapter 13) — and all that wonderful shopping. To make mat-
ters worse, there are ATMs on practically every corner. With cash and
credit so accessible, spending can get out of hand fast.
Before you go, come up with a realistic idea of how much you can spend.
You don’t want to worry constantly about every cent you spend, but you
also don’t want to faint when you get your credit card bills, either. The
idea is to have fun and enjoy yourself without agonizing. For peace of
mind and for the sake of your bank account, know when you can afford
to splurge and when to economize (and plan to do both!).
This chapter gives you some ideas of how to allocate your funds. After
all, you don’t want to find yourself still paying for this trip when you set
off on your next adventure!
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting a trip to Chicago — or to anywhere else for that matter — is a
matter of give and take. Unless your bank account is bottomless, you’ll
need to make some trade-offs. Are you prepared to sacrifice some hotel
comforts to pay for tickets to a hit musical? Can you eat hot dogs for
lunch in exchange for splurging on a couple of dinners at restaurants
owned by superstar chefs? Are you just as happy taking home photos as
expensive souvenirs? Then maybe you can have cocktails downtown on
North Michigan Avenue in the Signature Room at the 95th at the top of
the John Hancock Center Observatory (Chapter 11). It’s all a matter of
your priorities.

Taxes and fees
These expenses aren’t usually paid in cash, so they’re easy to overlook.
When you arrange any commercial transaction — booking a hotel room
or renting a car, for example — be sure to ask for the total cost, which
will inevitably be more than the great-sounding price you find on the
Web site, in the ad, or over the phone.
Here’s how taxes and fees can expand the price:
 Chicago sales tax is 9 percent. Restaurants in the central part of
the city add another 1 percent tax to your bill.
 Hotel room tax totals 15.39 percent.
 Many restaurants add a 15 percent to 18 percent gratuity to the
bill if your party is larger than five people.
Gratuities
The average tip for most service providers, such as waiters and cab-
drivers, is 15 percent, rising to 20 percent for particularly good service.
If you’re looking for an easy way to calculate the tip in a restaurant, dou-
bling the tax equates to 18 percent of the bill. A 10 percent to 15 percent
tip is sufficient if you just have a drink at a bar. Bellhops get $1 or $2 a
bag, hotel housekeepers should receive at least $1 per person per day,
and valet parking and coat-check attendants expect $1 to $2 for their
services.
Hotel phones
Your hotel may charge you $1 or more per call from your room — even 
if you’re just calling a toll-free number or contacting a long-distance
operator to use your telephone credit card or calling card. If you have a
mobile phone with unlimited (or a large number of included) minutes,
you may want to use it rather than the hotel phone. But make sure to
check with your provider to find out if you have to pay roaming charges
outside your home calling zone.
Incidentals
You may not notice the little costs each time they occur, but if you’re
stopping for coffee twice a day, buying bottled water, or purchasing a
second map because you left the first one in your hotel room, you could
easily be spending $20 to $30 more per day than necessary. Buy water 
at a drugstore or supermarket, stash it in your hotel room, and take a
bottle with you each time you head out. Have your morning cup of
coffee from the coffeemaker in your hotel room and stop once at a coffee
shop as a treat during the day (it’s also a good opportunity to use the
restroom; they can be hard to find in downtown Chicago). Make some
trail mix from nuts and raisins and put it in a resealable plastic bag, or
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
36

throw some energy bars into your purse or backpack. Try to not waste
too much on incidentals, and you’ll have more to spend on entertain-
ment and the like.
For tips on budgeting, see “Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun” at the end
of this chapter. For information on Chicago’s taxes, some of which are
quite significant (like our 9 percent sales tax), see the appendix.

Transportation
You don’t need a car in Chicago. (Hey, when I lived in the heart of the
city, I didn’t even own a car.) You can get around easily, and usually
safely, on Chicago’s relatively efficient public transportation system and
on foot. A bus or subway ride costs only $2, and a transfer that provides
two additional rides (if taken within a two-hour window) is only an addi-
tional 25¢. Cabs are plentiful and relatively inexpensive. The average cab
ride in the downtown area costs $7 to $10. All of which means that you
won’t need a rental car, even if you’re not staying downtown. So, assum-
ing you spend $25 a day on cabs and public transportation, you save a
sizable chunk of the $40 to $50 that you may otherwise spend on a car
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 37

rental, plus valet parking at your hotel, which runs as high as $36 a day.
That could amount to more than $60 a day to apply to other expenses.
(For more information about getting around the city, see Chapter 8.)
Watch the meter. Taxis cost $2.25 as soon as the driver starts the meter,
and then $1.80 for each mile. The driver adds $1 for each additional pas-
senger aged 12 to 65. At press time, there was talk of raising the fare, so
don’t be surprised if you jump into a cab and it costs you a bit more.
Lodging
Lodging is pretty easy to figure out. The cost is set after you book your
accommodations and is less flexible than other areas of your budget,
such as attractions. You have to have a place to stay. So, as in other real-
estate matters, location, location, and location determine the cost of
your lodgings. The more central you are to Chicago’s Magnificent Mile,
the more expensive the hotel. If you’re prepared to stay a little bit away
from downtown, you can save on lodging. But if being in the middle of
the action is valuable to you, you can find other areas for economizing.
For me, location is most important. I will take a smaller room in a hotel
that’s centrally located over a larger room in a hotel that’s far from the
main attractions. I like to walk everywhere and would rather spend more
on the room and less on cab fare. But that’s me. You need to decide if
the time spent traveling on public transportation or the expense of
taking cabs is worth the money you save by staying in a hotel away from
the center of the city.
According to the Hotel/Motel Association of Illinois, the average hotel
room rate in 2006 was about $118 for the Chicago metropolitan area, up
7 percent from 2005. Downtown rates are higher than metropolitan aver-
ages, so when you figure in room tax, you’re going to be spending (at the
very least) $130 for a room — although you can shave off a few dollars
by staying at the downtown Red Roof Inn or on the Near North Side, for
example. If you’re able to spend $160, you can figure in a few extra com-
forts and conveniences. Push this up to $220 a night and you can get a
comfortable and well-located hotel room. (See Chapter 9 for the low-
down on the Chicago hotel scene.)
Dining
Because Chicago has so many restaurants, inexpensive and moderately
priced eateries are easy to find. Many have the equivalent of blue-plate
specials. When you splurge at a top-tier restaurant, consider a multi-
course tasting menu to keep costs down. In most cases, these fixed-price
menus, which often showcase the chef’s best efforts, are a much better
deal than ordering à la carte.
You can save on breakfast if you choose a hotel with room rates that
include continental breakfast or, in some cases, a full buffet. Otherwise,
look for a coffee shop where you can get a roll or bagel, plus juice or
other beverage, for about $7. With careful choices (especially if you opt
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
38

for soup and salad), you can eat lunch for $10. You can have a decent
dinner in a non-franchise restaurant for $25 or less.
Hit Lou Mitchell’s (Chapter 10) in the Loop for breakfast, and you won’t
need lunch. The hearty portions and low prices make this spot a favorite
with locals. You get free doughnut holes while you wait in line, and for
about $10 you can get a gigantic omelet that will keep you — and maybe
a travel companion, too — going ’til dinner. (P.S. Ladies also get a free
box of Milk Duds when they finish!)
Sightseeing
Admission fees for museums, observation decks, and other attractions
can add up quickly. To figure out how much to budget, refer to the chap-
ters on sightseeing (Chapters 11 and 13), compile a list of must-see
attractions, and total the price of admissions. For ways to trim your
budget, see “Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun” at the end of this chapter.
Shopping
This category is, of course, highly flexible. Budgeting often involves at
least one four-letter word: sale. Check the daily newspapers, such as the
Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times (especially the Sunday editions),
for announcements. To be sure of hitting the city’s most spectacular
sales, plan to visit in January. And when it comes to Chicago souvenirs,
why not be creative? Instead of bringing home overpriced Chicago Cubs
jerseys from the souvenir store, you can buy something unique, such as
a package of money from your free tour of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago. The bills are shredded, of course, but it makes a fun gift.
Nightlife
Entertainment can be a tough category in which to economize. If you
enjoy a cocktail or a glass of wine, figure on spending about $12 a pop at
a downtown bar. If you’re headed for a jazz or blues club, allow for a
cover charge plus drinks (perhaps with a minimum drink requirement).
However, some lively neighborhood bars serve reasonably priced drinks
(see Chapter 16). And some entertainment won’t cost you a dime, such
as noontime “Under the Picasso” concerts at Daley Plaza, and free
movies at the Chicago Cultural Center (on South Michigan Avenue just
north of the Art Institute of Chicago) and Oriental Institute Museum in
suburban Hyde Park. In the summer, most music festivals in Grant Park
are free, and the people-watching alone can keep you entertained all
night long. (See Chapter 11 for information on these activities.)
Generally, you can see a show in Chicago for much less than you’d pay
on Broadway, and tickets are cheaper still if you take advantage of dis-
counts that are up to 50 percent the day of the show at Hot Tix booths.
Locations include 163 E. Pearson St. (the Chicago Waterworks Visitor
Center), just off Michigan Avenue, and 78 W. Randolph St., in the Loop.

Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Let’s say you tallied up your expected expenses and tried to make some
trade-offs, but the grand total still seems too high. Now is the time to
think about some serious ways to economize.
Planning tips
When you pull your trip together, consider
 Asking for discount rates: Membership in AAA, frequent-flier plans,
trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for discounted
rates on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, even meals. Ask
about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Going in the off season: If you can travel during non-peak months,
airline tickets are much cheaper. And during the low season (the
depth of winter), you can find hotel prices that are as much as half
of what they are during peak months.
 Traveling on off days of the week: If you can travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday, you may find cheaper airfares. When you
inquire about airfares, ask if you can obtain a lower rate by flying a
different day. Also remember that, for some airlines, staying over a
Saturday night can cut your airfare significantly.
 Reserving your flight well in advance: Fares that require a 21- or
14-day advance purchase can be a great deal.
 Trying a package tour: For many destinations, one call to a travel
agent can net you airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even
some sightseeing, all for much less than if you tried to put the trip
together yourself. (See Chapter 5 for specific suggestions.)
Lodging tips
To trim your hotel bill, think about
 Reserving a hotel room with a kitchen: Doing your own cooking
and dishes may not feel like a vacation, but you save a lot of money
by not eating in restaurants three times a day. Even if you only
make breakfast and an occasional bag lunch in the kitchen, you still
save in the long run. And you won’t be shocked by a hefty room-
service bill.
 Checking into a hotel that includes meals or drinks in its room
rate. Embassy Suites, for example, includes a hot breakfast buffet
and an evening cocktail gathering. Two Kimpton hotels — Hotel
Monaco and Hotel Allegro — offer guests wine and cheese each
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
40

evening. Three Near North hotels — City Suites, Majestic, and
Willows — serve breakfast featuring legendary Ann Sather cinna-
mon rolls. (See Chapter 9 for hotel listings.)
 Asking if your kids can stay in your room for no charge: A room
with two double beds usually doesn’t cost more than a room with one
queen-size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-
person rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you.
Even if you have to pay $20 for a rollaway bed, you save hundreds
by not taking two rooms.
 Avoiding the hotel minibar: If you have midnight cravings, stock
up on beverages and snacks at a supermarket. Even premium
prices at a grocery store are cheaper than the minibar.
 Not paying for amenities you won’t use: If you don’t expect to
have time for a swim in the pool or a workout in the health club,
choose a hotel that doesn’t have (and charge for) those facilities.
Transportation tips
When planning your trips around town, I suggest
 Not renting a car: Unless you’re traveling to the suburbs and
beyond, a car can be a liability and an unnecessary cost, especially
when you add the high cost of parking — over $30 a day at most
major hotels. Buses, trains, and cabs can save you big bucks.
 Studying the public transit system and street pattern: You can
find plenty of advice in this book about riding the Chicago Transit
Authority (CTA). Know in advance where taking a bus or train is
advisable, and remember that the 25¢ transfer is a great deal.
Chicago is a good walking city, and many of the attractions that 
you want to see can be explored on foot. Be sure to pick up a free
public transit map at any CTA station, download maps from the
CTA Web site at www.transitchicago.com, or call % 888-968-
7282. (For the lowdown on public transportation, see Chapter 8.)
 Taking advantage of the CTA Visitor Pass: Passes are a good
investment for visitors who plan to spend much time sightseeing
around the city. (For details, see Chapter 8.)
Dining tips
Before you dive into your next Chicago meal, consider
 Trying expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner: Lunch
tabs are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at most 
top restaurants, and the menu often boasts many of the same 
specialties.
 Keeping an eye on the time: Breakfast specials may end at 10 a.m.
or the early-bird dinner menu may run only until 6:30 p.m. — just
when you realize that you’re hungry.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

 Not drinking in hotel bars: The exceptions are bars such as 
the Palm Court at The Drake Hotel and the Salon in the
InterContinental Chicago, where the price of a drink includes
excellent jazz.
Sightseeing tips
When penny-pinching matters, try
 Buying a Chicago CityPass: The CityPass includes admission to
Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, the Field Museum of
Natural History, the Museum of Science and Industry, the John G.
Shedd Aquarium, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the John
Hancock Center Observatory (see Chapter 11). The adult rate is $50,
and the youth rate (3–11 years) is $39. The value of an adult pass is
$90, so you’re saving loads if you plan to hit most of Chicago’s
attractions. After you present your CityPass at the first attraction,
booklets are valid for nine days. You can purchase a CityPass at any
of the six locations or online at www.citypass.com.
 Taking advantage of freebies: On certain days, some major muse-
ums, such at the Art Institute of Chicago, waive admission. Chicago
also has many some free museums, such as the Oriental Institute
Museum (see Chapter 11).
Handling Money
With the proliferation of ATMs, getting cash away from home — even
from your credit card — is rarely a problem. But if you’re visiting the
ATM every day, you may start racking up significant fees. In that case,
you may want to consider using traveler’s checks. Here’s the lowdown
on the pros and cons of using various forms of payment.
Choosing traveler’s checks or the green stuff
Traveler’s checks are something of an anachronism from the days before
the ATM. The only sound alternative to traveling with dangerously large
amounts of cash, traveler’s checks were as reliable as currency. Unlike
personal checks or cash, traveler’s checks could (and still can) be
replaced if lost or stolen.
These days, traveler’s checks seem less necessary because all U.S.
cities, including Chicago, have 24-hour ATMs. Generally, carrying the
smallest amount of cash possible — enough to pay for cabs, tips, and
other incidentals — is wise.
Two major ATM networks are Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.master
card.com) and Plus (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com). Check the back
of your card for the name of your bank’s network. You may be linked to
two or three networks.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
42

Of course, as with anything else, you pay for the convenience of instant
cash. Many banks impose a fee ($1, $1.50, or even $2) every time a card
is used at an ATM owned by another bank. If you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — if you don’t
mind showing identification every time you want to cash a check.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $10, $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. You pay 
a service charge of 1 percent to 4 percent. You can also get American
Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282;
by using this number, Amex gold and platinum cardholders are exempt
from the 1 percent fee. AAA members can obtain checks without a fee at
most AAA offices.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
several other banks. The service charge is 1.5 percent to 2 percent;
checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. Call
% 800-732-1322 for information. MasterCard also offers traveler’s
checks; call % 800-223-9920 for a list of vendors near you.
Be vigilant when using ATMs. Whenever possible, choose machines in
well-lighted locations where plenty of people are about. And stay alert
while processing your request for cash. Robberies (and worse) can and
do occur around ATMs.
Doting on debit cards
Another way of working with money you have — as opposed to the theo-
retical money of credit cards — is by using a debit card (an ATM card
with a credit card logo). In many cases, your debit and ATM card are the
same piece of plastic. Instead of getting cash, however, the debit card
pays for purchases anywhere a credit card is accepted. The advantage?
The money comes out of your checking account instead of pushing up
against your credit card limit. Plus, you never pay an additional fee to
use it, and you have less cash to carry around.
Using plastic
Invaluable when traveling, credit cards are a safe way to carry money
and provide a convenient record of all your expenses. You can also with-
draw cash advances from your credit cards at any bank (although you
start paying hefty interest on the advance the moment you receive the
cash, and you won’t receive frequent-flier miles on an airline credit
card). At most banks, you don’t even need to go to a teller; you can get 
a cash advance at the ATM if you know your personal identification
number (PIN). If you forget your PIN or didn’t even know you had one,
call the phone number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank
to send it to you. It usually takes five to seven business days though, so
make a note to do this at least a week before you travel.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

Finding Chicago’s ATMs
In Chicago, Chase has a large network of ATMs. On Michigan Avenue,
you’ll find Bank One ATMs in the John Hancock Center Observatory
building and in the Chase building at Ontario Street (near the northwest
corner of the intersection with Michigan Avenue). If you aren’t a Chase
customer, the charge to use the ATM is $1.50. If you’re a Chase customer,
you won’t get charged. Chase is a member of the MAC, Cash Station, and
Cirrus networks.
When using an ATM, exercise the same caution that you would at home
(for example, protect your password). Don’t be complacent just because
you’re in a busy foot-traffic area — that makes running off with your
money easier, not harder.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Most credit card companies have toll-free numbers to call if your wallet or
purse is stolen. Your card issuer may be able to get you a cash advance
and provide an emergency replacement card in a day or two.
Check the back of your card for the issuing bank’s number before you
leave home. Keep the number separate from your wallet. You also can
call toll-free directory assistance (% 800-555-1212) to find your bank’s
number.
Visa and MasterCard have global service numbers: for Visa, % 800-847-
2911; for MasterCard, % 800-307-7309. (Both suggest you contact your
card issuer directly.) American Express cardholders and traveler’s
check holders should call % 800-221-7282.
If you carry traveler’s checks, keep a record of the serial numbers (sepa-
rate from the checks). Keeping a record of your credit card numbers 
and the companies’ emergency numbers also is a good idea. Be sure to
keep a copy of all your travel papers separate from your wallet or purse,
and leave a copy with someone at home in case you need it faxed in an
emergency.
Always notify the police if your wallet is stolen. You probably won’t get
the wallet back, but you will most probably need a copy of the police
report for your insurance or credit card company. In Chicago, % 311 is
the non-emergency police number.

Getting to Chicago
In This Chapter
 Flying to Chicago for the best price
 Discovering other ways to get here from there
 Debating the merits of a package tour
I
t seems that all roads lead to Chicago: The city is a major hub in the
interstate highway system and remains connected to the rest of
North America with passenger rail service. In the center of the country,
Chicago is an easy destination to access by plane, trains, or automobile.
In this chapter, I show you how to go about making your travel arrange-
ments, no matter what mode of transportation you choose.
Flying to Chicago
Most people get here via O’Hare International Airport — the passageway
to Chicago. If most travelers to Chicago are going to share a single expe-
rience, it’s O’Hare. One of the world’s busiest airports, O’Hare is often a
stopover for both domestic and international travelers (mostly because
American and United airlines use O’Hare as a major hub). O’Hare boasts
its own police force, zip code, medical center, cemetery, and chapel.
Some 68 million people pass through O’Hare annually. If you come to
Chicago, you may well do the same. (For info on surviving O’Hare, see
Chapter 8.)
But O’Hare isn’t the only airport in town: Don’t forget Chicago’s smaller
airport, Midway International Airport, which has doubled its public
spaces to accommodate more travelers. And political debate continues
over where and whether to build a third airport. Air service into the
Windy City offers a wide range of choices, from major domestic and
international carriers to small, no-frills airlines (not that many airlines
have an overabundance of frills these days).
Airfares demonstrate capitalism at work — passengers in the same cabin
on the same airplane rarely pay the same fare. Rather, they each pay
what the market will bear. Business travelers pay for the flexibility to
buy their tickets at the last minute, change their itineraries, or get home

before the weekend. Passengers who can book their tickets far in
advance, stay over Saturday night, or are willing to travel on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday pay the least, usually a fraction of the full fare.
On most flights, even the shortest hops, the full fare can reach $1,000 or
more, but a 7-day or 14-day advance-purchase ticket may cost only $200
or $300. Planning ahead pays.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Because O’Hare is one of the country’s busiest airports, almost every air-
line flies through Chicago, many with direct flights. Elk Grove Village, a
suburb of Chicago, houses the headquarters of United Air Lines.
Although this airline giant is going through hard times, it remains one of
the largest carriers in the nation and has one of the most extensive offer-
ings of flights from overseas. In fact, O’Hare handles so many international
flights that it has its own international terminal (Terminal 5). American,
Northwest, and Continental also offer large numbers of flights into both
O’Hare and Midway. Southwest Airlines and other discount carriers have
made extensive investments in facilities at the newly expanded Midway
airport. If you’re flying ATA, AirTran, or Frontier (as well as the aforemen-
tioned Southwest), you’ll likely be heading into Midway. (See the appendix
for the toll-free numbers of all these carriers.)
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is always a coach seat), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Because Chicago has two airports — O’Hare and Midway — you have
more options and chances to lock in a lower fare. Midway is a little
closer to downtown Chicago and a slightly cheaper ride by cab or shut-
tle. Because of varying traffic and road conditions, however, predicting
which airport offers a faster ride into the central city or back is difficult.
Under optimum conditions, the journey between both airports and the
city by car takes around 40 minutes — sometimes less for Midway. But
keep in mind that conditions are rarely optimum. During rush hour, the
same journey can take one to two hours. Both airports are served by
CTA trains, which are oblivious to traffic conditions.
Compared to O’Hare, Midway is smaller, has fewer restaurants and
shops, and is served by fewer airlines. However, you may be able to find
a cheaper fare to Midway. Definitely check flights to both airports before
buying your ticket.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. For some airlines, if you
can book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
46

willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the
least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. The airlines
also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices on their most
popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase requirements and
date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As you plan
your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend to take
place in seasons of low travel volume. You almost never see a sale
around the peak summer-vacation months of July and August, or around
Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare
they have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or have stiff cancellation
penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket price,
and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net.
STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader
in student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. Flights.com
(% 800-872-8800; www.flights.com) has excellent fares worldwide and
“local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800-359-2432; www.1800
flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel and so
has especially good access to fares for sunny destinations. Air Tickets
Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in
Montreal and leverages the currently weak Canadian dollar for low fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies — Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) —
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites, SideStep
(www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users. It purports to
“search 140 sites at once,” but in reality only beats competitors’ fares as
often as other sites do.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
Chapter 5: Getting to Chicago 47

airline Web sites or check megasites that compile comprehensive lists of
last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com).
For last-minute trips (including flight/hotel/car packages), www.site59.
com in the United States and www.lastminute.com in Europe often have
better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all 
major, well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from
Philadelphia to Chicago via Tampa is remote. But your chances of get-
ting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight
prices before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire,
but you have to play their “name our price” game. Note: These days,
Priceline also offers non-opaque service. You now have the option to
pick exact flights, times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid
on opaque fares as before. Check out Priceline.com For Dummies, by
Sascha Segan (Wiley), an excellent resource for getting the lowest air-
fares, hotel rooms, and car rentals.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. 
You can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to Chicago
Chicago is easier to get to by road for more people than almost any
other city in the nation. Within a 300-mile radius of the heart of the city
(or a comfortable one-day drive) lies one of the most densely populated
areas of the country. The Windy City also is a major crossroads of the
interstate highway system. East–west highways I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94
run through Chicago. The city is connected to north–south interstate
routes I-55, I-57, and I-65.
If you’re traveling as part of a group, you may want to save money by
driving. However, don’t forget to budget the cost of parking, which can
run as high as $30 a day in downtown Chicago.
If you plan to drive to Chicago but don’t intend to use your car while in
the city, consider perimeter parking lots. For bargain perimeter parking,
check with the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). For only $1.50, CTA’s
Park and Ride lots, located near many train-line terminals, allow visitors
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
48

to stow their cars for up to 24 hours. For long-term parking, CTA’s
Cumberland lot, ten minutes east of O’Hare, costs $11 for 24 hours. 
(Call % 888-968-7282 for locations and restrictions.)
Also consider parking in a lot within walking distance of the Loop.
Millennium Park has four lots. Rates vary, but expect to pay from $10 
to $20 for 1 to 24 hours. For the Grant Park North lot, enter on Michigan
Avenue at Madison or Randolph streets. For the Millennium Park lot,
enter on Columbus Drive at Monroe or Randolph avenues. For the East
Monroe Street lot, enter on Columbus Drive at Monroe or Randolph
avenues. And for the Grant Park South lot, enter on Michigan Avenue at
Van Buren Street.
Traffic on Chicago expressways can be brutal. Avoid arriving or depart-
ing during the heart of morning and evening rush hours (about 6:45–
9:30 a.m. and 3:45–6:30 p.m.). All the major arteries, including the Dan
Ryan (I-90 and I-94), Edens (I-94), Eisenhower (I-290), Kennedy (I-90), and
Stevenson (I-55) expressways, can gridlock. Don’t be lured into rush-
hour driving by the prospect of reverse commuting (coming into town in
the afternoon and leaving in the morning): It’s a myth. Once upon a time,
traffic may have been lighter outbound in the morning and inbound in
the evening — but today, that has been negated by the large number of
people who live in Chicago and commute to jobs in the suburbs.
Arriving by Other Means
Thanks to Amtrak, about 50 intercity trains with classic names like The
California Zephyr still pull into and out of Union Station (at Adams and
Canal streets, just west of the Loop across the Chicago River) on a daily
basis. You can get to or leave town on trains such as the Lakeshore
Limited, the Capitol Limited, the Empire Builder, and the Southwest Chief.
For example, the City of New Orleans leaves each evening for an overnight
trip to the Big Easy via Memphis. It’s about eight hours by train from, say,
Pittsburgh to Chicago; about 15 hours to New Orleans and it’ll take you
two days (and nights) to get to or from Los Angeles.
For specific fares, schedules, and reservations (which vary according 
to season, along with all kinds of discounts and vacation packages),
check with a travel agent or contact Amtrak (% 800-872-7245;
www.amtrak.com).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect. You
know your costs upfront and, in the case of the tame ones, you don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
Chapter 5: Getting to Chicago 49

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I recommend purchasing travel
insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay upfront. But
don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! Get travel insurance
through an independent agency. (I tell you more about the ins and outs
of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the tour
operator cancels?
 How packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit 25
hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax at
the hotel or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not return-
ing to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind, cer-
tain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. The tour opera-
tor may be evasive about this, because it may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but it
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and the tour operator may cancel the tour if it doesn’t
book enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how
close the tour operator is to reaching it. Again, a tour operator’s
answers may be evasive, but the information may help you select a
tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
For listings of various packages (including some that have specific
themes, like architecture, cruising the lake, and which cover more of 
the Midwest along with Chicago), I recommend Online Agency Deals
(www.oladeals.com). At the company’s Web site, you can search out
deals and information on tours and vacation packages from over 3,500
travel companies — just select Chicago as your destination.
If you’re a structure-loving traveler, your local travel agent can help you
hook up with a guided tour of Chicago. You may want to check City
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
50

Escapes (www.cityescapes.com), tours that are booked exclusively
through travel agencies.
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, and
tour operators resell the tours to the public. It’s kind of like buying your
vacation at a buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one
who buys the 1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a
time at a cost that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of
the biggest packagers in the Northeast and usually boasts a full-page ad
in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Continental
Airlines Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), Delta
Vacations (% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Southwest
Airlines Vacations (% 800-243-8372; www.swavacations.com), and
United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com).
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz,
Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If
you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the
Better Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go
online to www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based,
don’t fly with that company.
Package prices vary based on availability, dates, and hotel properties.
For example, at press time, American Airlines Vacations offered a high-
season rate that included round-trip airfare from Las Vegas and five
nights at the upscale Fairmont Hotel for $1,250 per person. A sample
package from United Vacations during low season included round-trip
Chapter 5: Getting to Chicago 51

airfare from New York and three nights at Hotel Allegro, for $650 per
person. From Los Angeles in high season, Delta Vacations offered airfare
to O’Hare and seven nights at various Chicago-area hotels starting from
$1,200 per person. Continental Airlines Vacations offered a package from
Miami to Chicago in June, with six nights at a suburban hotel, for $1,250
per person.
The Chicago Office of Tourism (% 877-244-2246; www.877chicago.
com) offers online travel packages to entice visitors into the city. So-
called Immersion Weekends have included such packages as “Paint the
Town Blues,” with two nights at the House of Blues Hotel, blues con-
certs, some drinks, and one dinner. Prices are between $350 and $500
per person. Other packages bundle hotel stays with tickets to hot musi-
cals or art exhibits.

Catering to Special Travel
Needs and Interests
In This Chapter
 Making the most of your family vacation
 Traveling as a senior
 Finding the best places for travelers with disabilities
 Locating resources for gay and lesbian travelers
C
hicago offers something for everyone, whatever the interest, need,
or inclination. This chapter points you toward both national and
Chicago-only resources for families, seniors, disabled visitors, and gay
and lesbian travelers.
If you have mobility issues, whether you’re traveling with kids, a senior,
or are in a wheelchair, you’ll find that maneuvering around Chicago is
pretty manageable. Chicago isn’t as congested as New York or as sprawl-
ing as Los Angeles. And thanks to a slightly slower pace, Chicago’s
hustle and bustle isn’t so frantic that you have to be on constant alert
lest the crowds run over you.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have trouble getting your kids out of the house in the morning,
heading hundreds or thousands of miles away may seem like an insur-
mountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding,
giving you new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
Several resources offer tips to help you travel with kids:
 How to Take Great Trips with Your Kids, by Sanford Portnoy, is
full of good general advice that can apply to travel anywhere.
 Family Travel Times (% 888-822-4FTT; www.familytravel
times.com) is an excellent online newsletter updated twice
monthly. Subscriptions are $39 a year, $49 for two years. Sample
articles are available on the newsletter’s Web site.

 Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com) is a com-
prehensive site that offers customized trip planning.
 Family Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com) is an
award-winning Web site that offers travel features, deals, and tips.
 Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com) offers an
online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and
tour operators for families.
Preparing for your vacation
One of the best ways to get kids excited about an upcoming trip is to
involve them in the planning. Start by sharing this book with your kids —
go through the attractions listed in Chapters 11 and 13. Next, have your
kids list the places they want to visit. Older kids can check out attractions
online. Finally, work with your kids to create an itinerary that appeals to
the whole family. You may want to rent a movie filmed in Chicago, such as
Ferris Bueller’s Day Off or The Blues Brothers. In either, you’ll see shots of
Chicago — the canyons of the Loop, the bridges spanning the Chicago
River, all of it scenery the kids will recognize when they arrive.
Before you leave, try to adjust to a new time zone if necessary. Put kids
to bed half an hour later each night for a couple of nights if Chicago is
west, and you’ll gain time. Or, if you’re traveling east, put them to bed
half an hour earlier.
Go over safety issues with your children. Make sure to create a plan so
children know what to do if they get lost. Put your child’s name and
some kind of identification inside a jacket.
Traveling to Chicago — and 
arriving happy and healthy
Want your whole family to arrive in Chicago in a good mood? Follow the
steps in this section to improve your plane or car trip.
On the plane
How do you avoid becoming the person everyone hopes won’t sit next
to him on a plane? Follow these tips for flying with little ones:
 Call ahead to order kids’ meals and confirm seating arrange-
ments. Some airlines offer bassinets for babies traveling in the
bulkhead row — parents may prefer the bulkhead row, with the
extra room for changing and letting toddlers sit on the floor. Other
parents prefer regular seating for the extra under-chair baggage
storage.
 When you’re packing, try not to overpack, but definitely do not
underpack on necessities. If you know the number of diapers your
child wears, add three in case of emergency. Bring a changing pad
in case the tiny restroom has no pullout changing table.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
54

On the other hand, one coloring book — not five — is sufficient.
Two toy cars — not the entire collection of 30 — is all you’ll want
to carry. Pick one stuffed animal and one blanket. Remember:
You’re not relocating your entire nursery.
 Use a stroller in the airport for non-walking or barely-walking
children, and check it at the gate. The stroller will be waiting for
you on the gangway when you deplane.
In the car
Traveling by car presents a different set of challenges: those long
stretches of open road with the kids asking “Are we there yet?” for the
10,000th time. Here are tips for keeping kids entertained — and adults
sane — on the Great American Road Trip:
 Pack a cooler with drinks, snacks, fruits, and veggies.
 Stop every few hours for air, bathroom breaks, and diaper changes.
 Try to stick to a regular feeding and sleeping schedule for babies.
 Look at your map for interesting things to visit on the way.
 Prepare to stretch your arm time and time again to reach all the
toys and bottles that have fallen out of your children’s hands for
the tenth time in the last five minutes. A flashlight can help locate
those items that roll under the seat.
 Use window shades to block the sun.
 Bring audiotapes of stories or children’s songs. If your car doesn’t
have one, you may want to bring a portable DVD player so the kids
can watch movies. Because a kids’ video lasts 30 minutes to an
hour, it’s a great help for long stretches with nothing to do.
 Carry a first-aid kit, a box of wipes for cleanups, a roll of paper
towels, extra blankets, plastic bags for motion sickness, a change of
clothes, and a cellphone in case of road emergencies.
Choosing sleeps and eats
Your choice of hotel probably isn’t only a matter of budget. Choosing a
hotel may also depend on the ages of the children who accompany you,
and — face it — how well they generally behave. Nothing is more embar-
rassing to parents, or annoying to other guests, than noisy children run-
ning amok through an upscale hotel. Find out if the hotel has a pool
(many downtown Chicago hotels don’t have one); ask if a video arcade is
nearby. Hotels in River North, for example, are near ESPN Zone, a sports-
themed attraction with dozens of games (see Chapter 11). Some hotels
offer play areas and kids’ programs. Make sure to ask about these serv-
ices when you call for a reservation.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 55

After you check into your hotel, childproof the room. Remove small and
breakable objects from children’s reach and check electric and com-
puter cords. You may also want to plug in a nightlight. Find out from the
concierge where to go if you need medical attention or to buy necessi-
ties, such as diapers, formula, and medicines.
Chicago is home to many kid-friendly restaurants. There are the obvious
choices, such as the Hard Rock Cafe, 63 W. Ontario St. at North State
Street (% 312-943-2252); the Rainforest Cafe, 605 N. Clark St. at Ohio
Street (% 312-787-1501); and ’50s-themed Ed Debevic’s, 640 N. Wells St.
at Ontario Street (% 312-664-1707). Then you have places such as Harry
Caray’s restaurant, with its showcases packed with baseball memora-
bilia. Youngsters also have fun in the wacky New Orleans–style environ-
ment of Heaven on Seven on Michigan Avenue; at the original location
on Wabash Avenue, kids can skip the exotic gumbo and jambalaya and
order a hamburger and chocolate pudding from a luncheon-counter
menu. Also along Michigan Avenue, try foodlife, where pizza, burgers,
and more await kids in the giant food court, or Billy Goat Tavern, the
real-life inspiration for the famous Saturday Night Live skit that features
John Belushi and “Cheeborger, cheeborger, chip, chip. No Coke — Pepsi.”
(See Chapter 10 for more information on these restaurants.)
For more tips on pleasing pint-size tourists, see Chapter 13.
Finding baby-sitting services
If you want to schedule some adults-only R & R, don’t leave finding a
baby sitter to chance. Make prior arrangements — giving you time to
check references — and add to your budget the amount that you’ll need
to cover baby-sitting. Expect to pay around $14 an hour, with a four-hour
minimum. Most agencies require at least 48 hours’ notice. For recom-
mendations, check with the concierge or front desk at your hotel. Many
hotels maintain lists of reputable baby-sitting agencies. One of the agen-
cies that many of the top hotels work with is American Childcare
Service (% 312-644-7300), a state-licensed and insured service that can
match you with a sitter. This agency requires that its caregivers undergo
background checks, furnish multiple references, and are trained in infant
and child CPR.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior when you make your travel reser-
vations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West have
canceled their senior-discount and coupon-book programs, many hotels
still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, including Chicago, people
over 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation. For
information on discounts on citywide programs, call the Chicago Park
District (% 312-742-7529).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
56

Seniors age 65 and over with a discounted pass get a reduced fare of 
85¢ per ride and 15¢ for transfers on Chicago’s public transportation.
Unfortunately, short-term visitors aren’t able to take advantage of these
discounts, because you must apply for the pass in person and it takes 
at least a week to obtain one. To obtain the pass, head to the Regional
Transit Authority offices, 175 W. Jackson Blvd., 2nd floor (% 888-968-
7282). Bring a driver’s license or passport. Explain that you’re from out
of town so you can receive the pass within a week (otherwise, process-
ing takes three weeks). However, there is a cash-only reduced fare of $1
per ride on the bus and 85¢ for trains, exact change only, and no trans-
fers will be issued. At rail turnstiles, you’ll have to see a rail-station 
customer assistant to take advantage of this fare.
Many of the El (elevated train) stations are difficult to navigate because
of stairs or out-of-order escalators. Call the Chicago Transit Authority
(CTA) (% 312-836-7000) for a list of stations that have elevators. If
mobility is an issue, you may be better off riding the bus.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs for those age 55 and over (and a spouse or companion of any
age) in Chicago and other destinations. Most courses last five to seven
days, and many include airfare, accommodations in university dormito-
ries or modest inns, meals, and tuition.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler, by Alison Gardner; 101 Tips for Mature
Travelers, available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or
617-350-7500; www.gct.com); and Unbelievably Good Deals and Great
Adventures That You Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50, by

Accessing Chicago: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. More options and
resources exist than ever before.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 57

Chicago information and resources
Many Chicago hotels provide special accommodations and services for
visitors in wheelchairs, such as ramps and large bathrooms, as well as
telecommunications devices for visitors with hearing impairments;
inquire when you make your reservation.
Visitors to Chicago find that most attractions are completely accessible.
Public museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago, Adler Planetarium
& Astronomy Museum, and the Field Museum of Natural History
observe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, as does the
Sears Tower Skydeck.
For specific information on facilities for people with disabilities, call or
write the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, 121 N. LaSalle St.,
Room 1104, Chicago, IL 60602 (% 312-744-6673 [voice] or 312-744-4780
[TTY]). The office is staffed from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
Horizons for the Blind, 2 N. Williams St., Crystal Lake, IL 60014 (% 815-
444-8800), is a social-service agency that can provide information about
hotels equipped with Braille signage, as well as attractions that offer
Braille signage and special tours. The Illinois Relay Center enables
hearing- and speech-impaired TTY callers to call individuals or busi-
nesses without TTYs 24 hours a day. Call % 800-526-0844 (TTY) or
800-526-0857 (voice). The city of Chicago operates a 24-hour information
service for hearing-impaired callers with TTY equipment; call 800-526-
0844 (TTY). Or % 312-744-8599 (voice).
Chicago streets and public transit
Pedestrians with disabilities find that downtown Chicago is pretty good
about curb cuts and other basics. Unfortunately, though, the Windy
City’s notoriously unpredictable weather and a challenging public trans-
portation system for those with disabilities (see later), often compel
Chicagoans and visitors to catch a ride. You can call CTA Paratransit
(% 312-432-7025) for a description of special services and taxi access
programs available in the city. The same service also offers door-to-door
lift services to and from O’Hare for travelers with disabilities. One
week’s notice is required, and visitors must be registered with a similar
program in their home city. For information, call % 312-432-7025.
Several CTA El stations on each line have elevators. Call the CTA 
(% 312-836-7000) for a list of accessible stations. All city buses are
equipped to accommodate wheelchairs. For other questions about 
CTA special services, call % 312-432-7025.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Among them are Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-
5005; www.flyingwheelstravel.com); Access-Able Travel Source
(% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com); and Accessible Journeys
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
58

(% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com). Avis
Rent a Car has an Avis Access program that offers such services as a
dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include
MossRehab (www.mossresourcenet.org); the American Foundation
for the Blind (AFB) (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org); and Society for
Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH) (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.
org). AirAmbulanceCard.com is now partnered with SATH and allows
you to preselect top-notch hospitals in case of an emergency. SATH also
provides access information for major airlines and travel tips. Also
check out Open World magazine (published by SATH) and the quarterly
magazine Emerging Horizons (www.emerginghorizons.com).
Despite efforts in recent years to improve its accessibility, Chicago’s
public transportation system lags behind those of other urban centers
in meeting ADA standards. Although the Regional Transit Authority 
(% 847-364-7223; www.pacebus.com), which operates the city’s buses
and trains, and Metra (% 312-322-6777; www.metrarail.com), the com-
muter-rail line to the suburbs, claim to be accessible, a trip can be ardu-
ous and frustrating. Only one in five buses is equipped with a lift, and
fewer than half of all train stations have elevators. Riders with disabili-
ties need to plan public-transit trips carefully. Call the CTA (% 312-836-
7000) for information about accessible bus routes and train stations.
By calling the CTA in advance of their trip, people with disabilities can
receive an application for a pass that allows holders to ride buses and
trains for half-price. Passes take about three weeks to process.
Following the Rainbow: Resources 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Chicago has a large gay and lesbian population, supported by numerous
resources. The Gay & Lesbian Chamber of Commerce (% 312-303-
3167; www.glchamber.org) is an excellent resource for imparting infor-
mation about restaurants, bars, and neighborhoods where the gay and
lesbian communities gather. The Windy City Times and other gay publi-
cations are available at many shops and bars in neighborhoods with
large gay and lesbian populations.
Among Chicago’s gay-friendly neighborhoods are Lakeview, New Town,
and Andersonville. Lakeview’s main thoroughfare is Belmont, between
Broadway and Sheffield. Within Lakeview is a smaller neighborhood
known as New Town (or, colloquially, Boys Town). Andersonville centers
around the half-dozen or so blocks of North Clark Street north of Foster
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs and Interests 59

Avenue and features the feminist bookstore Women and Children First,
5233 N. Clark St. (% 773-769-9299).
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) (% 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry, and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; go to its Web site and click on
Members.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service.
Gay.com Travel (% 800-929-2268 or 415-644-8044; www.gay.com/travel
or www.outandabout.com), is an excellent online successor to the popu-
lar Out & About print magazine. It provides regularly updated informa-
tion about gay-owned, gay-oriented, and gay-friendly lodging, dining,
sightseeing, nightlife, and shopping establishments in every important
destination worldwide.
The following travel guides are available at many bookstores, or you 
can order them online: Spartacus International Gay Guide (www.

Chapter 7
Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Considering whether to rent a car
 Buying travel insurance
 Packing wisely
 Knowing what to expect at airport security
T
he little things mean a lot: from knowing what to bring (or not) in
your carry-on, to determining how you’ll get around when you get
there, to having the right clothing so you’re not constantly freezing or
sweating can be details that make a difference in the comfort and ease of
your trip.
Taking care of a few details before you go can save you time in
Chicago — time otherwise spent waiting in line; trying to get tickets;
calling around town; buying the socks, long underwear, or sweater you
forgot to bring; and dealing with all the other annoyances that plague
the unprepared. This chapter covers everything from buying travel
insurance and packing comfortable walking shoes to preparing for 
airport security.
Renting a Car — Not!
Do you need to rent a car in Chicago? The answer is a qualified “No.” A
car can be a liability. Parking can be expensive, while street parking and
metered parking are scarce. If you drive Chicago’s expressways, you’ll
start to understand why many complain that the road system no longer
handles the increased volume of traffic and will be less equipped to do
so as time passes. Gridlock is becoming more frequent and intense.
That said, traffic-wise, Chicago is not as congested as, for example, New
York or London. Anyone who has sat fuming in Manhattan’s snarled
crosstown traffic or on London’s ancient and narrow streets may find
driving in downtown Chicago a breeze. More often than not, traffic does
move, even in the heart of the Loop or along the Magnificent Mile. Still,

the major arteries in and out of the city are usually jammed during the
misnamed rush hour, which is more like three hours. All of which brings
me to that qualified “No.”
You don’t need a car if you plan to stay downtown and confine your
touring to the outlying neighborhoods. Public transit — bus, El (an
abbreviation of elevated) train, and subway — is fairly comprehensive
and reliable. As long as you stick to busy routes during the day, you
should be safe. (Avoid long rides into unfamiliar areas at night.) Beyond
that, taxis are plentiful and pretty much affordable for short runs. On the
other hand, if you want to explore the outlying suburbs (including driv-
ing along the scenic lakeshore — see Chapter 14), a car is a must.
Daily costs for a midsize car average about $70, or about $200 per week.
For telephone numbers and rental-car companies with offices in Chicago,
see the appendix.
Identifying additional charges
In addition to the daily rental rate, rental-car companies in Chicago
charge 18 percent sales tax and, for rentals at the airport, a $2.75 daily
transaction fee.
You’ll also encounter a few optional charges. The Collision Damage
Waiver (CDW), which covers any damage to the car in the event of a 
collision, is covered by many credit card companies. Check with your
credit card company before you go, so you can avoid paying this hefty
fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your
luggage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your
car-rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the
Hope Diamond (and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk
anyway), you can probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driv-
ing around without liability or personal accident coverage is never a
good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and 
liability claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for
your initial full tank of gas upfront and can return the car with an empty
gas tank. If you reject this option, you pay only for the gas you use, but
you have to return the car with a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a
gallon for any shortfall, though with the price of gas soaring, especially
in the summer, as it has in the last couple of years, what the rental com-
pany charges may not be that much higher than the local gas station. So
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago 
62

consider that when you decide yes or no. In my experience, gas prices in
the refueling packages are at the high end, and I always find myself
trying to drive the car in on fumes so I don’t pay for an extra drop of
fuel. So, I prefer to forego the refueling package and always allow plenty
of time for refueling en route to the car-rental return. However, if you
usually run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re
a perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Getting the best deal
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars:
 Ask if the rate is the same for a morning pickup as it is for a
pickup at night — these rates can vary. Weekend rates may be
lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping the car five or more
days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the daily rate.
 Ask what the rate would be if you picked up the car from a down-
town location rather than at the airport. Rates sometimes are 
considerably lower downtown.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add
on a fee for drivers under 25, while some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, ask for
that specific rate. If you don’t, you may be charged the standard
(higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP,
and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to dis-
counts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Ask to use your frequent-flier account when booking. Not only
are your favorite (or at least most-used) airlines likely to have sent
you discount coupons, but most car rentals add at least 500 miles
to your frequent-flier account.
As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can make
comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can check rates at
most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the major travel sites —
Frommer’s (www.frommers.com), Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and Smarter
Travel (www.smartertravel.com), for example — have search engines
that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just enter the car size you
want, the pickup and return dates, and the location, and the server
returns a price. You can even make the reservation online. Priceline and
Hotwire work well for rental cars, too; the only “mystery” is which major
rental company you get, and for most travelers the difference between
Hertz, Avis, and Budget is negligible.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 63

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. You can get esti-
mates from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your
trip cost and dates, your age, and other information for prices from
more than a dozen companies.
Here is my advice on the three types of travel insurance:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com); Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip doesn’t
make sense for most travelers. Most existing health policies cover
you if you get sick away from home — but check your policy to be
sure.
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. If you plan to check items more valuable than the

WGN: World’s Greatest Newspaper
Tune in to one of Chicago’s most popular radio stations, WGN-720 AM, which is owned
by the Chicago Tribune Company and has a studio in the showcase window of the
Tribune Tower, 435 N. Michigan Ave., just north of the Michigan Avenue Bridge. The
company publishes the daily Chicago Tribune and is especially proud of the station’s
call letters — WGN (short for “World’s Greatest Newspaper”).
The Tribune Shop (% 312-222-3080), on the building’s street level, sells reproductions
of newspapers with famous headlines — “War Ends,” “Bulls Repeat,” and the like.
Ask for a copy of the 1948 newspaper with the bold (and incorrect) headline “Dewey
Defeats Truman.” Democrats especially love this souvenir.

standard liability, see if your valuables are covered by your home-
owner’s policy, or get baggage insurance as part of your compre-
hensive travel-insurance package. Don’t buy insurance at the
airport; it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, when found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com), Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com), or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy when You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, the viruses weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you.)
For domestic trips, most reliable healthcare plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. For information on purchasing additional
medical insurance for your trip, see the previous section.
If you suffer from a chronic illness, consult your doctor before your
departure. Pack prescription medications in your carry-on luggage, and
carry them in their original containers with pharmacy labels, otherwise
they won’t make it through airport security. Visitors from outside the
United States should carry generic names of prescription drugs.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-
3435; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards
by region or country and offers tips on food safety.
If you’re staying in downtown Chicago, the closest hospital will likely be
Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 251 E. Huron St. (% 312-926-2000;
www.nmh.org), off North Michigan Avenue. The number for its physi-
cian-referral service is % 312-926-8400. The emergency department 
(% 312-926-5188) is at 250 E. Erie St. near Fairbanks Court.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

Packing It Up
The classic packing advice is to start your packing by laying out on your
bed everything you think you need — then getting rid of half of it. I hate
this advice because I always wind up needing something I left behind. 
To me, the key is to check out the Weather Channel’s Web site (www.
weather.com) and see the long-range forecast. Then imagine what you
would wear in your city in that weather, and pack it. Leave room in the
suitcase, because you’ll undoubtedly buy things while traveling.
If you want to bring only a small bag, you may not be able to leave space
for purchases. If that’s the case, a good trick is to pack an empty nylon
duffel bag. On the way home, you can stuff it with your souvenirs and
other loot.
Preparing for sun, rain, and wind
Chicago’s famously changeable weather calls for these packing tips:
 Always pack a sweater. Even in summer, you can run into a 
cool evening by the lake or a theater or restaurant where the air-
conditioning reaches polar levels.
 If you’re visiting in the winter, pack warm headgear. You may be
concerned about looking unstylish, but believe me, you’ll appreci-
ate this advice later. Don’t worry about fashion. When tempera-
tures drop in Chicago, no one goes without head covering.
 If you’re comfortable wearing shorts, you’ll want to pack them
for a spring or fall trip, as well as for a summer visit. Some folks
tend to rush the season, and you may see people strolling along the
Mag Mile in shorts during a February mild spell.
 Even in summer, a lightweight jacket is always a good idea. The
Windy City can get breezy at any time of year.
Unless you’re planning a formal night out, you can leave the high heels
and suits at home. Most restaurants, even pricier ones, have become
more casual. For men, a dress shirt, a jacket, and a tie will more than 
suffice for any night out. (In fact, dress pants and a shirt with a sweater
are acceptable almost anywhere.) For women, a long skirt with a nice
sweater or blouse can work as well.
A few of the top restaurants and clubs (the Pump Room at the Omni
Ambassador East Hotel is a notable example) enforce a dress code. If
you plan to visit these spots, you need at least one dressy outfit.
Gift shops carry lots of clothes — from cheesy-logo fare to designer-
label fashions. They also have raincoats, umbrellas, swimwear, and
other weather-related items that you may have forgotten to pack. But 
be aware that you’re likely to pay a premium!
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Chicago

Choosing and packing your suitcase
When choosing your suitcase, think about the kind of traveling you’ll be
doing. A bag with wheels is handy if you’ll be mostly on hard floors but
not on uneven surfaces or stairs. A fold-over garment bag helps keep
dressy clothes wrinkle-free, but a garment bag may be unnecessary on a
casual vacation. Hard-sided luggage protects breakable items better but
weighs more than soft-sided bags.
When packing, start with the biggest, hardest items (usually shoes), and
then fit smaller items in and around them. Pack breakable items between
several layers of clothes, or keep them in your carry-on bag. Put things
that can leak — shampoo, sunscreen, moisturizer — in plastic zipper
bags, and throw in a few extra plastic bags for dirty laundry. Put identifi-
cation tags on the inside and outside of your suitcase.
In your carry-on bag, pack anything breakable or irreplaceable, such as
your return ticket, passport, expensive jewelry, contact lenses or
glasses, and prescription medication. Also consider packing a book or
magazines, a personal stereo with headphones, and a snack in the event
that you don’t like the airline food (or they don’t give you more than a
pack of peanuts or chips). Leave a little space for a sweater or jacket 
in case the airplane gets cold. See “Keeping Up with Airline Security
Measures,” later in this chapter, for information on what you can’t pack
in your carry-on bag.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work else-
where in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major cities, such
as Chicago. But take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on
its Web site before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are partic-
ularly weak in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destination
where you know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does from
InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-
car location, but beware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach
of our Global System for Mobiles (GSM) wireless network, which is
used by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will almost certainly
work in Chicago; it may not work in many of Chicago’s outlying areas.
(To see where GSM phones work in the United States, check out www.
t-mobile.com/coverage/national_popup.asp.) You also may not be
able to send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume nothing — call your
wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case scenario, you
can always rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

Accessing the Internet away from Home
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or a personal
digital assistant (PDA) — gives you the most flexibility. But even if you
don’t have a computer, you can still access your e-mail and even your
office computer from cybercafes.
Finding a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes is difficult. Although
there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these are independent
businesses, after all — three places to start looking are at www.cyber
captive.com and www.cybercafe.com. Likely neighborhoods to find 
a nearby cafe are those populated by college students — for example,
around the DePaul University campus in the Lincoln Park neighborhood
(roughly Halsted Avenue at Belmont Street); in Hyde Park, home to the
University of Chicago; and even the streets just west of Michigan Avenue
at Chicago Avenue that are home to Loyola University and its law school.
In Chicago, try Screenz, 2717 N. Clark St., 1 block south of Diversey Ave.
in Lincoln Park (% 773-348-9300; www.screenz.com), a computing
center where you can check e-mail, burn CDs of your digital photos, and
print out your favorite pictures.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most public libraries across the world
offer Internet access free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel business
centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates (or unless access is
included in your room rate).
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their waiting areas. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping
malls, hotel lobbies, and tourist-information offices around the world,
give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than
cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price mean you should
avoid them whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com). (Microsoft’s Hotmail is
another popular option, but Hotmail has severe spam problems.) Your
home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the Web-based account
automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). It provides a Web-based inter-
face for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from anywhere —
even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an always-
on connection to the Internet. The service offers top-quality security,
but if you’re worried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a
cybercafe computer to access the GoToMyPC system.

More and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as Wi-Fi (wire-
less fidelity) hotspots. Mac owners have their own networking technol-
ogy: Apple AirPort. T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot)
serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee
shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.
wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel 
lobbies. iPass providers (see later in this section) also give you access
to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby setups.
In downtown Chicago, both Starbucks and the sandwich chain Cosí have
numerous locations with Wi-Fi access. In the southern part of the Loop,
the Harold Washington Library Center, 400 S. State St. (% 312-747-
4300), also has wireless access. Wireless hotspots in Lincoln Park
include Panera Bread, 616 W. Diversey Pkwy. (% 773-528-4556), and
Argo Tea, 958 W. Armitage Ave. (% 773-388-1880). To locate other
hotspots that provide free wireless networks in cities around the world,
go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
Most business-class hotels in the United States offer dataports for
laptop modems, and a few thousand hotels in the United States and
Europe now offer free high-speed Internet access. In addition, major ISPs
have local access numbers around the world, allowing you to go online
by placing a local call. The iPass network also has dial-up numbers
around the world. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider, who will
then tell you how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a
list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on Individuals
Buy Now. One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209 or 920-235-
0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, if you don’t have a Wi-Fi equipped computer, bring a
connection kit with the right power source, a spare phone cord, and/or
a spare Ethernet network cable (if you’ll be logging on via dial-up or
cable) — or find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one and a half hours before a domestic
flight and two hours before an international flight.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

nearly obsolete. If you have an E-ticket, you can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer. Online check-in involves logging on to your air-
line’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your board-
ing pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do so! If
you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the same credit card you used
to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your boarding
pass from the kiosk and proceed to the security checkpoint with your
pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag an exit-
row seat, you’ll be able to do so using most airline kiosks. Even the
smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system, but always call your air-
line to make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is
also a good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside
check-in; call before you go. Some airlines are now charging a flat fee of
about $2 a bag for curbside check-in.
Security-checkpoint lines can still make for a long wait. If you have trou-
ble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline
will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal
objects such as big belt buckles. If you have metallic body parts, a note
from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners.
Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security,
except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Currently, the general rule is that sharp things are out, and only
toiletries of 3 fluid ounces or less packed in a resealable plastic bag can
pass through security. You can now take with you on the aircraft any
beverages you purchase in the boarding areas (past security). Travelers
in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal item”
such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all
sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still
considered a personal item. Of course, all regulations are subject to
change at a moment’s notice. Check the TSA Web site (www.tsa.gov/
public/index.jsp) for up-to-the-minute details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can purchase luggage locks that allow screeners to
open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary. Look for
Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and Brookstone
stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com). These locks,
approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage inspectors with a special
code or key. For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.
org. If you use something other than TSA-approved locks, your lock will
be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent needs to hand-search your luggage.

a lay of the land. After you’ve gotten acquainted with our
neighborhoods, you’re ready to get the lowdown on Chicago’s
hotels. I discuss the best options for families, for luxury, for
bargain hunters, and more.
Finally, whether you’re into tried-and-true restaurants or table-
hopping in see-and-be-seen spots, this part includes a good
introduction to Chicago’s restaurants. I describe Chicago’s
best restaurant areas, specialties, and deals, and I offer com-
plete reviews of my favorite places for snacks and meals.

F
inding your way around the Windy City is a breeze. For openers,
whenever you spot Lake Michigan dead ahead — and it’s pretty hard
to miss — you know you’re facing east. In this part of the book, you’ll find
out how to reach the city from the airports, pick up the finer points of
orienting yourself, and get the scoop on Chicago’s neighborhoods.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
Because Chicago is at the hub of the interstate highway system, many
visitors arrive by car. In addition, Amtrak serves Chicago relatively well,
even in this era of diminished train travel. Nonetheless, Chicago’s air-
ports provide most of the city’s visitor activity. Each day, several hun-
dred thousand air travelers fly in and out of Chicago.
In the following sections, I give you the scoop on how to get to your
hotel no matter how you arrive.
Arriving by plane
Chicago has two major airports: O’Hare and Midway. Despite their com-
bined vast capacity, the city has outgrown them both. For years, the cre-
ation of a third airport has been a political football, with plans afoot to
locate an airfield in Chicago’s far-south suburbs, in neighboring Indiana,
and even offshore on a pod in Lake Michigan.
Sometime in the new millennium, Chicago will get a third airport. Until
then, the city must struggle with what it has. Although it can be frustrat-
ing and daunting, O’Hare is fairly user-friendly, thanks to a revitalization
in the last decade. At the same time, Midway has gone from a virtually

abandoned facility to a bustling airport, expanding exponentially to
accommodate the growing number of travelers.
If you fly into O’Hare
Sprawling O’Hare International Airport has the dubious distinction of
being one of the world’s busiest air-travel hubs. Although traffic at
Midway has grown spectacularly over the last decade, O’Hare is by far
the city’s major airport. In fact, it handles more passengers and aircraft
operations than any other airport in the world.
Many visitors grumble that they’re greeted by unprotected luggage
carousels, lines for cabs, grouchy cops, loudspeaker threats to tow ille-
gally parked cars, and bus rides to rental-car lots in the hinterland.
Good things take place at O’Hare, too. A link to Chicago’s subway system
dodges gridlocked traffic, shuttling you downtown in about 45 minutes
for only $2. If you prefer a cab (lines are not always long), an airport
employee who’s in charge of making sure the cab line moves efficiently
will pair strangers willing to share rides and cut costs. And should
weather unexpectedly lock you in, a pedestrian tunnel means that good
food, comfortable accommodations, and an array of services are only a
short walk away at the excellent on-site O’Hare Hilton Hotel.
The trek between terminals can be long, but an elevated people-mover
system, opened in 1993 as part of $2 billion in improvements, whisks
passengers at 35 mph between the terminals and long-term Parking Lot
E. Stations are located at each terminal and at the remote parking lot.

The time-honored tradition 
of being stuck at O’Hare
If you find yourself spending significant time at O’Hare, planned or unexpected, check
out the visitor services. Information booths are available on the lower levels of
Terminals 1, 2, and 3, outside the lower-level customs area, and on the upper level of
Terminal 5. (By the way, there’s no Terminal 4.) The information booths are open daily
from 8:15 a.m. to 8 p.m. Stop by for an airport map, or dial % 773-686-2200 for an exten-
sive menu of airport information.
Travelers with youngsters head for the interactive Kids on the Fly Children’s Museum
in Terminal 2, near the security checkpoint. Hand-on exhibits focus on aviation, travel,
and geography.
Some of the Windy City’s signature food and drink is available at O’Hare. Pizzeria Uno,
Gold Coast Dogs, and Lou Mitchell’s Express (a satellite of Chicago’s best breakfast
spot) are in Terminal 5; Goose Island, the city’s best-known microbrewery, is in
Terminal 3.

If you leave O’Hare for another U.S. destination, you often encounter
long lines that wind up to the ticket counters like a conga line at a wed-
ding reception. Avoid them with curbside check-in, available for most
domestic flights only.
A cab ride downtown from O’Hare costs about $40. The number for
Yellow Cab is % 312-829-4222; for Checker Cab, % 312-243-2537.
Airport buses, operated by Continental Airport Express (% 800-654-
7871 or 312-454-7800; www.airportexpress.com), cost $21 one-way 
and stop at most downtown hotels.
If you’re willing to share your taxi from the airport to downtown, you
can save almost 50 percent on the fare. Join the queue (if there is one) at
the cabstand, and when you reach the head of the line, tell the airport
employee that you want to share a ride. In a limousine, a ride for three
people from O’Hare Airport into downtown runs about $75. Call My
Chauffer Limousine (% 800-762-6888 or 630-920-8888) in advance if this
appeals to you.
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) (% 312-836-7000) subway (called
the El, short for “elevated” train) is the cheapest and often fastest way
downtown, but not necessarily the safest. Avoid the subway late at
night. Rush hours and daylight hours are safe enough. To reach the El,
follow the signs displayed near baggage-claim areas and in arrival halls.
The signs guide you through a series of ped-ways (served by escalators,
elevators, and moving walkways) to the CTA Blue-Line train stop.
Another option for getting into the city is renting a car. Most major car-
rental companies have counters at O’Hare, but their lots are remote. You
can pick up a shuttle bus outside the baggage-claim area to take you to
your rental car.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75
Early to bed, early to rise
Hilton Chicago O’Hare Airport (% 800-445-8667 or 773-686-8000), within the airport,
couldn’t be more convenient for travelers with early flights. The 858 guest rooms are
both well appointed and soundproof, despite being virtually on the runways.
Even if you’re not a guest, you can work out at the 10,000-square-foot health club,
which has a pool, whirlpool, steam room, and sauna. The fee of $11 a day includes
towels, shampoo, conditioner, and hair dryers.
The Hilton is also home to the Gaslight Club, an establishment in the Playboy Club
genre. Andiamo is a full-service restaurant that serves three meals daily and supplies
the Hilton’s “Food on the Fly” program (% 773-601-1733). Hot sandwiches and entrees,
mostly priced under $10, are a great alternative to airline food.

If you fly into Midway
Midway Airport (% 773-838-0600) almost died in the 1980s, but the
addition of flights by ATA and Southwest Airlines revived the facility,
which once looked like a strip mall. Today, the airport has undergone a
major reconstruction. A new terminal including restaurants and baggage
carousels was built to accommodate the increased traffic.
Midway is closer to downtown than O’Hare, and under optimum condi-
tions, the trip from downtown via highways (car, cab, or shuttle bus) can
take less than half an hour. But due to traffic, the journey often takes as
long as the trip from O’Hare.
Cab rides to Midway are about $5 cheaper than to O’Hare from down-
town. Cab sharing from the airport is available, but only if you’re going
downtown. The airport shuttle van to downtown hotels is cheaper, too,
at $16 one-way.
Like O’Hare, most major car-rental companies have counters at Midway,
but their lots are remote. Most parking is in distant lots served by shut-
tles, which you can pick up outside of the baggage-claim area.
The CTA (the El) also serves Midway. The Orange Line trip from Midway
is much shorter than the Blue Line ride from O’Hare. But the walk from
the terminal to the stop at Midway is long (even without luggage). To 
get from the terminal to the El, walk from the terminal toward baggage
claim, but do not take the escalators down to baggage claim. Instead,
continue walking up the ramp toward the parking garage. Along the way
you’ll spot signs marked TRAINS TO CITY. There is one section of moving
sidewalk, but most of the way, you’ll have to hoof it.
Arriving by car
All roads lead to Chicago, or so it seems. From the east, I-80 and I-90
cross the northern sector of Illinois. I-90 splits off and turns into Chicago
via the Skyway and the Dan Ryan Expressway. From there, I-90 runs
through Wisconsin, and beyond as far west as Seattle. If you’re coming
from the south, you can enter Chicago on I-55, which winds its way up
the Mississippi Valley and enters Chicago from the west, along with the
Stevenson Expressway. I-57 originates in southern Illinois and connects
in Chicago on the west leg of the Dan Ryan. From the east, I-94 links
Detroit and Chicago, and leaves the city heading northwest via the
Kennedy Expressway.
Arriving by train
Nearly every transcontinental Amtrak route runs through or to
Chicago’s sprawling Union Station, which is also a hub for Metra com-
muter train service to the south and southwest suburbs. The loading
and unloading area lies below street level near the heart of the Loop.
During the day, you should have no problem hailing a cab curbside. At
night, you may want to call for one from inside the station.
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
76

North on Canal Street from Union Station is Northwestern Station (now
officially called the Ogilvie Transportation Center), the hub of Metra
train service to the north and northwest suburbs.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Remember this easy way to keep yourself oriented in Chicago: The lake
is always to the east. “The lake,” of course, is Lake Michigan, which dis-
appears into the horizon like some huge inland sea. As my friend from
London said while staring trancelike at the lake, “You . . . can’t . . . see . . .
across it.”
The Chicago River forms a Y that divides the city into three sections:
North Side, West Side, and South Side (the east side, of course, is the
lake). The Loop, the business and financial center of the city, is located
just south of the Chicago River. The main shopping district is North
Michigan Avenue, also known as the Magnificent Mile, which stretches
north of the Chicago River, not too far west of the lake. On the West Side
is Bucktown/Wicker Park, the Randolph Street Market District, and many
outlying residential neighborhoods.
As a former part of the Northwest Territories, Chicago is laid out in a
grid system, with point zero located at the intersection of State and
Madison streets, within the Loop. State Street divides east and west
addresses and Madison divides the north and south. Complicating this
straightforward layout are a few diagonal streets and streets that end
unexpectedly, only to take up again a block or two farther along. Here
are some key points to remember:
 The focal point of the city’s numbering system is the intersection
of State and Madison streets, in the heart of the Loop. Madison
Street runs east-west and is the north-south divider. State Street
runs north-south and is the east-west divider.
 The Loop is the heart of downtown. Its approximate boundaries
are the Chicago River to the north, Congress Street to the south,
Halsted Street to the west, and Wabash Avenue to the east.
 Numbered streets always run east-west.
 All north-south streets have names, not numbers.
 The first few streets south of Madison are named for American
presidents in the order of their terms: Madison, Monroe, Adams,
Jackson, Van Buren, Harrison, Polk, and Taylor.
 Streets north of Madison follow a grid system. Division Street, for
example, is an east-west street approximately 12 blocks north of
Madison and is numbered 1200 North. The same system applies to
north-south streets. For example, Halsted Street, approximately 8
blocks west of State Street, is numbered 800 West.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 77

Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, many with large ethnic populations.
Prominent Chicago neighborhoods, from south to north, include
 Chinatown: The city’s Chinese enclave is compact, and the main
thoroughfares are along Cermak Road (also known as 22nd Street)
and Wentworth and Archer avenues. Here you find good restau-
rants, such as Three Happiness, 209 W. Cermak Rd. (% 312-842-
1964), interesting tearooms, and shops.
 The Loop: Chicago’s downtown is named after the elevated train
track that loops around the financial district. The main attractions
include riding the El and visiting the Mercantile Exchange, where
you can watch traders in the pit doing their thing, whatever that is.
(It’s always been beyond me!)
 Near West: Former warehouses have been converted to living and
working space just west of the Kennedy Expressway. The area
includes Greektown and Oprah’s workplace, Harpo Studios, plus a
host of hip restaurants and bars.
 Magnificent Mile: The northern length of Michigan Avenue is
Chicago’s version of Fifth Avenue, Oxford Street, and Rodeo Drive.
The Mag Mile stretches from the Chicago River to the Oak Street
Beach. Anchoring the south end are the distinctive Wrigley Building
and Gothic Tribune Towers; at the north end is The Drake Hotel.
Highlights include the John Hancock Center Observatory,
Millennium Park, Fourth Presbyterian Church, Water Tower Place,
Chicago Place Mall, and Westfield North Bridge Mall.
 Streeterville: Adjoining the Magnificent Mile, Streeterville is a
booming neighborhood of trendy restaurants, bars, and tucked-
away boutiques and galleries. Streeterville is bounded by Michigan
Avenue to the west, Lake Michigan to the east, the Chicago River to
the south, and Oak Street to the north.
 River North: Go gallery hopping and visit the site of some of the
city’s hippest restaurants and clubs. Some 70 galleries are located
in an area dubbed “SuHu” (two of its major east-west streets are
Superior and Huron). The neighborhood is bounded by Chicago
Avenue to the north, the Chicago River to the west and south, and
State Street to the east.

Yes, Virginia, that is a lake
Lake Michigan is 22,300 square miles in size and reaches depths of over 900 feet. The
other Great Lakes are Erie, Superior, Ontario, and Huron. Chicago honors each of the
lakes with a street on the east-west corridor intersecting the Michigan Avenue shop-
ping district. The U.S.-Canada international boundary runs through all the Great Lakes
except Lake Michigan, which lies wholly in U.S. territory.

 Near North: This feast of restaurants, bars, and boutiques just 
west and north of the Magnificent Mile includes the famous rows of
bars on Rush and Division streets. You can find great goings-on for
going out.
 Gold Coast: The bastion of Chicago’s old money, this beautiful
neighborhood has many 19th-century homes and runs along Lake
Shore Drive north of Michigan Avenue.
 Bucktown/Wicker Park: An area thick with artists, in recent years,
it has become somewhat gentrified, with waves of hot new restau-
rants, alternative culture, and loft-dwelling yuppies rolling in. In
fact, Bon Appétit magazine has recognized Wicker Park as the new
mecca for the best neighborhood restaurants in Chicago. The focal
point of the neighborhood is the intersection of Milwaukee and
North avenues.
 Lincoln Park: The young and the restless, families just starting out,
and anyone who can afford the high prices inhabit Chicago’s most
popular neighborhood. On its far eastern edge is the neighbor-
hood’s namesake park containing the nation’s oldest zoo and two
museums. Come to this neighborhood for some of Chicago’s most
popular bars, restaurants, theater companies, and retail shops.
 Wrigleyville: Named after Wrigley Field, the neighborhood sur-
rounding the ballpark is filled with “three flats” and “five flats” —
apartment buildings with three or five floors of apartments — and
sports bars. Many young people just launching their careers in
Chicago choose to live here.
 Andersonville: This formerly Swedish enclave stretches along 3 or 
4 blocks of North Clark Street north of Foster Avenue. On Saturdays,
a bell ringer makes his rounds as storekeepers ceremonially sweep
sidewalks with corn brooms. Highlights include the Swedish-
American Museum, a pair of Scandinavian delis, a Swedish bakery,
and two good Swedish restaurants.
 Hyde Park: Home of the University of Chicago, Hyde Park is an
oasis of liberal thinking and intellectualism, hemmed in on all sides
by some of Chicago’s most crime-ridden neighborhoods. The
Museum of Science and Industry is the main attraction, with
Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago a close second.
For the locations of these neighborhoods, and many others, see the
color map inside the front cover of this book.
Finding Information after You Arrive
The best source of information is the Chicago Convention and Tourism
Bureau (% 877-CHICAGO; www.877chicago.com). The Chicago Office
of Tourism, Chicago Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington St., Chicago, IL
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 79

60602 (% 312-744-2400 or 312-744-2947 [TTY]; http://egov.cityof
chicago.org), will mail you a packet of materials with information 
on upcoming events and attractions. The Illinois Bureau of Tourism
(% 800-2CONNECT or 800-406-6418 [TTY]; www.enjoyillinois.com)
will also send you a packet of information about Chicago and other
Illinois destinations.
When you’re in Chicago, one of the easiest ways to gather information 
is to visit the Chicago Office of Tourism in the Chicago Cultural Center,
78 E. Washington St. (% 877-244-2246 or 312-744-2400). It’s open week-
days from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Printed materials, including the Chicago Visitor’s
Guide, are available free. While you’re at this historic building, take a
free, guided tour and admire the marble, mosaics, and Tiffany stained
glass. You can also enjoy free entertainment, such as movies, music, art
exhibitions, and guest speakers. In summer, tours of Chicago’s diverse
neighborhoods depart from the center.
Another walk-in visitor center operated by the Chicago Office of Tourism
is in the historic Water Tower Pumping Station, 186 E. Pearson St. 
(% 312-744-8783). Open daily from 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., the tourist office
distributes printed materials and is a primary stop for trolley and bus
tours. Hot Tix, where theatergoers can purchase discounted tickets, is
here, too (see Chapter 15).
The Illinois Marketplace at Navy Pier, 600 E. Grand Ave. (% 312-595-
5400), stays open somewhat late to accommodate visitors to Chicago’s
most popular tourist attraction. Hours are Monday through Thursday
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The marketplace has guidebooks and
maps, and sells tickets for Lake Michigan boat rides and dinner cruises
that depart from the pier.
Geared to business travelers, the Chicago Convention and Tourism
Bureau office at McCormick Place on the Lake, 2301 S. Lake Shore Dr.
(% 312-567-8500), has information on Chicago’s major points of inter-
est. It’s open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Getting Around Chicago
When in Chicago, do as Chicagoans do and take the train or the bus.
CTA subway and elevated trains connect most of the city’s key attrac-
tions and provide fast, cheap transportation between downtown and
O’Hare and Midway airports. Although subject to the same gridlock as
cars during rush hours, buses are also ideal for getting around.
For tips on sightseeing by public transportation, see Chapter 11.

By the “El” — Chicago’s subway
The CTA rail system, also referred to as the El (short for “elevated”), has
elevated tracks, surface tracks, and underground tracks — often all on
the same line. The fare is $1.75, and you need a pass because tokens
have been eliminated. All stations sell passes during open hours. There’s
no central station, but the Loop is the center of the system. Stations are
named for the streets where they’re located.
For a couple of useful maps of Chicago’s subway and El lines, see the
Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. All the lines are color-coded. The
Blue Line runs between O’Hare and downtown; the Orange Line runs
between Midway and downtown. Here are the main subway and El lines:
 Blue Line: Runs west-northwest to O’Hare airport
 Brown Line: Zigzags on a north-northwest route
 Green Line: Runs along Wabash and Lake streets and travels 
west-south
 Orange Line: Runs southwest and serves Midway Airport
 Purple Line: Provides express service north-south to and from
Evanston
 Red Line: Runs along State Street and heads on a north-south route
Most trains run daily every 5 to 25 minutes through late evening. The
Red and Blue lines run 24 hours. For information, call the CTA at % 312-
836-7000 or go to www.yourcta.com.
By bus
CTA buses are a convenient, cheap way to explore downtown and many
of its ethnic neighborhoods. Buses stop about every 2 blocks — look for
blue CTA bus-stop signs that list bus numbers and routes. On most

Traveling to the ’burbs on Metra
Metra operates commuter trains on 12 lines between the suburbs and several down-
town terminals. The system is separate from the CTA, with its own fares. Service is
frequent during rush hours, and lines run every one to three hours otherwise. Most
routes run daily. On some lines, Metra offers heavily discounted weekend passes to
encourage leisure travelers to use the system. Trains leave for the suburbs from Union
Station (where Amtrak is also based) and Northwestern Station (also known as the
Ogilvie Transportation Center) in the Loop. If you’re taking a Metra train, make sure to
ask from which station your train leaves. For information, contact Metra Passenger
Services (% 312-322-6777; www.metrarail.com) during regular business hours
or RTA travel information (% 312-836-7000) after-hours.

routes, buses run every day, every 10 to 20 minutes through late
evening. For exact times, call the CTA at % 312-836-7000.
Chicago buses and trains accept dollar bills but do not give change. A
ride costs $2; a 25¢ transfer is good for two additional rides on any route
within a two-hour period. Feed bills into a machine next to the driver,
drop coins into a fare box, or insert transfer cards and transit passes into
another machine alongside the driver. The fare for children ages 8 to 11
and seniors is 85¢, plus 15¢ for a transfer. Children 7 and under ride free.
CTA visitor passes are a convenient budget-stretching idea. For $5, a
one-day pass offers unlimited rides on CTA buses and trains for 24 hours
from the first time you use it. You can also buy passes good for two,
three, and five days ($18). Passes are sold at visitor centers, Hot Tix
booths, select museums, both airports, Union Station, and other loca-
tions. Although the passes save you the trouble of feeding the fare
machines, remember that they’re economical only if you plan to make at
least three distinct trips at least two or more hours apart. For advance
sales, call % 888-968-7282 or go to www.yourcta.com.
Be sure to equip yourself with one of the excellent free route maps avail-
able at all CTA stations. The maps pinpoint major attractions and hotels
in relation to bus and train routes. If you’re unsure which bus or train
runs to your destination, call the CTA information line (% 312-836-
7000). Tell the attendant your point of origin and destination, and he’ll
give you a route. The line is staffed daily from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m.

Sky train: Chicago’s El
Watch any Hollywood movie or TV series set in Chicago, and chances are they’ll fea-
ture at least one scene set against our screeching elevated train system, more com-
monly known as the El (witness The Fugitive, ER, and others). The trains symbolize
Chicago’s gritty, “city-that-works” attitude, but they actually began as a cutting-edge
technology.
After the Great Fire of 1871, Chicago made a remarkable recovery; within 20 years, the
downtown district was swarming with people, streetcars, and horses (but no stop-
lights). To help relieve congestion, the city took to the sky, building a system of ele-
vated trains 15 feet above all the madness. The first El trains were steam-powered,
but by the end of the century, all the lines — run by separate companies — used elec-
tricity. In 1895, the three El companies collaborated to build a set of tracks into and
around the central business district that all the lines would then share. By 1897, the
“Loop” was up and running.
Chicago’s El wasn’t the nation’s first. New York City started running its elevated trains
in 1867. But the New York El has almost disappeared, moving underground and turn-
ing into a subway early last century. With 289 miles of track, Chicago has the biggest
El in the country and the second-largest public transportation system.

CTA buses (routes 1–204) run in the city and nearby suburbs. Pace
buses (% 847-364-7223; www.pacebus.com) run throughout the sub-
urbs; connect with the CTA; and accept CTA transfer cards, transit cards,
and passes.
By taxi
In areas with plenty of pedestrian traffic, such as the Loop, North
Michigan Avenue, and River North, taxis are easy to hail. If you can’t find
one, head for the nearest major hotel; if the doorman finds one for you, a
$1 or $2 tip is in order.
Outside downtown and late at night, cabs are fewer and harder to flag
down. To call ahead for a ride, try Yellow Cab (% 312-820-4222) or
Checker Cab (% 312-243-2537).
Taxi fares are $2.25 for meter start-up, plus $1.80 for each additional
mile, and $1 per additional passenger ages 12 to 65.
By car
You don’t need a car to explore Chicago. In fact, you’re likely better with-
out one. Parking is expensive, street parking is tough to find, and the
volume of traffic is at its limit. Public transit is pretty far-reaching. And
even better news: Your own two feet are the best way to get up close
and check out Chicago from street level.
On foot
You can cover plenty of ground on foot while avoiding gridlock and
crowded subway trains. Chicago is a great walking city, with several
attractions within relatively short distances, wide sidewalks, and tempt-
ing window-shopping — depending on your willpower, maybe that last
one’s not so good.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 83
Taking the free trolley
Want to take a ride on the giant Ferris wheel at Navy Pier and then perhaps head to
River North to grab a burger at Rock-N-Roll McDonald’s? Forget about parking and
take the free trolley shuttle that operates along the Illinois Street–Grand Avenue cor-
ridor between Navy Pier and State Street. The trolley runs every 10 to 20 minutes from
10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, year-round, making about a dozen stops along the way. The
service was started to relieve traffic congestion at Navy Pier.
During the summer, the city also operates free trolleys daily between Michigan Avenue
and the Museum Campus (site of the Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum of Natural
History, and the Shedd Aquarium); the trolleys run on weekends in the fall and spring.

Some of my favorite walks are right in the heart of downtown. The
Magnificent Mile, for example, is a window-shopper’s delight that also
offers some architectural gems. On the lakefront, you can stroll past a
long string of high-rise apartment buildings on one side and a sandy
beach on the other. Just north of downtown, you can walk through the
excellent, free Lincoln Park Zoo.
Chicago is as safe as most major cities. Always use common sense. If
you don’t feel safe, you probably aren’t — get into a taxi immediately.
Generally safe areas include North Michigan Avenue (and the intersect-
ing streets), Streeterville, River North, Rush Street, Gold Coast, and
Lincoln Park. During the day, the Loop is crowded with businesspeople
and safe. At night, most of the Loop tends to empty out with the excep-
tion of the North Loop Theater District, where plenty of people and cabs
still congregate.

How to get to McCormick Place
Conference Center
BY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
Although many trade shows at McCormick Place, at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive
(% 312-791-7000; www.mccormickplace.com), arrange transportation from hotels
downtown and along North Michigan Avenue, you can also get there from Michigan
Avenue by taking the no. 3 King Drive bus, which deposits passengers at the foot of
McCormick Place’s South Building, at 23rd Street and Martin Luther King, Jr., Drive.
The no. 3 runs from early morning to about 11 p.m.
You can also take a Metra Electric commuter train to McCormick Place North. Catch
the train in the Loop at the Randolph Street Station at Randolph Street and Michigan
Avenue. For more info, call the RTA/CTA Travel Information hot line at % 312-836-7000.
BY CAR
From the Loop and North Michigan Avenue: Take Lake Shore Drive South and follow
the signs to McCormick Place.
From O’Hare Airport: Take the Northwest Tollway (I-90) to the Kennedy/Dan Ryan
Expressway (I-94) to the Stevenson Expressway North (I-55). Take the Stevenson
Expressway north to Lake Shore Drive, and follow the signs to McCormick Place.
From Midway Airport: Take the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) north to Lake Shore Drive
South. Follow the signs to McCormick Place.

Checking In at Chicago’s
Best Hotels
In This Chapter
 Selecting the hotel or bed-and-breakfast that’s right for you
 Choosing the right neighborhood
 Scoping out the best hotels in the city
 Knowing your options if you can’t get your main pick
 Indexing hotels by location and price
You may be the kind of traveler who thinks a hotel room is simply a
place to sleep and stow your luggage. In that case, you don’t need
two pools, a half-dozen restaurants and lounges, a grand ballroom, and a
health club. Nor do you need to shell out for those nonessential extras.
On the other hand, if you enjoy taking full advantage of a hotel’s 
amenities — afternoon tea with harp music, a day at the spa, arcades
packed with shops — you can find hotels with those, too. But you usu-
ally pay extra for the privilege. You can enjoy the best of both worlds by
staying at a no-frills property and visiting other hotels to enjoy tea and
jazz, and to relax with a cocktail by the fountain in a fancy lobby bar
with a piano. In Chicago, you can find rooms at both ends of the price
and comfort spectrum, and a great many in between.
Because you need a place in Chicago to hang your hat and rest your
head, the most important part of planning a trip is nailing down where
you’re going to stay. Four crucial factors come into play: price, location,
roominess, and amenities.
Getting to Know Your Options
When it comes to accommodations, Chicago does have something for
everyone in terms of style, size, price, and location. You can suit both
your personality and your pocketbook.
If you want luxury, you can find it at properties such as the Four Seasons,
the Ritz-Carlton, or The Peninsula. Boutique-style luxury hotels made

their mark in Chicago with the splashy 2006 opening of The James
Chicago. If you’re interested in combining history and upscale accommo-
dations, look no further than The Drake Hotel and the venerable
InterContinental Chicago.
If you’re comfortable with chains — or have a favorite — you can find
the Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton, Radisson, Embassy Suites, Doubletree
Guest Suites, and others. Even Red Roof Inn and Comfort Inn have
classy hotels (by those chains’ no-frills standards) close to the heart of
the Magnificent Mile. If you prefer a suite and want to pay a little less for
the space, travel less than 5 miles north to the City Suites Hotel. The
Hampton Inn chain made an interesting move by creating a boutique
hotel atop the LaSalle Bank Theatre — if a Loop location is what you’re
seeking, you can check out the Hampton Majestic.
Music lovers can immerse themselves in the funky atmosphere at the
House of Blues Hotel in Marina City, or the Hard Rock Hotel, just south
of the Chicago River off of Michigan Avenue, a rehab of the famous
Carbon and Carbide skyscraper.
For European-style digs, look into accommodations at small boutique
hotels, such as the Whitehall and Tremont. Or try the Hotel Allegro
and Hotel Burnham, stylish hostelries converted from historic buildings
in Chicago’s revitalized Loop.
Bed-and-breakfasts
Chicago may not seem like a bed-and-breakfast (B&B) kind of town.
Nonetheless, B&Bs are a viable option for visitors. Many locals share
their homes, offering B&B accommodations in the European style.
You’ll also find a wide range of unhosted B&B accommodations. These
consist of a suite or an apartment that you have all to yourself — a home
away from home. Sometimes the host is there to greet you and then
leaves you with a set of keys and breakfast items in the fridge.
One of the best ways to locate either kind of B&B accommodations is
through a reservation service, such as At Home Inn Chicago, Inc. 
(% 800-375-7084 or 312-640-1050; www.athomeinnchicago.com). This
service represents about 50 establishments, all within the city, from the
South Loop to the Lakeview neighborhood (with a few farther north).
These are a mix of hosted guest rooms in houses and apartments and
unhosted accommodations in self-contained apartments. For example,
$275 a night gets you a three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bathroom condo
in a Lincoln Park Victorian home. For about $185 a night, you can
unpack in a one-bedroom apartment in the Loop.
Stand-alone inns are also a nice option. Windy City Urban Inn (% 773-
248-7091; www.windycityinn.com) is a Victorian-era B&B in the Lincoln
Park area with five rooms in the main house plus three apartments in a
carriage house. The Wheeler Mansion (% 312-945-2020; www.wheeler
mansion.com) an exquisitely restored 1870s Second Empire–style B&B,
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
86

is just two blocks from McCormick Place and a convenient option for
those traveling on business.
Lodgings for families with kids
Families won’t want to pick the kind of hotel where parents find them-
selves cringing at every sound a child makes. When you have kids in
tow, big and bustling can be better. You may want to avoid small bou-
tique hotels, where a certain “hush” pervades the atmosphere, and go
for the hustle and bustle of a 2,000-room behemoth such as the Hyatt
Regency, where the noise of kids blends right in. If you opt for an all-
suites hotel, you’ll have an extra room with a separate TV. That may help
adults and youngsters better coexist in the relative confinement of a
hotel. All-suites hotels typically have kitchens with refrigerators and
microwaves (for economizing with a dine-in meal) and a dining area.
Location can also be an important consideration for families traveling
with children. Pick a property in River North and you’re just steps away
from such kid-pleasers as Rock-N-Roll McDonald’s (Chapter 10), the Hard
Rock Cafe, 63 W. Ontario St. at North State Street (% 312-943-2252), and
the Rainforest Cafe, 605 N. Clark St. at Ohio Street (% 312-787-1501).
Hotels for travelers with disabilities
Finding wheelchair-accessible accommodations in Chicago can be some-
thing of a challenge. Many of the city’s storied hotels are old and not
designed for guests with disabilities. Many older hotels (such as the
InterContinental Chicago) have been renovated to include a small
number of wheelchair-accessible guest rooms. The problem is that the
tiered floors and sweeping staircases that made these hostelries famous
aren’t tailored to meet the needs of patrons with mobility impairments.
The best bets for travelers with disabilities are the newer hotels, such as
the Courtyard by Marriott. Unfortunately, accessibility and low cost are
not typically found together. Most inexpensive digs don’t offer wheel-
chair-accessible rooms at all. Remember to be explicit about your needs
when you make your reservation.
Location, location, location
Chicago’s core is relatively compact. If shopping along North Michigan
Avenue is the primary objective of your visit, you want to stay at a hotel
along or near the Magnificent Mile. If you don’t mind a short commute,
you can stay in the North Loop and walk or take the 151 bus north along
Michigan Avenue. Likewise, if you have business in the financial district
along South LaSalle Street, a hotel in the Gold Coast won’t put you too
far away. Public transportation is plentiful, and cab rides around down-
town are relatively swift. Streets don’t gridlock as often or as intensely
as they do in, say, New York. However, beware of the bridges: In the
summer, traffic can be held up for ten minutes as bridges are raised to
allow private yachts egress along the Chicago River.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Chicago’s Best Hotels 87

Finding convenient lodgings in the neighborhood where you spend the
bulk of your time is most helpful. Having a couple of first-rate restau-
rants nearby, or a museum or gallery or two, makes sense. To make 
this easy, I recommend hotels and list the neighborhood where each is
located in the following sections; check these against the maps to see
where the hotel is in relation to the attractions you want to see.
My hotel listings concentrate on the Magnificent Mile, the Gold Coast,
the Loop, and Streeterville. Other neighborhoods you may want to look
at include
 Near North: Away from the mainstream but near interesting neigh-
borhoods and Lincoln Park
 River East: Fairly close to the Loop and the Magnificent Mile, but
with a tendency to empty out after dark
 River North: An immensely popular tourist area, with the inevitable
sprinkling of tourist traps, but it also has some lower-priced hotels
The Magnificent Mile
If your mission is shopping, shops aplenty stretch along North Michigan
Avenue from the Michigan Avenue Bridge across the Chicago River and
north to Oak Street. This retail bounty includes four high-rise malls,
upscale shops along Oak Street just west of Michigan Avenue, and bar-
gain stores. (See Chapter 12 for shopping.) You can also find many of
Chicago’s priciest hotels, along with a bargain or two.
In a nutshell:
 Chicago’s premier shopping is right here.
 Many major bus routes include North Michigan Avenue.
 Convenient access to the numerous boat trips and bus tours that
begin at the Michigan Avenue Bridge are available.
But . . .
 You can often find yourself in jostling crowds.
 Traffic can get snarled during evening rush hour.
 Michigan Avenue can be noisy, with horns, sirens, and crews of
street musicians banging on garbage cans.
The Gold Coast
This high-rent district is north of the Magnificent Mile. You can find
yourself within an easy walk of the lakefront and not far from prime
shopping. Hotels are near the nightlife of Rush and Division streets.
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
88

In a nutshell:
 The Gold Coast has easy access to Oak Street Beach, lakefront
walking, and biking.
 The location is ideal for sampling nightlife.
 Leafy streets and handsome brownstones adorn the residential sec-
tions of the district.
But . . .
 Out-of-towners in search of action pack the area around Rush and
Division streets.
 Noisy bars and clubs can be a turnoff.
 Many high-end restaurants have long waits, even with reservations.
The Loop
The traditional heart of Chicago, its downtown, is home to one of
Chicago’s most famous thoroughfares — “State Street, that great street.”
With the opening of Millennium Park, Chicago has made a commitment
to the Loop, and the downtown core is rebounding. New hotels are open-
ing, shops are returning, and a revitalized theater district is drawing
evening crowds. Loop hotels, in fierce competition with those north of
the river, offer some attractive rates and package deals.
In a nutshell:
 This area has a good mix of theaters, shops, and hotels, and excel-
lent proximity to Millennium Park.
 The Loop offers an unbeatable location for doing business in the
LaSalle Street corridor.
 The location offers easy access to the Art Institute of Chicago,
Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, State Street,
and the best of the city’s public art.
But . . .
 The Loop is still relatively empty after dark — although the scene is
no longer comatose as it once was.
 Despite improvements, State Street still looks a bit dowdy in parts.
 You can expect to be solicited by panhandlers.
Streeterville
A handy location combined with an influx of residents into converted
loft spaces and high-rises makes Streeterville a great place to stay.
Streeterville contains many good restaurants and faces Lake Michigan.
Despite its proximity to high-end real estate, Streeterville offers a
number of modestly priced hotel options.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Chicago’s Best Hotels 89

In a nutshell:
 Streeterville offers an incredibly diverse selection of restaurants to
fit a wide range of budgets.
 The enormously popular Navy Pier is near.
 It’s adjacent to the prime shopping of the Magnificent Mile.
But . . .
 Many of the streets are narrow and easily blocked.
 Navy Pier can be a zoo, with boisterous crowds and difficult park-
ing that spill into the east side of the neighborhood.
 Although the neighborhood has become gentrified, a few sleazy
pockets remain in its southeast corner.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Travelers accustomed to spending big bucks for a hotel room the size 
of a closet are in for a surprise in Chicago. Certainly, the city has glitzy
upscale hotels that start at $400 a night. But enough variety exists to sat-
isfy just about every taste and pocketbook. How do you get the most
hotel for your money? This chapter lets you in on the city’s best secrets.
Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum amount that a hotel charges for a room.
The desk clerk will quote the rack rate if you walk in off the street and
ask for a room for the night. You sometimes see the rate printed on the
fire/emergency exit diagrams posted on the back of hotel-room doors.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you don’t have to pay
it! Hardly anybody does. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack
rate is simple: Just ask for a cheaper rate. You may be pleasantly sur-
prised. For my tips on beating the rack rate, see the next section.
Price depends on many factors, not the least of which is how you make
your reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better deal
with certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the
hotel gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering business
toward that hotel.) Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free
number, or the city’s (% 877-244-2246), may result in a lower rate than
if you call the hotel directly. On the other hand, the central reservations
number may not know about discounts at specific locations. For exam-
ple, local franchises may offer a special group rate for a wedding or
family reunion but may neglect to tell the central booking line. Your best
bet is to call both the local number and the central number and see
which one gives you a better deal.
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
90

If you’re smart, you never have to pay the rack rate. Consider the follow-
ing when you’re searching for a good deal:
 All-in-one/inclusive packages: Packages can include lodging,
meals, transportation, sightseeing, or some combination of these. If
you were planning to do these things anyway, a package may save
you money. Beyond the practical, you may find some fun bonuses,
such as shopping vouchers, champagne brunches, and carriage
rides. (See Chapter 5 for more on package tours.)
 Family rates: Deals for families vary from hotel to hotel and from
weekday to weekend. Ask what’s available, and be sure to find out
exactly how many kids at what age can stay free.
 Weekend rates or packages: Some business hotels offer discounts
to keep volume up during the weekend. Hotels in the heart of the
Loop’s business district will most likely offer these promotions.
 Off-season specials: Consider visiting during the heart of winter or
the tail end of autumn. See the sidebar “When is the off season?”
for more on these deals.
 Holiday rates: If you travel during a holiday, ask if the hotel offers a
special rate.
 Corporate discounts: Many hotels, especially branches of the large
chains, offer corporate rates. Find out whether these rates apply 
to you.
 Senior and AARP rates: If you’re 65 or over (or a member of AARP;
you have to be 50 to join AARP) you may be eligible for a senior 
discount.
 Online specials: See “Surfing the Web for hotel deals,” later in this
chapter, for details on finding the best price on the Web.
For more ways to cut lodging costs, see Chapter 4.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Chicago’s Best Hotels 91
When is the off season?
Chicago is becoming a year-round, seven-days-a-week destination. Still, you can 
usually find a few good buys from January through March — providing a mega-
convention is not swallowing up huge numbers of hotel rooms. In the winter, the
Chicago Office of Tourism Web site (www.877chicago.com) features hotel spe-
cials, some as low as $69 per night with some blackout dates and minimum-night stays.
Most of the more centrally located hotels (but not those in the highest price bracket)
may be priced from $99 to $139 per night before taxes. Late fall, when the weather can
be mild and pleasant, is also a time to snare lower room rates, particularly on week-
ends when the business travelers have left.

Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Although the major travel booking sites (Frommer’s, Travelocity,
Expedia, and Orbitz; see Chapter 5 for details) offer hotel booking, you
may be better off using a site devoted primarily to lodging. You can often
find properties not listed with more general online travel agencies. A few
of the sites worth checking are
 All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com): Although the name
is something of a misnomer, the site does have tens of thousands of
listings throughout the world, including Chicago. Bear in mind that
each hotel has paid a small fee ($25 and up) to be included, so the
list isn’t objective and is more like a book of online brochures.
 hoteldiscount!com (www.hoteldiscounts.com): This site lists
bargain room rates at hotels in more than 50 U.S. and international
cities, including Chicago. Because these folks prebook blocks of
rooms, you can sometimes reserve rooms at hotels that are other-
wise sold out. Select a city and input your dates, and you get a list
of the best prices for a selection of hotels. The toll-free number 
(% 800-364-0801) is given on the Web site. Call if you want more
options than those hotels that are listed online.
 InnSite (www.innsite.com): InnSite has B&B listings in all 50 U.S.
states. Find an inn at your destination, see pictures of the rooms,
and check prices and availability. This extensive directory of B&Bs
includes listings only if proprietors submit them; inns don’t pay to
get listed. The innkeepers write their own descriptions, and many
listings link to the inns’ own Web sites.
 TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com): Listing more than 26,000 hotels
in 170 countries, TravelWeb focuses mostly on chains (both upper
and lower end), and you can book almost 90 percent of these online.
TravelWeb’s Click-It Weekends, updated each Monday, offers week-
end deals at many leading hotel chains.
Reserving the best room
Somebody has to get the best room in the house, and that somebody
may as well be you! Here are a few tips for landing a room you’ll love:
 Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
close to the elevator. Corner rooms often have more windows and
light than standard rooms, and they don’t always cost more.
 Ask if the hotel is renovating. If it is, request a room away from the
renovation work.
 Pick your smoking preference. Most hotels offer nonsmoking
rooms; if smoke bothers you, by all means ask for one.
 Inquire about the location of the hotel’s restaurants, bars, and
clubs. These places can be a source of irritating noise.
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
92

If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front-
desk staff. If they have another room, they should be happy to accom-
modate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
If you show up in Chicago without a reservation, shame on you! But you
have options other than sleeping on a park bench. If you’re not success-
ful during the day, call hotels after 6 p.m., when rooms that are reserved
but not secured with a credit card may become available.
When booking a room at the last minute, you can usually negotiate a
better rate if you phone (even from around the corner) instead of show-
ing up with luggage in hand and a look of desperation.
Another option is to check with reservation bureaus, which buy rooms
in bulk and resell them. They usually offer sizeable discounts off rack
rates. Often, these bureaus are able to find space when other hotels in
the city are sold out. So you may luck out with one of the following:
 Accommodations Express (% 800-950-4685): Eighty percent of
Chicago hotels participate in this service; discounts are 10 percent
to 40 percent off rack rates.
 Hotels.com (% 800-96-HOTEL; www.hotels.com): Forty hotels
participate; 20 percent to 50 percent off rack rates.
 Hot Rooms (% 800-468-3500; www.hotrooms.com): This Chicago-
based service is the best source for discounted rooms at all of
Chicago’s best hotels.
 Quikbook (% 800-789-9887; www.quikbook.com): Twenty hotels
participate; 10 percent to 40 percent off rack rates.
Chicago’s Best Hotels
Chicago has been on a building binge. Even with a downtown inventory
of more than 30,000 rooms, an estimated 3,000 more are scheduled for
completion by 2009. (By comparison, the city’s hotel inventory grew by
about 5,000 rooms over the past ten years.) In addition to the new con-
struction (especially of upscale and luxury hotel units), a growing trend
is condo conversion — the sale of individual hotel rooms to independent
owners. Two examples are Hotel 71 and the Amalfi Hotel.
What does this mean to the intrepid traveler, other than construction
cranes on the horizon and scaffolding on the streets? It’s good news! In
the past, conventioneers told tales of sleeping on cots in hotel hallways
because there was, literally, no room at the inn. Now travelers have
more lodging options than ever before. Increased competition means
wiggle room on prices is more likely, too.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Chicago’s Best Hotels 93

When a major convention is in town, look out. Even with all the con-
struction going on, getting a room can be difficult, so book early. To find
out if an upcoming convention coincides with the dates you plan to visit
Chicago, call the Chicago Convention & Tourism Bureau at % 312-567-
8500, or check its Web site at www.choosechicago.com (click on
Meeting Professionals and then Convention Calendar).
Each hotel listing in this chapter includes a price rating between one
and four dollar signs. The number of dollar signs reflects the average
rack rate (the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room) for a standard
double room for one night, excluding taxes. The more dollar signs under
the name, the more you pay. Table 9-1 has the breakdown.

These accommodations are relatively simple
and inexpensive. Rooms will likely be small,
and televisions are not necessarily provided.
Parking is not provided but rather catch-as-
you-can on the street.
$$
$126–$200
A bit classier, these midrange accommoda-
tions offer more room, more extras (such as
irons, hair dryers, or a microwave), and a
more convenient location than the preceding
category.
$$$
$201–$300
Higher-class still, these accommodations
begin to look plush. Think chocolates on your
pillow, a classy restaurant, underground
parking garages, maybe even expansive
views of the water.
$$$$
$301 and up
These top-rated accommodations come with
luxury amenities such as valet parking, on-
premise spas, and in-room hot tubs and CD
players — but you pay through the nose 
for ’em.
The Kid Friendly icon designates hotels that are especially good for fami-
lies. These hotels may offer play areas, kids’ menus in the restaurants, or
swimming pools, and all have an open (not stuffy) atmosphere that
makes families feel at ease. (Nothing stresses a parent more than Junior
knocking over an antique Chinese vase in the lobby, right?) Bear in mind
that every hotel in town accommodates children’s needs; a listing with-
out this icon does not mean “kid unfriendly.” Most properties allow kids
to stay free with their parents, but the cut-off age varies. Always ask
when you’re booking.

Gold Coast
Traditionalists breathed a sigh of relief when a major renovation in the late
1990s left this hotel and its famous restaurant, the Pump Room, vastly
improved but basically unaltered. Opened in 1926, the 285-room hotel, in
a residential neighborhood 2 blocks west of Lake Michigan’s famed
beaches, features custom furnishings and marble bathrooms. Rooms are
clean and tidy. Standard rooms have two-line phones and minibars, and
the 54 suites, each with a separate bedroom, two bathrooms, a small
kitchen, and a dining room, include 13 ultraplush “celebrity” units named
after famous former guests. Most extravagant is the Presidential Suite,
which boasts a canopied terrace and marble fireplace. On the tiny floor
alongside the Pump Room bar, guests can dance to live entertainment.

This Northside hotel is one of Chicago’s best-kept lodging secrets. This
gracious apartment building offers 25 large hotel rooms. The doorman

restaurants, Ambria (Chapter 10), is off the lobby. If you prefer a neigh-
borhood atmosphere and doing as the natives do, this is the place. Be sure

South Loop
Big is not necessarily a bad thing in a hotel. Sprawling over several city
blocks, this massive hotel, with 1,545 rooms, is like a city within a city.
Public areas abound with shops, bars, restaurants, and artwork. Rooms
feature cherrywood furnishings and feel spacious, thanks to high ceilings.
Many rooms have two bathrooms — a bonus for families with kids. A club
level in the tower provides a higher degree of pampering and has its own
check-in. Kitty O’Shea’s pub recruits chefs, bartenders, and waitstaff under
an Irish government exchange program. Buckingham’s, the hotel’s fine-

dining restaurant, specializes in steaks and is known for its selection of
single-malt Scotch whisky. This hotel is ideally located for sightseers —
across from Grant Park, 5 blocks south of the Art Institute of Chicago and
Millennium Park, and a 20-minute walk from the Field Museum of Natural

Magnificent Mile
You can’t go wrong at the Marriott, in the heart of the Magnificent Mile
near the North Bridge shopping and entertainment complex. Fine rooms
of above-average size are more than comfortable. Concierge floors are
available for a bit more money. An indoor pool and sun deck, health club,
and basketball courts round out the amenities. Although it is large, at 1,192
rooms, you feel at home here. You can play at nearby ESPN Zone and shop
’til you drop in the adjacent Westfield North Bridge Mall.

Conrad Chicago
$$$$
Magnificent Mile
Tucked into the back of Westfield North Bridge mall, the Conrad Chicago
(formerly Le Méridien) maintains a low profile. A quick elevator ride con-
nects you with stores such as Nordstrom and Kenneth Cole or Chicago’s
Magnificent Meal food court, where you can grab anything from a Fluky’s
hot dog to Italian fare at Tuscany Cafe. This property — part of the Hilton
hotel group’s upscale “boutique” brand — is determined to compete with
the city’s more established luxury properties (with room rates to match).

Beware the one-armed man
Movie fans who stay at the Chicago Hilton and Towers should keep their eyes peeled
for the one-armed man. Numerous scenes for the movie The Fugitive were filmed in
the hotel and its Conrad Hilton Suite. For those who want to stay in style, the 5,000-
square-foot suite comes with its own butler, maid, limousine service, and helipad —
and goes for about $5,000 a night. In addition to Harrison Ford, other celebs who have
stayed in it include presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, as
well as film star John Travolta.

Rooms are a bit small (especially the least expensive ones on the north
side), but amenities are top-of-the-line: The safes come with chargers for
cellphones and laptop computers, and the in-room phones are cordless. A
few of the suites even come with private terraces, something few hotels
in this city can offer. The Conrad can’t quite compete with the Park Hyatt
or The Peninsula in the glamour department, but its cozy style should
appeal to travelers looking for something a little more personal.

River North
This chain offers good deals in the heart of River North, one of Chicago’s
flashiest tourist areas. Here you’re a short walk from the shops of Michigan
Avenue, the Loop, and River North’s main strip, and the free trolley to Navy
Pier stops nearby. The newly renovated rooms have large desks and two-
line phones with high-speed Internet access, granite vanities and sofas
(some with pull-out beds). Coffee and newspapers (included in the room
rate) are available in the lobby, and the hotel has an exercise room, pool,
and sun deck. The 30 East Cafe & Lounge offers a breakfast buffet, lunch,
dinner, and room service. As another bonus, you’re close to numerous
restaurants, the legendary jazz club Andy’s and the jazz club Pops for
Champagne (Chapter 16), and a number of galleries and antiques shops.

Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile
$$–$$$
Magnificent Mile
This confusingly named (it’s easy to get it mixed up with its River North
counterpart) but newer hotel sits in a prime location a half-block east of
Michigan Avenue. You’ll pay a little more to stay at this hotel than the
Courtyard in River North, and that’s partly due to the location, and partly
due to the room size, which tends to be a little larger. Double rooms offer
two queen-size beds — a nice change from the standard two double beds —
and king suites make this a comfortable choice for families. Add to that the
lovely swimming pool on the tenth floor and a large fitness room with great
views, and you may want to up the ante and stay here. The lobby décor is
Art Deco, and the room décor is pretty standard, but everything is clean and
new. An on-site American cafe, Viand Bar & Kitchen, is kid-friendly and also
provides room service. And when you need a pick-me-up, you can visit the
Starbucks in the lobby.

Streeterville
A step up in elegance from other all-suite hotels, the DoubleTree offers
comfort in one of Chicago’s best neighborhoods. A casual attitude char-
acterizes the hotel, which is tucked into an elegant street in Streeterville
a couple blocks east of Michigan Avenue, near The Drake Hotel. Here you
get a warm, inviting, immaculate room, plus a separate living room and
bedroom and a deluxe bathroom. Surrounded in glass, in summertime, the
pool deck on the 30th floor is a great place to watch the twice-weekly fire-
works at Navy Pier. Families will feel welcome at Mrs. Park’s Tavern, an
American bistro. The small but adequate workout room will keep you fit
after that meal! You’ll find huge floral arrangements in the lobby and
freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies at check-in.

to play. A shopping arcade is ideal for browsing. Dining spots include the
Cape Cod Room, a Chicago institution since 1933. The Coq d’Or piano bar
(Chapter 16) is known for its well-made martinis. In the Palm Court, you
can enjoy afternoon tea around a fountain with harp music to accompany
your finger sandwiches. There’s also live jazz on Saturdays.

Rainforest Cafe, and other kid-friendly, high-profile dining spots. Parents
like the extras that make a stay easy on the pocketbook, such as cooked-
to-order breakfasts free every morning, and evening cocktails. Suites have
well-equipped kitchens and TVs in both the living room and bedroom.
Osteria Via Stato, a super-yummy new Italian restaurant, is on the street

Chicago’s Four Seasons Hotel is not only one of the best in town, but one

peting lavishly accent the hotel’s attractive public areas. Chandeliers are
as common as light bulbs are at Motel 6. The 70 shops of 900 North
Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile’s most upscale mall (also known
as “Bloomingdale’s mall”) are connected to the hotel. Still, you may never
venture beyond the hotel’s seventh-floor lobby, which holds the Seasons
lounge and restaurant. The lounge offers afternoon tea and views of the
Magnificent Mile. The restaurant features cutting-edge American cuisine.
The hotel’s clublike bar, off the lobby, accommodates cigar smokers. The
spa holds a pool, huge whirlpool, sun deck, and outdoor jogging track.

Hampton Majestic

Loop
You’d be hard-pressed to recognize this new boutique offering as part of
the Hampton Inn chain. Above the refurbished LaSalle Bank Theater in the
heart of the Loop, and near State Street shops, as well as Millennium and
Grant parks, the Hampton is a find for those looking for a unique boutique
hotel with a Loop location. It’s small (135 rooms), and the décor is sophis-
ticated, with gold tiles on the ceiling and walls clad with marble — not typ-
ical Hampton Inn fare (room rates are higher than typical Hampton rates,
too!). Although the building dates from 1906, the amenities are modern,
including free wireless high-speed Internet access and 32-inch flat-screen,
high-definition TVs. A high-end fitness room features Life Fitness equip-
ment (each piece with its own TV), and room service comes from nearby
Loop favorite Italian Village. Families will want to book a suite, which offers
a sleeper sofa, under-the-counter refrigerator, and microwave. Bathrooms
are above par, and feature showerheads with multiple massage settings.
Ceilings are high, giving the rooms a spacious feel, and original windows
are beautiful. Plus, there’s the regular Hampton amenity of a complimen-
tary hot breakfast buffet.

Hard Rock Hotel Chicago
$$$
Loop
The good news: This hotel is not on top of the super-touristy Hard Rock
Cafe, which is about a mile away in River North. In fact, the hotel is a rel-
atively restrained rehab of one of the city’s historic skyscrapers, the 40-
story Carbide and Carbon Building. As expected, the theme here is music:
Pop tunes echo through the lobby, TV monitors show videos, and glass
cases display pop-star memorabilia. If your kids are in the age range that
considers wearing a Hard Rock T-shirt from exotic locales a badge of
honor, they may get a kick from a stay here. Guest rooms are neutral in
décor with modern furnishings. The building’s larger-than-average win-
dows let in plenty of light. The Hard Rock rooms on the corners of each
floor are larger than the standard double rooms and feature chaise longues
for stretching out. The hotel’s restaurant, China Bar & Grill, serves up
Asian fusion cuisine in a high-energy setting, and the street-level bar, open
’til 4 a.m., features live music and DJs most nights.

Hotel Allegro

Loop
Located across the street from City Hall and in the North Loop theater dis-
trict, the 483-room Hotel Allegro is splashy, fun, and a great value. Formerly
the Bismarck Hotel, the place opened in 1894 and was rebuilt in 1926 and
again in 2000, the most recent update pioneering the redesign of the old
hotels into boutique offerings. Warm, vibrant colors and bold patterns
dominate the public spaces and smallish guest rooms. (Don’t be surprised
if your room is painted a perky pink-grapefruit color.) Suites have nice
amenities, including terry robes, VCRs, and two-person Jacuzzi tubs. You
also get melon-and-magenta bedspreads and green throw pillows sprin-
kled with gold stars. Whirlpools are installed in 31 suites. Guests gather
each evening for complimentary wine served around a black grand piano
and limestone fireplace. 312 Chicago restaurant, a colorful extension of the

Hotel Burnham

Loop
Back in 1999, in one of the city’s best restorations in years, the Kimpton
Group of San Francisco transformed one of the world’s first skyscrapers,
D. H. Burnham’s Reliance Building (1891), into a superhip boutique hotel.
(Thanks to the same group for creating Hotel Allegro and Hotel Monaco —
both listed in this chapter.) In the heart of the Loop, across from Macy’s
State Street department store (formerly Marshall Field’s), the hotel has 103
rooms and 19 suites — average in size, below average in price. Visitors
marvel at huge guest-room windows that stretch from floor to ceiling. Ask
for a high, corner room overlooking Macy’s. The playful Atwood Café,
which serves eclectic American cuisine on the ground floor, allows you to
simultaneously dine and admire the restored terrazzo floors and Carrara
wainscoting.

hotel, part of the Loews Hotel group, combines Gothic, Moroccan, East

Hyatt on Printers Row

South Loop
History meets high-tech at this comfortable hotel. Surrounded by loft apart-

Salt Building with a century-old printing plant. It’s a comfortable walk from
the Art Institute of Chicago, Grant Park, Sears Tower, Harold Washington
Library, and the city’s financial district. Guest rooms feature Frank Lloyd
Wright–style geometric designs as well as black lacquer furniture and tap-
estry spreads. Though old-world European in flavor, this hotel offers ameni-
ties such as VCRs, computer workstations, two telephones per room, and
TVs. Adjoining the hotel is the acclaimed Prairie restaurant, which serves
innovative Midwestern cuisine.

This sprawling hotel with more than 2,019 rooms is as impersonal as Union

the hotel is family-friendly — parents don’t need to worry unduly about
kids acting, well, like kids. With all the hustle and bustle, kids blend right
into the general commotion of the place. With its emphasis on conventions

proofing in some rooms is not all it could be. Bonuses: Food is available
with 24-hour room service and at a half-dozen restaurants and cafes, which
include Big’s, an aptly named gigantic brasserie and bar offering 87 brands
of single-malt Scotch, 46 kinds of cognac, 115 Armagnacs, and 164 varieties
of liqueurs and cordials.

InterContinental Chicago
$$$$
Magnificent Mile
Installed in two adjoining buildings at the foot of the Magnificent Mile, this
hotel is eccentric and lovable. The hotel’s south tower was built in 1929 as
the Medinah Athletic Club, a luxury men’s club, and was recently updated.
Climbing to the eighth floor in the south tower, visitors are swept through
a mélange of architectural styles, from classic Italian Renaissance to
French Louis XVI, from medieval England to Spain and Mesopotamia.
Flourishes include hand-stenciled ceilings, marble columns, brass inlays,
and beautiful tapestries and artwork. Service is smooth, and rooms are
elegant and intimate. Each unit at this 814-room property comes with terry
robes, a coffeemaker, a refrigerator, a desk, and three dual-line phones.
Rooms in the older tower are more classic in style; rooms in the north
tower are modern and more standard. The hotel’s restaurant, Zest, is the
only street-level restaurant on Michigan Avenue, so grab a table by the
window and enjoy the people-watching.

The James Chicago
$$$
River North
This hotel made quite a splash when it opened a block west of Michigan
Avenue in 2006. Formerly the nondescript Lenox Suites, The James brings
a much-needed small luxury alternative to Chicago’s hotel scene. Yes,
you’ll see more business travelers here than families, but well-heeled fam-
ilies in the know stay here as well. Cool and stylish in looks, the hotel has
a small lobby. Rooms are a tribute to modern minimalism: Dark-wood plat-
form beds, leather cube stools, chocolate-colored carpeting and slate-tiled
bathrooms complete the décor. The hotel’s strength is its amenities,
notably the 42-inch plasma TVs in each room. There’s also Wi-Fi and a
stereo with an iPod dock. A small spa and gym are located on the lower
level. Try the hotel’s steakhouse, David Burke’s Primehouse, and check
out the nightlife at adjoining J Bar. One downside is the lack of views. Make
sure to ask for a street view, and you’ll be able to admire the famed
Medinah Temple down the street; courtyard views are dismal. Families
may want to inquire about the one-bedroom corner apartments that
include a wet bar; they start at $439 per night. Loft rooms are quite large
(550 sq. ft.) and feature artwork by Chicago artists.

Park Hyatt
$$$$
Magnificent Mile
How stunning is this hotel? Stunning enough that Chicago’s Pritzker family,
owners of the Hyatt hotel chain, moved in when it first opened several
years ago. Part hotel, part condominium building, the 67-story building is
a showpiece of the high-end Park Hyatt line, occupying one of the most
desirable spots on North Michigan Avenue overlooking Water Tower

Touring Tarzan’s old haunt
Even if you don’t stay at the InterContinental Chicago, stop by for a fascinating free
architectural tour. Guests and nonguests can take a 30-minute tape-recorded, self-
guided walking tour narrated by WGN radio personality Roy Leonard. Leave a driver’s
license or other identification as security and get a loaner Walkman. Discover the
beautiful Venetian-style, junior Olympic-size pool, where Olympic gold medalist and
screen actor Tarzan Johnny Weismuller trained and pioneer bodybuilder Charles Atlas
coached the wealthy. Mobster Al Capone threw a huge poolside party here, but only
for an episode of The Untouchables TV series. Nonguests may use the pool and a
state-of-the-art health club for $15 per visit. Changing rooms, saunas, showers, and toi-
letries are provided.

Square. The décor is sleek and contemporary, and you’ll know immedi-
ately you’re in Chicago by the elegant black-and-white photographs of the
city in each guest room. Relaxing is easy in the 7,000-square-foot pool and
spa facility. Guest rooms are oversize. Not as traditionally flowery as the
Four Seasons or the Ritz-Carlton, the Park Hyatt has a more masculine
style of elegance — not unlike the Giorgio Armani designs you can buy in
the boutique on the ground level. The hotel caters to individual business
travelers seeking out the ultimate in personalized service and amenities.
What can you expect? Sony flat-screen TVs, DVD and CD players, a BRNO
desk chair and an Eames chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and
Charles Eames, and four — count ’em — four two-line phones.

The Peninsula Chicago
$$$$
Magnificent Mile
The Peninsula breezed into town a few years ago and has been giving the
luxury-hotel market a run for its money ever since. Service here is practi-
cally a religion, followed by the in-room technology, which rivals any hotel
in the world. The 339 spacious rooms feature marble bathrooms with a
separate shower and tub, hands-free phones, and high-tech entertainment
systems. A small silver “command station” by every bed allows guests to
control the lights, curtains, and room temperature without getting out
from under the covers. The 20-story hotel tower above the Tiffany and Co.
boutique on Michigan Avenue is topped by a 3,500-square-foot suite with
its own outdoor terrace. According to its promoters, the hotel’s mixture of
Eastern graciousness (the headquarters are in Hong Kong) and
Midwestern hospitality sets it apart — a claim I can second.

Red Roof Inn
$
Streeterville
When Motel 6 converted the historic French-owned Hotel Richmont in the
1990s, this became the budget hotel in the pricey Streeterville neighbor-
hood. Red Roof Inn then acquired the property and completed another
renovation. This is your best bet for the lowest-priced lodgings near the
normally pricey Magnificent Mile area. Rooms and amenities match the
budget prices, but who cares, if you’re spending most of your time out on
the town? On the ground floor, hungry travelers can enjoy Coco Pazzo, a
charming sidewalk cafe with excellent Italian fare at prices that won’t eat
up all that money you saved on lodgings.

Renaissance Chicago Hotel
$$–$$$$
North Loop
Returning guests claim that the Renaissance Chicago — which has
retained a strong following (mostly business travelers, who are the hotel’s
bread and butter) through several name changes — is the most comfort-
able hotel in the city. The 553-room, 27-story luxury hotel built by Stouffer
in 1991 features bay windows that offer priceless views of the river and
city. Comfortable-but-simple guest rooms are tastefully decorated in dark
woods, with rich draperies and fabrics and plush carpeting. Four club
floors offer even more comfortable lodgings (in extra-large rooms), a bat-
tery of business amenities, plus rates that include concierge service, a pri-
vate lounge, breakfast, and evening hors d’oeuvres. The hotel has a small
indoor pool and health club on the fourth floor, with a new spa room that’s
been added to provide massage services. Stop in the Lobby Court for
evening cocktails and live jazz or piano music. Theatergoers should
inquire about packages that include performances in the nearby North
Loop theater district.

Ritz-Carlton Chicago
$$$$
Magnificent Mile
Yes, that was Oprah heading into the hotel dining room. You may also find
Mayor Richard Daley holding a power dinner, or Christie Hefner, Playboy
Enterprises CEO, running her empire. This celebrity magnet, known for its
open and airy setting, is super-luxurious yet large enough, with 435 rooms,
to provide anonymity. Guest rooms have handsome cherrywood furnish-
ings and marble bathrooms; suites are ultraplush, with glass French doors
separating bedroom and living room. Standard amenities include king-size
beds, hair dryers, robes, and double-line phones. The Ritz forms part of
the Water Tower complex, in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. You can
find shoppers taking a respite — perhaps with afternoon tea or an evening
aperitif — in the hotel’s atrium lobby. Sunday brunch is one of the best in
town and includes a separate buffet for kids. Don’t miss the gravlax (cured
salmon, a Scandinavian delicacy). Despite its upscale ambience, the size
and bustle make this hotel a place where parents can feel comfortable 
with kids.

This is a big hotel, but somehow it doesn’t feel impersonal. The huge lobby
has a friendly piano bar and windows overlooking an esplanade along the
Chicago River. Rooms are sizable and comfortable, featuring a sitting area
with loveseat and chair. Many of the 1,209 rooms in this 34-story hotel offer
spectacular views of Lake Michigan. Guests in the 110 club-level rooms
pay extra for such amenities as robes and access to a club room that
serves breakfast and cocktails (included in the room rate). Guests include
a large percentage of convention-goers, taking advantage of the property’s
120,000 square feet of meeting and convention space. A standout among
the hotel’s five restaurants and lounges is Don Shula’s Steakhouse, serving
excellent steaks and chops.

The Silversmith
$$$–$$$$
Loop
Frank Lloyd Wright would probably be delighted with this smart hotel —
it has enough Wright influences to satisfy even his enormous ego. Opened
in 1998 as a hotel, the distinctive dark-green building was created in 1897
to house silversmiths and jewelers. A National Historic Landmark today,
the building contains eight floors of guest units (143 rooms), and no two
rooms on any floor are alike. Rooms are decorated in Arts and Crafts and
Prairie School style, with original 12-foot ceilings, 10-foot windows draped
in velvety curtains, and red-oak furniture. Desks are designed to accom-
modate computers. Armoires contain built-in TVs, refrigerators, and CD
players. Many rooms have cushioned window seats. Oversize bathrooms
have granite countertops and tile-and-granite floors. Thrifty travelers with
families may ask about the suites, which are a bargain compared to those
in other downtown hotels.

Sofitel Chicago Water Tower

Another recent addition to Chicago’s crowded luxury-hotel scene, the
Sofitel aims to impress by drawing on the city’s tradition of great archi-
tecture. French designer Pierre-Yves Rochon created a building that’s

110

impossible to pass without taking a second look: a soaring, triangular
tower with a glass and aluminum facade that sparkles in the sun. If you’re
looking for clubby exclusivity, this won’t be your scene, but fans of abun-
dant natural light will be able to get their fix here (weather permitting, of
course). The guest rooms feature contemporary décor with beechwood
walls and chrome hardware for a modern touch. All the rooms enjoy good
views of the city (but the privacy-conscious will want to stay on the upper
floors, where they won’t be on display to surrounding apartment build-
ings). The standard doubles are fairly compact, but thanks to large picture
windows, the spaces don’t feel cramped. The sleek bathrooms are rela-
tively spacious, and the amenities are top-notch.

Gold Coast
Here’s an oasis of quiet sophistication off raucous Rush Street. Housed in
a striking 1980s-built geometric granite-and-glass-skinned building (which
has won awards for architecture and interior design), the 246-room hotel
offers entertainment gadgetry and high-tech conveniences. Each guest
room has a stereo TV and VCR (with movie rentals available 24 hours a
day), a stereo receiver with a compact disc player (and an in-room selec-
tion of CDs), a fully stocked minibar, three telephones (one with a speak-
erphone), and a dedicated fax or computer hookup. Among 40 luxurious
suites are some with balconies, terraces, and sweeping city-and-lake views.
You can work out in the fitness suite, or borrow step boxes and a Reebok
step video to take back to your room. Whiskey Bar & Grill, owned by Rande
Gerber (yeah, he’s the guy married to Cindy Crawford), fills with beautiful
people and has outdoor seating that overlooks the bustle of Rush Street,
where more beautiful people drink and dine.

Talbott Hotel
$$$
Magnificent Mile
One of the hidden gems of the Michigan Avenue shopping corridor, the
Talbott Hotel combines the charm of an English inn with a location that’s
hard to beat. Just off the lobby, you’ll find a cozy sitting room where you
can curl up in a leather armchair by the fireplace. A bar area and sidewalk
cafe with first-rate people-watching were added recently. You won’t find
extensive hotel facilities here, but the cozy atmosphere makes for a bed-
and-breakfast feel (without the sometimes-too-personal bed-and-breakfast
intrusions). But the real surprise is the rooms: Many are exceptionally
large, and all are available at very competitive prices. Suites and the hotel’s
executive king rooms entice with Jacuzzi tubs, and all suites have sepa-
rate sitting areas with sofa beds and dining tables.

The Tremont

Magnificent Mile
If you’re looking for a small, romantic European-style hotel, The Tremont

hotel off the busiest shopping street in the city. The cozy lobby with a fire-
place sets the mood. In the guest rooms, the tasteful furnishings, plush terry
robes, vases of fresh flowers, and marble bathrooms invite lounging. Rooms
aren’t spacious, but they are cheery, with yellow walls and large windows.
(Ask for a room facing Delaware Street if you crave natural light — rooms in
other parts of the hotel look into neighboring buildings.) With its bright
colors and solicitous service, The Tremont is one of the city’s best picks for
a romantic getaway. Guests who call room service are connected to Mike
Ditka’s Restaurant, the boisterous New Orleans–style eatery on the prem-
ises where football and cigars reign. Check out the fabulous Chicago Bears
memorabilia on the upstairs walls.

telephones (with fax and Internet capability), Crabtree & Evelyn toiletries,
terry robes, and a daily newspaper. Among the eight luxury suites,
appointed in 18th-century English style with Asian touches, are two with
outdoor terraces and knockout skyline views. Because this is an older
property, expect narrow hallways and small bathrooms. The fully
equipped fitness center supplies exercise bikes for in-room use. The hotel
restaurant, Fornetto Mei (little oven), serves Italian and Asian fare, and its
centerpiece is its wood-burning pizza oven, located in the restaurant’s
atrium overlooking Delaware Street. Molive, an American bistro, serves
reasonably priced lunch fare and a dinner menu with Californian,
Mediterranean, and Asian accents. Off the small, paneled lobby are a piano
bar and a tearoom, which serves British-style afternoon tea.

C
hicago is not the meat-and-potatoes place that it was back when the
Chicago stockyards and packing houses fed the nation. Today, dining
in Chicago is as sophisticated as dining in New York, San Francisco, and
other cosmopolitan cities. In fact, in 2006, one of our hottest restaurants,
Alinea, was named best restaurant in the nation by Gourmet magazine.
Chicago dining has arrived, and with force.
But even as you’re planning which hot spots to try, don’t worry about
missing out on the classics: Chicago still offers the famous deep-dish
pizza that was invented here in the 1940s. Gino’s East and other Chicago
pizzerias continue to draw big crowds (see Chapter 2). And Chicago is
still the place for steak. Historically, Chicago’s highest grossing restau-
rant has been Gibson’s Steakhouse, a clubby, dark-wood den of cigars,
fine red wine, and gargantuan steaks. Many other Chicago restaurants
famously serve up juicy cuts of beef — see the “Chicago’s steak joints”
sidebar later in this chapter for a list of the best.
But Chicago is much more than pizza and steak. You can find everything
from foodie meccas like Charlie Trotter’s to basement-level dives like
Billy Goat Tavern. Ethnic options abound: Mexican food doesn’t get any
better than Frontera Grill, where the museum-quality Mexican art com-
pletes an atmosphere that matches the level of the cuisine. And a bit off
the beaten path, Arun’s offers exquisite Thai food and desserts so beau-
tiful they’ll bring tears to your eyes.

Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
The most recent trend in Chicago dining is a movement toward food
engineering, for lack of a better term. High-tech combinations of foods
have created out-of-this-world meals and have spawned terms like “food
deconstruction” at unbelievably pricey, high-end establishments such as
Alinea, Moto, and Tru. Still, other well-known chefs still reign supreme,
such as Jean Joho at Everest, Charlie Trotter at his eponymous restau-
rant, and Arun Sampanthavivat at Arun’s.
Other restaurants have put together fascinating mixes of cuisines and
cultures — and the result is truly wonderful, brand-new flavor and taste.
A leading example is the Indian–Latin American combinations at
Vermilion, and SushiSamba Rio, which takes its inspiration from the
Japanese immigrants who moved to Peru and Brazil in the early 20th
century, eventually creating a cuisine that mixed their native Asian
dishes with South American ingredients.
Another trend among Chicago foodies is small plates. Two restaurants
are standouts in this regard. Vegetarians and veggie lovers alike will
delight in the twist on fine dining served up at Green Zebra. The restau-
rant features “small plates” of veggie specialties, such as fennel risotto
cake with a syrah reduction, and Hawaiian heart of palm with Kaffir lime
and Thai basil chile. Another super-popular spot featuring small plates is
the Mediterranean restaurant Avec, which is garnering kudos from food-
ies nationwide.
On the other end of the dining spectrum, industry analysts have noted
an increase in consumers’ appetites for quick and casual eateries where
you order food at a counter and sit down to have it brought to you, like
the local Potbelly’s and Corner Bakery. Such places provide convenient
and fairly healthy meals — very healthy, when compared to traditional
fast food — and are especially popular for lunch.
Many hotels are handing over restaurant operations to independent
restaurateurs — often celebrity chefs. In many cases, the new restau-
rants provide room service, too. A couple of notable examples include
Mike Ditka’s Restaurant in The Tremont Hotel and the Atwood Café in
the Hotel Burnham.
Chicago restaurants reflect the neighborhoods in which they’re located.
In the Loop, you’ll find the expense-account business crowd. Around the
Magnificent Mile, there’s plenty of outdoor dining where stylish people
go to see and be seen. In the burgeoning Randolph Street Market
District, a former warehouse and market area where Oprah’s Harpo
Studios and many design and production companies make their home, a
row of hip new restaurants has popped up. River North, the gallery dis-
trict, is where you find the city’s largest concentration of dining spots.
In Lincoln Park and on the North Side, you find locals at their neighbor-
hood favorites, which tend to change less frequently.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 119

One Chicago neighborhood stands out for some of the hottest dining in
the country: the Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood, home to a large
concentration of artists, boasts eclectic fare and restaurants with cutting-
edge décor. The area’s offerings range from eclectic, small cafes along
Milwaukee Avenue to the high-end hot spots like Spring.
To get your bearings in terms of Chicago’s neighborhoods, see Chapter 8.
For a dining guide to some of Chicago’s many ethnic neighborhoods, see
“Tasting Chicago’s ethnic eats” later in this chapter.
Making reservations
Do you want reservations at the city’s hottest restaurant? Or perhaps
you want to find out which blues musicians are in Chicago during your
visit? This section can help you plan ahead for your night on the town.
If your ideal evening includes dinner at a top restaurant followed by an
award-winning play, make reservations before you leave! Call popular
restaurants two to three weeks in advance for weekend reservations. For
plays, you may need to purchase tickets a few months in advance.
You may also consider using Open Table (www.opentable.com), the
Web site which allows you to reserve tables online at restaurants all
over the country. More than 200 restaurants in the Chicago area (includ-
ing many of the ones in this book) are listed on the site, and you can
even make reservations before you leave home.
Some restaurants are so popular with walk-in diners that they choose
not to accept reservations. To avoid a long wait, plan an early or late
lunch (say, 11:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m.) or an early or late dinner (before 
6 p.m. or after 8:30 p.m.). Exceptions at dinner include restaurants close
to theaters, where you can usually get a table easily around 8 p.m., after
the crowds have left to make the curtain.
In Chicago, you can usually get a table at most restaurants with a day or
two’s notice — sometimes even with a same-day phone call. In cases
where I recommend reservations, I urge you to take the few minutes to
make them — especially for dinner. If you arrive without reservations
during the dinner rush at Chicago’s most popular restaurants, you may

Time-savers
Busy, diner-type restaurants (with booths, tables, and counter seats) usually don’t take
reservations. If you’re willing to sit at the counter, you can often be seated immedi-
ately. The counter is not as intimate or private as a table, of course, but it’s a good
option if you’re pressed for time. This strategy usually works, for example, at Lou
Mitchell’s, the Loop’s most popular breakfast spot, which often has long lines.

find yourself cooling your heels for at least an hour. And, speaking of
cool, that’s the reception you’ll get from the harried host or hostess.
Dressing to dine
As “casual day” has taken hold in corporate America, restaurant dress
codes, too, have become more casual. With a few exceptions — the
Pump Room is a notable one — Chicago restaurant dress codes are
relaxed, and many top spots allow jeans and sports shirts. If a man
wears a tie and a woman a cocktail dress, they may feel slightly over-
dressed in all but the most formal Chicago restaurants. (Still, I feel more
comfortable being slightly overdressed than slightly underdressed.) In
most places, women can feel comfortable in black pants, a sweater, and
boots; men, in dress pants and a sweater. In the summertime, a sundress
with cardigan and sandals for women and khakis and golf shirt for men
should suffice in most places. If you’re concerned, call ahead and ask if
the restaurant has a dress code.
Smoking — or not
Unlike New York and California, Chicago still allows smoking in restau-
rants, but there has been a recent movement toward a smoking ban. At
press time, city ordinances required that all restaurants provide non-
smoking sections. How comfortable and effective they are for nonsmok-
ers depends on the ventilation and the distance between smoking and
nonsmoking areas. Sometimes nonsmoking sections are in a separate
room, away from smokers; often the sections adjoin.
Finding other restaurant sources
Here are the best print and online sources for up-to-date restaurant
information and listings:
 Centerstage Chicago (www.centerstage.net/chicago) offers an
online menu of music, food, dancing, theater, art, and bars.
 Chicago Magazine (% 312-222-8999; www.chicagomag.com), the
premier city magazine, covers lifestyles, culture, theater, Chicago
gossip, and other entertainment, and is a reliable source of restau-
rant reviews.
 The free Chicago Reader (% 312-828-0350; www.chicagoreader.
com) is an alternative newspaper that has gone mainstream —
mostly. Published on Thursday and distributed in the city’s restau-
rants, cafes, and bookstores, the Reader contains Chicago’s most
comprehensive entertainment listings and reviews, covering a wide
range of tastes and lifestyles.
 Weekend, the Friday entertainment section of the Chicago Sun-
Times (% 312-321-3000; www.suntimes.com), is packed with list-
ings. Most famous are the movie reviews by critic Roger Ebert; the
restaurant review section is also good.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 121

 The Chicago Tribune (% 312-222-3232; www.chicagotribune.
com) publishes a weekend tabloid insert, Friday, that’s full of list-
ings and reviews. The section is known for excellent restaurant
reviews.
 The Daily Herald (% 847-427-4300; www.dailyherald.com), pub-
lished in suburban Arlington Heights and distributed throughout
the city, has a fat weekend entertainment section, Time Out!, pub-
lished on Friday.
 North Shore (www.northshoremag.com) is an online magazine
covering Chicago’s northern suburbs. It may be of interest if you
plan to spend time there or want to ogle the homes in the city’s
priciest suburbs.
 Metromix (www.metromix.com), sponsored by the Chicago
Tribune, is a great site for keeping abreast of new restaurants,
clubs, bars, and shows.
 Gritty New City (www.newcitychicago.com) strives to be what the
Chicago Reader once was. Published on Thursday, its pages are full
of the offbeat and the irreverent.

hotels, and lists some of the city’s dining, entertainment, and shop-
ping destinations.
Tasting Chicago’s ethnic eats
A patchwork of ethnic diversity, stitched from cuisines from around the
globe, distinguishes Chicago’s dining scene. Looking for the cuisine of
Cuba or China? Of Japan or Jamaica? Of Laos or Lithuania? You’ll find
them all and many more in the Windy City, where sending your taste
buds on a multinational culinary adventure is easy.
Italian, Chicago-style
At the south end of the Loop, Taylor Street is as Italian as spaghetti and
meatballs. Here in Chicago’s own “Little Italy” (which, sadly, is shrinking
due to encroaching urban renewal), the neighborhood wears its ethnic-
ity boldly.
Check out the red-white-and-green décor of Mario’s Italian Lemonade,
1068 W. Taylor St. (no phone). Pans of rich pizza bread, crusty loaves,
and amaretto cookies fill the air with wonderful smells at Scafuri
Bakery, 1337 W. Taylor St. (% 312-733-8881). And stores still sell
imported olive oil, sausages, cheeses, and wines. You may even run into
Italian-American celebrities like Tony Bennett dining at old neighbor-
hood favorites, such as the Rosebud, 1500 W. Taylor St., near Ashland
Avenue (% 312-942-1117). And, as in the old days in this neighborhood,
black-shawl-draped elderly women gossip on stoops, and men in cloth
caps linger over strong coffee.
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
122

Italian restaurants, old and new, are sprinkled throughout the city. A
Loop landmark for more than 70 years, Italian Village, 71 W. Monroe St.,
at Dearborn Street (% 312-332-7005), is three restaurants in one and a
favorite for pre- and post-theater dining. Stylish Coco Pazzo, 300 W.
Hubbard St. (% 312-836-0900), features the cooking of Tuscany. Just off
the Magnificent Mile, Bice Ristorante (see listing later in this chapter)
offers top food and great people-watching from a sidewalk dining area.
When Jay Leno brings his Tonight Show to Chicago, he often heads for
Mr. Beef on Orleans, 666 N. Orleans St., between Erie and Huron streets
(% 312-337-8500) for an Italian beef or sausage sandwich. Don’t miss
this Chicago favorite — juicy beef or spicy grilled sausage served on a
chewy roll and dressed with sweet or hot peppers.
Although the Maxwell Street market has relocated, you can still buy
pork-chop sandwiches along Halsted Street. Other don’t-miss Chicago
treats include double cheeseburgers at Billy Goat Tavern, 430 N.
Michigan Ave. (% 312-222-1525); all-beef Vienna hot dogs and fries
smothered in cheddar cheese at Gold Coast Dogs, 159 N. Wabash, at
Randolph Street (% 312-917-1677); and ribs at Twin Anchors (see list-
ing later in this chapter). Suburban outposts include Robinson’s No. 1
Ribs in Oak Park and Hecky’s Barbecue in Evanston.
It’s all Greek to me
Long tables and family-style dining reign in Greektown, which is a popular
destination for large groups. Greektown, which received a face-lift in 1996,
occupies a few blocks of Halsted Street north of Jackson Boulevard and
offers a zesty mix of Greek restaurants, nightclubs, and grocery stores.
Greektown restaurants serve such Mediterranean staples as Greek salad,
saganaki (flaming cheese), and baklava (a dessert made with thin layers
of pastry, nuts, and honey), as well as the ubiquitous gyro plate or sand-
wich. One of the area’s most attractive restaurants is Pegasus, 130 S.
Halsted St. (% 312-226-3377), where a rooftop garden offers a panoramic
view of the Chicago skyline. Another favorite of mine is Santorini, 800 W.
Adams St. (% 312-829-8820) — although most of the restaurants in the
neighborhood offer the same lively atmosphere and similar fare.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 123
To market, to market
One of Chicago’s hottest new areas, the Randolph Street Market District, sprouted
among the cabbages and turnips of the produce market of West Randolph Street. The
neighborhood is about an $8 cab ride from the Mag Mile. The young and the beautiful
flock to this “urban chic” neighborhood, to such restaurants as Marché, 833 W.
Randolph St. (% 312-226-8399); Blue Point Oyster Bar, 741 W. Randolph St. 
(% 312-207-1222); Red Light, 820 W. Randolph St. (% 312-733-8880); and Vivo, 838 W.
Randolph St. (% 312-733-3379).

Best of the wurst
Good German fellowship (known as Gemütlichkeit) flows — along with
mounds of plump sausages — at several German restaurants. Sadly, the
Berghoff, 17 W. Adams St. (% 312-427-3170), closed its long-running
German restaurant, but the family still runs a bar here that holds
Chicago liquor license no. 1.
The largest concentration of German food and culture is found in the
Lincoln Square neighborhood, accessible via the Brown Line (at the
Western Avenue stop). Business is often transacted in German at
Meyer’s Delicatessen, 4750 N. Lincoln Ave. (% 773-561-3377), and the
Merz Apothecary, 4716 N. Lincoln Ave. (% 773-989-0900), with its fra-
grant European herbs and toiletries. The Chicago Brauhaus, 4732 N.
Lincoln Ave. (% 773-784-4444), resembles a Munich beer hall and offers
schnitzel, smoked pork loin, Koenigsberger klopse (meatballs in caper
sauce), and other German specialties.
Dim sum and then some
Chicago’s Chinatown is about 20 blocks south of the Loop and about 2
long blocks west of the McCormick Place convention complex. Some 50
restaurants, bakeries, markets, and import houses, are strung along a
few blocks of Cermak Road and Wentworth Avenue. Perennially popular
restaurants include Three Happiness, 209 W. Cermak Rd. (% 312-842-
1964) and 2130 S. Wentworth Ave. (% 312-791-1228), known for its
bountiful dim sum cart, and Emperor’s Choice, 2238 S. Wentworth Ave.
(% 312-225-8800), which serves superior seafood. Elsewhere in the city,
head for River North to try the satay bar at Ben Pao, 52 W. Illinois St., at
Dearborn Street (% 312-222-1888).
Thai one on
Thai restaurants are to Chicago what Chinese restaurants are to many
other American cities: ubiquitous, affordable, and perfect for a quick
meal that offers a taste of the exotic. If you’ve never tried Thai, Chicago
is a great place to start. Good introductory dishes are pad thai noodles
topped with minced peanuts, or the coconut-based mild yellow curry.
Arun’s (see listing later in this chapter) is one of the city’s reigning gour-
met interpreters of Thai cuisine, but you can find many other low-key
places where entrees don’t go much beyond $10. A staple of the River
North dining scene is the bright and airy Star of Siam, 11 E. Illinois St., 
at North State Street (% 312-670-0100). Amarit, 1 E. Delaware Place, at
State Street (% 312-649-0500), a few blocks off the Magnificent Mile,
consistently delivers top-quality noodles, curries, and Thai iced tea,
even if the décor runs toward the shabby. The North Side’s Thai Classic,
3332 N. Clark St., at Roscoe Street (% 773-404-2000), near Wrigley Field,
offers an excellent all-you-can-eat buffet on weekends, if you want to try
a taste of everything.

124

Samplings from around the world
A Vietnamese enclave known as Little Saigon centers on Argyle Street
and North Sheridan Road, about a 20-minute cab ride north of down-
town. You find a number of restaurants here that feature Vietnamese
and Laotian specialties, as well as markets offering Oriental vegetables,
exotic spices, and hand-painted teapots. Even the El station on Argyle
sports a red, pagoda-style roof.
Go just to the east and a bit north of Little Saigon to find Andersonville, 
a formerly Scandinavian neighborhood with eateries such as Svea
Restaurant, 5236 N. Clark St. (% 773-275-7738), and Ann Sather (see list-
ing later in this chapter). They serve traditional pea soup, potato sausage,
Swedish meatballs, and Swedish pancakes with tart lingonberries. Check
out the Swedish American Museum Center, a pair of Scandinavian delis
(Wikstrom’s and Erikson’s), and the Swedish Bakery, 5348 N. Clark St. 
(% 773-561-8919) — a must-visit if you’re in the area. This is the reigning
star of bakeries in Chicago, in my humble opinion, and you don’t have to
be Swedish to love it (although their wide array of Swedish Christmas
cookies are to die for). Middle Eastern food is also becoming popular in
the area, with several excellent bakeries and restaurants.
Other major enclaves in Chicago that offer ethnic cuisine include a
Lithuanian area around Marquette Park on the southwest side; a con-
centration of Indian shops and restaurants along Devon Avenue; and
Ukrainian Village (on the West Side, near Chicago Avenue and Oakley
Boulevard), where you find borscht and cabbage rolls. Sections of North
Milwaukee Avenue are “Main Street” for Chicago’s huge Polish popula-
tion (the second-largest urban concentration after Warsaw’s), with store-
front restaurants such as Red Apple Restaurant, 3123 N. Milwaukee
Ave., at Central Park Avenue (% 773-588-5781).
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Chicago is a great food town — but you’re not here just to eat. You’ll
probably want some cash left over for other activities. In that case, it’s
time to investigate cheap eats.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 125
Tips about tipping and taxes
How much should you tip? Throughout the United States, the standard tip is 15 percent
of the total before tax is added; 20 percent is considered a generous tip. If you prefer,
you can strike a reasonable compromise by figuring 15 percent of the total, tax
included. Chicago’s food tax is substantial. Restaurants levy a 9 percent state tax, plus
a 1 percent city tax. I find it easiest to double the tax, leaving that amount for the tip.

I have two tips for bargain hunters. First, head for one of Chicago’s many
ethnic restaurants. Two people can enjoy a Thai meal for about $30,
including beer to wash down the spicy peanut sauce. Second, eat your
big meal at lunch. Many restaurants serve dinner only, but the ones that
open at midday (or even for breakfast) offer great values at lunch.
Other strategies: Split an appetizer or dessert. Skip the alcohol or enjoy
a before- or after-dinner drink from your private (and cheaper) stash in
your room. If possible, skip beverages altogether — those $2.50 Diet
Cokes can really add up. Order the fixed-price menu (not available
everywhere but always a good deal). Have a meal on the go for lunch
and save your cash for a big night out.
A server who rattles off daily specials without prices may be busy or 
forgetful — or may be counting on your reluctance to look cheap in front
of your friends or family. Always ask, and no $23 plate of noodles (true
story) will ever sneak up on you.
To help you budget, each listing in this chapter includes a price range for
main courses and a dollar-sign rating. The ratings represent the price of
an appetizer, entree, and nonalcoholic beverage — but not tax or tip —
and correspond with the following ranges:

Lettuce Entertain You . . . All Over Chicago
The Lettuce Entertain You restaurant empire was founded in Chicago in 1971 by Rich
Melman, who opened R.J. Grunt’s (which is still going strong) as an upscale hamburger
joint just across the street from the Lincoln Park Zoo. In doing so, he staked his claim
to fame with what is considered the world’s first restaurant salad bar. Today, the com-
pany owns 70 restaurants around the country, and it’s pretty hard to eat extensively in
Chicago without happening into one owned by Lettuce Entertain You. From high-end
French dining at Everest, to casual Asian fare at Big Bowl, and stuff-yourself-silly
family-style Italian dining at Maggiano’s, you’ll find plenty of options. Check them 
out on their Web site, www.leye.com, where you can make reservations at any of
their restaurants. (And hint, hint: If you need to buy a little something for your hosts or
friends while in town, most Chicagoans will always appreciate a Lettuce Entertain You 
gift card.)

ECLECTIC
Mushroom-flavored puffs inspired by sculptures at the Museum of
Contemporary Art, and French onion soup served inside a shell of pul-
verized onions (you have to break the shell to get to the soup inside) are
just some of the ways Alinea’s chef Grant Achatz is changing the face of
food. Like Homaro Cantu at Moto (see listing later in this chapter), Achatz
presents familiar foods in new contexts and unexpected forms, such as a
serving of rib-eye beef surrounded by orange, yellow, and brown sauces
that combine to taste just like A-1 steak sauce. Achatz, who has worked
with Spain’s Ferran Adrià (the master of food deconstruction), as well as
French Laundry’s Thomas Keller, says he wants diners to feel like they’re
taking a journey, “zigzagging between challenge and comfort.” The restau-
rant itself is comfortable, with shoulder-high chairs you can sink into and

Ambria

Lincoln Park
FRENCH
Ambria is one of Chicago’s finest restaurants, and one of the longest-running,
at 20 years and counting. Housed in the stately Belden-Stratford Hotel
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 127

(now mostly condominiums), across the street from Lincoln Park Zoo,
Chicago’s classical French restaurant maintains a high standard. You find
deals being brokered and couples celebrating anniversaries in the wood-
paneled, clublike atmosphere. Service is exemplary, from the charming
hostess who makes you feel comfortable in the upscale French atmos-
phere to the professional waitstaff. The food, from roasted rack of lamb to
medallions of New Zealand venison, is superb. Ask for a soufflé for dessert
when you order your main course (so they have time to prepare this light-
as-air French classic).

Ann Sather
$
North Side
SCANDINAVIAN/BREAKFAST
Gooey, buttery-soft homemade cinnamon rolls are reason enough to visit
this mecca of Swedish delights. So are thin Swedish pancakes with 
lingonberry sauce, and maybe a side of mild Swedish potato sausage. This
popular breakfast spot is especially busy on weekends — you may have to
wait, but lines move quickly. (Get there before 11 a.m. for the fastest serv-
ice.) Hearty, inexpensive lunches include chopped beefsteak, roast pork
loin, and meatballs. Ann Sather’s is bright and cheerful, decorated with
paintings from a Swedish fairy tale. A sister restaurant is in the Swedish
enclave of Andersonville, at 5207 N. Clark (% 773-271-6677). Several other
branches serve only breakfast and lunch: in Wicker Park, at 1448 N.
Milwaukee Ave. (% 773-394-1812), and at smaller cafes in Lakeview, 
at 3411 N. Broadway (% 773-305-0024) and 3416 N. Southport Ave. 
(% 773-404-4475).

Arun’s
$$$$$
North Side
THAI
Stunningly beautiful Thai food and an ever-changing chef’s menu make this
the best Thai restaurant in the city. For my money, Arun’s may be the best
Thai restaurant in the country. Tucked away in a far-northwest neighbor-
hood, the restaurant’s unassuming exterior cloaks a spectacular interior.
It offers a fixed-price-only menu of 12 courses for $85 — expensive, but
worth it. On any given night, you may sample hot-and-sour shrimp soup,
three-flavored red snapper, or garlic prawns. Even classic dishes become
unforgettable here: Courses of various delicate dumplings are accented
with edible, carved dough flowers. And the desserts, including the scrump-
tious sticky rice with papaya, are tiny works of art. If you take public trans-
portation here, you may want to splurge on a cab home, because buses
run sporadically late at night.

ECLECTIC
Colorful and offbeat, this stylish eatery in the Hotel Burnham is eclectic
and fun and serves up a fresh take on comfort food. This fanciful and
romantic spot is filled with nooks and crannies and sofa-like seats. Soaring
windows allow you to take in the bustle of State Street from the comfort of
your own table. Don’t miss the mussels in a garlicky tomato sauce with
crusty, grilled homemade bread, and for dessert, try the banana-and-white-
chocolate bread pudding. The bar is small, so you’re allowed to take drinks
and sit in chairs around the fireplace in the lobby.

No, you aren’t walking into a sauna: The wood-paneled walls and long
benches for communal dining are part of the experience at this hot new
restaurant, the latest from the owners of Blackbird, the restaurant next
door that’s been a happening spot for years. Avec is all about small plates
and matching wines. And speaking of wine, it’s served carafe-style, a real
value, because you get about a glass and a half of wine for the price of one
glass. Specialties cooked in the woodburning oven include charcuterie
(such as homemade chorizo and salami dishes), and a wide range of small

AMERICAN
It’s all about wine at this bistro in a lofty, airy space in the Marina Towers
complex, across from the House of Blues. This place is so wine-centric that
the menu recommends which red or white would best complement each
offering. Ordering glasses of wines from certain regions or of specific vari-
etals will bring out the wine expert in you. (A flight is two to three small
glasses of different wines served together.) And the food, enlivened with
Californian and Mediterranean accents, is yummy enough to make sure
you don’t drink on an empty stomach. In the tavern, you can sit at the bar
and snack on small plates like shiitake spring rolls, steamed mussels, and
homemade pâtés. Book a table in the Cellar for a dinner menu that
includes seafood, seared venison, and braised pork shank.

Bistro 110

Magnificent Mile
AMERICAN
A neighborhood crowd gathers at Bistro 110 for its changing weekly spe-
cials, posted on a chalkboard. (You can also check the board for the
weather forecast and other local news.) This is the perfect spot to get a
grilled fish, steak, or roasted veggie platter, and the place has become so
well-known for its roasted garlic with crunchy French bread that the
restaurant gives each table a card with the recipe to take home. Because
it’s a neighborhood crowd, the atmosphere is relaxed and kid-friendly.
Sunday brunch with a New Orleans–inspired menu and a live jazz band is
a popular ritual; get there early — or be prepared for a long wait.

Blackbird
$$$
Randolph Street Market District
NEW AMERICAN
Stylishly bare, Blackbird exudes an urban chic that could blend into the
dining landscape of any major city. The white, narrow room is dense with
close-packed tables, and the floor-to-ceiling windows in front frame the
urban landscape outside. As in many new restaurants, the noise level can
get high (and the tables are crammed too close together). Nevertheless,
Blackbird is fun for people who like a scene (everyone pretends not to be
looking around), but I’d recommend somewhere else if you’re looking for
a romantic dinner. Familiar comfort foods in new guises make up the
entree list: rack of lamb with figs, leeks, and honey, and rosemary-infused
mashed potatoes; quail breast stuffed with dates, almonds, orange, and
smoked bacon; and grilled sturgeon with caramelized carrots and curried
cauliflower. Desserts are fairly straightforward and on the small side.

Boka
$$
Lincoln Park
AMERICAN
In a neighborhood of Irish pubs and sandwich joints, Boka is a sophisti-
cated, grown-up alternative. The dimly lit dining room manages to be both
romantic and dramatic, thanks to the fabric “sculptures” stretched across
the ceiling. The appetizer getting the thumbs-up from critics is the fresh
oyster selection served with a still-bubbling sparkling wine sauce. Entrees
cover a range of meat and seafood: You might try the grilled wild salmon
with a thyme-sherry reduction, served with white beans and grilled greens;
or go for the pork chops, which are topped with a rosemary-cider sauce
and come with blue-cheese potato gratin. Boka makes a great dinner stop
before a show at Steppenwolf, but make a reservation, because many other
theatergoers will have the same idea.

Bucktown/Wicker Park
ECLECTIC
Café Absinthe doesn’t look like much from the outside (in fact, you enter
from the alleyway), but the romantic interior is the perfect place to linger
over a meal with a date. Be prepared for trendy types soaking in the atmos-
phere while jazz plays in the background. Draperies divide the tables, cre-
ating privacy for a tête-à-tête. Food is interesting and changes seasonally.
Appetizers may include grilled ostrich filet with confit onion, fresh figs and
mandarin oranges, or brie cooked en croute with hazelnuts, blackberry
preserves, and spiced strawberries. Main courses run the gamut from
wasabi-seared tuna with Oriental vegetable rolls to Pernod-glazed rack of
lamb with macadamia-nut couscous. Dessert is as exotic as the rest; if it’s
available, try the tea-scented crème brûlée, or the decadent chocolate-
and-hazelnut mousse served in a martini glass.

SPANISH/TAPAS
Sure, this place is loud. And boisterous. And crowded. But the food is

in their 20s and 30s, making it a good group destination. You may try going
in the off-hours, such as very late (after 10 p.m.) or very early (at 4 p.m.,
after a day of shopping or touring). After you give your name to the host-
ess, head to the bar for a pitcher of sangria, and join in the fun. Tapas
include baked goat cheese, grilled octopus, and tortilla Española. In a town
where many restaurant kitchens close by 10 p.m., this place is one of
Chicago’s most reliable and popular spots for a late-night dinner.

LATIN AMERICAN
At Carnivale, it’s the vibrant atmosphere, not the food, that’s the attrac-

the dance music that played throughout a recent meal, the stereo system
remains intact. Head for the cavernous, two-story central dining room if
you want to be at the center of the action, or request a table in one of the
more intimate side rooms if you prefer not to shout through your meal.
The menu takes inspiration from Central and South America, and includes
everything from rum-glazed pork shoulder with Puerto Rican rice and

Carson’s
$$
River North
BARBECUE
A true Chicago institution, Carson’s calls itself “The Place for Ribs,” and,
is it ever! The barbecue sauce is sweet and tangy, and the ribs are meaty.
Included in the $20 price for a full slab of ribs are coleslaw and one of four
types of potatoes (the most decadent are au gratin), plus right-out-of-the-
oven rolls. For dinner there’s often a wait, but don’t despair. In the bar area,
you’ll find a heaping mound of some of the best chopped liver around and
plenty of cocktail rye to go with it. When you’re seated at your table, tie on
your plastic bib — and indulge. In case you don’t eat ribs, Carson’s also
barbecues chicken, salmon, and pork chops, and the restaurant’s steaks
aren’t bad. But ribs are the house specialty, so make sure that someone
orders them. (The waitstaff will be shocked if you don’t.) If by some
remarkable feat you have room left after dinner, the candy-bar sundaes are
a scrumptious finale. Carson’s popularity has led to something of a factory
mentality among management, which evidently feels the need to herd ’em
in and out, but the servers are responsive to requests not to be hurried
through the meal.

Charlie Trotter’s
$$$$$
Lincoln Park
NOUVELLE
Welcome to Chicago’s foodie mecca. Housed in a 1908-built brownstone,
Charlie Trotter’s is a destination, not just a restaurant. The food outshines
even the restaurant’s setting. Highly stylized items and lush ingredients
make for complex dishes that are innovative, improvisational, and har-
monious. The grand menu assortment ($110) changes daily, and a veg-
etable menu is $90. Those are your only two choices, so don’t expect to
order à la carte. The coveted table in the kitchen allows for the best view-
ing and must be booked well in advance. Be prepared to make this your
entire evening’s activity, because meals can take up to three hours.
Naturally, you’ll find an extensive wine list and a sommelier to help you
match wines with each course. For a taste of Trotter’s gourmet fare on a
smaller scale, stop by Trotter’s To Go, his takeout store in Lincoln Park,
at 1337 W. Fullerton Ave. (% 773-868-6510).

steak with fries), braised lamb shank, and coq au vin (chicken in red-wine

Club Lucky
$$
Bucktown/Wicker Park
ITALIAN
Naugahyde banquettes, Formica-topped bar and tables, and Captain Video
ceiling fixtures may seem retro to some, but everyone from young families
to stylish couples find Club Lucky both an interesting scene and a deal for
good food. The menu offers Italian home-style cooking, such as pasta e
fagioli (thick macaroni-and-bean soup); rigatoni with veal meatballs,
steamed escarole, and melted slabs of mozzarella; and spicy grilled bone-
less pork chops served with peppers and roasted potatoes. Try one of the
restaurant’s signature martinis while you wait (weekends draw big
crowds). The lunch menu includes about a dozen Italian sandwiches, such
as scrambled eggs and pesto, meatball, and Italian sausage.

Custom House
$$$
South Loop
AMERICAN
The menu highlights here are aimed at carnivores, from the rich, almost
buttery short rib (served with horseradish-flavored cream puffs) to the
pork chop accompanied by pork-stuffed cannelloni and wild mushrooms.
No gimmicks here: The draw is Chef Shawn McClain’s knack for mixing
unexpected flavors simply but perfectly. (Take, for example, the seemingly
straightforward spinach salad, which is livened up with thick chunks of
bacon, roasted shiitake mushrooms, and hazelnuts). Service is top-notch
and the setting sophisticated, with velvet-upholstered booths that allow

lunch, and a Sunday brunch.

Cyrano’s Bistro, Wine Bar & Cabaret
$$
River North
BISTRO
This charming restaurant has yellow walls, gilt mirrors, and French 
posters — after a glass of wine, you just may think you’re in Southwest
France. In fact, Bergerac, France, happens to be the hometown of this
lovely restaurant’s chef, and also the hometown of the restaurant’s name-
sake, Cyrano de Bergerac. For $27, you can have a three-course fixed-price
feast that may include ratatouille, coq au vin, and a bread pudding with
chocolate sauce. A three-course lunch special for $20 is a real deal. A cabaret
is presented Wednesday through Saturday nights; there’s a $10 cover and
two-drink minimum those nights, or pay the $35 for an all-inclusive dinner
and cabaret package.

Del Toro
$$
Bucktown/Wicker Park
SPANISH/TAPAS
The mosaic-covered walls, red lace curtains and red marble bar give this
space a nice dose of old-world European style, but Del Toro, with its
Wicker Park address, caters to late-night hipsters (complete with a DJ who
spins tunes after 10 p.m.). Dishes range from basic (marinated olives;
roasted beet and goat cheese salad) to more ambitious (seared tuna with
sweet-and-sour pumpkin; a terrine of saffron-braised octopus). The lightly
breaded and fried chickpeas — mixed with lime juice and chiles — are typ-
ical of the Del Toro menu: seemingly straightforward but with a flavorful
twist. The large, welcoming lounge area in front is a good spot to sample
the restaurant’s specialty cocktails.

This create-your-own stir-fry restaurant often has lines, but don’t worry —
they move quickly. If you’ve never assembled your own stir-fry dish, you

may want to follow one of the suggested recipes on the giant blackboards.
Choose from over 70 ingredients including rice, noodles, seafood, chicken,
beef, sauces, and veggies — for one price. And remember, the price
includes multiple visits to the food line. If at first you don’t succeed, try,
try again. Kids love to create their own dishes, and the price is right if you
have a few wee ones in tow: A kid’s stir-fry is $5. Flat Top Grill has three

Frontera Grill and Topolobampo
$$–$$$$
River North
MEXICAN
Owners Rick and Deann Bayless travel extensively through Mexico, gath-
ering authentic regional recipes for what is arguably one of America’s best
Mexican restaurants, containing two dining options. Topolobampo is more
upscale, and you can order off its menu at its more casual sister eatery,
Frontera Grill. Both are in the same building. Try the signature tacos al
carbon (the precursor of Americanized fajitas) or chile-marinated stuffed
quail with smoky red beans, enchiladas, browned potatoes, and tangy cab-
bage. The signature appetizer at Frontera is the sopes surtidos, corn
“boats” filled with chicken in red mole sauce, or black beans with home-
made chorizo, and more. At Topolobampo, you’ll find white tablecloths
and more upscale ingredients and presentation. Frontera only accepts
reservations for parties of five to ten, so do as the locals do after putting
their names on the list: Order a few margaritas in the bar, which is deco-
rated with terra-cotta tile and rustic wooden tables and bar stools.
See map p. 133. 445 N. Clark St. (between Illinois and Hubbard streets). % 312-661-

parties of 1 to 8, reservations accepted at Frontera Grill only for groups of 5 to 10.

Gibson’s Steakhouse
$$$$
Gold Coast
STEAKHOUSE
Chicagoans come here to see and be seen, and the food isn’t bad either.
Photos of celebs decorate the Art Deco–style rooms. The bar has its own
life, where the “who’s who” of the city mingle and mix. Everything is larger
than life, from the patrons to the martinis, which come in 10-ounce glasses.
Entrees are also giant-size, and well-aged steaks are the star of the show.
With such ample portions, Gibson’s is ideal for a group interested in shar-
ing dishes. The turtle pie (a luscious dessert) alone can probably serve
eight! This is one of Chicago’s most popular restaurants, so call well in
advance for reservations. If you aren’t up for a big meal, you can also order
from the bar menu.

mended. Main courses: $22–$35. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Daily 11:30 a.m. to midnight;

Gino’s East
$
River North
PIZZA
Chicago’s famous pizzeria serves up deep-dish pizzas in the classic style at
its huge, block-long location. Patrons are welcome to scrawl on the graffiti-
covered walls and furniture, making this a favorite with kids. Most people
consider Gino’s the quintessential Chicago deep-dish pizza. It’s so filling
that, for many diners, one piece is sufficient for a meal — and a small
cheese pizza is plenty for two. Three or more pieces is enough to send you
into cholesterol overdrive. Specialties include the supreme, with layers of
cheese, sausage, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms; and the vege-
tarian, with cheese, onions, peppers, asparagus, summer squash, zucchini,
and eggplant.

Chicago’s steak joints
Since the days of the stockyards, Chicago has been known for its beef. The stockyards
are long gone, but the steakhouses remain. The most profitable restaurant in Chicago is
Gibson’s Steakhouse, where the drinks are as big as the beef (see the listing in this chap-
ter). Morton’s, 1050 N. State St. (% 312-266-4820), a Chicago original with branches
nationwide (and other Chicago-area locations), is considered by some to be the city’s
best. Other local favorites include the Saloon Steakhouse (see listing in this chapter),

South Loop
ITALIAN
The South Loop was officially gentrified with the opening of this funky Italian
restaurant. The cozy, convivial ambience — with exposed-brick, mahogany
accents, an open kitchen, stacks of wine bottles, and hip music — is par
for the course in other restaurant-rich neighborhoods, but it’s a breath of
fresh air in this area. While Gioco’s nouveau Italian dishes include a few
standard appetizers (such as fried calamari), you’ll also find some creative
new options: octopus carpaccio, confit of rabbit with fava-bean purée, and
steamed mussels with white wine. The fine selection of pastas includes
eggplant ravioli with pesto sauce, pappardelle in a duck sauce, and risotto
ai frutti di mare (with mixed seafood). Even if you’re loath to order tiramisu
for the umpteenth time, try this heavenly version — light as air and easy
on the rum.

The latest offering from the chef who won raves at Spring (see listing later

attracting attention for its “small plates” approach, featuring veggie
delights. Try the fennel risotto cake with a syrah reduction, and the
Hawaiian heart of palm with Kaffir lime and Thai basil chile. And count on
ordering two mini-portions if you want to fill up. This vegetarian cuisine

Holy cow! One of Chicago’s most flamboyant eateries is larger than life,

From the huge baseball bat outside to showcases filled with uniforms, hel-

America’s favorite pastime. (Have you ever hurled a baseball from a
pitcher’s mound to home plate? To get an idea of the distance, take a look

exact distance from hill to plate.) The food is pretty good, too — steaks,
chops, pasta with red sauce, and such Italian basics as chicken Vesuvio,
cheese ravioli, and calamari. The bar offers homemade thick-cut potato
chips that can be addictive. Be careful not to ruin your appetite!

Hot Chocolate

Bucktown/Wicker Park
AMERICAN
Mindy Segal’s desserts got raves when she worked at the restaurant mk
(see the listing later in this chapter), so when she opened her own place —
with a dessert theme, no less — there were lines almost immediately. Hot
Chocolate is a casual neighborhood spot, the kind of place you can stop
in for a brioche and coffee in the morning, a Kobe beef steak sandwich at
lunch, or a plate of glazed pork tenderloin in the evening. However,
desserts are the main event here. Many, including the apple-cider potpie
and the banana napoleon, with layers of caramelized bananas, banana cof-
feecake, graham crackers, and a topping of banana ice cream, use seasonal
fruit, but chocoholics can get their fill, too, with dishes such as the rich
chocolate soufflé with caramel ice cream or a flight of mini hot chocolates
served with homemade marshmallows. Come on a weekday (for a late
lunch or early dinner) to avoid a wait.

ECLECTIC
Jane’s is a neighborhood charmer that’s managed to keep an off-the-
beaten-track feel. Casual and chic, the restaurant is in an old house that
was gutted, so it’s open to the roof. The walls are decorated with ever-
changing work by local artists. In the winter, soft yellow light makes the
place cozy; in the summer, you can sit outside at sidewalk tables.
Bucktown residents pack the place, so you usually wind up squeezing into
the bar area to wait. But the experience is worth it. Try Jane’s version of
salade niçoise, with grilled ahi tuna. Pan-roasted grouper and goat cheese,
and stuffed chicken breast are also favorites.

Here’s a little piece of Miami transplanted to the North Bridge area. If you’ve
never sampled stone crab, this outpost of famed Joe’s Stone Crab of Miami

cracked perfectly to preserve the delectable meat. (Note: The claws are
served cold.) Sides include creamed spinach and hash browns. The Key
lime pie is the best I’ve had — and believe me, I’ve tasted many. If you get
hooked, never fear: You can order stone crabs from Joe’s over the Web and
they’ll arrive via Fed Ex the next day, packed in dry ice.

When my sushi-loving friends and I debate the merits of Chicago sushi
spots, we always come back to Kamehachi. The place is filled with a good-
looking crowd, and the sushi is fresh. In the fast-changing restaurant world,
Kamehachi’s record is impressive. This family-owned spot has been going
strong since 1967, when it opened as Chicago’s first sushi bar. If you have
a group, call ahead and book the tatami room, where you can make plenty
of noise and linger over dinner. Otherwise, ask for a table upstairs where
you can watch the Old Town crowd swirl by. A second location is just off

gracious destination is bathed in a honeyed glow and is filled with sensual
aromas from the open kitchen and rotisserie. Well-prepared versions of
bistro standards include the delicate bouillabaisse in a lobster-saffron
broth; ragout of super-tender rabbit, onions, and mashed potatoes; steak
frites; sensational escargots bourguignon; onion soup; and salade Lyonnaise

that the fare is on the heavy, rich side, you’re right. In a tiny storefront, the
tables are closely packed, meaning that the atmosphere is intimate and,
after your fellow diners get a glass or two of wine in them, boisterous as
well. Some people find it cozy and others feel it’s claustrophobic. You prob-

including one of the best crème brûlées in Chicago. Prices here are more

Plan to eat at least one breakfast at this South Loop diner, a Chicago tra-

egg dishes served in sizzling skillets. You double your pleasure (and cho-
lesterol) with Mitchell’s use of double-yolk eggs. Pancakes and waffles are
good, too. Orders come with thick slabs of toasted Greek bread and home-
made marmalade. The wait can be long, especially on weekends, but it can
be shorter if you’re willing to take a counter seat. The restaurant has a tra-
dition of handing out boxes of Milk Duds to female patrons — and doughnut

Maggiano’s
$$
River North
ITALIAN
A great pick for large groups, Maggiano’s is a shrine to family-style Italian
dining. Like many of its fellow Lettuce Entertain You restaurants,
Maggiano’s feels a bit contrived, with traditional red-checkered tablecloths
and old family portraits (which family, we’ll never know), designed to
create the feel of Little Italy throughout the nine dining rooms. Still, heap-
ing plates of pasta meant to be shared make Maggiano’s a good choice for
a large or budget-conscious family (and who’s isn’t?). Everything on the
menu is super-sized. Steaks are all more than a pound, and most pasta
dishes weigh in over 25 ounces. You’re expected to share dishes, pass
things around, and try a bit of everything. The menu is vast and features
Italian pasta classics such as chicken and spinach manicotti, eggplant
Parmesan and meat or marinara lasagna, plus chicken, veal, steaks, chops,
and seafood. Try the Prime New York Steak al Forno, Gorgonzola, a strip
steak served with caramelized onions and melted Gorgonzola cheese.
There’s no kids’ menu, but the kitchen will serve smaller portions.

The romantic, bring-the-outdoors-indoors atmosphere is the draw at this

patio, however, is the best place to enjoy a meal: It’s covered and heated
in the winter, making for the unusual indoor-outdoor feel. My favorites
here always include seafood, whether it’s ahi tuna or seared scallops that
are out of this world. Wild game is another specialty here, including grilled
ostrich and venison. An apple-caramel Dutch pancake and chocolate
mousse cake are among the most comforting, feel-good desserts you’ll
have anywhere. The West Coast–oriented wine list is heavy on Bordeaux
blends, with more than 20 wines by the glass.

juices. The bright, smoke-free main-floor dining room offers a compara-

If you think food is meant to be experienced by all the senses, book a table

Homaro Cantu calls his cuisine “avant-garde with Asian influences,” but
what he’s really interested in is taking dining beyond just eating. He
entwines fresh herbs in custom-designed corkscrew-handled spoons,
allowing the scent of the herbs to waft toward diners as they eat. Cantu’s
got a sense of humor, too — during a raw food course, he uses a “virtual
aroma device” to emit a subtle smoky scent, and sometimes the menu itself
is edible. Dining here is strictly degustation, with 4-course, 7-course, and
10-course options and a “gastronomic tasting menu” of up to 17 courses.
The restaurant itself has a minimalist Zen feel — here, all the drama is at
your table.

p.m. And with creative variations on breakfast favorites, it’s not hard to
see why. The pan-seared cut oatmeal with dried fruit compote and apple-
cider–brown-sugar syrup tastes more like pie than Quaker Oats. You’ll find
a different theme each week (such as apples) for the pancake “flight” — four
silver-dollar-sized stacks of buttermilk pancakes served in a slightly differ-
ent way. And, no, that isn’t your mother’s hash, unless she uses Guinness-
braised brisket and butternut squash. Other favorites include the puff pastry
and fruit smoothies blended with whatever juices you request. A second

Osteria Via Stato
$$
River North
ITALIAN
At Osteria Via Stato, the choices are plentiful, so it’s good that you aren’t
required to make many. A set price of $36 buys you a full, European-style
meal: a range of antipasto plates (smoked salmon, salami, warm focaccia,
and more), two pasta dishes (served family-style), and a meat entree (the
only dish you actually choose from the menu). Pastas are usually a mix of
hearty and light; pappardelle with a chunky meat-and-mushroom sauce
may be served alongside rigatoni with cauliflower in a Parmesan-garlic
broth. Entrees include an excellent veal Marsala; smoky pork shank with
white beans; or chicken Mario, a chicken breast perfectly seared with
butter and olive oil. If you want to keep things simple with drinks, ask for
the “Just Bring Me Wine” program, which matches a glass of wine to each
course at three price levels (the most affordable, $15, is a good deal).

Park Grill

Location, location, location — it’s what sets Park Grill apart from the other
upscale comfort-food restaurants in town. Set in the middle of Millennium
Park, Park Grill makes a great stop after a late-afternoon stroll or before a
summer concert at the Pritzker Music Pavilion (this is a popular preshow
dinner spot, so definitely make a reservation). The dining room is simple
but welcoming, with floor-to-ceiling windows along one wall that look onto
the Michigan Avenue skyline (you won’t, alas, get a view of the park). The
menu highlights American favorites, some prepared simply (pot roast,
rotisserie chicken, pork chops), and others featuring a more international
twist, such as seafood risotto or duck gnocchi.

Named for Arturo Petterino, maitre d’ at the Pump Room (see the follow-

re-creates the feeling of downtown dining in the 1940s and 1950s. In the
Goodman Theatre building, Petterino’s is a popular pre-theater option, so
book a table in advance if you have to catch a show. The dimly lit dining
room is decorated in dark wood with red leather booths, and the overall
feel is relaxed. The straightforward menu is filled with classic American

Gold Coast
AMERICAN
Chicago’s most iconic restaurant was once the bastion of stars whose
appearance in Booth One would guarantee a photo in the newspaper the
next morning. Today, the Pump Room is slightly less star-filled — but the
room has been restored to its former glory, in the original cobalt-blue-and-
gold décor. Service is provided by a well-trained crew, and the food is clas-
sic American with a sophisticated twist. Appetizers include a simple beef
tartare or a caviar plate. Entrees also provide some creative twists on old
classics, including Maine lobster with apple-tarragon purée, or lamb loin
with a mint pesto crust. There’s a live band and dancing every Friday and
Saturday night from 8 p.m. to midnight.
The Pump Room has a dress code — and it’s enforced. Men must wear

Rockit is no gourmet destination, but if you’re looking to chow down on
better-than-decent food in a high-energy setting, this place fills the bill.
One of the current hot spots for well-heeled 20- and 30-something singles,
Rockit is definitely a scene after work and on weekends, with loud music
and plenty of flirting at the busy front bar. The dining room is a trendy take
on a traditional tavern, and combines exposed-brick walls and distressed-
wood tables with sleek metallic accents and chocolate-brown leather
booths. The menu is fairly predictable, but still a few notches above your
standard bar fare. The Crispy Pork is a wonderfully tender pork medallion
with a crunchy crust.

Russian Tea Time

Loop
RUSSIAN/TEA
Russian Tea Time is a popular spot with Chicago Symphony Orchestra
patrons and musicians, and is far from being the simple tea cafe that its
name implies. This family-owned restaurant’s extensive menu is like a tour
through the cuisine of Czarist Russia and the former Soviet republics (for
Russian neophytes, all the dishes are well described). The atmosphere is
old-world and cozy, with lots of woodwork and a friendly staff. Start with
potato pancakes, blini with Russian caviar, or chilled smoked sturgeon; if
you can’t decide, consider mixed appetizer platters to share. For a sam-
pling of old Russia, try the beef stroganoff; kulebiaka (meat pie with
ground beef, cabbage, and onions); or roast pheasant served with
brandied prunes and a walnut, brandy, and pomegranate sauce.

SEAFOOD
You’d swear you stepped into a 1940s-era restaurant on the Atlantic Coast
when you enter Shaw’s. The busy dining room has a lively feel, and the
extensive menu should suit all tastes. The appetizers alone run the gamut
from popcorn shrimp and fried calamari to exotic sushi combinations.
Fresh seafood is the specialty, with fried smelt, sautéed sea scallops, and
grilled fish among the fare. The adjoining Blue Crab Lounge offers an excel-

This former Russian bathhouse has been transformed into an oasis of Zen
calm. This restaurant attracted national attention when it opened, and it
still attracts foodies. Diners step down into a dining room hidden from the
street, then sink into banquettes that zigzag across the center of the room.
The menu emphasizes seafood and Pan-Asian preparations. Appetizers
include an aromatic lemon-grass–red-curry broth with rice noodles, and
sea scallop and potato ravioli with sautéed mushrooms and truffle
essence. Most entrees are seafood based: New Zealand snapper with
lemon couscous and fennel salad is one example. Desserts tend to go the
Asian route, although the coconut brûlée with warm pineapple puts a
whole new twist on rice pudding.

LATIN AMERICAN/SUSHI
Latin American seviche combined with sushi seems an odd juxtaposition,
but it works surprisingly well at this new restaurant, which is based on a
Peruvian/Brazilian culinary tradition created when Japanese immigrants
moved there in the early 20th century. The dramatic dining room has
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 155

become a fashionable scene, and tables are scattered on different levels,
some in a sunken red “conversation pit,” others up on a balcony along one
wall. Beaded curtains hang from the ceiling and bathrooms are set in a
bamboo-filled garden. But after admiring the scenery, what will you eat?
Try one of the “samba rolls,” which combine the traditional sticky-rice-
and-seaweed wrapping with unexpected fillings. The El Topo, a mix of
salmon, jalapeño pepper, melted mozzarella, and crispy onions, is deli-
cious; also try the Samba Rio roll, with guava-glazed short ribs and sweet
pepper. More straightforward is the Surf & Turf, here interpreted as seared
rare tuna and a beef filet on a bed of carrot-and-ginger purée.

décor. The real bargain here is the wonderful (and cheap) after-work buffet
($12 all-you-can-eat with a $6 drink minimum). In the dining room, pasta

INDIAN/LATIN AMERICAN
This may seem like another unusual fusion concept, but the food is more
than just a novelty. Owner Rohini Dey and chef Maneet Chauhan — both
women, both originally from India — have found a common thread
between Indian and Latin American cooking: Both feature similar ingredients
(rice and chiles), use some of the same seasonings (cumin and coriander),
and even share similar preparations (the variety of Latin salsas is compa-
rable to different Indian chutneys). The result is a menu that mixes flavors
in new ways, yet the dishes still seem familiar, whether it’s empanadas with
mango-coconut chutney, seviche with Indian spices, or tandoori skirt steak

and affordable. The daily spread of antipasti is always worth sampling. You
can’t go wrong with the rigatoni or the roasted lamb chops, served with
sautéed garlic spinach. Pastas include a black linguine with crabmeat or a
daily homemade ravioli selection. For dessert, try the double-chocolate cake
with espresso sauce — and with this dose of caffeine, be prepared to stay

Being a tourist can really take it out of you. Sometimes all you want is to
rest your aching feet and re-energize with a quick snack. Unlike New York,
Chicago doesn’t have battalions of pushcart food vendors (thankfully —
their absence keeps the sidewalks clear and cuts down on greasy
smells). But this city does have great portable food and quick eats.
Maybe you’ve burned off your lunch more quickly than expected.
Or maybe you have only an hour to squeeze in a meal before a show.
You’re in luck: Chicago’s got what you want.

Local carnivore favorites include Italian beef and Italian sausage sand-
wiches. My favorite spot for these specialties is Mr. Beef on Orleans,
666 N. Orleans St., between Erie and Huron streets (% 312-337-8500).
This hole-in-the-wall eatery has a counter up front and seating at picnic
benches in the rear. When Jim Belushi and Jay Leno are in Chicago, they
stop by, as do local media celebs. You have two big decisions to make:
Part III: Settling into Chicago 
160

whether you want an Italian beef (juicy, thinly sliced, piled high) or an
Italian sausage (charbroiled and spicy), and whether you want toppings
of hot or sweet peppers. Each sandwich is packed into a chewy roll. If
you can’t decide, order a combo.
Another good choice is Al’s Italian Beef, with two places, at 169 W.
Ontario St. at Wells Street (% 312-943-3222) and 1079 W. Taylor St.,
between Aberdeen and Carpenter in Little Italy (% 312-226-4017).
Refreshing Italian ice
If you’re going the low-fat route (or even if you aren’t), you’ll enjoy
Mario’s Italian Lemonade in Little Italy, 1068 W. Taylor St. (no phone).
From May to late October, the stand sells refreshing Italian ice — cups of
shaved ice doused with syrup (traditional lemon flavor and a variety of
others). Tom and Wendee’s Italian Ice, 1136 W. Armitage Ave. at Clifton
Street, Lincoln Park (% 773-327-2885) sells a version made with fresh
fruit rather than syrup.
World-famous Chicago hot dogs
“Hot dogs” in Chicago mean Vienna All-Beef franks served with mustard,
green relish, chopped onion, sliced tomato, hot peppers, and celery salt.
Ketchup is another option, though purists don’t use it. Several popular
chains sell these delicious dogs. One of these is Gold Coast Dogs, 159 N.
Wabash Ave., at Randolph Street (% 312-917-1677). Gold Coast Dogs is
a place where you can grab your food and run, or join the crowd in the
restaurant. Get a Vienna hot dog and top it with the works, Chicago-style.
Finish off your meal with a thick shake in chocolate, vanilla, or straw-
berry. It’s open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Fluky’s, in the Westfield North Bridge mall at 520 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-
245-0702), is part of a local chain that has been serving great hot dogs
since the Depression. Portillo’s, 100 W. Ontario St. (% 312-587-8930), is
another local chain that specializes in hot dogs but also serves excellent
pastas and salads. Byron’s serves Vienna All-Beef hot dogs at three loca-
tions: 1017 W. Irving Park Rd. (% 773-281-7474), 1701 W. Lawrence
(% 773-271-0900), and 680 N. Halsted St. (% 312-738-0968).
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 161
Chicago treats
Deep-dish pizza may be Chicago’s culinary claim to fame, but the city has also added
to the national waistline in other ways. Twinkies and Wonder Bread were invented
here; Chicago businessman James L. Kraft created the first processed cheese; and
Oscar Mayer got his start as a butcher in the Old Town neighborhood.

Fast food with big flavors
Chicagoans in the know head for Potbelly Sandwich Works. The made-
to-order grilled sub sandwiches on warm, crusty homemade bread can
be loaded up with all sorts of meats, cheeses, and veggies. The shakes
are fantastic, too. Yes, there’s a potbellied stove inside and all sorts of
Old West–type memorabilia. From the original at 2264 N. Lincoln Ave.,
between Belden and Webster (% 773-528-1405), the franchise has
grown to ten locations, including 190 N. State St. at Lake Street in the
Loop (% 312-683-1234) and 520 N. Michigan Ave, in the Westfield North
Bridge shopping center (% 312-664-1008), which are convenient to the
Loop and the Magnificent Mile.
Also in the Loop (in the Sears Tower, to be exact) is Mrs. Levy’s
Delicatessen, a retro deli that displays signed photographs of famous
patrons. Staples such as knishes, blintzes, and soups are made daily
from scratch. Sandwiches are piled high and include such standards as
corned beef, beef brisket, and pastrami; soup choices include sweet-and-
sour cabbage, chicken matzo ball, and mushroom barley. You can find
Mrs. Levy’s on the mezzanine level of the Sears Tower, 233 S. Wacker Dr.
(% 312-993-0530).
Corner Bakery offers cafeteria-style dining and sandwiches, soups,
salads, pastas, and pizzas. (Plus, check out the bakery items — hard to
resist!) Downtown has more than a dozen locations. Two of the larger
ones are at 676 N. St. Clair at Erie Street (% 312-266-2570) and 1121 N.
State St. near Cedar Street (% 312-787-1969).
foodlife, on the mezzanine level of Water Tower Place, at 835 N.
Michigan Ave. (% 312-335-3663), takes the concept of “food court” 
to a higher level. Here you find many healthy alternatives to fast food.
A dozen or so kiosks offer everything from barbecued chicken to Asian
stir-fry, from pizza to low-fat Caesar salad. A hostess will seat you and
give you an electronic card, and then it’s up to you to stroll around and
select whatever food suits your fancy (each purchase is recorded on
your card, and you pay on the way out).
If you’re a TV fan, you’ve probably heard the phrase “Cheeborger, chee-
borger, cheep, cheep. No Coke — Pepsi,” made famous by John Belushi’s
crabby Greek counterman on the original Saturday Night Live. Chicago’s
Billy Goat Tavern, 430 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-222-1525), served as
the inspiration for Belushi’s character. The Billy Goat is a hangout for
newspaper writers from the nearby Tribune and Sun-Times buildings.
Come on down (it’s below street level) for a beer and a burger; you’ll get
a real Chicago experience.
I would be remiss in writing about Chicago if I omitted McDonald’s
(because the company headquarters is in Oak Brook). One of the chain’s
most profitable franchises, the Rock-N-Roll McDonald’s, 600 N. Clark St.
at Ohio Street (% 312-867-0455), was torn down in July 2004. A new and
improved flagship store opened there in April 2005.
Part III: Settling into Chicago

World-famous pizza
Chicago has three pizza styles: Chicago-style, also known as deep-dish,
which is thick-crusted and often demands a knife and fork; stuffed, which is
similar to a pie, with a crust on both top and bottom; and thin-crust. Many
pizzerias serve both deep-dish and thin, and some make all three kinds.
Three of Chicago’s best gourmet deep-dish restaurants are Pizzeria Uno,
29 E. Ohio St. at Wabash Avenue (% 312-321-1000); Pizzeria Due, 619 N.
Wabash Ave. at Ontario Street (% 312-943-2400); and Gino’s East (see
earlier in this chapter).
In River North, Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria, 439 N. Wells St. (% 312-828-9800),
bakes both deep-dish and thin-crust pizza and even has a low-fat-cheese
option.
Edwardo’s is a local pizza chain that serves all three varieties, but with a
wheat crust and all-natural ingredients (spinach pizza is the specialty
here); locations are in the Gold Coast at 1212 N. Dearborn St. at Division
Street (% 312-337-4490), in the South Loop at 521 S. Dearborn St. 
(% 312-939-3366), and in Lincoln Park at 2662 N. Halsted St. (% 773-
871-3400). Not far from Lincoln Park Zoo is Ranalli’s Pizzeria, Libations
& Collectibles, 1925 N. Lincoln Ave. (% 312-642-4700), with its terrific
open-air patio and extensive selection of beers.
In Wrigleyville, just off Belmont Avenue, are Leona’s Pizzeria, 3215 N.
Sheffield Ave. (% 773-327-8861), and Pat’s Pizzeria, 3114 N. Sheffield
Ave. (% 773-248-0168), both of which serve all three kinds of pizza.
Leona’s also has a location in Little Italy at 1419 W. Taylor St. (% 312-
850-2222), and Pat’s has one downtown in the Athletic Club Illinois
Center at 211 N. Stetson Ave. (% 312-946-0220).
Tea or coffee
If you’re shopping on the Magnificent Mile and feel like having an elegant
afternoon tea complete with finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, go
to the Palm Court at The Drake Hotel, 140 E. Walton Place (% 312-787-
2200), or the sunny Seasons Lounge of the Four Seasons Hotel, 120 E.
Delaware Place (% 312-280-8800). A fine afternoon tea is also served at
the Greenhouse at the Ritz-Carlton, 160 E. Pearson St. (% 312-266-1000),
in the 12th-floor lobby above the Water Tower Place mall.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Chicago 163
I scream, you scream . . .
Worth the trip is Margie’s Candies, 1960 N. Western Ave. at Armitage Avenue (% 773-
384-1035), a classic ice-cream parlor that makes its own hot fudge, butterscotch, and
caramel. The place is frozen in time; from the looks of it, in the 1940s (it has been in exis-
tence since 1921). Margie’s serves sundaes in giant dishes shaped like conch shells.

On the North Side, you can head to one of my favorite coffee shops,
Uncommon Grounds, 1214 W. Grace St. at Clark Street (% 773-929-3680),
which serves up fine breakfasts and sandwiches, plus wine and beer.
In fact, a good portion of this book was written there, so you know you
can hang out for hours without anyone bothering you!

Exploring Chicago

In this part . . . 
W
hether you want to make up your own itinerary or
follow my ready-made ones, this part helps you
peruse Chicago’s sights. I cover Chicago’s main attractions, as
well as others worth a stop if you have the time and energy.
I’ve created itineraries based on the length of your stay — what
should you do if you have one day, or two, or three? — and
special interests. And what would travel be without a little
souvenir hunting? In this part, you ﬁnd a complete guide to
shopping, from Michigan Avenue’s glittering boutiques to
unique vintage shops. Finally, I provide ﬁve day trips in case
you have the time and interest in venturing beyond Chicago.

hicago is a sophisticated city with many diverse attractions, from
museums with world-famous collections; to outstanding buildings
by internationally known architects; to miles of running and biking paths
along the lakefront; and, of course, major sports venues such as Wrigley
Field, the friendly confines of the Chicago Cubs. Best of all for visitors,
the majority of the top attractions are in or near downtown, all accessi-
ble by public transportation.
In this chapter, I describe the city’s most popular attractions. See the
map in this chapter for locations, unless noted otherwise.
Chicago’s Top Sights
Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum
Museum Campus (near the Loop)
The first planetarium in the Western Hemisphere rocketed into the new
millennium with a face-lift and an addition that wraps itself around the
1920-built planetarium like a high-tech glass visor. And high-tech it is: Your
first stop should be the Sky Pavilion, which includes four exhibition gal-
leries, including the StarRider virtual-reality theater, which propels visi-
tors on a voyage of discovery into the infinity of space. Settle down under
the massive dome, and you’ll take a half-hour interactive virtual-reality 
trip through the Milky Way and into deep space, featuring a computer-
generated 3-D graphics projection system and controls in the armrest of
each seat. Afterward, come back to Earth at the museum’s cafe, which offers
stunning views of Chicago’s skyline and a selection of salads, soups, and

close-ups of the moon, the planets, and distant galaxies through a closed-
circuit monitor connected to the planetarium’s Doane Observatory tele-
scope. Allow at least two hours at the Adler, or combine a visit with a day
at the Museum Campus (see the “Mixing fish, fossils, and outer space: The
Museum Campus” sidebar, in this chapter).

Taking advantage of free museum days
Alas, the days when every museum in town had at least one free-admission day a
week are gone. Now, the major museums only give breaks on admission during the
slowest times of the year (usually late fall and the dead of winter). Still, if you plan your
time carefully, you can save yourself some fees, especially at the city’s smaller muse-
ums. Keep in mind that you will still have to pay for special exhibitions and films on
free days.
Monday: Adler Planetarium and Field Museum of Natural History (both Sept–Feb,
except the last two weeks of Dec); Museum of Science and Industry (mid-Sept–Nov
and Jan–Feb); Shedd Aquarium (Oct–Feb, except the last two weeks of Dec;
Oceanarium admission extra)

Art Institute of Chicago
Near the Loop
Chicago’s pride and joy is a warm, welcoming museum, a world-class insti-
tution that never seems stuffy. (You can get an idea of the museum’s sense
of whimsy during the holidays when the lion sculptures that guard its
entrance sport Santa hats.) The Art Institute has several different depart-
ments, each with its own exhibition space and collection. Highlights
include well-known works such as Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the
Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat; Paris Street: Rainy Day by Gustave
Caillebotte; and two icons of American isolation, Edward Hopper’s
Nighthawks and Grant Wood’s American Gothic.
The size and scope of the Art Institute’s collections can be overwhelming.
First-timers would do well to take a Collection Highlight Tour (2 p.m. Sat,
Sun, and Tues). The tour is free and lasts about an hour, concentrating on
a few major works. A highlight tour for kids runs on some Saturdays, and
the Kraft Education Center on the lower level offers fun seek-and-find pro-
grams for children and interactive exhibits. If you’re touring on your own,
don’t miss the museum’s outstanding Impressionist art collection, with
one of the world’s largest collections of Monet paintings, and the Thorne
Miniature Rooms — 68 dollhouselike chambers that chronicle decorative
arts through the centuries. Watch for touring shows, for which reserva-
tions are usually required. Reserve at least two hours for the museum and
try to visit during off times, such as weekdays, early mornings, or late
afternoons.

Chicago ArchiCenter and Chicago Architecture 
Foundation Boat Tours
Near the Loop
Chicago calls itself the “first city of architecture,” and a quick swing
through the ArchiCenter, followed by a Chicago Architecture Foundation
(CAF) boat tour, is the best way to survey the architectural highlights. The
ArchiCenter is run by the Foundation and is across the street from the Art
Institute. Exhibits include a scale model of downtown Chicago, profiles of
the people and buildings that shaped the city’s look, and a searchable
database with pictures and information on many of Chicago’s best-known
skyscrapers. “Architecture ambassadors” are on hand to provide infor-
mation on tours run by the Foundation. The most popular tour is a one-
and-a-half-hour “Architecture River Cruise” along the north and south
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 177

branches of the Chicago River. You see 50 or so buildings, including the
Gothic 1925 Tribune Tower, designed by a New York architect who won a
contest; Marina City, home of Bob Newhart on The Bob Newhart Show (if
you remember that far back); Sears Tower; and NBC Tower, constructed in
wedding-cake style in homage to the city’s old zoning codes mandating
that sunlight must reach down to the street. Lecturers generally do a good
job of making the cruise enjoyable for visitors with all levels of architec-
tural knowledge.
The boat tours are quite popular, so buy tickets in advance through
Ticketmaster (% 312-902-1500; www.ticketmaster.com), or avoid the
service charge and buy your tickets at the ArchiCenter at 224 S. Michigan
Ave., or from the boat launch on the southeast corner of Michigan Avenue
and Wacker Drive. (Look for the blue awning.)
CAF also offers architecture tours year-round by foot and bus. For first-
time visitors, I highly recommend two tours for an excellent introduction
to the dramatic architecture of the Loop. Historic Skyscrapers (daily at
10 a.m.) covers buildings built between 1880 and 1940, including the
Rookery and the Chicago Board of Trade; Modern Skyscrapers (daily at
1 p.m.) includes modern masterpieces by Mies van der Rohe and post-
modern works by contemporary architects. The two-hour tours cost $14
each for adults and $11 each for seniors and students. Call or check the
very thorough Web site for details.

Web site, because times change.
Chicago Cultural Center
Near the Loop
The Cultural Center offers a storehouse of not-too-heavy culture and
plenty of fun — for free. Built in 1897 as the city’s library, the building
exhibits the Beaux Arts style that became popular after the 1893 World’s
Columbian Exposition on the city’s South Side. But it’s what’s inside that
will knock your socks off. Free tours guide visitors up a sweeping staircase
of white Italian marble to admire what is, for my money, the most stunning
interior in Chicago. You will see rare marble; fine hardwood; stained glass;
polished brass; and mosaics of Favrile glass, colored stone, and mother-of-
pearl inlaid in white marble. At the top of the grand staircase is a Tiffany
dome, believed to be the world’s largest. The grand setting hosts an array
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
178

of art exhibitions, concerts, films, lectures, and other events, many of them
free. A long-standing tradition is the Dame Myra Hess Memorial classical
concert every Wednesday in the Preston Bradley Hall. Allow about an hour
to visit the Cultural Center.

Chicago Fed Visitors Center
Loop
The Visitors Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is a quick 
stop-off if you’re touring the Loop. More than just the standard history-of-
banking displays, the center has kid-friendly features such as a giant cube
that holds a million dollars, and an exhibit that lets you try detecting coun-
terfeit bills. And there’s even a section that enables visitors to pretend to
wield the power of the Fed for a moment, showing how changes in inter-
est rates affect the economy. Free guided tours are offered weekdays at
1 p.m. Allow 30 minutes for the tour.

Mixing fish, fossils, and outer space: 
The Museum Campus
The Museum Campus is a 1990s creation that brings together three great Chicago
institutions — the Field Museum of Natural History, the John G. Shedd Aquarium, and
the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum. Previously divided by the northbound
lanes of Lake Shore Drive, the area was much like the center grounds of the Indy 500
racetrack — without professional drivers. Today, the road has been moved west of
Soldier Field, and you can stroll from the Field Museum to the Shedd Aquarium and
the Planetarium without fear of being struck by a speeding auto. A new pedestrian
underpass makes the campus a 15-minute walk east from the Roosevelt El stops or a
longer (but enjoyable) stroll through Grant Park and along the lakefront from the Loop.
If you’re not up for a walk, bus no. 146 runs from North Michigan Avenue and State
Street in the Loop. Parking isn’t bad because the museums have access to the lots
around Soldier Field, but be aware that no public parking is available during Chicago
Bears football games in the fall; Bears fans get first dibs on all surrounding parking
spaces. Check out www.museumcampus.org for driving directions and information
on parking and public transportation.

Field Museum of Natural History
Museum Campus (near the Loop)
For the fun of it, the Field Museum is hard to beat. Kids love it for its wide-
open spaces, giant dinos, and hands-on exhibits. Come see Sue, the largest
T. rex fossil ever unearthed, but stay to explore gleaming gems, giant
stuffed elephants, mummies, and Native American artifacts. Visitors can
climb into a life-size Egyptian tomb, step into the sun-drenched desert, and
visit an ancient Egyptian marketplace. Take time to explore the African
continent, visiting a royal Cameroon palace, witnessing some of the great
savanna wildlife, and traveling across the Sahara and back to Nigeria. You
can “travel” to America by ship and feel what it may have been like for
Africans taken against their will and sold into slavery. The museum also
has its own McDonald’s on the lower level. While you’re downstairs, plug
a dollar bill into one of the old-fashioned wax-molding machines and watch
as a red T. rex or green brontosaurus comes to life in front of your eyes.
Allow at least half a day.

Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio
Suburban Oak Park
World-famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright made his first home and studio
in Oak Park, a suburb just west of Chicago. Wright lived and worked here
for 20 of his most productive years. During this time, he experimented with
and perfected what became known as the Prairie School style of architec-
ture. His home and studio were built in 1889 as a cottage that came to house
the 22-year-old architect, his new bride, and a growing family. You can
glimpse Wright’s genius on a guided tour (the only way to see the place), as
guides show how the house became the architect’s showcase and labora-
tory. You may not agree with his controversial private life, but you have to
admire a man who became the single-most important influence on American
architecture. While you’re in Oak Park, you can check out Unity Temple,
Wright’s masterpiece for the Unitarian Church, and take a walking tour to
view the exteriors of homes throughout the neighborhood that were built
by Wright. (See Chapter 14 for a complete Oak Park itinerary.) Plan on a full
day to visit the home and studio and tour the surrounding neighborhood.

Grant Park
Near the Loop
During the summer, festivals reign in Grant Park, the Loop’s front lawn
overlooking Lake Michigan. Grant Park Music Festival, Blues Fest, Jazz
Fest, Gospel Fest, and the ever-popular Taste of Chicago food free-for-all
take place here. (For details on these festivals, see Chapter 3.) But Grant
Park also offers quieter pleasures — all of them free.
For picnic supplies, head to Corner Bakery (Chapter 10) on the corner of
Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue, across from the Art Institute.
This 319-acre swath of greenery between South Michigan Avenue and the
lakeshore is not contiguous parkland, but a patchwork of greenery dis-
sected by city streets. The northwest corner of Grant Park (bordered by
Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street) is the site of Millennium Park, a
winning combination of beautiful landscaping, elegant architecture, and
public entertainment spaces. (For more on Millennium Park, see the list-
ing later in this chapter.)
Chief among Grant Park’s charms is Buckingham Fountain — twice as 
big as the Latona Basin at Versailles, after which it was modeled. Built in
1927 of Georgia pink marble, the baroque fountain delights strollers with
a computer-orchestrated symphony of dancing water. After dark from April
through October, the fountain spurts columns of water up to 150 feet every
hour on the hour, and beginning at 4 p.m., a whirl of colored lights and dra-
matic music amps up the drama. The fountain shuts down at 11 p.m., and
concession areas and bathrooms are available on the plaza.

John G. Shedd Aquarium
Museum Campus (near the Loop)
The world’s largest indoor aquarium is a spectacular sight, especially the
Oceanarium, housed in a setting that re-creates a Pacific Northwest

More museums, less $$$
If you’re planning on visiting lots of Chicago museums, you should invest in a CityPass,
a prepaid ticket that gets you into the biggest attractions (Art Institute, Field Museum
of Natural History, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Museum of Science and
Industry, and The Hancock Observatory). The cost is $50 for adults and $39 for chil-
dren, which is about 50 percent cheaper than paying all the attractions’ individual
admission fees. You can buy a CityPass at any of these six attractions, or purchase
one online at www.citypass.net before you arrive in Chicago.

coastal environment. The wall of windows revealing Lake Michigan just
beyond the Oceanarium’s windows creates the illusion of an expanse of
sea. Don’t miss walking the winding nature trail and watch dolphins, sea
otters, and harbor seals. The most popular animals are three female
Beluga whales, cute creatures whose humped heads and natural “smiles”
make them seem human. Buying the All-Access Pass that includes the
Oceanarium is more expensive, but I highly recommend it — it’s the only
way to see the dolphin show, in which a crew of friendly trainers puts the
dolphins through their paces of leaping dives and tail walking.
Upon entering, it’s impossible to miss the 90,000-gallon circular tank hold-
ing a Caribbean coral reef in the aquarium’s central rotunda. Divers doing
the feedings describe animals and their environment via underwater
microphones. Watch for a hawksbill sea turtle named Hawkeye who has
been here for 20-plus years, and keep an eye out for the very scary moray
eel. Observe the penguin colony in an exhibit that approximates the
Falkland Islands off Argentina. Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River fea-
tures an array of piranhas, birds, sloths, insects, snakes, catfish, stingrays,
iguanas, and caimans. The newest exhibit is Wild Reef — Sharks at
Shedd, a series of 26 interconnected habitats that house a Philippine coral
reef patrolled by sharks and other predators (they even swim over your
head at certain spots). Allow at least three hours to visit.

The Hancock Observatory
Magnificent Mile
A location right on the Magnificent Mile means the John Hancock Center
offers an up-close-and-personal view of the city from its observatory on
the 94th floor. Okay, so visits to “Big John” are not as popular as the Sears
Tower Skydeck, but I think the view is more interesting and the location
can’t be beat. The view looking north over the Gold Coast and Lincoln Park
is fantastic, with the curving lakefront, beaches, and high-rises disap-
pearing in a line toward the suburbs. Looking west, you get an interesting
view of the Mag Mile, which twinkles with lights on any evening, especially
during the holidays. (The observatory doesn’t close until 11 p.m.!) On a
clear day, you can see about 65 miles and part of three states surrounding
this corner of Illinois — Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Talking tele-
scopes have sound effects and narration in four languages, history walls
illustrate the growth of the city, and the Skywalk open-air viewing deck
allows visitors to feel the rush of the wind at 1,000 feet through a “screened
porch.” A high-speed elevator whisks passengers to the observatory in
40 seconds — kids love the ride. Allow one hour.
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
182

The Signature Room at the 95th floor, a sleek restaurant with adjoining
lounge, allows you to take in views with a drink in hand. (Ladies, make sure
to visit the restroom — it has the best view in the restaurant.) If the line
for the observatory is too long, head here. You’ll pay the cost of a drink
rather than admission — about the same price.

Lakefront
Walk, run, bike, skate, or just sit and watch the world go by at Chicago’s
lakefront, the city’s number-one free attraction, lined with paths and
beaches. The best-known is Oak Street Beach, the location of which at the
northern tip of the Magnificent Mile creates some interesting sights as sun
worshippers wearing flip-flops and carrying coolers make their way up
Michigan Avenue. For some seclusion, try Ohio Street Beach, an intimate
sliver of sand in Olive Park, just north of Navy Pier. With buoys marking a
1-mile course, Ohio Street Beach is also the place for serious open-water
swimming (see “Especially for active types,” later in this chapter). Beaches
are officially open and staffed by lifeguards from Memorial Day to Labor
Day until 9:30 p.m. Contact the Chicago Park District (% 312-742-7529)
for more information on the beaches.
To rent bikes or skates, go to Bike Chicago (p. 194) at North Avenue Beach,
Millennium Park, or Navy Pier.
The most popular beach in Chicago is North Avenue Beach, about 6 blocks
north of Oak Street, a volleyball hot spot that features a landmark steamship-
shaped beach that’s home to an outdoor gym. This is where Lincoln Park sin-
gles come to play, check each other out, and fly by on bikes and in-line skates.
Because Lake Shore Drive runs between the lake and the city, access to
the lakefront is somewhat limited. Near the Magnificent Mile, you find
pedestrian tunnels to the lakefront at the corner of Oak Street and
Michigan Avenue, at Chicago Avenue and Lake Shore Drive, and at Grand
Avenue and Lake Shore Drive near Navy Pier. On the near North Side, you
find access under and over Lake Shore Drive at North Avenue, from Lincoln
Park Zoo, and at Fullerton Avenue.
See map p. 174. CTA: To Oak Street Beach, Red Line to Division, then walk east to the
lake; to Oak Street and North Avenue beaches, bus no. 151 along Lake Shore Drive;

Lincoln Park and Lincoln Park Zoo
Lincoln Park
Lincoln Park is the city’s largest park. Straight and narrow, it begins at
North Avenue and follows the shoreline of Lake Michigan for several miles.
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 183

Within its 1,200 acres are bathing beaches (see the previous listing for the
lakefront); the Chicago Historical Society (see “Especially for serious
museum buffs”); the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum (see “Especially
for kids,” later in this chapter); the Lincoln Park Conservancy with its gar-
dens; a driving range, golf course, and tennis courts near Diversey
Avenue; and miles of walking and running paths.
The park’s free Lincoln Park Zoo, 2001 N. Clark St. (% 312-742-2000;
www.lpzoo.com), is convenient, compact (35 acres), and charming. The
nation’s oldest, founded in 1868, the zoo is home to more than 200 species.
A favorite exhibit is the Regenstein African Journey, a series of linked
indoor and outdoor habitats that’s home to elephants, giraffes, rhinos, and
other large mammals; glass-enclosed tanks allow visitors to go face-to-face
with swimming pygmy hippos and (not for the faint of heart) a rocky ledge
filled with Madagascar hissing cockroaches. Your second stop should be
the Regenstein Center for African Apes, which was rebuilt in 2004.
Lincoln Park Zoo has had remarkable success breeding gorillas and chim-
panzees, and watching these ape families interact can be mesmerizing
(and touching). One caveat: I’ve found the building incredibly noisy
during weekend visits, so be prepared. Another popular spot is the Sea
Lion Pool, in the center of the zoo and home to harbor seals, gray seals,
and California sea lions. An underwater viewing area spans 70 feet. Look
for seasonal events, such as caroling to the animals in December and con-
certs in summer, when you can stroll among the great cats with a glass of
chardonnay in hand. The zoo grounds are open most days from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. On weekends and holidays between Memorial Day and Labor Day,
the hours are from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. In the winter, hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(The zoo buildings and farm are open slightly later and close slightly ear-
lier than the grounds each day.) Parking is $12 a day in an on-site lot. Allow
two to three hours.
When hunger strikes, head to Cafe Brauer, 2021 Stockton Dr. near
Armitage Avenue in the park (% 312-742-2400). Here you find fast food
and an ice-cream parlor, plus paddleboat rentals at the edge of the South
Pond. For more upscale dining, try the North Pond Café, 2610 Cannon Dr.,
south of Diversey Parkway in the park (% 773-477-5845), serving
American cuisine in a Prairie School–style setting.
See map p. 174. Lincoln Park runs from North Avenue to Ardmore Avenue along the
lakefront. CTA: Bus no. 151 runs the length of the park.
Millennium Park
At the north end of Grant Park along Michigan Avenue is the city’s newest
urban showpiece, and many of its attractions have already come to sym-
bolize the city. The architectural highlight is the Frank Gehry–designed
Pritzker Music Pavilion, home of the free summer music concerts by the
Grant Park Symphony Orchestra. Another popular attraction is the huge
elliptical sculpture by British artist Anish Kapoor, officially named
Cloudgate, which is his first public work in the United States. But you’ll
soon be affectionately calling it the “Bean” like most Chicagoans. I dare
you to stand with your toes in the water at the Crown Fountain, surveying
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
184

the spectacular cityscape of South Michigan Avenue, and not feel an irre-
pressible urge to uproot your family and move into a condo in downtown
Chicago. The park is a great success and an example of what a modern
park can be.
Compare Millennium Park’s interactive fountain with the grande dame of
Chicago fountains, Buckingham Fountain (just south in Grant Park), which
is lovely but untouchable. Even the sculpture is interactive — the “Bean”
by Anish Kapoor is essentially a gigantic 3-D mirror. Kids and adults are
attracted to its reflective surface and house-of-mirrors qualities. The
Crown Fountain is another favorite, with its two 50-foot glass-brick towers,
facing each other across a black-granite plaza, with water cascading down
their sides. Faces of Chicagoans are projected through the glass blocks
and change at regular intervals — and watch out, because water spews
from their mouths when you least expect it. The Jay Pritzker Pavilion, with
its bandshell, is a sight to behold, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge, also
designed by Gehry, curves and winds its way over Columbus Drive, pro-
viding changing views of the cityscape as you walk. Gardens of native
plants are beginning to flourish, and by the next edition of this book, you’ll
surely feel as though you’re walking through a Midwestern prairie as you
stroll the Lurie Garden, with 250 varieties of native perennial plants. All in
all, this is a must-see, must-experience park.
You can lunch at the Park Grill (% 312-521-7275; www.parkgrill
chicago.com; open daily 11 a.m.–10:30 p.m.), overlooking the McCormick
Tribune Plaza ice-skating rink. Next door to the grill, Park Café offers take-
out salads and sandwiches. Parking is easy, in underground lots at the bar-
gain rate of $12, the best deal in the city.

Free lunchtime entertainment 
under the Picasso
While you’re in the Loop, stop by the Picasso sculpture in Daley Plaza at the Richard J.
Daley Center any weekday at noon for a free show. Offerings include music, dance, and
other performing arts, and are popular with Loop workers, who often come with their
brown-bag lunches. As the days grow colder, performances move indoors to the lobby.
Daley Center is between North Dearborn, North Clark, West Randolph, and West
Washington streets. For “Under the Picasso” information, call % 312-346-3278, the
Department of Cultural Affairs cultural programming hot line. To get to Daley Plaza,
take the Brown, Green, Orange, or Purple line to Clark, and then walk 1 block south on
Clark and 1⁄2 block east on Randolph. Or take bus no. 22, 24, or 42 to the corner of
Randolph and Clark streets.

Museum of Science and Industry
Hyde Park
Don’t miss Chicago’s fabulous granddaddy of all interactive museums.
There is no more eerie or thrilling exhibit in Chicago than the U-505, the
captured World War II U-boat. You can relive its capture during a dramatic
(and claustrophobic) sound-and-lights tour. Or, ride a retired 727 United
Air Lines jetliner. Perhaps you’d like to travel deep into a replica of a
Southern Illinois coal mine? Or concentrate on the story of space explo-
ration at the Henry Crown Space Center? Children are entranced by
Colleen Moore’s Fairy Castle, a lavishly decorated miniature palace.
Younger children (up to age 10) enjoy the Idea Factory, where they can
explore scientific principles. A massive model train exhibit called The
Great Train Story and All Aboard the Silver Streak, a refurbished
Burlington Pioneer Zephyr train with onboard interactive exhibits, should
please most kids. And don’t miss The Farm, where kids can sit in a John
Deere combine, and the chick hatchery within the exhibit Genetics:
Decoding Life. This huge museum (there are 2,000 exhibits!) is so full of
wonders that you may not know where to start. One thing is for sure: You
can easily spend a day here, especially if you’re going to catch a movie at
the OMNIMAX Theater, for which you may need advance tickets. When
hunger strikes, you can head to the museum’s impressive “food court,”
which has tons of (surprisingly!) healthy and delicious options.

Navy Pier
East of Streeterville
Jutting three-quarters of a mile into Lake Michigan, Navy Pier was built in
1916 as a shipping and recreational facility. Today, with its 50 acres of
parks, gardens, shops, restaurants, and attractions, it’s Chicago’s number-
one tourist attraction — and rightfully so: This is the best place for dining
outside or strolling along the water and taking in views of the city.
Kids love the IMAX Theater (% 312-595-5629); the small ice-skating rink;
and the mammoth Ferris wheel, with cars that look like red french-fry
boxes (the sponsor is McDonald’s). The wonderful Chicago Children’s
Museum (% 312-527-1000; www.chichildrensmuseum.org) has areas for
preschoolers as well as for older children, and several permanent exhibits
that allow kids a maximum of hands-on fun.
The pier also hosts art shows, outdoor sculpture exhibits, and more. Plus,
the Chicago Shakespeare Theater (Chapter 15) makes its home here, and
several boat tours — from speedboats to tall ships — depart from the
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
186

pier’s south side (see “Seeing Chicago by Guided Tour,” later in this chap-
ter). Summer is one long party, with fireworks Wednesday and Saturday
evenings.
The pier has nine restaurants and a food court. Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.
(% 312-252-4867) re-creates the down-home atmosphere of the movie
Forrest Gump. A more elegant alternative is RIVA (% 312-644-7482), spe-
cializing in fresh seafood, steaks, and pasta, and which has a fabulous view
of Chicago’s skyline.
The pier has its downside, including massive weekend crowds and limited
parking. Try to come during the week or on Sunday. (Sat can be a zoo.) To
avoid the parking issue, take the free trolley service between Navy Pier
and State Street along Grand Avenue and Illinois Street. Trolley hours are
Sunday to Thursday 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 10 a.m. to midnight, and
Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Trolleys run about every 20 minutes; look for

Oprah Winfrey Show
Randolph Street Market District
Are you in touch with your spirit? If not, you’d better hightail it over to the
Harpo Studios for Oprah. With a little persistence, you, too, can be a part
of the show. Considered the world’s largest cult by detractors, and must-
see television by followers, the show is taped Tuesday through Thursday
at 8 a.m. and noon. You can get tickets by calling % 312-591-9222 (per-
sistence required!). Call at least four weeks in advance. Even if you don’t
love Oprah, watching her producers work like a well-oiled machine and
seeing Oprah turn on the charm when the cameras roll gives you insight
into how television works. The studio is small and intimate, and Oprah
answers questions and talks with the audience during commercial breaks.
After the show, head over to Wishbone (Chapter 10), a Harpo Studios
favorite hangout, for Southern-style cooking.

Sears Tower Skydeck
Loop
The view from the skydeck of the Sears Tower is a good way to orient your-
self to the city and beyond, because it provides a panorama of Chicago
and the Midwest. On a clear day, you can see up to 50 miles and four states
(including Illinois). Visitors rocket to the top in a high-speed elevator that
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 187

goes from ground to the 103rd floor in 70 seconds. Built in 1973 and long
the world’s tallest building, the Sears Tower had to surrender its title to a
building in Malaysia with longer decorative spires. (The Sears Tower has
since put up a 22-foot antenna in an attempt to win back the title). Allow
one to two hours, depending on the length of the line (arrive in the late
afternoon to avoid the worst of the crowds).
I think you get a better view of Chicago at The Hancock Observatory (see
listing earlier in this chapter), which overlooks more interesting neigh-
borhoods and architecture and is more centrally located — the Sears
Tower sits in the west Loop, which becomes a dead zone on weekends.

Wrigley Field
Wrigleyville
Nothing makes you feel more optimistic than Opening Day at Wrigley Field.
Sure, you may be wearing long underwear and earmuffs, but that doesn’t
deter Cubs fans, for whom hope springs eternal. Wrigley Field is an almost-
perfect ballpark, from its ivy-covered outfield walls to the hand-operated
scoreboard. If you attend a day game and buy a hot dog, a beer, and a box
of Crackerjacks, the whole afternoon runs about $50 a person. Because
Wrigley is small, just about every seat is decent, but the coveted outfield
seats get more sun — significant if a tan is more important to you than the
game. Call in advance for tickets; although the Cubs lose plenty of games
every year, tickets can be difficult to get.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
Beyond the city’s major attractions, Chicago has plenty to offer visitors
with special interests — whether you’re an architecture buff or you have
kids in tow. The following suggestions should give you some ideas.
Especially for kids
Chicago offers loads of activities for pint-size and teenage tourists.
For the major attractions with kid appeal — Adler Planetarium &
Astronomy Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Field Museum of Natural
History, John G. Shedd Aquarium, The Hancock Observatory, Lincoln
Park and Lincoln Park Zoo, Museum of Science and Industry, Navy Pier,
and Sears Tower — see “Chicago’s Top Sights,” earlier in this chapter.

Brookfield Zoo
Suburban Brookfield
The Chicago area’s largest zoo is spread over 216 acres with 2,700 animals
in residence. Observe giraffes, snow leopards, Siberian tigers, green sea tur-
tles, baboons, and more. Start out at Habitat Africa!, a multiple-ecosystem
exhibit, almost 30 acres in size (about the size of the entire Lincoln Park
Zoo!). All the animals live in naturalistic environments that allow them to
live side-by-side with other inhabitants of their regions. And definitely
check out Tropic World, where you hang out at treetop level with mon-
keys, and Australia House, where fruit bats flit around your head. The
Living Coast explores the west coast of Chile and Peru, and includes every-
thing from a tank of plate-size moon jellies to a rocky shore where
Humboldt penguins swim and nest as Inca terns and gray gulls fly freely
overhead. The Swamp re-creates the bioregions of a southern cypress
swamp and an Illinois river scene and discusses what people can do to
protect wetlands. The dolphins at the Seven Seas Panorama put on an
amazing show that has been a Brookfield Zoo fixture for years. If you go on
a weekend, buy tickets to the dolphin show at least a couple of hours
before the one you plan to attend, because they tend to sell out quickly.
The Hamill Family Play Zoo is a wonderful stop for kids. They not only get
to pet animals but can also build habitats, learn how to plant a garden, and
even play animal dress-up. The only catch: the separate admission fee
($3.50 adults, $2.50 children). Allow three hours.

Six Flags Great America
Suburban Gurnee
If your kids have thrill-seeking personalities, head for this major theme/
amusement park in the northern suburbs, about a 45-minute drive from
Chicago. The park has more than 100 rides and attractions and is a favorite
with roller-coaster fans. There are ten roller coasters, including Déjà Vu,
where riders fly forward and backward over a twisting, looping, inverted
steel track, and Superman, where you speed along hanging headfirst. Other
don’t-miss rides include the Iron Wolf, where you do corkscrew turns and
360-degree loops while standing up, and the American Eagle, a classic
wooden coaster. Teenagers have a ball here, but so do little ones: The
Looney Tunes National Park is full of kiddie rides with cartoon themes. Six
Flags also has live shows, IMAX movies, and restaurants. If you take the
trouble to get here, allow a full day. If you’re without a car, you can get there
by Metrarail, which offers day trips to Six Flags from May to October, leav-

Chicago has so many great buildings — by such notable architects as
Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe —
that architecture buffs will be in heaven.

Auditorium Building and Theatre
Loop
A truly grand theater with landmark status, the Auditorium is worth a visit
to experience late-19th-century Chicago opulence. Designed and built in
1889 by Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, the Auditorium was a wonder
of the world: the heaviest (110,000 tons) and most massive modern edi-
fice on earth, the most fireproof building constructed, and the tallest in
Chicago. It was also the first large-scale building to be electrically lighted,
and its theater was the first in the country to install air-conditioning.
Today, the 4,000-seat auditorium is a venue for touring Broadway shows,
and the office building is the home of Roosevelt University. Tours are avail-
able on Mondays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. but must be arranged in advance;
call ahead to book your place.

Charnley-Persky House
Gold Coast
Architecture junkies may want to visit this modest Gold Coast mansion,
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1891 while he was working in the office
of Louis Sullivan. Elements of the design can be traced to both architects —
Sullivan’s famous organic ornamentation decorates the fireplaces while the
layout around the home’s hearth is pure Wright. A stop here makes a nice
highlight to a walking tour of the surrounding neighborhood. Visits to the
house, now the home of the Society of Architectural Historians, are by
guided tour only; enter the house by the south gate. Tours last approxi-
mately 45 minutes.

Glessner House
South of the Loop
Prairie Avenue, south of the Loop, was the city’s first “Gold Coast,” and its
most famous address is Glessner House, a must-see for anyone interested
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 191

in architectural history. The only surviving Chicago building designed by
Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson, the house represented a dra-
matic shift from Victorian architecture upon its completion in 1886. The
granite exterior gives the home a forbidding air, but step inside and you
discover a welcoming, cozy retreat filled with Arts and Crafts furnishings.
Visits to the house are by guided tour only, and are first-come, first-served,
unless you have a group of ten or more. They can be combined with tours
of the nearby Clarke House Museum, a Greek Revival home that’s the
oldest surviving house in the city.

take place at noon, 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. Closed major holidays.
Water Tower
Magnificent Mile
One of Chicago’s best-known landmarks dominates the Magnificent Mile
like a gleaming fairy-tale castle. However, its original purpose is decidedly
un-fairy-tale-like. The tower was designed to conceal an ugly, 138-foot-high
standpipe used in connection with pumping water from Lake Michigan.
Many thought the structure itself even more unsightly — Oscar Wilde
described it as “a castellated monstrosity with pepper boxes stuck all over
it.” But Chicagoans have come to be proud of their talisman, one of the
few buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1871. (Its companion pumping
station, across the street, was another.) Today, the tower houses City
Gallery, an art gallery, and the tower has been spruced up and is sur-
rounded by lawns and park benches. Lights illuminate the tower at night,
and street musicians often play in the surrounding park.

Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.
Wicker Park
If you hit just one outlying neighborhood, Wicker Park, with its Victorian
homes and 19th-century buildings first built by Polish immigrants, is the
place to go. Not long ago, this was a tough neighborhood whose “mean
streets” served as a model for author Nelson Algren in novels such as The
Man With the Golden Arm. Wicker Park is now being gentrified — its many
large homes are being remodeled, and restaurants and boutiques are open-
ing. Chicago Neighborhood Tours (% 312-742-1190; www.chgocity
tours.com) offers an excursion that explores Wicker Park. Sights include
art galleries, the distinctive Flatiron Building, 1569–79 N. Milwaukee Ave.
at North Avenue, an office building designed in 1929 by Holabird & Root
that now houses galleries and artist studios. The tour also passes Holy
Trinity Russian Orthodox Cathedral, 1121 N. Leavitt St., designed in 1899
by Louis Sullivan and constructed with a donation from Czar Nicholas II.
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
192

Strong evidence remains of Wicker Park’s Polish past and present.
Coexisting with coffee bars and galleries are the shops, eateries, and
churches that serve the Polish community. Many Poles still live in Wicker
Park — sometimes called Chicago’s “Ethnic Gold Coast.” The Polish
Museum of America, 984 N. Milwaukee Ave. (% 773-384-3352), features an
exhibit about Ignacy Jan Paderewsky, a Polish Renaissance Man who was
a pianist, composer, and prime minister of Poland.
See map p. 174. Bordered by John F. Kennedy Expressway and Western, Chicago,
and Fullerton avenues. CTA: Blue Line to Damen or Division or bus no. 56, 70, or 72
along Milwaukee Avenue.
Especially for romantics
Don’t be fooled by the sports-town image: Chicago can be just as roman-
tic as the next city. When the stars rise on a warm summer evening, few
cities can match its seductive lake breezes and city lights.
You can always go to a high-end restaurant for a romantic setting, but
why not try something more creative? Here are some of my favorites:
 On a starry night, head to Navy Pier (p. 186), where you can take a
spin on the Ferris wheel or just stroll along the water and gaze at
the city’s lights.
 Pack up your picnic supplies and candelabra for a classy night under
the stars at the Ravinia Festival (Chapter 15) in Highland Park.
 You can enjoy the moon, music, and munchies closer to downtown
during free concerts in Millennium Park’s Pritzer Bandshell by the
Grant Park Symphony and Chorus (Chapter 15).
 What could be more romantic than spending the day on a sailboat?
You can rent a boat from the Chicago Sailing Club in Belmont
Harbor (see the next section for details).
 The McKinlock Court Garden Restaurant (% 312-443-3600), tucked
away in the center of the Art Institute of Chicago (see listing in this
chapter), is the spot for free jazz — as well as good quiche, wine,
cheesecake, and cappuccino. The outdoor cafe surrounds the
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 193
Taking love to new heights
Navy Pier’s 148-foot-high Ferris wheel, which opened in 1995, quickly became a
Chicago landmark. The ride was modeled after the first Ferris wheel, built for Chicago’s
1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. Only weeks after the new Ferris wheel opened, a
man and woman were married on it. You don’t have to get married to enjoy the ride: A
seven-and-a-half-minute ride costs $5 (bride or groom not included), and the views
are spectacular.

soothing Triton fountain. On Tuesday evenings during warm-
weather months, jazz aficionados sit outside among the flowers
and trees and listen to live music. Museum admission is free on
Tuesdays; the restaurant has an $8-per-person minimum.
Especially for active types
From biking to climbing to skating, Chicago presents loads of opportuni-
ties for indoor and outdoor adventures. If you’re traveling with a
teenager, one of these activities may be just the thing to combat teen
boredom — no doubt the result of too many hours spent touring muse-
ums with the family.
 Biking: Chicago boasts 18 miles of paved lakefront paths. Bike
Chicago rents bicycles daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. from May though
October at Navy Pier (% 312-595-9600) and North Avenue Beach
(% 773-327-2706), and year-round at Millennium Park (% 888-245-
3929). It stocks everything from mountain and touring bikes to
kids’ bikes, strollers, and quadcycles (four-wheeled vehicles with a
steering wheel and canopy). Rates start at $8.75 an hour, or $34 a
day, with helmets, pads, and locks included. If you’d like to cycle
your way past some Chicago landmarks, guided tours are also
available.
Both the Chicago Park District (% 312-742-7529) and the
Chicagoland Bicycle Federation (% 312-427-3325; www.chibike
fed.org) offer free maps that detail biking routes. The latter, which
is the preeminent organization for cyclists in Chicago, sells a much
larger map for $6.95 that details extensive routes within a seven-
county area.
 Climbing: Waiting to challenge climbers at the Lakeshore Athletic
Club, 211 N. Stetson, 1 block east of North Michigan Avenue at Lake
Street (% 312-616-9000), is “Mount Chicago,” billed as the “world’s
highest indoor climbing wall.” Rising 110 feet, the man-made wall
offers a climbing adventure even to those who lack previous experi-
ence. Climbers must take an orientation and safety class and wear a
protective body harness. The cost is $35 for first-time climbers;
return visitors pay $20.
 Fishing: Want to do battle with a Coho salmon, or tie into a tackle-
testing, arm-aching, 20-plus-pound Chinook? Salmon fishing has
been big on Lake Michigan since Pacific species were introduced 
in the 1970s. The Chicago Sportfishing Association (% 312-922-
1100) can help you find a charter in Burnham Harbor and Diversey
Harbor, most of which cost about $395 for five hours.
 Golfing: To warm up your swing in the spring, head to The Green
at Grant Park (% 312-642-7888; www.thegreenonline.com), 
an 18-hole putting course on Monroe Street between Columbus
Avenue and Lake Shore Drive, just east of Millennium Park. It’s not
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
194

exactly tournament-level play, but it’s more challenging than minia-
ture golf, and the setting can’t be beat. The course is open daily
from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., and putters and golf balls are provided.
Rates are $9 per round for adults, $6 for children under 13. Another
option is the Diversey Driving Range, 141 W. Diversey Pkwy. 
(% 312-742-7929), in Lincoln Park just north of Diversey Harbor.
This two-level range attracts all levels, and the price is certainly
right — $11 for a bucket of 100 balls. The Chicago Park District runs
six golf courses in the city; one of the most popular is the nine-hole
Sydney Marovitz Course, 3600 N. Lake Shore Dr., at Waveland
Avenue; many Chicagoans refer to it simply as Waveland. Thanks to
its picturesque lakefront location, it’s always full on the weekends,
so make a reservation well in advance. This course and other city-
run courses are open mid-April through November. For information
on greens fees, locations, and hours, contact the Chicago Park
District golf office (% 312-245-0909; www.cpdgolf.com).
 Ice-skating: Whether you’re a graceful glider or merely a stumbler,
you can ice-skate (weather permitting) in the heart of Chicago’s
Loop at McCormick-Tribune Ice Rink, 55 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-
742-5222). Located in Millennium Park on the north end of Grant
Park, the 16,000-square-foot rink is open from November through
March. Admission is free, and skate rentals cost $5. There’s also a rel-
atively small rink at Navy Pier, 600 E. Grand Ave. (% 312-595-7437).
 Sailing: The Chicago Sailing Club in Belmont Harbor (% 773-871-
7245; www.chicagosailingclub.com) rents J-22 and J-30 boats
from 9 a.m. to sunset, weather permitting, May through October. A
J-22 holds four adults, and a J-30 accommodates six. Rates range
from $35 to $90 an hour or from $305 to $520 a day, depending on
boat size. The services of a skipper are extra; if you choose not to
hire a skipper, you must prove your sailing skills (a small evalua-
tion fee is charged). If you’d rather sit back and relax, you can char-
ter a boat. Reservations are essential.
 Swimming: The lakefront is open for swimming until 9:30 p.m. from
Memorial Day to Labor Day in areas watched over by lifeguards (no
swimming off the rocks, please). A good place to swim is Ohio
Street Beach, located near Navy Pier. The Chicago Triathlon Club
marks a course here each summer with a buoy at both the 1⁄4- and 
1⁄2-mile marks. This popular swimming route follows the shoreline in
a straight line and is fairly shallow. For more information, contact
the Chicago Park District (% 312-742-7529; www.chicagopark
district.com).
 Walking or running: The paved lakefront path is perfect for walk-
ing or running. See the “Walking in Chicago” sidebar in this chapter
for my recommended route.
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 195

Especially for sports fans
Chicago’s pro sports teams have their share of ups and downs, but fans
are insanely loyal — witness the Chicago Cubs, who haven’t played in a
World Series since 1945 but sell out many games. Until that wonderful
2005 World Series win, the White Sox had been excluded from baseball’s
fall classic since 1959. Not since the glory days of 1961 have the
Blackhawks hoisted hockey’s Stanley Cup. The Bears won their one and
only Super Bowl after the 1985–1986 season — but things are looking up;
though they didn’t win it, Da Bears won the 2006 NFC Championship and
went to the Super Bowl (where they lost to the Indianapolis Colts). The
Bulls were the exception. During the Jordan years, they took six NBA
championships. With Michael gone, the Bulls lagged at the bottom of the
league, and now as a young team, they are becoming more exciting to
watch. And new to the pro-sports scene in Chicago are the WNBA’s
Chicago Sky, an expansion team that brings the best of women’s pro
hoops to town in their summer season.
Tickets are generally available for most teams, although Bears tickets
can be tough to get, and tickets for weekend and night Cubs games.
What follows is a guide to Chicago’s professional sports teams:
 Chicago Bears: Soldier Field, Lake Shore Drive and 16th Street

sic colonnade was retained in a recent renovation, but football fans

Walking in Chicago
Chicago is a great city for stretching your legs. If you stay downtown, take a stroll
along Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to the Chicago River. Although the walk can
be enjoyable at any hour, I recommend the morning, before the crowds descend.
If the day is pleasant and you have a bit more energy, head to the lakefront path, a
popular destination for locals. You can access the lakefront at the intersection of Oak
Street and Michigan Avenue. (If it’s daytime and busy in the area, use the pedestrian
tunnel. Do not use the tunnel at night or very early in the morning.) After you’re on the
lakefront path at Oak Street Beach, head south. You’ll go around a bend and see two
stunning glass apartment buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe to your right. Keep
heading south. You may see swimmers (in wet suits during much of the year) swimming
alongside you in the water. When you reach the black Lakefront Tower (the only high-
rise to the east of Lake Shore Drive), head east to Navy Pier. Walk or run along the
south side of the pier all the way to the end and back. You can return to Michigan
Avenue along the same route or use the pedestrian underpass beneath Lake Shore
Drive at Chicago Avenue. (Again, don’t use the underpass at night or very early in the
morning.) After you emerge from the tunnel, walk due west to Michigan Avenue. Navy
Pier is 3⁄4 mile in length. The run (or walk) from Oak Street adds just over 2 miles.

will recognize little else. A giant addition looks like a spaceship was
crammed awkwardly on top of the venerable old stadium. But the
“Monsters of the Midway” will continue to battle wind, snow, and
fog, in addition to their opponents — the revamped stadium still
doesn’t have a dome. For Bears tickets, which cost from $45 to
$300, call % 847-295-6600. Bus no. 146 travels to the stadium.
 Chicago Blackhawks: The Chicago Blackhawks (www.chicago
blackhawks.com) have a devoted, passionate following of fans
who work themselves into a frenzy with the first note of “The Star-
Spangled Banner.” The ’Hawks play at the United Center, 1901 W.
Madison St., west of the Loop, which they share with the Chicago
Bulls. For hockey tickets ($15–$100), call Ticketmaster at 
% 312-559-1212.
 Chicago Bulls: The Bulls play at the United Center, 1901 W. Madison
St., a facility that they share with the Blackhawks. The life-size
bronze statue of Michael Jordan at the stadium entrance pretty
much sums up the recent success of pro sports in Chicago. For Bulls
tickets ($10–$85), go to the Web site www.nba.com/bulls or call the
United Center (% 312-455-4500; www.chicagosports.com). Bus
no. 20 travels from the Loop to the United Center.
 Chicago Cubs: See listing for Wrigley Field earlier this chapter.
 Chicago Sky: Chicago’s WNBA team (www.wnba.com/sky) made its
debut in 2006, at 6,500-seat Pavilion on the University of Chicago 
at Illinois campus (known to locals as the UIC Pavilion), at 525 S.
Racine. The season starts in May, and there are 17 home games,
usually starting at 7 p.m. Don’t miss the energetic cheering by the
Sky Dance Crew, an all-youth dance squad that gets the crowd
moving. The Sky is one of seven teams in the WNBA’s Eastern
Conference, and tickets begin at a reasonable $13, and range up to
$225 for club seating. The 2007 season is the start of the league’s
11th year. For tickets, call % 877-329-9622.
 Chicago White Sox: This South Side baseball club has a reputation
for attracting “blue-collar” fans (compared to the Cubs’ “white-
collar” supporters). The toughest ticket in town is the Sox-Cubs
match-up. The White Sox (% 312-674-1000; www.whitesox.mlb.
com) play in U.S. Cellular Field (formerly called Comiskey Park),
333 W. 35th St. For Sox tickets ($12–$45), call Ticketmaster at 
% 866-769-4263 or visit the park’s box office. To get to the ballpark
by the El, take the Red Line to Sox/35th Street.
Especially for serious museum buffs
After you hit the major Chicago institutions — the Art Institute of
Chicago, the Museum of Science and Industry, and the offerings of the
Museum Campus (see “Chicago’s Top Sights,” earlier in this chapter for
details on these) — museum fans still have more options.
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 197

Chicago History Museum
Lincoln Park
At the southwestern tip of Lincoln Park is one of the city’s oldest cultural
institutions (founded in 1856), but it has reinvented itself for the 21st cen-
tury. Completely gutted and rebuilt in 2006, the new museum immerses
visitors in interactive experiences and surrounds them with priceless arti-
facts. Galleries include a re-creation of an 1890s El station (complete with
the city’s first elevated train); an exhibit on “Chicago in Crisis” (covering
everything from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 to the 1968 Democratic
National Convention riots); and a section on Illinois’s most famous native
son, Abraham Lincoln (including his presidential carriage). Though you’ll
find the computer stations and multimedia presentations that are the hall-
mark of modern museums, it’s not all high-tech; one of my favorite exhibits
is made up of decidedly low-tech dioramas of historical scenes, where you
can trace the city’s progression from a few cabins to the grand World’s
Columbian Exposition of 1893. Another must-see is the Costume and
Textile Gallery, which showcases pieces from the museum’s collection 
of historical clothing, including Michael Jordan’s basketball uniform,
dresses made by 19th-century immigrants, and gowns by French designer
Christian Dior. In a move to attract more families, there’s also an interac-
tive gallery just for kids.
The History Museum presents a wide range of lectures, seminars, and
tours, including walking tours of the surrounding neighborhood; check the
museum’s Web site for details, because the schedules change frequently.

DuSable Museum of African-American History
South Side
The pride and the pain of African-Americans is chronicled in the museum
named for Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, born of a French father and a black
mother. The affluent, well-educated du Sable became Chicago’s first per-
manent settler when he established a trading post in 1779. Exhibits portray
the degradation and cruelty of slavery and the hope of the civil rights
movement. Offering a mix of art and history, the museum displays works
by African-American artists and celebrates African-Americans in the armed
forces. It also documents lynchings, Ku Klux Klan activities, and demean-
ing products.

Museum of Contemporary Art
Magnificent Mile
Billed as the nation’s largest contemporary-art museum, the MCA is set
between the lake and the Water Tower on a piece of prime real estate,
although the building feels a bit inaccessible, with a daunting set of stairs
leading to the entrance. The interior, however, is light and vibrant. The
museum highlights works dating back to 1945, including work by
Alexander Calder, Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, and Bruce Nauman — plus
Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons. You may want to take the free daily tour or
rent an audio tour for insights into the often-challenging exhibits. In addi-
tion to a range of activities and educational programming, including films,
performances, and a lecture series in a 300-seat theater, the museum fea-
tures Puck’s at the MCA, a cafe operated by Wolfgang Puck of Spago
restaurant fame, with seating that overlooks a 1-acre terraced sculpture
garden. The store, Culturecounter, with one-of-a-kind gift items, is worth
a stop. The museum’s First Fridays program, featuring after-hours per-
formances, live music, and food and drink, takes place on (yes!) the first
Friday of every month. Allow one to two hours.

Oriental Institute Museum
Hyde Park
Don’t be misled by the name, which predates the term Middle East. At this
location at the midpoint of the University of Chicago campus, you’ll find
mummies, Persian kings’ gold jewelry, a fragment of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
and Tutankhamen’s tomb. This user-friendly, free museum contains one of
the world’s largest collections of Near Eastern art, including a massive
statue of the boy-king, Tutankhamen. The museum is divided into the
Egyptian Gallery, Mesopotamian Gallery, and Persian Gallery. So if you’re
interested in Ancient Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and other
Middle Eastern countries, come here to discover amazing artifacts — and

Chicago Public Library/Harold Washington Library Center
Loop
Chicago’s first African-American mayor was a charismatic leader, and this
handsome library is a fitting tribute. A permanent exhibition chronicles
the life of the mayor, who died in 1987. The political memorabilia includes
a button collection; one reads “Honkies for Harold,” symbolizing his uni-
versal appeal. Artworks by African-American artists fill the ten-story inte-
rior. The ninth floor contains the sun-dappled, 52-foot glass-domed winter
garden, a good spot for study and contemplation, and the stylish Beyond
Words Café. A children’s library offers puppet shows and other activities.
On the ground floor, Second Hand Prose sells (for pennies) books retired
from circulation.
The library offers free one-hour guided tours of its art and architecture.

with rare books and manuscripts (including Shakespeare’s First Folio and
Jefferson’s copy of The Federalist Papers). The library is a major destina-
tion for genealogists — the genealogy holdings are available to the public
for free if you’re over age 16 and have a photo ID. Exhibitions display many
of the library’s books and maps. Programs include concerts, lectures, chil-
dren’s story hours, and a holiday bazaar in early December.
Free one-hour tours are available on Thursday at 3 p.m. and on Saturday
at 10:30 a.m.

Chicago’s colorful politics
Read the newspapers or listen to the news, and you get a glimpse into Chicago’s ward
politics and political machine (vote early and often was a phrase coined in the Windy
City), as well as the not-so-complimentary nicknames that Chicago gives its politi-
cians. Corrupt Alderman “Bathhouse” John Coughlin earned his nickname because
he formerly labored in a public bathhouse. Snippy Mayor Jane Byrne was known as
“Attila the Hen” and “Crazy Jane.” Deal-making Alderman Edward Vrodolyak was
known as “Fast Eddie.” Not-so-slick-tongued Mayor Eugene Sawyer was dubbed
“Mayor Mumbles.” Mayor Anton Cermak was labeled “Pushcart Tony” because of
his former job as a teamster.

Especially for movie lovers
Tired of sightseeing? Is the weather too hot or rainy to be outside? Seek
shelter in the comforts of a movie theater. For locations and movie list-
ings for Chicago’s many multiplexes, pick up a copy of the Chicago
Tribune or Chicago Sun-Times.
If you’re in the mood for something different (no doubt you can go to a
multiplex in your hometown), visit one of these movie houses that cater
to cinema buffs with truly original programming:
 Facets Multi-Media, 1517 W. Fullerton Ave. (% 773-281-9075; www.
facets.org; CTA: Red or Brown line to Fullerton), is for the die-
hard cinematic thrill-seeker. This nonprofit center screens inde-
pendent films and videos from around the world. Facets also hosts
the Children’s Film Festival (Oct–Nov) and the Chicago Latino Film
Festival (Apr–May).
 The Gene Siskel Film Center, 164 N. State St. (% 312-846-2600;
www.siskelfilmcenter.org; CTA: Red Line to Washington or
Brown Line to Randolph), named after the well-known Chicago
Tribune film critic who died in 1999, is part of the School of the Art
Institute of Chicago. The center hosts an eclectic selection of film
series in two theaters, including lectures and discussions with film-
makers. The Film Center often shows foreign films that are not
released commercially in the United States.
 The Music Box Theatre on the far North Side is a classic movie
house with a big screen and a house organist (see Chapter 16 for
details).
If you’re a fan of the oldies, you have two interesting options, both free:
 Chicago Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington St., near the Loop 
(% 312-744-6630), screens classics such as Casablanca on Tuesday
evenings.
 The Oriental Institute Museum (% 773-702-9507; see listing earlier
in this chapter) in Hyde Park screens such flicks as Cleopatra, the
1934 Cecil B. DeMille epic starring Claudette Colbert, on Sundays.
For inexpensive seats to Hollywood’s more-recent offerings, check out

Seeing Chicago by Guided Tour
Although you already have a friend to show you around Chicago (this
book!), I won’t be offended if you want an in-person guided tour. A good
guide can escort you around the city and its neighborhoods, pointing
out the sights and giving you special insights.
Just the basics: Orientation tours
Take a tour as soon as you arrive. You can take a basic sightseeing tour
on a motor coach, van, double-decker bus, open trolley, or boat. Even if
you did your homework and have read this book cover to cover, there’s
nothing like seeing the city firsthand. Suddenly, the geography you tried
to fix in your mind makes sense. Attractions and sights you read about
come to life. Instead of words on the page in a book in your hand, you’re
seeing the place with your own eyes.
One popular spot for picking up a land or water tour is at the Michigan
Avenue Bridge (over the Chicago River at East Wacker Drive). Other land
tours take off from the intersection of Pearson Street and Michigan
Avenue (near the Water Tower).
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
202
Insider tours — for free!
Want to see the city from a native’s point of view? Chicago Greeter, a new program run
by the Chicago Office of Tourism, matches tourists with local Chicagoans who serve
as volunteer guides. Visitors can request a specific neighborhood or theme (every-
thing from Polish heritage sites to Chicago movie locations), and a greeter gives a free,
two- to four-hour tour. Greeters won’t escort groups of more than six people, but kids
of all ages are welcome (bringing newborns on the tours, however, is discouraged).
When you call, be sure to specify that you’ll be using a stroller, so your guide can plan
accordingly for accessing public transportation. Popular family tours include Lincoln
Park Zoo and the Shedd Aquarium. Specific requests for tours should be made at least
a week in advance, but “InstaGreeters” are also available on a first-come, first-served
basis at the Chicago Cultural Center, 77 E. Randolph St., Friday through Sunday. For
details, call % 312-744-8000 or visit www.chicagogreeter.com.

One word of caution about guided tours: Don’t regard everything you
hear as fact. Narrators are known to take liberties with the truth and are
apt to spread a rumor or two. They also read from a script that is usually
memorized — the 10,000th repetition may be dull. Treat these tours as
what they are: basic sightseeing and orientation — here’s the Water
Tower, there’s the Sears Tower, here’s Lake Michigan.
Any of the following can give you a good overview of the city:
 Chicago Trolley Company (% 773-648-5000): Breezy trolleys pro-
vide one-and-a-half-hour narrated tours of the major sites and also
offer all-day on-and-off privileges. In inclement weather, vehicles
are enclosed and heated. Trolleys run every 20 minutes or so,
depending on the seasonal demand. The fare is $20 for adults, $17
for seniors, and $10 for children 3 to 11. Tours run daily 9 a.m. to 
9 p.m. (until 6:30 p.m. Apr–Oct).
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 203
Do-it-yourself sightseeing
A cheap way to tour the city is by hopping aboard one of Chicago’s El trains or buses.
You can take your own tour for the cost of subway or bus fare — $1.75, plus 25¢ for a
transfer (good for a return trip if you use it within two hours). Here are some of the
city’s best sightseeing routes (for information on public transportation, see Chapter 8):
 Brown Line (trip duration 20 minutes; daily): Ride from the Loop to Belmont Station.
You get a bird’s-eye view of downtown, gentrified loft districts, and a number of
historic neighborhoods. Start at the big El station at Clark and Lake streets and
get on the northbound train.
 No. 151 Sheridan bus (trip duration 30 minutes; daily): Pick up the 151 downtown
on Michigan Avenue (the bus stops every 2 blocks on the avenue) and ride it north
to Belmont. You cover Lake Shore Drive and Lincoln Park. If you take the bus south,
you travel State Street and wind up at Union Station.
 No. 146 Marine-Michigan bus (trip duration 20 minutes; daily): This express bus
allows you to take in North Michigan Avenue, State Street, and the Museum
Campus. Pick up the bus on Sheridan and Diversey going south. (You can also pick
up the 146 along Michigan Avenue, although it has fewer stops than the 151.) You
see the Harold Washington Library, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago
Cultural Center, and the landmark Water Tower.
 No. 10 Museum of Science and Industry bus (trip duration 35 minutes; weekends
year-round, daily in summer and winter holiday season): From North Michigan
Avenue at the Water Tower (the stop is in front of Borders on Michigan Avenue
across from Water Tower Place), ride south to the Museum Campus. You see Grant
Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, the University of Chicago, and Chinatown.

 Gray Line Tours (% 312-251-3107; www.grayline.com): You’ll find
the granddaddy of tour companies in every major city, including
Chicago. Gray Line offers a range of bus excursions, including four-
hour Inside Chicago tour packages, which cost $28 for adults and
$14 for children 5 to 12.
Water, water everywhere: Boat tours
A variety of excursion boats travel the Lake Michigan shoreline and
three branches of the Chicago River. The boats offer sightseeing by day,
and dining and dancing at night. Primary boarding spots are along the
Chicago River between North Michigan and Wabash avenues; Ogden
Slip, at the east end of East Illinois Street next to River East Plaza; and
Navy Pier.
You may be surprised at this advice from an off-the-beaten-path afi-
cionado, but here goes: Get on that boat! Chicagoans know the best way
to get the lay of the land is by water. You save oodles of time. Instead of
wandering around (like a tourist, I must add), you can maneuver with
something resembling confidence and get a taste of Chicago’s beautiful
lakefront from a unique perspective.
For most sightseeing boats, the season runs from early May through late
October. Tours typically last 90 minutes, but shorter and longer trips are
available. Most operate on a set schedule, and reservations are advisable
during prime times, such as weekends and holidays in the middle of
summer. At other times, walking on is possible.
The following tour companies offer great ways to see the city from the
water (also see Chicago Architecture Foundation Boat Tours earlier in
this chapter):
 Chicago from the Lake (% 312-527-1977; www.chicagoline.com)
runs two types of cruises: a 90-minute tour of architecture along
the Chicago River, and historical excursions that travel on the lake
and river to explore the development of the city. The price includes
coffee (Starbucks, no less), lemonade, cookies, and muffins. For
tickets, call or stop by the company’s ticket office on the lower
level on the east end of River East Plaza. Advance reservations are
recommended. Tours depart from Ogden Slip adjacent to River East
Plaza (formerly North Pier) at the end of East Illinois Street. Tickets
cost $28 adults, $26 seniors, $16 children 7 to 18, free for children
under 7. Tours run May through October daily.
 Mystic Blue Cruises (% 877-299-7783; www.mysticbluecruises.
com) offers a casual dinner cruise with a DJ, TV monitors playing
music videos, and spirited dancing. You may run into a bachelor or
bachelorette party. Food is served buffet-style. The fare is $30 to $75,
depending on the time of day, and cruises run year-round. The same
company offers more formal (and expensive) cruises year-round
aboard the Odyssey (www.odysseycruises.com) and motorboat
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
204

rides on the 70-passenger Seadog (www.seadogcruises.com) from
May through Labor Day, if you really want to feel the water in your
face.
 Shoreline Sightseeing (% 312-222-9328; www.shorelinesight
seeing.com) launches 30-minute lake cruises every half-hour from
its three dock locations: the Shedd Aquarium, Navy Pier, and
Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park. Shoreline has also gotten in on
the popular architecture tours. Narrated by architectural guides,
they cost more than regular tours. A water taxi also runs every
half-hour from Navy Pier to both the Sears Tower and the Shedd
Aquarium. One-way tickets for the water taxi are $6 for adults, $5
for seniors, and $3 for children under 12; all-day passes cost $12 for
adults and $6 for children. Tours depart from Navy Pier, Shedd
Aquarium, and Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park. Tickets cost
$12 adults, $11 seniors, $6 children under 12; architectural tours
cost $22 to $24 adults, $19 to $21 seniors, $11 children under 12.
Tours run May through September daily.
 Spirit of Chicago (% 866-211-3804; www.spiritcruises.com)
and Odyssey II (% 888-957-2322; www.odysseycruises.com), a
pair of sleek motor yachts, offer luxury cruises. They include lunch,
brunch, or dinner, and a romantic moonlight cruise with bubbly and
dancing. The 600-passenger Spirit of Chicago and the 800-passenger
Odyssey II depart from Navy Pier from April to December. Tickets
run from $32 to $95.
 The Tall Ship Windy (% 312-595-5555; www.tallshipwindy.com)
is for those who enjoy listening to the slap of sails as they plow
through the waves of Lake Michigan. The 148-foot, four-masted
schooner offers 90-minute daytime and evening cruises. Passengers
help raise and trim sails and take turns at the ship’s wheel. Adults
ride for $25, seniors and children under 12 ride for $15. Call for sail-
ing times; according to their Web site, “We sail daily except we tend
to take some Mondays off in May, September and October.”
 Wendella Sightseeing Boats (% 312-337-1446; www.wendella
boats.com) has operated cruises on the Chicago River and Lake
Michigan since 1935. Guides identify the skyscrapers, which are
brilliantly lit at night. Guided lake and river tours run one, one and
a half, and two hours. Tickets are $20 for adults, $18 for seniors,
and $10 for children ages 3 to 11. The boats run daily from April
through October.
Beyond the basics: Architectural and cultural tours
Chicago is a living textbook of architectural styles, and the high-quality
tours offered by the Chicago Architecture Foundation (% 312-922-
8687; www.architecture.org) provide an excellent introduction. More
than 50 tours are offered — by bus, train, boat, and bicycle, as well 
as on foot. For more on their most popular tour, the Architecture River
Cruise along the north and south branches of the Chicago River, 
Chapter 11: Chicago's Top Attractions 205

see the listing under “Chicago’s Top Sights,” earlier this chapter. Other
favorite tours are the Rise of the Skyscraper and On and About North
Michigan Avenue walking tours, and the Chicago Architecture Highlights
by Bus trip. The bus tour, which covers a number of high-impact histori-
cal districts, departs at 9:30 a.m. every Saturday, some Wednesdays, and
some Sundays from 224 S. Michigan Ave.; the tour lasts over three hours
and costs $35 for adults, $32 for students and seniors.
The Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs offers audio walking tours
in the Loop. Pick up the headset that includes a tape at the Shop at the
Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington (% 312-742-0079). The 90-minute
tape, narrated by local broadcast journalist Bill Kurtis, provides visitors
with an overview of downtown’s skyscrapers, public spaces, and sculp-
tures. The tour package costs $5 (with a $50 returnable deposit, cash or
credit card) and includes rental of a tape player and a map and booklet
of the downtown area.
The Chicago History Museum offers daylong and half-day bus tours
year-round that cover unique themes or aspects of the metropolitan
area’s history. Led by historians and scholars, they take place in the city
and surrounding areas. Tours are different every year and are usually
related to exhibits at the Historical Society’s museum; call the Historical
Society (% 312-642-4600; www.chicagohistory.org) for updates.
Prices are $60 per person for full-day tours (10 a.m.–4 p.m.), including
lunch; and $35 for half-day tours (1–5 p.m.). Tours depart from the
museum, at Clark Street and North Avenue.
Meet the locals: Neighborhood tours
Chicago Neighborhood Tours (% 312-742-1190; www.chgocitytours.
com) offers half-day, narrated, bus excursions to about a dozen diverse
communities throughout the city, and you’ll be accompanied by local
greeters. Tours are divided into three categories: Neighborhood Tours,
Special Interest Tours (focusing on the Great Chicago Fire, for example),
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
206
By horse and carriage
Noble Horse (% 312-266-7878), with the largest fleet of antique horse carriages in the
city, is stationed around the old Water Tower Square, at the northwest corner of
Chicago and Michigan avenues. Each of the drivers, outfitted in black tie and top hat,
has his own variation on the basic Magnificent Mile itinerary. (You can also do tours
of the lakefront, river, Lincoln Park, and Buckingham Fountain.) The charge is $35 for
each half-hour for up to four people. The coaches run year-round, with convertible
coaches in the warm months and enclosed carriages with wool blankets on bone-
chilling nights. You’ll find several other carriage operators, all of whom pick up riders
in the vicinity.

and Cultural Historian’s Choice Tours, led by the cultural historian for
the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, who takes visitors to some
offbeat gems.
These tours are a wonderful way to see landmarks, cultural centers, and
museums. Tours also explore shopping centers and allow you to taste
local cuisine. For example, the Chinatown/Pilsen tour includes a guided
walking tour of Chinatown led by Chinese American Service League rep-
resentatives, with a stop for refreshments at a Chinese bakery. Then
there’s a visit, reception, and shopping at the Mexican Fine Arts Center
Museum, and a guided bus tour of the Pilsen neighborhood that takes in
murals by local artists. Another tour includes the Bronzeville neighbor-
hood on the South Side, a view of Chicago’s Jewish neighborhoods.
Tours depart from the Chicago Cultural Center, 77 E. Randolph St., at 
10 a.m. on Saturdays and last approximately four to five hours. Call first,
because the tours don’t run on major holidays and generally don’t run
during the month of January. Advance purchase is recommended.
Neighborhood tours include refreshments and are $25 for adults, $20 for
seniors and students; Special Interest tours include lunch and are $50
for adults, $45 for seniors and students; Cultural Historian’s Choice
tours include refreshments and are $35.
Gangsters and ghosts: Specialty tours
Untouchable Tours (% 773-881-1195 — ask for Bugsy; www.gangster
tour.com) are led by Da Boys and their molls. Suitably costumed 
guides — the men in snap-brimmed fedoras, the women in flapper 
outfits — brandish machine guns and pistols. Two-hour tours visit
Prohibition-era gangster hangouts and hit spots like the Biograph
Theatre, where John Dillinger met his end; and the site of the St.
Valentine’s Day massacre. The fare is $25 for adults and $19 for children
under 16. Tours depart from the southeast corner of Clark and Ohio
streets and run Monday through Wednesday at 10 a.m.; Thursday at 
10 a.m. and 1 p.m.; Friday at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 7:30 p.m.; Saturday 
at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m.; and Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Focusing on the supernatural and paranormal, the Tour of Haunted and
Legendary Places (% 708-499-0300; www.ghosttours.com) visits
graveyards, haunted houses, and other ghostly places, led by Richard
Crowe, who bills himself as a “professional ghost hunter.” Crowe does
know his stuff, so you’ll get some informative history lessons along the
way. A four-hour narrated bus tour costs $37 per person and departs
from Goose Island Restaurant at 1800 N. Clybourn Ave.; a two-hour
supernatural boat excursion from July to Labor Day is $24 per person
and leaves at 10:30 p.m. from the Mercury boat dock at Michigan Avenue
and Wacker Drive. Reservations are required. Crowe’s tours are espe-
cially popular around Halloween, so book well in advance.

Chapter 12
A Shopper’s Guide 
to Chicago
In This Chapter
 Checking out the local shopping scene
 Hitting the big-name stores
 Exploring the best shopping neighborhoods
C
hicago is a shopping mecca. Why do you think the Magnificent Mile
is called “magnificent”? Not because of the sightseeing, believe me!
On Michigan Avenue, the stores are the thing.
You can buy everything from Hermès scarves to LEGO building blocks
on or around Michigan Avenue. As you stroll the Magnificent Mile, you’ll
see that finding the department stores and four (yes, four!) high-rise
shopping malls is no problem. But if you want to discover Chicago’s 
boutiques and specialty stores, I point you in the right direction. (Even
within the downtown malls, you may miss some of the smaller places
that make Chicago a great shopping destination.) I also explore other
neighborhoods that offer boutique shopping.
Surveying the Scene
Stores traditionally stay open latest on Thursday night, until 8 p.m. or so.
Department stores stay open until about 7 p.m. all other nights except
Sundays, when they open around 11 a.m. and close around 6 p.m. Smaller
stores close by 5 or 6 p.m.
The biggest sales of the year are in January, when retailers slash prices
to make room for spring offerings. This is the best time to shop (if you
didn’t blow all your bucks over the holidays!), especially because
Chicago’s sales tax on nonfood items is a noticeable 9 percent. Ouch.

Checking Out the Big Names
Chicago is populated by outposts of most major department stores.
Here’s the info on the many department stores that await you:
 Bloomingdale’s, 900 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-440-4460; www.
bloomingdales.com): New York’s beloved Bloomie’s is trans-
planted here as a six-level store that includes a section devoted to
Bloomingdale’s logo merchandise. Home furnishings have a fabu-
lous historic location in the former Medinah Temple, a landmark
building at 600 N. Wabash Ave. (% 312-324-7500).
 Carson Pirie Scott, 1 S. State St. (% 312-641-7000): Stunning archi-
tecture by Louis Sullivan (one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s mentors)
makes this century-old department store easy on the eyes. The
exterior incorporates intricate ornamental iron filigree. The store 
is also easier on your pocketbook than nearby Macy’s (formerly
Marshall Field’s) and carries slightly lower-end merchandise as
well. In late 2006, it was announced that this location would close;
the store plans to open in a new location that as of press time, is
yet to be announced.
 Macy’s, 111 N. State St. (% 312-781-1000; www.macys.com): The
former Marshall Field’s department store is one of the world’s
largest, occupying an entire city block (72 acres of shopping!) and
featuring the largest Tiffany glass mosaic dome in the United States.
Chicago traditions include meeting under the clock and viewing the
animated holiday window displays at the 1852-built store. When
Macy’s took over in 2006, it maintained another tradition: Serving
afternoon tea in the gracious Walnut Room (which, during the holi-
days, is home to a giant Christmas tree and another tradition,
breakfast with Santa). A smaller branch is located in Water Tower
Place (% 312-335-7700).
 Neiman Marcus, 737 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-642-5900; www.
neimanmarcus.com): Texas’s favorite department store has top
merchandise and prices to match. If you’re in town in late January,
the “Last Call” sale is one of the city’s best. The fourth-floor epicure
shop specializes in pâté, caviar, and other delicacies.
 Nordstrom, Westfield North Bridge Mall, 520 N. Michigan Ave. 
(% 312-379-4300; www.nordstrom.com): The newest department
store addition to the Magnificent Mile, Nordstrom anchors a mall
that has attracted traffic to the south end of Michigan Avenue. Why
go to Nordstrom? Shoes. On the weekends, you’ll have to take a
number, and an employee with a microphone walks around the
huge department calling out the next number to be served. Despite
the microphone, the service is renowned.
Chapter 12: A Shopper’s Guide to Chicago 209

 Saks Fifth Avenue, Chicago Place, 700 N. Michigan Ave. (% 312-
944-6500; www.saks.com): Designer fashions are what this seven-
story store is all about. Visit the jewelry department on the first
floor, or shop for makeup and the city’s best selection of Jo Malone
scents, lotions, and other beauty products.
Going to Market
When the temperature rises, retail vendors hit the streets. This section
guides you to the best of the summer markets and art fairs.
Farmers’ markets
From mid-May to late October, Chicago’s downtown plazas and neigh-
borhoods come alive with fruits, vegetables, flowers, and food from
farms outside the city and even out-of-state. Markets in residential neigh-
borhoods, such as the gourmet market at Lincoln Park High School,
2001 N. Orchard St., usually take place on Saturdays. The farmers’ mar-
kets downtown take place during the week. Schedules may vary, so con-
tact the Mayor’s Office of Special Events (% 312-744-3315) for more
information. Downtown markets include
 Daley Plaza, 55 W. Randolph St., on Thursdays
 Federal Plaza, Adams Street and Jackson Boulevard, on Tuesdays
 Park at Jackson and Wacker, across from the Sears Tower, on
Thursdays
 Prudential Plaza, 130 E. Randolph St., every other Tuesday
Art fairs
Chicago hosts a festival in one of its parks or neighborhoods practically
every weekend in summer. Many of the best are focused around art.
Artists from all over apply to be accepted into these four juried art fairs:
 Around the Coyote, at the intersection of Damen, North, and
Milwaukee avenues (% 773-342-6777; www.aroundthecoyote.
org): This art festival, held the second weekend in September,
showcases the talent of local artists. The entrance fee entitles you
to enter not only local art galleries but also many artists’ homes
and studios for a look behind the scenes.
 Bucktown Arts Fest, near Fullerton and Western avenues (% 312-
409-8305; www.bucktownartsfest.com): This most recent addi-
tion to the art-fair circuit is staged in a comfortable park setting.
Don’t forget your sunscreen or hat, however, because it’s typically
pretty steamy the last weekend in August.
 57th Street Art Fair, 57th Street in downtown Hyde Park (% 773-
493-3247; www.57thstreetartfair.org): This long-standing fair
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
210

is a natural outgrowth of the intellectual and artsy enclave on
Chicago’s South Side. Much less crowded than the Old Town Art
Fair the weekend before, this fair on the third weekend in June
makes for a more comfortable art-viewing experience.
 Old Town Art Fair, Lincoln Avenue and Wisconsin Street (% 312-
337-1938): The most high-end of Chicago’s art-fair offerings boasts
art prices to match. It kicks off the art-fair season the second week-
end in June. Go early or late in the day to avoid unbearable midday
crowds. Be careful not to accidentally pay entrance into the other
nearby festivals that take advantage of the art fair’s draw, unless
you’re more interested in drinking beer and hearing bands than
seeing art. (See Chapter 3 for more details.)
Street fairs
Although not in the same league as the art fairs in the preceding section,
almost every neighborhood festival includes booths with vendors selling
jewelry, bohemian clothing, sunglasses, African drums, and even mas-
sages. In this city that loves to eat, you also find a healthy helping of
food vendors offering a variety of ethnic cuisines. See Chapter 3 for a list
of the most popular festivals. You can also contact the Mayor’s Office of
Special Events (% 312-744-3315) for a festival calendar.
Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
In this section, I describe Chicago’s best stores, organized by 
neighborhood.
Magnificent Mile and environs
This high-priced stretch of real estate on Michigan Avenue reaches from
Oak Street to the Chicago River. You find high-visibility names, from
Cartier to Kenneth Cole, Filene’s Basement to Ralph Lauren, Gucci to
Nike. For locations of stores, see the “Magnificent Mile Shopping” map 
in this chapter. Standout shops include
 Active Endeavors, 45 E. Grand Ave. (% 312-822-0600; www.active
endeavors.com): Gear for outdoor pursuits, from hiking to biking
to skiing. Fun casual clothes, too. In the Westfield North Bridge
mall, on the street level facing Grand Avenue.
 American Girl Place, 111 E. Chicago Ave. (% 877-247-5223; www.
americangirl.com): The “in” place for the preteen set. You can
never collect enough American Girl dolls . . . and then you need to
buy them an extensive wardrobe, complete with accessories! This
three-story, 37,500-square-foot store lures in millions of shoppers
each year. In order to avoid disappointing the American girl in your
life, I strongly advise that you call ahead about a month in advance
to secure lunch in the chic cafe or to catch a stage show, which is
performed five days a week in a 150-seat theater. In 2006, it was
Chapter 12: A Shopper’s Guide to Chicago 211

 Shabby Chic, 2146 N. Halsted St. (% 773-327-9372; www.shabby
chic.com): The famous decorating look is for sale in this furniture
store.
 Tabula Tua, 1015 W. Armitage Ave. (% 773-525-3500; www.tabula
tua.com): Everything you need to set the perfect table.
Old Town
One of my favorite shopping strips is North Wells Street in Old Town.
Take a jaunt down one of the side streets to admire the neighborhood’s
restored brownstones. Shops include
 Fleet Feet Sports, 210 W. North Ave., in Piper’s Alley (% 312-587-
3338; www.fleetfeet.com): Runner’s heaven. They’ll videotape
you running on the treadmill and give you the verdict on shoes that
will work best for you.
 Handle With Care, 1706 N. Wells St. (% 312-751-2929; www.shop
hwc.com): In a little strip of shops on Wells Street north of North
Avenue, this shop boasts gift items and colorful clothing.
 A New Leaf, 1818 N. Wells St. (% 312-642-8553): One of Chicago’s
top florists has a breathtaking storefront with a carriage house in
the back, all packed with flowers, plants, pots, candles, glassware,
and more.
Southport Avenue
As recently as the early 1990s, this area was considered off the beaten
path. Now gentrified, Southport Avenue retains some of its funkier past
with eclectic boutiques for clothing and accessories. Shops include
 Fly Paper, 3402 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-296-4359): A card and
gift store featuring exquisite gift wrap and stationery. Paper Boy, a
ten-minute walk away at 1351 W. Belmont Ave. (% 773-388-8811), 
is under the same ownership and features a similarly eclectic 
collection.
 Krista K, 3458 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-248-1967) stocks newer
women’s designers who aren’t widely available in Chicago.
 P.O.S.H., 3729 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-529-7674; www.posh
chicago.com): Tableware, including never-used vintage silver 
and commercial-grade china from European and American hotels,
restaurants, and cruise ships.
 The Red Head Boutique, 3450 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-325-9898;
www.redheadboutique.com): Women’s specialty boutique featur-
ing clothes, purses, and jewelry.
 Shane, 3657 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-549-0179), and Jake, 3740 N.
Southport Ave. (% 773-929-5253), carry more casual clothes for both
men and women (think trendy T-shirts and specialty-label denim).
Chapter 12: A Shopper’s Guide to Chicago 221

West Lakeview
The West Lakeview neighborhood, between 1100 and 2400 West, is
known as “antiques row.” More than 20 shops offer a mind-boggling
range of antiques and collectibles, from books and furniture to
Depression-era glass and dolls. Destinations include
 Architectural Artifacts, Inc., 4325 N. Ravenswood Ave., east of
Damen Avenue and south of Montrose Avenue (% 773-348-0622):
Chicago has a handful of salvage specialists who cater to the design
trades and retail customers seeking an unusual architectural piece
for their homes. This one is the best and is well worth seeking out
at its location next to the Metra train line in the far-northwest
corner of the city’s Lakeview neighborhood.
 Broadway Antique Market, 6131 N. Broadway (% 773-743-5444):
Two floors of funky, fun, somewhat pricey antiques and collectibles.
 Jay Robert’s Antique Warehouse, 149 W. Kinzie St. at LaSalle St.
(% 312-222-0167). This mammoth River North space is within
walking distance of downtown hotels, but you’ll need comfortable
shoes to explore all 50,000 square feet. The selection is wildly
eclectic: fine furniture that includes fireplaces, stained glass, stat-
ues, tapestries, and an impressive selection of antique clocks in a
variety of styles ranging from elaborate Victorian to sophisticated
Art Deco.
 Michael FitzSimmons Decorative Arts, 311 W. Superior St. between
Franklin and Orleans streets (% 312-787-0496): This shop is one 
of the top dealers anywhere for furniture and furnishings dating to
the Arts and Crafts period, from Stickley chairs to antique British
lamps. You’ll also find top-notch reproductions, including William
Morris wallpaper patterns.
 Modern Times, 2100 W. Grand Ave. at Damen Avenue (% 312-243-
5706): This shop specializes in the major designers of home fur-
nishings from the 1930s to the 1960s — the sort of pieces that 
style-conscious shoppers buy to furnish their newly gentrified 
lofts. You’ll also find lighting fixtures of all types and some jewelry.
Note: The store is only open Friday through Sunday; weekdays by
appointment only.
 Olde Chicago Ltd. Antiques, 3110 N. Kedzie Ave. (% 773-935-1200):
This importer of furniture from Europe specializes in the years prior
to 1900. The shop is a well-kept secret that mostly serves the trade —
much of the furniture is sold to out-of-town dealers — but now that
you’re in the know, you can stop by.
 Salvage One, 1840 W. Hubbard St. at Damen Avenue (% 312-733-
0098): Like Architectural Artifacts (earlier in this list), this sprawl-
ing space stocks everything and the kitchen sink — literally: There’s
an entire room filled with vintage sinks. You’ll find hundreds of one-
of-a-kind pieces for the home handyperson, including doors, man-
tels, tubs, stained glass, and antique chandeliers.
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
222

Bucktown/Wicker Park
Fun, funky, and off-the-beaten-path purchases are best found in
Bucktown and Wicker Park, Chicago’s artist enclaves. Shops include
 Apartment Number 9, 1804 N. Damen Ave. (% 773-395-2999):
Modern menswear, on the mostly casual side. You’ll find suits here
(or you can purchase jackets and pants separately), plus dress
shirts and ties, mixed in with more casual garments.
 Pagoda Red, 1714 N. Damen Ave., second floor (% 773-235-1188;
www.pagodared.com): Imported antique furniture and art objects
from China, Tibet, and Burma.
 p45, 1643 N. Damen Ave. (% 773-862-4523; www.p45.com): A cool
boutique that has received acclaim from East Coast fashion editors.
Women’s and men’s clothing by young designers.
 Red Hen Bread, 1623 N. Milwaukee Ave. (% 773-342-6823):
Homemade bread that’s so good it’s used by some of the city’s 
best restaurants.
 Robin Richman, 2108 N. Damen Ave. at Dickens Street (% 773-278-
6150): You’ll feel as though you’re poking through a big, antiques-
filled closet as you browse around this tiny Bucktown storefront.
Though Richman carries a small assortment of men’s and women’s
separates (mostly loose, unstructured pieces), the big draw here is
her exquisite sweaters.
 Scoop NYC, 1702 N. Milwaukee Ave. at Wabansia Avenue (% 773-
227-9930): At this first Midwest outpost of the New York clothing
boutique, you’ll find a mix of major fashion names (Marc Jacobs
bags, Jimmy Choo shoes), along with the requisite selection of
designer denim, flirty dresses, and seemingly simple T-shirts that
will make you do a double-take when you check out the price tag.
(The store stocks men’s and kids’ clothing, too.)
 Shopgirl, 1206 W. Webster Ave. at Racine Avenue (% 773-935-
SHOP): Lincoln Park 20- and 30-somethings flock to Shopgirl for the
latest looks from trendy lines such as Blue Cult and Free People. It’s
a girly gathering place (pink walls, glittery chandeliers); the same
owner runs a maternity store and kids’ clothing shop across the
street.
 The T-Shirt Deli, 1739 N. Damen Ave. between Willow Street and 
St. Paul Avenue (% 773-276-6266): For a new twist on custom
clothing, stop by this cozy Bucktown storefront, where you can
order up your own personalized T-shirt creation from books of vin-
tage iron-on patches; your shirt will be printed up while you wait.
When it’s done, the shirt is packaged in a paper bag with a side of
potato chips — just like a real deli.

Chapter 13
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Hitting the highlights if your time is limited
 Enjoying Chicago with your kids
 Shopping along the Magnificent Mile
L
et’s say you have limited time in our fair city, and you want to see 
as much as possible. Perhaps the holidays are near and shopping is
tops on your list. Or maybe you want to arrange a day of touring with
your kids. Either way, you’ve come to the right chapter.
Chicago in Three Days
This itinerary covers the best that Chicago has to offer if you have a lim-
ited amount of time to visit the city.
Day 1
Spend the first day in the heart of downtown, known as the Loop. Thanks
to the Great Fire of 1871 and the city leaders’ determination to rebuild
with style, Chicago has been a world leader in architecture for more than
a century. You find some of Chicago’s best architecture in the Loop. If
you’re visiting during nice weather, walk around the Loop on a self-guided
tour or one organized by the Chicago Architecture Foundation — the
early skyscraper tour is a good primer (Chapter 11). Finish your stroll at
Millennium Park, Chicago’s largest public-works project in decades
(Chapter 11). The park begins at Randolph and Michigan Avenue and
extends south to the Art Institute. Catch your reflection in “The Bean” and
walk over Frank Gehry’s curving pedestrian bridge, which has fantastic
lake and city views.
When it’s time for lunch, head to Heaven on Seven (Chapter 10) for
some Cajun and Creole cooking. After lunch, visit one or two of the city’s
premier museums, such as the Art Institute of Chicago or one of the
Museum Campus museums — the Field Museum of Natural History, the

John G. Shedd Aquarium, or the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy
Museum, depending on your interests (Chapter 11). Next, return to your
hotel for a little downtime before heading out to dinner (Chapter 10) 
followed by a show at one of the city’s top theaters, like the Goodman
Theatre (Chapter 15).
Day 2
On the morning of the second day, head for Lincoln Park (Chapter 11),
where you can stroll among the animals at Lincoln Park Zoo, stop and
smell the roses at Lincoln Park Conservatory, and take a paddleboat
ride at one of the park’s lagoons. Have lunch at the North Pond Café (if
money is no object) or Cafe Brauer (if sandwiches are more your style).
If the Cubs are playing, and you secured tickets in advance, head to
Wrigley Field for an afternoon game (Chapter 11). You can also take a
chance and try to buy tickets at the stadium. If you’re not a sports fan,
stroll among the boutiques of Armitage Avenue (Chapter 12). For
dinner, sample the fare at one of the city’s ethnic restaurants along Clark
Street or Southport Avenue (Chapter 10). Finish your day with some
down-and-dirty Chicago blues. My personal favorite venue is Buddy
Guy’s Legends, which you can get to by hopping on the subway or
taking a cab (Chapter 16).
Day 3
On the morning of your last day, make a trip to the top of The Hancock
Observatory (Chapter 11). Next, do some window-shopping up and down
Michigan Avenue, or go gallery-hopping in River North (Chapter 12).
Both areas have plenty of excellent restaurants for lunch. If you’re not in
the mood for shopping, visit one of the major museums you didn’t see 
on the first day. Or check out the Museum of Contemporary Art, just off
Michigan Avenue (Chapter 11).
In the evening, head to Navy Pier, where you can board a boat for a
dinner cruise with spectacular views of the skyline (Chapter 11).
Chicago in Five Days
This itinerary hits more of the city’s highlights. For the first three days,
follow the itinerary in the preceding section.
Day 4
Begin the fourth day with a trip to Hyde Park, where you’ll want to
spend the majority of your day at the Museum of Science and Industry
(Chapter 11). If you also want to see the University of Chicago, make
some time in the afternoon for visits to the Oriental Institute Museum
(Chapter 11) and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Robie House (Chapter 14), both
on the university’s campus.

THE
LOOP
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 229

After some relaxation time back at your hotel, make your way to the
Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood for dinner. You can’t go wrong at
Pacific Northwest–inspired Meritage (Chapter 10). Afterward, hit the
music scene at Wicker Park fixture Double Door, a great place to see
local and national indie-rock and jazz acts (Chapter 16).
Day 5
If the sun is shining on your last day, head to the lakefront (Chapter 11)
and Oak Street Beach. Pitch your blanket on the sand and relax. Or,
burn off calories from last night’s dinner by renting a bike or in-line
skates from Bike Chicago (Chapter 11) at North Avenue Beach.
If it’s cold or rainy, take a taxi to the Glessner House (Chapter 11) for a
tour of one of Chicago’s architectural treasures. End the day with tea at
the Atwood Café or Four Seasons Hotel (Chapter 10).
Following dinner at the restaurant of your choosing, spend your last
night at one of Chicago’s outstanding jazz clubs, such as Green Dolphin
Street (Chapter 16), which also serves dinner.
Chicago for Families with Kids
The itineraries in this section are sure to please pint-size tourists — and
their escorts. If you’re visiting in winter, or if the weather is inclement,
substitute the outdoor activities with some of the many indoor, kid-
friendly attractions in Chapter 11.
Day 1
Begin your day with a ride on the El (subway). Riding high above the
city streets gives kids a bird’s-eye view. One of the best is the brown line,
which you can pick up at Lake and Clark streets and ride through the
heart of downtown. After your tour, head south to the Museum of
Science and Industry (Chapter 11), the classic kids’ attraction that
never fails to enthrall. Spend the remainder of your day at this large
museum, where you can also have lunch and catch an IMAX movie.
Return downtown for dinner, perhaps at Ed Debevic’s (Chapter 6).
Day 2
On the morning of your second day, take a Chicago Architecture
Foundation boat tour of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan (Chap-
ter 11). Even small kids enjoy being on the water, while adults can learn
about the city’s spectacular architecture. Back on land, stroll up the
Magnificent Mile. Along the way, you pass such kid magnets as the
Disney Store and American Girl Place. For lunch, head to the foodlife
food court in Water Tower Place (Chapter 10), where the wide-ranging
menu offers options for everyone in the family. Next, hop a ride on the

elevator and head to the top of The Hancock Observatory (Chapter 11).
In the evening, make your way to Navy Pier for dinner and more spec-
tacular views of the city (Chapter 11).
Day 3
If the Cubs are in town, spend day 3 at Wrigley Field (Chapter 11). Dine
on hot dogs or bratwurst while you sip a beer and the kids polish off
cotton candy and licorice. If the Cubs aren’t playing, take the brood to
the Art Institute of Chicago (Chapter 11). Make sure to check out the
activity schedule at the Kraft Education Center. For lunch in the Loop, go
to Heaven on Seven (Chapter 10) or the food court on the eighth floor
of Macy’s (formerly Marshall Field’s; see Chapter 12).
After two nights out, your kids probably need a quiet evening at the
hotel (and you probably need an adults-only night out!). Try to arrange 
a baby sitter through the hotel concierge so you can go out for dinner,
maybe in the hotel where you’re staying. Or have takeout food delivered
to your hotel room — see the ethnic eats in Chapter 10 for options.
Day 4
On day 4, explore Lincoln Park Zoo and visit the Farm-in-the-Zoo. After
lunch at Cafe Brauer (Chapter 11), check out the Peggy Notebaert
Nature Museum, with its spectacular butterfly house (Chapter 11). In
the evening, catch a show, such as a musical in one of the North Loop
theater district’s venues or the kid-pleasing Blue Man Group at Briar
Street Theatre in Lincoln Park (Chapter 15).
Day 5
If the sun is shining, head to the lakefront (Chapter 11). Your kids can
splash in the waves under the eyes of lifeguards at Oak Street or North
Avenue beaches. If your family is feeling more active, rent bikes from
Bike Chicago (Chapter 11) at North Avenue Beach. For lunch on the
beach, you can stop at Oak Street Beachstro (% 312-915-4100), on Oak
Street Beach, south of North Avenue Beach.
Alternatively, if the day isn’t beach-worthy, head to the Museum Campus
and the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Field Museum of
Natural History, or John G. Shedd Aquarium (Chapter 11). You can
spend your whole day here, eating in one of the museum cafeterias for
lunch.
Spend your last evening eating and playing games at ESPN Zone
(Chapter 11).
Chicago for Shopaholics
What could be more magnificent than strolling Michigan Avenue, admiring
the shops and people-watching? For the true shopaholic, the experience
Part IV: Exploring Chicago 
232

can’t be beat. The Magnificent Mile, Chicago’s main shopping artery,
makes a straight shot along Michigan Avenue from the Chicago River 
to Oak Street. The shops along the way are countless.
The Magnificent Mile is packed to the gills during summer weekends and
holidays. Follow the cues of real Chicagoans and shop on weekdays to
avoid the jostling crowds.
Before hitting the stores, fortify yourself at the Corner Bakery, 676 N. St.
Clair St. at Erie Street (% 312-266-2570). Along with crowds of locals,
you find dozens of breads, from olive ciabatta to walnut and raisin rolls,
and an array of pastries. Among the many excellent choices are egg frit-
tatas, and oatmeal studded with dried cranberries, almonds, and brown
sugar.
Shopaholics can easily fill a day along Michigan Avenue. Chain stores,
on the high and low ends include Virgin Records, Crate & Barrel, Sony,
Nike, Tiffany & Co., Banana Republic, and Borders. Among the major
department stores are Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus,
Lord & Taylor, and Bloomingdale’s. Designer stores include everything
from Burberry to Chanel. Rounding out the selections are four big malls:
Westfield North Bridge, Chicago Place, Water Tower Place, and 900
North Michigan. (For descriptions and locations, see Chapter 12.)
For more details on the shopping scene, check out the annual shopping
guide on the Chicago Magazine Web site at www.chicagomag.com.
When hunger strikes and you don’t want to waste valuable shopping
time on a sit-down restaurant, head to L’Appetito, an Italian grocery
store in the plaza of the John Hancock Center, 875 N. Michigan Ave.
Order a sandwich to go and head across the street to the courtyard of
the ivy-clad Fourth Presbyterian Church, between East Delaware Place
and East Chestnut Street. Sit by the fountain to enjoy your mini-picnic.
If shopping wears you down, treat yourself to a little pampering at Mario
Tricoci Salon & Day Spa (% 312-915-0960) on the lower level of the
Bloomie’s building, 900 N. Michigan Ave.
If you’re still near Michigan Avenue at dinner, you may want to get
decked out in all your new finery for a gourmet meal. Try the nearby
Bice or Bistro 110 (Chapter 10). After dinner, have a drink at Cru, 888 N.
Wabash Ave. at Delaware Street (% 312-337-4078), a European wine bar
decorated with a zebra-wood bar, gold-tone paint accents, and chande-
liers. Get a sofa next to a fireplace, watch the stylish crowd, and relax.

C
hicago after dark means world-class performances by
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera 
of Chicago. It means improv comedy at The Second City or a
new play or revival at the Steppenwolf or Goodman theaters.
Chicago’s theater district is booming in the North Loop, with
shows that are on their way to Broadway — or touring after a
successful Broadway run.
Going out in Chicago can also be as simple as a game of pool
at a neighborhood pub or a glass of Shiraz in front of the 
ﬁreplace at a wine bar. Chicago has a thriving music scene,
including ﬁrst-rate jazz joints and some of the planet’s best
blues clubs. After reading this part, you’ll be able to navigate
Chicago’s theater, performing arts, and bar and club scenes
with ease.

Five Day Trips
In This Chapter

 Visiting university towns: Evanston and Hyde Park
E
ven with all that the city has to offer, if you’re in town for more than a
few days (or staying with friends and relatives in the suburbs), you
may want to explore beyond the city limits. In this chapter, I describe the
best attractions in the Chicago suburbs and offer day-trip suggestions.
Meeting Oak Park’s Native Sons
Two fiercely independent men — both innovators with controversial
personal lives — left their marks on this quiet, leafy suburb. Frank Lloyd
Wright perfected his Prairie School style of architecture here, leaving
behind numerous examples of his work. Ernest Hemingway was born in
Oak Park and lived here into his late teens. (For locations of the stops on
this tour, see the “Oak Park” map in this chapter.)
Getting there
Suburban Oak Park is 10 miles west of downtown. By train, take the Green
Line to Harlem Avenue, about a 25-minute ride from downtown. To reach
the Oak Park Visitor Center (see the next section), get off at Harlem and
walk 2 blocks north to Lake Street. Take a right onto Lake, and then walk
to Forest Avenue, where you make a left.
By car, take the Eisenhower Expressway (I-290) west to Harlem Avenue
(Ill. 43, about 10 miles from downtown) and exit north. Continue on
Harlem north to Lake Street. Take a right on Lake Street and continue to
Forest Avenue. Turn left. Immediately on the right, you see the Oak Park
Visitor Center.

Taking a tour
The Oak Park Visitor Center, 158 Forest Ave. (% 708-848-1500; www.
visitoakpark.com), is open daily April through October from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and November through March from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can
get maps and guidebooks there, a few blocks from the heart of the his-
toric district and the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio.
Seeing the sights
The must-see attraction in Oak Park is the Frank Lloyd Wright Home
and Studio, which is open by guided tour only (see Chapter 11 for
details). You can also take a guided walking tour of the neighborhood
on weekends at noon, 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. (tour times are more limited
Nov–Feb). You see houses designed by Wright, as well as the charming
Victorian homes that he hated so intensely. Tours last one hour and cost
$12 for adults and $10 for seniors and children 7 to 18 (free for children
under 7). Tours depart from the Ginkgo Tree Bookshop in the Frank
Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, 951 Chicago Ave. (% 708-848-1976). At
the shop, you can also rent an audiocassette for a self-guided tour of the
historic district, available daily from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The rental cost
is $12 for adults and $10 for seniors and children.
Wright fans will also want to visit nearby Unity Temple, 875 Lake St.
(% 708-383-8873). Guided tours that last 45 minutes depart on
Saturdays and Sundays on the hour from 1 to 3 p.m. Admission is $8 
for adults and $6 for seniors, students, and children.
The other two highlights in Oak Park are the restored Hemingway
Birthplace, 339 N. Oak Park Ave. (the home of his maternal grandpar-
ents), and the Ernest Hemingway Museum, down the block at 200 N.
Oak Park Ave., both operated by the Ernest Hemingway Foundation 
(% 708-848-2222; www.ehfop.org). The museum traces the author’s
life from his first job out of high school as a reporter with the Kansas City
Star to his work as a war correspondent in Europe during World War II.
Videos of 15 films made from his work, from A Farewell to Arms (1932) to
Islands in the Stream (1977), are shown. Both places are open Sunday
through Friday from 1 to 5 p.m., and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. An
admission charge of $7 for adults and $5 for seniors and students (chil-
dren under 5 are free) covers both the birthplace and the museum.
Dining locally
If you need to refuel between walking tours, many restaurants, cafes, and
ice-cream shops are on and around Oak Park Avenue, near Unity Temple.
My favorite is the Avenue Ale House, 825 S. Oak Park Ave. (% 708-848-
2801), a tavern that offers steaks, chops, sandwiches, French onion
soup, and giant salads. Eight beers are on tap, and 50 more are available
bottled. An outdoor dining area is open in summer.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Chicago: Five Day Trips 239

Shopping in the Historic Village of Long Grove
Nestled among the northwest suburbs is Long Grove Village. Settled 
in the 1840s by German immigrants, Long Grove has preserved its old-
fashioned character and makes a fine day trip for those looking for a
break from the big-city noise and commotion. You feel like you stepped
into a rural village at the turn of the 20th century. Set on 500 acres of oak
and hickory tree groves, Long Grove is a browsers’ and shoppers’ desti-
nation, and special events throughout the year keep the businesses hop-
ping. The historic buildings contain more than 100 specialty shops,
galleries, and restaurants.
Getting there
Long Grove is about 30 miles northwest of Chicago. From the Loop, take
the I-94 tollway north until it separates at I-90, another tollway that travels
northwesterly. Follow I-90 until you reach Route 53, and drive north on 53
until it dead-ends at Lake Cook Road. Take the west exit off 53 and follow
Lake Cook Road to Hicks Road. Turn right on Hicks Road and then left on
Old McHenry Road, which takes you into the center of town. It’s also pos-
sible to take the Metra to Long Grove (if you’re without a car), though it
involves a cab ride from Arlington Park or Antioch (10–20 minutes). For
information, call % 312-322-6900 (press 3) or visit www.rtachicago.com.
Taking a tour
The Long Grove Tourist Information Center, near the Fountain Square
(% 847-634-0888; www.longgroveonline.com), has information about
events in town. You can pick up a map showing the locations of local
businesses — many of the streets are small and winding, so addresses
alone won’t be of much help.
Seeing the sights
The village hosts several cultural and entertainment events, festivals,
and art fairs during the year. The annual Strawberry Festival is the
biggest, held during the last weekend in June. An Apple Festival is held
in October, and a Chocolate Festival is held in May.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: Chicago Nightlife

Wide lawns, narrow minds
At one time, the Oak Park city fathers shunned one of their most famous sons, Nobel
laureate Ernest Hemingway. They apparently took umbrage at his supposed descrip-
tion of Oak Park as a town of “wide lawns and narrow minds.” Today, all seems to be
forgiven — the community welcomes visitors to Ernest Hemingway Museum, to tours
of the Hemingway Birthplace, and to an annual festival that includes readings, a
“Papa” lookalike contest, and other shenanigans.

Don’t miss the Long Grove Confectionery, 220 Robert Parker Coffin Rd.
(% 800-373-3102), one of Chicago’s last remaining candy companies,
where you can eat hand-dipped chocolate-covered strawberries in the
summer and gigantic caramel apples in the fall. Another standout is the
Pine Cone Christmas Shop, 210 Robert Parker Coffin Rd. (% 847-634-
0890), a year-round wonder of decorated trees and Charles Dickens 
villages.
Dining locally
For lunch, stop at Village Tavern, 135 Old McHenry Rd. (Route 22) at
Country Lane (% 847-634-3117), a Long Grove institution offering
soups, sandwiches, and other comfort food.
Discovering Evanston’s College-Town Charm
Northwestern University contributes to the liberal, intellectual culture 
of Evanston, Chicago’s oldest suburb — and one of the most scenic.
Evanston manages to combine the peaceful feeling and green space of 
a suburb with the culture and lively atmosphere that you expect of an
urban center. Evanston’s downtown offers sophisticated dining and
shopping. From downtown Chicago, the drive to Evanston on Lake Shore
Drive and Sheridan Road takes about 25 minutes. But time your trip,
because at rush hour, it can take much longer — up to 45 minutes.
Getting there
By car from the Loop, drive north on Lake Shore Drive to Sheridan Road.
Continue north on Sheridan. As you enter Evanston, Northwestern
University is located along the lakeshore, on your right.
By public transport, take the Metra North train line from Northwestern
Station in the Loop to the Davis Street stop, and walk east on Davis Street
into the heart of downtown Evanston. The ride takes about 20 minutes.
(See Chapter 8 for information on Metra.)
Taking a tour
Lighthouse Park, 2601 Sheridan Rd. at Central Street (% 847-328-6961),
is the site of a lighthouse built in 1873 after the wreck of the Lady Elgin.
Nature-center tours, a wildlife trail, a small museum, and an experimen-
tal greenhouse are all part of the park. Tours of the lighthouse start at 2,
3, and 4 p.m. on weekends from June to September. Admission to the
lighthouse is $5 for adults and $3 for seniors and students, but kids
under 8 are not allowed for safety reasons.
Seeing the sights
Relive college life at Northwestern University — the lakefront campus is
worth wandering for a couple of hours. From Sheridan Road, turn toward
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Chicago: Five Day Trips 241

the lake on Campus Drive, and park in the lot that fronts Sheridan Road.
From there, walk down Campus Drive toward the lake into the heart of
the campus. Be sure to check out the stained-glass windows at Alice
Millar Chapel and the art at Mary and Leigh Block Gallery during 
your walk.
The former mansion of Charles Gates Dawes, 225 Greenwood, now houses
the Evanston Historical Society (% 847-475-3410; www.evanston
historical.org), which gives free tours of this century-old national
landmark. Dawes, a wealthy financier, served as vice president under
Calvin Coolidge and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925 for his smooth
handling of German reparations on behalf of the League of Nations follow-
ing World War I.
Dining locally
While on the Northwestern campus, head to the Norris Student Center
near the lake for snacks or ice cream. To experience Evanston’s bohemian
side, grab a cup of coffee or enjoy breakfast or lunch at Blind Faith Café,
525 Dempster St. (% 847-328-6875), where organic and vegetarian spe-
cialties include scrambled tofu, huevos rancheros, granola, and pancakes.
Stop in, soak in the atmosphere, and feel healthier by the minute.
Ambling Up the North Shore: 
Wilmette and Environs
A long string of suburbs run along Lake Michigan going north from
Chicago; many of them are among the nation’s wealthiest zip codes. 
As a friend of mine put it as we strolled Lake Forest, passing one luxury
car after another: Either everyone should live like this, or no one should
live like this!
Getting there
By car, take Lake Shore Drive out of the city, which turns into Sheridan
Road. Sheridan winds through the campus of Northwestern University 
in Evanston and into the upper-crust North Shore suburbs of Wilmette,
Kenilworth, and Winnetka. (You’ll recognize them by the multimillion-
dollar homes that flank the road.)
Taking a tour
Admission is free at the Baha’i House of Worship, 100 Linden Ave. at
Sheridan Road (% 847-853-2300), a gleaming stone temple designed by
the French-Canadian Louis Bourgeois and completed in 1953. Essentially
a soaring nine-sided 135-foot dome, draped in a delicate lacelike facade,
the temple reveals the eastern influence of the Baha’i faith’s native Iran.
Surrounded by formal gardens, it is one of seven Baha’i temples in the
world, and the only one in the Western Hemisphere.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: Chicago Nightlife 
242

The dome’s latticework is even more beautiful as you gaze upward from
the floor of the sanctuary, which, during the day, is flooded with light.
Temple members offer informal tours of the building to anyone who
inquires; older children and adults with an interest in architecture will
get the most out of a tour of the interior. Not only is the temple itself
really a sight, but the drive on Sheridan Road is one of the most beauti-
ful in the Chicago area. The visitor center is open daily May through
September 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and October through April 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The temple is open daily from 7 a.m., and devotional services are held
Monday through Saturday at 12:15 p.m. and Sunday at 1:15 p.m. (with
choral accompaniment).
A word of caution if you’re driving: The temple seems to appear out of
nowhere as you round a particularly tight curve on Sheridan Road, and
it can distract even the most focused of drivers. Take it slowly, and wait
until you’re safely parked before gazing skyward.
Seeing the sights
If you’ve made it up to the Baha’i Temple, take a stroll across Sheridan
Road to Gilson Park for a taste of north-suburban life. Check out the
sailors prepping their boats for a lake tour, families picnicking, and kids
frolicking on the sandy beach. Access to the beach is restricted in the
summer (the locals like to keep the Chicago riffraff out), but in the fall
and spring you’re welcome to wander (just don’t expect to take a dip in
the frigid water). You’ll have a wonderful opportunity for a photo either
in front of the lake or on one of the small grassy dunes.
Dining locally
Breakfast is served all day at Walker Bros. Original Pancake House, 153
Green Bay Rd. (% 847-251-6000), a favorite North Shore breakfast spot.
Expect a long wait on weekends. Top choices are apple pancakes (a kid
favorite), German pancakes served with fruit, and oven-baked omelets.
The restaurant serves lunch and dinner, too.
Hanging Out in Hyde Park
Anchoring Chicago’s Hyde Park neighborhood is the Museum of Science
and Industry, a perennial favorite with kids and one of Chicago’s most
popular tourist attractions. What many visitors don’t know is that the
museum is located in a leafy neighborhood that is also the home of the
sprawling 175-acre campus of the University of Chicago. Many fine
attractions sit amid the Gothic architecture and tree-lined streets of the
university campus. (For the locations of the attractions in this section,
see the “Hyde Park” map in this chapter.)

Getting there
By car, take Lake Shore Drive south to 59th Street. Follow 59th Street
west (you pass the Museum of Science and Industry) into the heart of
the University of Chicago campus (59th Street and Ellis Avenue). The
drive takes about 20 minutes from downtown.
By train, you can reach Hyde Park from downtown in 15 minutes with
Metra. Trains run at least every hour Monday through Saturday from
5:15 a.m. to 12:50 a.m. and Sundays and holidays from 5 a.m. to 12:55 a.m.
Pick up the train at Randolph and Michigan, Van Buren and Michigan, or

Roosevelt and Michigan. The 55th-56th-57th Street Station is nearest the
Museum of Science and Industry; the 59th Street Station is nearest the
University of Chicago campus. Fare is about $2. (See Chapter 8 for infor-
mation on Metra.)
By bus, the no. 6 Jeffrey Express from the Loop takes about 30 minutes.
Pick up the bus on Wacker Drive on weekdays from 5:30 a.m. to 10:30
p.m., and on weekends and holidays from 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Another
way to go is local bus no. 1, which originates at Union Station on Jackson
Boulevard and Canal Street.
By taxi, the fare to Hyde Park from downtown is about $20.
Taking a tour
Fans of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Prairie School architecture will want to see
the 1909 Robie House, 5727 S. Woodlawn Ave. (% 773-834-1847), a mas-
terpiece of 20th-century architecture. The house is undergoing a mas-
sive renovation not slated for completion until 2010. Although the house
is open during the process, your photos may include lots of scaffolding!
Forty-five-minute tours start at 11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m. on weekdays
and every half-hour from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on weekends. Admission is
$12 for adults, $10 for seniors and children 7 to 17. The former three-car
garage (a rarity at the time) houses a gift shop stocked with Wright
items.
Seeing the sights
For details on the main attraction, the Museum of Science and Industry,
see Chapter 11.
About 10 blocks west of the Museum of Science and Industry on the
campus of the University of Chicago is the stunning Rockefeller
Memorial Chapel, 5850 S. Woodlawn Ave. (% 773-702-2100). The Gothic
chapel, built in 1928, is home to the world’s second-largest carillon,
donated by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in memory of his mother, Laura, in
1932. Choir concerts, carillon performances, and other musical pro-
grams are presented throughout the year, usually for a small donation.
The building is open to the public daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., except
during religious services.
Also on the campus of the University of Chicago is the Oriental Institute
Museum, where you find mummies, gold jewelry, and other treasures 
of ancient Egypt, Syria, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. (See
Chapter 11 for details on this free museum.)
Before his death in 2005, Nobel Prize–winning novelist Saul Bellow occa-
sionally returned to the Chicago-area neighborhoods that he wrote
about in novels such as Herzog. One of his favorite stops was the
Seminary Co-op Bookstore, 5757 S. University (% 773-752-4381). 
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Chicago: Five Day Trips 245

This rambling bookstore has an amazing array of titles and is a treasure-
trove of academic and scholarly books.
Dining locally
For lunch, travel north to Mellow Yellow, 1508 E. 53rd St. (% 773-667-
2000), where you can get a bowl of Cincinnati-style five-way chili.
University of Chicago students and faculty members go to this Hyde
Park institution for potent chili (including a vegetarian version) and to
linger over coffee and dessert. Quiche and hamburgers are other reliable
choices.

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene
In This Chapter
 Keeping up with the hottest groups and spaces
 Finding out what’s on when
 Tracking down hot tickets
 Getting your theater, opera, or symphony fix
C
ulture is alive and accessible in Chicago. The performing-arts 
scene — theater, symphony, opera, and dance — keeps things hop-
ping just about every night, making Chicago a city that certainly doesn’t
sleep much.
With such fixtures as the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Joffrey Ballet of Chicago,
Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the
question is not so much “Should we see a performance?” as “How many 
of these fabulous performances can we see?”
Chicago’s thriving theater scene offers something for everyone, from
flashy musicals to intimate dramas. Because Chicago audiences have a
knack for mimicking the reactions of their Broadway audience counter-
parts, the city has become a favorite pre-Broadway testing ground. Most
recently, the success of shows such as Spamalot in Chicago has led to
those shows getting a chance on Broadway.
This chapter reveals the best of the local offerings and other helpful
details, such as how to get tickets and find pre-theater dining.
Be sure to check out “The Loop after Dark” and “Lincoln Park and
Wrigleyville after Dark” maps in Chapter 16 to locate this chapter’s 
listings.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Chicago’s performing-arts scene is centered on the Loop, with another
cluster of theaters on the city’s North Side. The theater scene is changing

faster than you can shout “Bravo!” Not so long ago, the Loop was coma-
tose after business hours. No more. Lively bars and bistros, hotels, and a
number of theaters have pumped new life into the area.
Be sure to check out the “Dining before or after the show” sidebar for
tips on where to eat.
Taking a look at Chicago’s hot performing-arts spots
The Chicago Theatre added an intimate, 281-seat theater on its lower
level and opened it with a long-running Chicago favorite (and Guinness
World Records record-holder for the longest-running play in U.S. theater
history), Shear Madness.
The LaSalle Bank Theatre (formerly the Schubert) was refurbished in
2005 and reopened with a fresh new look. Built in 1906 as a home for
vaudeville, it books mostly big-name musicals and sometimes, comedy
performers. (If you’re interested in those big musicals, check out www.
broadwayinchicago.com to see a schedule of the latest shows). In late
2006, the Hampton Inn opened a boutique hotel on top of the theater,
the Hampton Majestic (Chapter 9).
Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for Music and Dance, 205 E.
Randolph Dr. (% 312-334-7777; www.madtc.com), a 1,500-seat facility in
Millennium Park, has a stark aesthetic but wonderful sightlines, thanks
to its stadium seating, and hosts a full slate of performances from its 12
resident companies. From classic opera such as Le nozze di Figaro by
Chicago Opera Theater, to modern dance by River North Chicago Dance
and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and jazz dance by Giordano Jazz
Dance Chicago, this theater and dance space boasts performances that
are worth checking out.
The Goodman Theatre is in an attractive building on Randolph and
Dearborn streets (you’ll recognize it by the exterior panels that change
colors, creating a mosaic effect). The building was a total-gut rehab of
the historic Harris and Selwyn theaters. The focal point is the 830-seat
main-stage theater, a limestone-and-glass structure in the center of the
block. Completing the complex are a 400-seat studio theater, two restau-
rants, and retail space.
Two other prominent Loop theaters are the Cadillac Palace Theater and
the Ford Center for the Performing Arts/Oriental Theater. The Palace,
connected to the hip Hotel Allegro, is a refurbished 1926 vaudeville
house that offers 2,400 seats and stages first-run and touring Broadway
musicals. The Oriental features a fantastical Asian décor; today, both
theaters book major touring shows.
The Lookingglass Theatre Company also has a prominent space, in
Water Tower Works. This convenient location on the Magnificent Mile
next door to Water Tower Place has two stages to showcase the com-
pany’s distinctive physical style.

248

Visitors to Navy Pier will find the Chicago Shakespeare Theater — an
intimate 550-seat space patterned after the Swan Theatre at Stratford-
upon-Avon in England.
Despite all the change in Chicago’s theater scene, you can rely on some
constants. A robust contingent of long-running shows play here. Some of
the most popular include Late Night Catechism (at Royal George Theatre
Center), Blue Man Group (at Briar Street Theatre) and Tony and Tina’s
Wedding (at Piper’s Alley, 210 W. North Ave.; % 312-664-8844).
Getting hip to theater etiquette
Ready for a big night at the theater? Before you face the bright lights,
you may want to know a few things. First, some general tips:
 Don’t use cameras or camcorders in theaters. Taping is prohibited
by law.
 Don’t talk during a performance. (Not that you’d ever do that!)
 Do shut off all beepers and cellphones. (And for goodness’ sake, if
yours goes off, don’t answer it!)
Chicago is a relaxed Midwestern city. Patrons of the theater and of theater-
district restaurants dress relatively informally. In most cases, a sweater
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 249
Dining before or after the show
I prefer dining before a show because sitting in a theater with a growling stomach for
two hours is no fun. (I wind up thinking about food more than the entertainment in front
of me!) Whether you choose to dine before or after the show, I have recommenda-
tions for you.
Many venues cater to the theater crowd and are accustomed to getting diners in and
out on time. A number of quality restaurants, such as Atwood Café and Trattoria No. 10
(Chapter 10), are within walking distance of the Loop theaters. Other good options are
Petterino’s, 150 N. Dearborn St. at Randolph Street (% 312-442-0150), a steakhouse in
the Goodman Theatre building (call early for reservations), and 312 Chicago, 136 N.
LaSalle St. at Randolph Street (% 312-696-2420), an Italian restaurant in flashy Hotel
Allegro.
If you’re more comfortable eating after the show, Chicago has plenty of restaurants
whose kitchens stay open late. Standouts open until at least 1 a.m. include Bin 36,
Café Iberico, Jake Melnick’s, Kamehachi, Nine (open until 3 a.m. on Sat!), and Tango
Sur. See Chapter 10 for descriptions of all these spots.
If you crave more entertainment, nightclubs (Chapter 16) usually are just getting up to
speed around the time the curtain falls. Some clubs also provide good food late at
night. One notable example is Green Dolphin Street, 2200 N. Ashland Ave. at Webster
(% 773-395-0066; www.jazzitup.com).

and slacks or jeans, perhaps with a light jacket, work for men. For
women, similarly low-key attire is appropriate — pants and shirt or skirt
and blouse.
For most theatergoers, the bottom line is how comfortable they feel
about the appropriateness of what they’re wearing. They’re likely to
dress up for a hot-ticket blockbuster musical and dress down for store-
front repertory. Most prefer the safety of the middle ground to feeling
self-conscious about being over- or underdressed.
Happy news: Ushers in Chicago theaters don’t expect tips. Acknowledging
their help with a thank-you or a pleasant nod or smile is all that’s
required. However, if you battle your way to the bar during intermission,
the beleaguered bartender appreciates your tip.
The show must go on — and on time. Chicago-area theaters tend to be
punctual, and tardy patrons usually must wait to be seated until the con-
clusion of the scene or musical number in progress. Arriving late for the
opera can be especially troublesome. With acts lasting for over an hour,
you’ll find yourself watching on a monitor in the lobby.
Finding Out What’s On and Getting Tickets
Getting connected to the Chicago fine-arts scene requires only a phone
call. The Chicago Dance and Music Alliance information line (% 312-
987-1123; www.chicagoperformances.org), can give you listings of
upcoming events.
Fine arts in the Windy City pick up when the leaves start to fall. The
Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera of Chicago begin
their seasons in September. The opera concludes its schedule in March;
the symphony continues into June. (See “Raising the Curtain on the
Performing Arts,” later in this chapter, for information on all the organi-
zations mentioned in this section.)
Area dance troupes are active all year. Highlights of their seasons
include performances at the Ravinia Festival in late summer (see the
“Bach in the ’burbs” sidebar in this chapter) and at the annual month-
long festival Dance Chicago, which takes place at the Athenaeum
Theatre (% 773-935-6860; www.dancechicago.com) in autumn. Other
noteworthy happenings are Joffrey Ballet of Chicago’s Nutcracker over
the holidays and the Hubbard Street Dance Chicago’s spring engage-
ment. For all other dance news, check the Chicago Dance and Music
Alliance information line at % 312-987-1123 or visit www.chicago
performances.org.
In addition to the Ravinia Festival, summer traditions include concerts
by the Grant Park Symphony and Chorus, which now take place in the
Frank Gehry–designed Pritzker Pavilion. Featuring Gehry’s signature sin-
uous lines, the pavilion is surrounded by dramatic ribbons of curved

steel. The Grant Park Symphony will not only look better than ever, it
should sound great, too — thanks to a state-of-the-art sound system.
Concerts are held Wednesday through Sunday, with most performances
beginning at 7:30 p.m. Seats (about 4,000 of them) are reserved for sub-
scribers, but unclaimed places are offered to the public 15 minutes
before the concert starts. There’s also plenty of lawn seating; so bring a
blanket and enjoy a picnic dinner.
Chicago’s vibrant theater scene is in a constant state of flux, with open-
ings, closings, revivals, and extensions. Useful tools to help you scope
out a show are the Chicago Tribune (www.chicagotribune.com),
Chicago Sun-Times (www.suntimes.com), and Daily Herald (www.
dailyherald.com), which offer comprehensive weekly listings in their
Friday entertainment sections. The papers also run reviews of larger
shows around town; for older reviews, check their Web sites. Other reli-
able sources of reviews and commentary are Chicago (www.chicago
mag.com) and North Shore (www.northshoremag.com) magazines. To
find out about out-of-the-mainstream performances, pick up the Chicago
Reader (www.chicagoreader.com) and New City (www.newcity
chicago.com), the leading free alternative newspapers. These tabloids
cover nearly every upcoming production, from traveling Broadway 
musicals to avant-garde performance art.
Some Chicago theaters have specially designed performances (usually
on weekdays, or weekend matinees) that cater to families. These shows
often offer discounted children’s tickets or special discounts for large
groups. You can find out about these performances in the papers (see
“Finding Out What’s On and Getting Tickets” earlier in this chapter). You
can also get details on kid-friendly productions from the League of
Chicago Theatres (% 312-554-9800; www.chicagoplays.com).
If you’re surfing the Web, check out the following sites, which bring the
Chicago theater world to your fingertips:
 www.metromix.com, supported by the Chicago Tribune
 www.centerstage.net/chicago, run by a group of Northwestern
alumni in association with MediaOne
 http://chicago.citysearch.com, the local CitySearch Web site,
offers valuable theater information and reviews
Getting tickets to symphony, opera, ballet, and theater performances is
largely a function of what’s hot and what’s not. Try the Ticketmaster
arts line (% 312-902-1500; www.ticketmaster.com) and the Ticket
Exchange (% 800-666-0779 or 312-902-1888) — if tickets are available,
you can get them there. Another tactic is to wait until you get to town,
show up at the venue around lunchtime on the day of the performance,
and ask for turn-back tickets; you may luck out.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 251

If you’re unable to land the tickets you want, try talking to the concierge
at your hotel. If that fails, try a licensed ticket agency. Brokers include
Gold Coast Tickets (% 800-889-9100 or 312-644-6446) and Union Tysen
Entertainment Ticket Service (% 800-372-7344 or 312-372-7344).
Supply and demand rule: You could end up paying double or triple face
value (or even more) for those coveted tickets.
Another good tactic is to stop at the box office around noon on the day
you want to see the show. You can often pick up a cancellation. This is
definitely the case at the Lyric Opera, where patrons have a long-standing
tradition of turning in unused subscription tickets at the box office. You
can purchase those tickets and often obtain great seats.

Traveling to the show by El or bus
For $2 (plus 25¢ for transfers), you can travel by bus or El (train/subway) to your venue.
For details on Chicago’s public-transportation system, see Chapter 8. For a map of the
El, see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. Following is a list of transportation
directions to the major venues:

 Symphony Center: Green, Purple, Brown, or Orange line to Adams, or the Michigan
Avenue bus (no. 3, 4, 60, 145, 147, or 151) to the corner of Michigan and Jackson

Bargain hunters have several options for buying discounted tickets:
 The League of Chicago Theatres (% 312-554-9800; www.chicago
plays.com) has a daily telephone listing of discounted shows, as
well as information about upcoming shows and a current theater
guide. The call costs $1 per minute, with calls lasting an average of
three minutes.
 Hot Tix (% 312-554-9800; www.hottix.org), operated by the
League of Chicago Theatres, sells same-day half-price tickets on 
the day of the show for about 125 city and suburban theaters. On
Friday, you can buy tickets for shows throughout the weekend.
Tickets are available starting at 10 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday
and 11 a.m. Sunday at a number of locations, including Water
Works Visitor Center, 163 E. Pearson St.; and at the Chicago
Tourism Center, 72 E. Randolph St., just east of Clark Street.
 The Steppenwolf Theatre Company’s box office (see the listing
later in this chapter) usually has a limited number of half-price
same-day seats.
 The “Tix at Six” program at the Goodman Theatre offers half-price,
day-of-show tickets; many of them are excellent seats that have
been returned by subscribers. Tickets go on sale at the box office
at 6 p.m. for evening performances, or noon for matinees.
 Many theaters offer discounts for full-time students and seniors on
off-peak days during the week. To find out if the show you want is
discounted, call the theater. These specials aren’t always well
advertised, so many low-cost seats go unclaimed.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
Draw back the curtain on this town’s theater scene and you find every-
thing from splashy Broadway musicals to gritty small productions. This
section guides you to the best, organized by neighborhood.
Do you love the string section? Is your secret dream to belt out “La
Donna e Mobile” with the likes of Luciano Pavarotti? Symphony, dance,
and opera lovers find plenty to love in Chicago.

Civic duty
The Civic Opera House has played host to scores of famous operas, and when it comes
to staging great plays, the Civic Theatre is perhaps best known for the 1944 premiere
of Tennessee Williams’s classic The Glass Menagerie. The theater (% 312-419-0033;
www.civicoperahouse.com) is now part of the Civic Opera House. See the
“Opera” section for information on the opera house.

Theater
You’ll likely find yourself headed to one of several neighborhoods that
form the base of Chicago’s theater scene. What follows is the lowdown
on each.
The Loop: An awakening theatrical giant
Chicago’s Loop imports the best and biggest of Broadway’s musicals and
dramas. The largest theaters often play host to extended runs of popular
shows, filling out their schedules with special events and one-night-only
performances by big-name artists. Major Loop theaters include the 
following:
 Auditorium Theatre, 50 E. Congress Pkwy. at Michigan Avenue 
(% 312-922-2110; www.auditoriumtheatre.org)
 Cadillac Palace Theater, 151 W. Randolph St. between North LaSalle
and North Wells streets (% 312-384-1510)
 Chicago Theatre, 175 N. State St. at Lake Street (% 312-443-1130)
 Ford Center for the Performing Arts/Oriental Theatre, 24 W.
Randolph St. at State Street (% 312-782-2004)
 Goodman Theatre, 170 N. Dearborn St. at Randolph Street (% 312-
443-3800; www.goodman-theatre.org)
 LaSalle Bank Theatre, 22 W. Monroe St. at State Street 
(% 312-977-1700)

Oriental Theatre’s reversal of fortune
Among the success stories in the Loop theater revival is the Ford Center for the
Performing Arts, a renovation of the former Oriental Theatre. But the road to success
was long and winding:
1903
On December 30, fire sweeps through the Iroquois Theater killing 603 people
during a Christmas show.
1926
On the site of the Iroquois, the Oriental Theatre opens — one of the first movie
palaces to feature Far East–inspired décor, including turbaned ushers. The 
theater becomes Chicago’s top spot to see first-run films and stage shows. Bob
Hope, Judy Garland, the Three Stooges, and Danny Kaye are among those who
tread its boards.
1970s The theater falls into disrepair and is shuttered, becoming the terrain of the-
atrical ghosts and rodents.
1998
After a makeover, the theater reopens as the Ford Center for the Performing
Arts with a lavish production of the Broadway hit Ragtime.
2005
The theater is home to the kickoff for the award-winning Broadway hit Wicked.

Lincoln Park: The cutting edge
Theaters in Lincoln Park leave the glitzy Broadway shows to larger
venues and focus on original, edgy drama. Steppenwolf Theatre
Company on Halsted Street launched the careers of Joan Allen, John
Malkovich, and Gary Sinise, who often return to direct and act. In 2001,
the Victory Gardens Theater became the third Chicago theater (after
the Steppenwolf and the Goodman) to win a Tony for sustained excel-
lence by a resident theater. It celebrated, in part, with a move to the his-
toric, 299-seat Biograph Theater, 2433 N. Lincoln Ave. (% 773-871-3000).
Its former location at 2257 N. Lincoln Ave. is now known as Victory
Gardens Theater Greenhouse, and is home to smaller resident compa-
nies such as About Face.
Other Lincoln Park theaters offer popular performances by traveling
troupes, such as Blue Man Group at the Briar Street Theatre. Following
are some key Lincoln Park venues:
 Apollo Theater, 2540 N. Lincoln Ave. (% 773-935-6100; www.
apollochicago.com)
 Briar Street Theatre, 3133 N. Halsted St. at Briar Street 
(% 773-348-4000)
 Royal George Theatre Center, 1641 N. Halsted St. at North Avenue
(% 312-988-9000; www.theroyalgeorgetheatre.com)
 Steppenwolf Theatre Company, 1650 N. Halsted St. at North
Avenue (% 312-335-1650; www.steppenwolf.org)
 Victory Gardens Theater at the Biograph, 2433 N. Lincoln Ave. 
(% 773-871-3000; www.victorygardens.org)
Around town: A few notables
Other major theaters around town include
 Chicago Shakespeare Theater, 800 E. Grand Ave. at Navy Pier 
(% 312-595-5600; www.chicagoshakes.com)
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 255
Finding a better seat
Most of Chicago’s grand old theaters have balconies that go way, way up toward the
ceiling — and if you’re stuck in the cheap seats, you’ll be straining to see what’s hap-
pening on stage. Although theaters are strict about checking tickets when you arrive,
the ushers relax during intermission. So scope out empty seats during the first act,
and then move down to better (and much pricier) spots for the rest of the show. (I’ve
had great success with this tactic at the Auditorium Theatre, which is so huge that it
rarely sells out.)

 Lookingglass Theatre Company, Water Tower Works, 821 N.
Michigan Ave., Magnificent Mile (% 312-337-0665; www.
lookingglasstheatre.org)
 Rosemont Theatre, 5400 N. River Rd., in the northwestern suburb
of Rosemont (% 847-671-5100), a top stop for musicals and 
concerts
 North Shore Center for the Performing Arts in Skokie, 9501
Skokie Blvd., in the northern suburb of Skokie (% 847-673-6300),
home to the well-respected Northlight Theater, the Skokie Valley
Symphony Orchestra, and a series of touring acts, including
comics, dance troupes, and children’s programs
Symphony
Tickets to the world-renowned Chicago Symphony Orchestra are
always in demand. (We’re talking one of the great orchestras in the
world, so what do you expect?) Classical is far from the only kind of
music on tap, however. The “Symphony Center Presents” series has
included top jazz, world, Latin, and cabaret artists in recent years.
Performances are held at the Symphony Center, 220 S. Michigan Ave. at
Jackson (% 312-294-3000; www.cso.org). Now entering its second cen-
tury, the symphony reserves most seats for season subscribers — but
don’t fear. You can call in advance for a limited number of tickets or
order tickets over the Web site. Good seats may also be available on the
day of the performance at the box office. Call Symphony Center or stop
by the box office to check availability.
The Chicago Cultural Center, 78 E. Washington St. (% 312-744-6630),
books a number of ensembles throughout the year, including the

Solti and Barenboim: Men with batons
If you try to conjure up the names of multiple Grammy winners, what performers spring
to mind? Perhaps The Beatles, Whitney Houston, or Tony Bennett? How about the late,
great Georg Solti? As the longtime director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO),
Sir Georg Solti won many honors during his illustrious career. His 32 Grammy Awards
make Solti the most decorated musician in both classical and popular music.
After Solti’s death in 1997, Daniel Barenboim from the Orchestre de Paris became the
CSO’s musical director. Barenboim introduced more modern works by 20th-century
composers to the orchestra’s repertoire. But, of course, the ensemble still performs
many of classical music’s greatest hits by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart.
In 2006, the next era of the Chicago Symphony began when Barenboim moved on, and
Bernard Haitink, an Amsterdam-born conductor with an international career spanning
five decades, took the helm.

Opera
The Lyric Opera of Chicago (% 312-332-2244; www.lyricopera.org)
is one of the world’s premier opera companies and performs at the Civic
Opera House, at the corner of West Madison Street and North Wacker
Drive. The Art Deco building is the country’s second-largest opera
house, with 3,563 seats, offering patrons a setting that’s pleasing to the
eye and the ear. Opening night in September remains the quasi-official
kickoff of the Chicago social season, but don’t be scared off by the
snooty factor; audiences here are relatively casual (to the dismay of 
all those opera snobs).
You can always count on a spectacular set and outstanding music at the
Lyric. The season sells out far in advance, but you can usually get turn-
back tickets just before the performance.
Chicago Opera Theater (% 312-704-8414; www.chicagooperatheater.
org) appeals to a broader audience that appreciates its emphasis on
English-language productions, lower prices, and an abundance of avail-
able seats. Performances are at the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater
for Music and Dance in Millennium Park, at 205 E. Randolph Dr., just north
of the Pritzker Pavilion.
Dance
Millennium Park — the high-profile cultural and recreational center in
Grant Park — is home to the Joan W. and Irving B. Harris Theater for
Music and Dance, 205 E. Randolph Drive (just north of the Pritzker
Pavilion), a state-of-the-art 1,500-seat music and dance theater where all
of Chicago’s major dance troupes perform. For complete information on

Rhapsody at Symphony Center: 
Dining before the overture
Symphony Center resulted from a $105-million renovation that connected the original
Orchestra Hall, home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, to the surrounding build-
ings, expanded the stage and seating area, and created an on-premises education
center and restaurant, Rhapsody, 65 E. Adams St. at Wabash Avenue (% 312-786-
9911). The restaurant serves contemporary American cuisine in a warm setting over-
looking a small park. Concertgoers can savor every bite of the signature dessert — a
chocolate brownie with a gooey, molten center, topped with chocolate sorbet and a
treble-clef chocolate leaf — knowing that they’re just steps from the concert hall.

local dance performances, call the Chicago Dance and Music Alliance
information line at % 312-987-1123 or check out www.chicago
performances.org.
Founded in 1956 in New York and transplanted to Chicago, the Joffrey
Ballet of Chicago (% 312-739-0120; www.joffreyballet.org) focuses
on classic works of the 20th century, and experiments with contempo-
rary music by pop stars have made this troupe popular with a wide
range of audiences. The Joffrey continues to draw crowds to its popular
rock ballet, Billboards, which is set to the music of Prince and continues
to tour internationally. The company is usually in town in the spring
(Mar or Apr), October, and December, when it stages a popular rendition
of the holiday favorite The Nutcracker.
Dance lovers have flocked to contemporary dance performances by
Hubbard Street Dance Chicago (% 312-850-9744; www.hubbardstreet
dance.com) since 1978. The 22-member ensemble blurs the lines separat-
ing traditional forms and comes up with a truly American and original
style. You can see elements of jazz, modern, ballet, and theater dance in
their performances. Sometimes whimsical, sometimes romantic, the 22-
member ensemble incorporates a range of dance traditions, from Kevin
O’Day to Twyla Tharp, who has choreographed pieces exclusively for
Hubbard Street. Although the troupe spends most of the year touring, it
has regular two- to three-week Chicago engagements in the fall and spring.
In the summer, the dancers often perform at Ravinia Festival, the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra’s lovely outdoor pavilion in north-suburban
Highland Park.

Bach in the ’burbs
In summertime, music lovers pack their picnic hampers and spread their blankets on
the lawns at the Ravinia Festival (% 847-266-5100; www.ravinia.org) in Highland
Park. The festival runs from mid-June through Labor Day weekend. Ravinia is the unof-
ficial summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; the orchestra plays most
weekends beginning at the end of June. The festival also features performances by the
Joffrey Ballet and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. Other offerings include jazz and
pop performers such as Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Lyle Lovett, and more. A pro-
gram of Saturday-afternoon performances is geared toward kids. Tickets for the lawn
run from $8 to $10; pavilion seating costs $25 to $50. For big names, call well in advance
for tickets.
To get to the festival, take the Metra (% 312-322-6777; www.metrarail.com) com-
muter train from the Loop to Ravinia. The train stops conveniently at the gate and has
schedules to coincide with showtimes.

The Old Town School of Folk Music, 4454 N. Lincoln Ave. between
Wilson and Montrose avenues (% 773-728-6000; www.oldtownschool.
org), covers a variety of indigenous musical forms, from country, folk,
and bluegrass to Latin and Celtic. The school is best known as a training
center offering a slate of music classes, but it also hosts everyone from
the legendary Pete Seeger to bluegrass phenom Alison Krauss. Shows
are reasonably priced, with tickets ranging from $10 to $25. The school’s
home, in a former 1930s library, is the world’s largest facility dedicated
to the preservation and presentation of traditional and contemporary
folk music. The Old Town School also houses an art gallery showcasing
exhibitions of works by local, national, and international artists; a music
store offering an exquisite selection of instruments, sheet music, and
hard-to-find recordings; and a cafe. The school hosts an annual Chicago
Folk and Roots Festival in July in Wells Park at Lincoln and Montrose,
with stage performances and an activity and craft tent for kids. Headliners
are name-brand performers such as Patti Smith. The school maintains
another retail store and a schedule of children’s classes at its first loca-
tion, 909 W. Armitage Ave.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 259
Airwaves in the Windy City
Chicago’s National Public Radio station WBEZ-FM (91.5 FM) is home to Ira Glass’s This
American Life program every Friday night at 7 p.m. and Saturday afternoon at 1 p.m.
On your Chicago TV screen, WGN-TV (Channel 9), part of the Tribune Company media
empire, can fill you in on Chicago’s sports teams’ progress — or lack thereof.
In addition, Wait, Wait . . . Don’t Tell Me!, the weekly, hour-long NPR news quiz show,
is taped most Thursday nights at the Chase Auditorium, 10 S. Dearborn Street. Tickets
are $20, and seating begins at 7 p.m. (The show is taped from 7:30–9:30 p.m.) It’s a
chance to play along and test your current-events knowledge with some of the best
and brightest in the news and entertainment world, while trying to figure out what’s
real and what’s made up. (Laughs abound!) Tickets can be booked in advance at
www.npr.org.

Chapter 16
Hitting the Clubs and Bars
In This Chapter
 Hanging out at Chicago’s best bars
 Feeling the vibes on the music and club scene
 Laughing out loud on the comedy circuit
 Getting fabulous at gay and lesbian bars and clubs
I
s your perfect night out spent in a seedy but hip bar in an up-and-
coming part of town, or nestled in a sofa in a wine bar? Do you want
to dance the night away, or laugh until you cry at a comedy club? Maybe
you’d like to experience the quintessential Chicago hangout — the
neighborhood Irish bar, with patrons quaffing pints as folk singers per-
form ballads? Chicago has whatever gets you going after dark.
The legal drinking age is 21, and bars and clubs in the Lincoln Park area
are especially tough on checking IDs. Some require patrons to be 23 — a
policy aimed at circumventing the use of fake IDs. So if you’re blessed
with a baby face, don’t forget your driver’s license!
When stepping out, consider leaving your rental car in the garage. You
won’t have to deal with parking — which can often be difficult to find —
or assign a designated driver. Instead, travel to your destination by
public transportation or taxi, and return to your hotel by taxi. I don’t
recommend that you ride the bus or take the El late at night.
Hanging Out: Chicago’s Best Bars
Prime areas for bars include River North; the Clybourn Corridor (along
Clybourn Avenue north of West North Avenue); Lincoln Park, especially
along Lincoln Avenue and Halsted Street; Bucktown and Wicker Park;
and the Randolph Street Market District west of the Loop.
Most bars stay open until 1 or 2 a.m. Unless noted otherwise, the bars in
this section don’t charge a cover.

The Loop after Dark
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 261

The popular neighborhood pub Brehon’s, 731 N. Wells St. at Superior
Street, River North (% 312-642-1071), is a good place to shoot the
breeze with the locals. Irish and Chicago memorabilia hang on the walls.
Order a pint, get to talking, and you just may find that the fellow on the
barstool next to you is a Chicago politician.
Celtic Crossings, 751 N. Clark St. near Chicago Avenue, River North 
(% 312-337-1005), is a warm, dark, friendly pub with two fireplaces and
no TV. A diverse crowd of young and old, corporate and the artistically
minded, gathers for quiet conversation over pints of Guinness and Harp.
Go on Sunday evening for the traditional Irish music jam, and you’re
sure to meet some natives of the Emerald Isle.
Baseball fans vent before or after games at Cubby Bear, 1059 W. Addison
St. across from Wrigley Field, Wrigleyville (% 773-327-1662; www.cubby
bear.com). You’ll find pool tables, darts, and TV screens are the focus.
At night, the club is one of Chicago’s premier rock venues, drawing a
youngish crowd. There’s no cover during the day or after games; other-
wise, tickets usually are less than $10 for most music, which really
begins to rock out after 10 p.m.
Cullen’s Bar and Grill, 3741 N. Southport Ave., Lakeview (% 773-975-
0600), is a classic Irish bar with great food, including grilled shrimp
appetizers, huge Caesar salads, mashed potatoes, and the requisite Irish
dishes such as shepherd’s pie. Combine dinner here with a movie at the
old-time Music Box Theatre next door, 3733 N. Southport Ave. (% 773-
871-6607), and you have a perfect evening. Sunday nights are among the
liveliest here.

Get Your Beer Here: Goose Island
Brewery
In the heart of Lincoln Park, Goose Island’s Clybourn Brewery is the perfect spot to
sample the beers produced by Chicago’s best-known brewery. Since 1988, Goose
Island has been brewing up hand-crafted ales and lagers. You’ll find ten drafts to
choose from, and each Tuesday at 6 p.m., the pub premieres a new beer. Food is a
step above the usual pub fare, and those in the know go for the Stilton burger. Also
noteworthy are the prime steak salad and fish and chips, or, for those who just want
a salty snack with their drink, baked Bavarian pretzels or homemade Clybourn pub
chips. You can tour the brewery every Sunday at 3 p.m. for $5. For Cubs fans, there’s
a second location in Wrigleyville, 3535 N. Clark St. (% 773-832-9040). 1800 N. Clybourn
(at the three-way intersection with Sheffield and Willow). % 312-915-0071. www.
gooseisland.com. CTA: Red Line to North/Clybourn. Reservations not required.
Main courses: Lunch $15; dinner $20. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V. Open: Thurs–Sat, 11 a.m.–
10 p.m. (bar stays open until 1 a.m. and a late-night menu is served in the bar);
Sun–Wed, 11 a.m.–10 p.m. (bar open until midnight).

Delilah’s, 2771 N. Lincoln Ave., Lincoln Park (% 773-472-2771), is a punk-
rock bar smack-dab in the middle of yuppie Lincoln Park. Showcasing the
best whiskey selection in town and arguably the most rocking jukebox,
Delilah’s is home to hard-core punk rockers, plus neighborhood regulars.
Fado, 100 W. Grand Ave. at Clark Street, River North (% 312-836-0066),
is a reproduction of a Dublin pub. Traditional Irish music plays nonstop,
and you can order up authentic Irish food and drink plus standard pub
grub, including sandwiches, burgers, fries, and salads. The bar charges a
cover on holidays.
Gamekeepers, 1971 N. Lincoln Ave., Lincoln Park (% 773-549-0400),
appeals to a young, sports-minded crowd intent on watching the game
on big-screen TVs.
Near the heart of Uptown, Holiday Club, 4000 N. Sheridan Rd. (% 773-
348-9600), is home to Chicago’s most diverse jukebox, offering Englebert
Humperdink, Social Distortion, Naked Raygun, and Ray Charles. Holiday
not only shakes out gallons of martinis a night but also has a decent beer
selection. Groups of singles and couples in their 20s and 30s hang out here.
Hopleaf Bar, 5148 N. Clark St. (% 773-334-9851), is considered one of the
best taverns in Chicago by those in the know. Serving excellent Belgian
fare in a casual-cool Euro dining area, the bar offers an extensive Belgian
beer list. Don’t miss the mussels and frites.
Jake’s Pub, 2932 N. Clark St., Lincoln Park (% 773-248-3318), is a Chicago
neighborhood bar on busy Clark Street. More than just a regular haunt
for the local barflies, Jake’s hops on Friday and Saturday nights with an
eclectic mix of regulars, college kids, and people looking for an alternative
to the sports-bar scene. Imported beers, a nicely stocked jukebox, and a
pool table make Jake’s a great hangout.
At Kitty O’Shea’s in the Chicago Hilton and Towers, 720 S. Michigan Ave.
between Balbo and Eighth streets, the Loop (% 312-922-4400), the
brogues are as authentic as the Jameson and Guinness that are on offer.
Most of the waitstaff are hired through an Irish government work-permit
program. You find live Irish entertainment, a jukebox stacked with favorite
Gaelic tunes, a collection of shillelaghs, and Irish pub food such as lamb
stew. Main courses range from about $8 to $12.
Lemmings, 1850 N. Damen Ave., Bucktown/Wicker Park (% 773-862-
1688), is the Bucktown version of Jake’s Pub. A perfect place to escape
the craziness of other overpopulated Bucktown bars, Lemmings exem-
plifies the neighborhood’s laid-back atmosphere.
Matilda, 3101 N. Sheffield Ave., Lincoln Park (% 773-883-4400), is a low-
key hipster (but not hip) meet-market (but not meat-market) bar. The 20-
and 30-something crowd downs drinks while listening to college radio
selections from the jukebox. In two large rooms with ample seating,
Matilda’s serves food and a wide selection of beers. The menu boasts

the famed 1-pound “Heartstopper” burger, plus sandwiches, salads, and
appetizers. The bar offers 30 types of martinis, plus 26 beers on tap —
with a heavy emphasis on Chicago microbrews.
North Beach, 1551 N. Sheffield Ave. at North Avenue, Lincoln Park 
(% 312-266-7842), is a cavernous bar and entertainment complex that
provides outdoor sports indoors. Sand volleyball, basketball, bowling,
table tennis, and miniature golf entertain a youngish, corporate crowd.
North Beach charges a cover on some nights, but you get your money
back via drink specials.
You’ll find a cozy atmosphere of booths and tables, as well as an inviting
bar that caters to hipsters at the Rainbo Club, 1150 N. Damen Ave.,
Bucktown/Wicker Park (% 773-489-5999). This place is packed with a
mix of “scenesters” and young professionals on the weekends; you may
have a better experience if you go on a weekday night. Be sure to take
some photos in the antiquated photo booth.
Getting the Beat: Music Venues
Chicago is home to the world’s most popular and widely heard style of
blues and is an important venue for jazz. The city offers just about any-
thing you’re looking for, including music for listening, dancing, and dam-
aging your hearing (not recommended!). You can find comfortable piano
bars and wild clubs with wilder people.
Many music venues don’t get hopping until after 11 p.m., but arrive
between 9 and 10 p.m. to allow time to get seats in the club, have a drink,
and relax before the show. Most clubs continue to pulse until the wee
hours, depending on what’s happening onstage. So you’re not turned
away, call ahead before heading somewhere at 2 a.m.
Catching the blues
Celebrate the women of blues at Blue Chicago, 736 and 536 N. Clark St.,
River North (% 312-642-6261; www.bluechicago.com), which showcases
top female talent. The cover charge ($5–$8) is good for both locations.

Late-night bites in Lincoln Park
When the Lincoln Park bars shut down at 2 a.m., the action moves to the Wiener Circle,
2622 N. Clark St. (% 773-477-7444). This hot dog stand is no-frills: You shout your order
across the drunken crowd, and the only spots to sit are a few picnic tables out front.
Open until 4 a.m. during the week and 5 a.m. on weekends, the Wiener Circle is the
center of pre-dawn life in Lincoln Park — and I know people who swear that the
greasy cheese-topped fries are the perfect hangover prevention.

B.L.U.E.S., 2519 N. Halsted St. between Wrightwood and Fullerton
avenues, Lincoln Park (% 773-528-1012; www.chicagobluesbar.com),
satisfies the most ardent fans with live music 365 days a year. The dark,
narrow club puts patrons up close to performers. Expect to spend the
evening standing. The cover is $5 to $8.
If Chicago is the body and soul of blues music, then Buddy Guy’s
Legends, 754 S. Wabash Ave. between Balbo and Eighth streets, South
Loop (% 312-427-0333; www.buddyguys.com), is its heart. Everyone
from Eric Clapton to Muddy Waters has stopped in to jam and listen to
the best in blues at this club owned and operated by blues legend Buddy
Guy. Every January, Guy plays a series of shows that sell out early. The
cover charge is usually under $10.
Keep an eye out for Jake and Elwood at the House of Blues, 329 N.
Dearborn St. at Kinzie Street, River North (% 312-923-2000; www.hob.
com). Dan Aykroyd, also known as Elwood, is an owner. The hotel, restau-
rant, bar, and concert venue books a wide variety of acts and stages a
popular Sunday gospel brunch for about $35 with seatings at 9:30 a.m. 
and noon. The cover starts at $10 and goes up to $50 for a big name.
Kingston Mines, 2548 N. Halsted St. between Wrightwood and Fullerton
avenues, Lincoln Park (% 773-477-4646; www.kingstonmines.com), has
two stages’ worth of blues greats. It may not be up to par with Buddy
Guy’s, but it’s certain to satisfy your craving for down-home blues.
Performances last until 4 a.m. on Saturdays. The cover charge is $12
Sunday to Wednesday, $12 on Saturday.
Smoke Daddy Rhythm and Bar-B-Que, 1804 W. Division St., Wicker Park
(% 773-772-6656; www.thesmokedaddy.com), serves dinner in plastic
baskets like your favorite barbecue joint, and tops it off with live music
seven nights a week. The result is great blues and jazz in a laid-back, inti-
mate atmosphere.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 267
A lesson in blues
Chicago grew to be a blues music center in the 1930s and 1940s, when thousands of
Mississippians migrated north for factory work. Blues musicians from the Delta cre-
ated a hybrid form that became known as Chicago-style blues, probably the most pop-
ular and widely heard style of blues. These early musicians captured the rawness of
the Delta style and combined that with a fully amplified sound. In the 1950s and beyond,
Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Big Bill Broonzy, Howlin’ Wolf, and other greats pioneered
what became the early electric Chicago blues, featuring highly amplified harmonica,
slide guitar, and piano. Today, Chicago bluesmen such as Buddy Guy, Lonnie Brooks,
and the “Queen of Chicago Blues,” vocalist Koko Taylor, continue to evolve the
Chicago style. The blues is truly America’s music — in fact, it’s one of America’s only
indigenous art forms — so make sure to catch a show while you’re in Chicago.

Jazzing up the night
Live jazz is performed practically ’round-the-clock, mostly by nationally
known musicians, at Andy’s Jazz Club, 11 E. Hubbard St. between State
Street and Wabash Avenue, River North (% 312-642-6805; www.andys
jazzclub.com). This loud, grungy hangout for serious jazz fans offers
three-hour sets at lunch on weekdays and music throughout the evening
all week. The kitchen stays open late; pizza and burgers are decent. The
cover charge is $5 Sunday through Thursday and $10 and up Friday and
Saturday; no cover is charged during lunch.
Green Dolphin Street, 2200 N. Ashland Ave. at Webster Avenue, Lincoln
Park (% 773-395-0066; www.jazzitup.com), is a retro supper club that’s
slick — and pricey. Stylish patrons in their 30s, 40s, and 50s enjoy seafood
and contemporary American cuisine from a celebrated kitchen and then
head to an adjacent room that accommodates 200 people for live jazz. The
music ranges from headliners, such as Wynton Marsalis, to experimental
artists, plus Latin jazz and big-band music. The cover varies; on Sunday
there is no cover charge. Main courses range from $20 to $30.
Known for great jazz in a historic setting, Green Mill, 4802 N. Broadway
at Lawrence Avenue, near Andersonville (% 773-878-5552; www.green
milljazz.com), was established in 1907 and frequented by mobster Al
Capone. You can hear Latin jazz, big-band jazz, jazz piano, and more. On
Tuesdays and Thursdays, jitterbugging hipsters come in for swing and
big-band music. On Sunday, the club hosts Chicago’s best-known poetry
slam. The cover ranges from free to $8.
Joe Segal, founder of Jazz Showcase, 59 W. Grand Ave. at Clark Street,
River North (% 312-670-2473; www.jazzshowcase.com), has created
this family-friendly venue that books some of the hottest names in the
business. With two performances each night (open to audiences of all
ages) and a 4 p.m. Sunday matinee, this club is ushering in the next gen-
eration of fans. The cover charge is usually $20.
If you’re in the mood for bubbly, Pops for Champagne, 601 N. State in
River North (% 312-266-7677), offers more than 100 labels, plus live jazz
combos. The jazz lounge cover varies.
Rockin’ ’n’ rollin’ to live music
Drawing a 20-something crowd for bands near Wrigley Field is Cubby
Bear (see “Hanging Out: Chicago’s Best Bars” earlier in this chapter), a
popular bar during the day.
A Wicker Park fixture, Double Door, 1572 N. Milwaukee Ave. at North
Avenue (% 773-489-3160; www.doubledoor.com), attracts a broad audi-
ence by inviting edgy new groups to its stage nightly, from hip-hop to
new country. The cover is $5 to $10, more for special performances.

268

Elbo Room, 2871 N. Lincoln Ave. at George Street, Lincoln Park (% 773-
549-5549; www.elboroomchicago.com), defies classification. The eclec-
tic acts range from hip-hop to Goth to rockabilly, and the crowds are
equally diverse. The cover charge is $3 and up; no cover is charged in
the lounge.
Empty Bottle, 1035 N. Western Ave., Bucktown/Wicker Park (% 773-276-
3600; www.emptybottle.com), is the place to see local and national
indie-rock and jazz acts. On the West Side, the Empty Bottle has been 
a bastion of ultracool for quite some time. The bar also features pool
tables and pinball machines, as well as Pabst Blue Ribbon (in a bottle)
for $1.50. The annual Polyester Fest (each fall) is the best time to catch
the interesting mix of local artists along with some national acts. Tickets
rarely cost more than $15.
Tiny Fireside Bowl, 2646 W. Fullerton Ave. between California and
Western avenues, Bucktown/Wicker Park (% 773-486-2700), hosts occa-
sional live music of the hip-hop, punk, and rock genres at 9 p.m. on
Sundays — but it’s still primarily a bowling alley. No cover charge.
One of Chicago’s best and most famous concert venues, Metro, 3730 N.
Clark St. at Racine Ave., Wrigleyville (% 773-549-0203; www.metro
chicago.com), packs in a capacity crowd of about 1,100 people for local
and national acts. (If you’re going to see a popular act, get tickets in
advance to avoid getting stuck outside.) The best bet is to hit the late-
night, 18-and-over shows, when the crowd is subdued and into the music
onstage. Admission varies from $5 to $40 but is usually around $10.
Schuba’s Tavern, 3159 N. Southport Ave. at Belmont Avenue, Lincoln
Park (% 773-525-2508; www.schubas.com), is best known for local and
national folk singers and songwriters and attracts rock and country-
western acts as well. The Harmony Grill, the tavern’s restaurant, has a
capable kitchen that offers inexpensive late-night dining (some dishes
are under $10), including the usual bar appetizers, hearty sandwiches,
thin-crust pizzas, and a small but eclectic selection of entrees ranging
from Southern-style fried chicken to a large Mexican salad called the
“Galexico.” The cover is $4 to $15.
The Vic Theatre, 3145 N. Sheffield Ave. at Belmont Avenue, Lincoln Park
(% 773-472-0449; www.victheatre.com), stages a variety of acts as
well as the popular Brew ’n View (% 773-618-8439), where crowds of
local 20-somethings enjoy second-run movies and an open bar. Cover
prices vary depending on the show; Brew and View movie nights are $5.
Tickling the ivories: Piano bars
An evening spent hanging in a piano bar is a relaxing escape from the
bustle of the city, whether you choose to sit near the piano and
exchange small talk with the performer or crawl into a cozy booth.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 269

Piano bars, and some upscale bars without ivories, lie along the
Magnificent Mile and adjoining streets, especially in hotels such as The
Drake Hotel, the Raphael, and the InterContinental Chicago. Unless indi-
cated otherwise, the piano bars in this section don’t charge a cover.
Coq d’Or in The Drake Hotel, 140 E. Walton St. at Michigan Avenue,
Magnificent Mile (% 312-787-2200), showcases pianists and vocalists
seven nights a week from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Indulge in a martini, a
specialty here, and enjoy the dark, speak-easy atmosphere.
Rush Street is home to Jilly’s, 1007 N. Rush St. at Oak Street, Gold Coast
(% 312-664-1001; www.jillyschicago.com). Jazz trios and piano styl-
ists play this dark room, named after Frank Sinatra’s manager. Photos of
the Rat Pack decorate the walls. This lively place attracts a crowd in
their 30s to 50s.
The upscale Pump Room, in the Omni Ambassador East Hotel, 1301 
N. State Pkwy. at Goethe Street, Gold Coast (% 312-266-0360; www.
pumproom.com), attracts an older crowd. Piano stylists and trios play
smooth, soft standards and there’s a small dance floor. Jackets are pre-
ferred for men. Reservations for the restaurant are strongly recom-
mended. Come right after dinner.
Redhead Piano Bar, 16 W. Ontario St., River North (% 312-640-1000;
www.redheadpianobar.com), is a favorite with the locals and located
near many fine restaurants. This makes a great after-dinner spot.

Chicago’s big music venues
The roar of jet engines from nearby O’Hare greets visitors to the Allstate Arena (for-
merly the Rosemont Horizon), 6920 N. Mannheim Rd., Rosemont (% 847-635-6601;
www.allstatearena.com). The host of Chicago Wolves minor league hockey
team and DePaul University basketball doubles as a concert hall where big-name
artists, from Fleetwood Mac to the Beastie Boys, take the stage. Two levels of seat-
ing in the round arena create a total of 18,500 seats. Renovations intended to improve
acoustics and the views from the seats (some were obstructed) have improved the
venue. Ticket prices vary.
The Riviera Theatre, 4746 N. Racine Ave. at Lawrence Avenue in Uptown (% 773-275-
6800; www.rivieratheatre.com), is a moderately large theater that usually 
books new acts of the MTV variety. It’s a classy venue that attracts a head-bobbing,
standing-room-only crowd.
Just down the street from the Riviera, the Aragon Ballroom, 1106 W. Lawrence Ave.
(% 773-561-9500; www.aragon.com), caters to guitar-heavy rockers and rapping
emcees. With an open floor and festival seating, this venue is not for the faint of heart.

The most striking element of the Zebra Lounge, 1220 N. State Pkwy.
between Division and Goethe streets, Gold Coast (% 312-642-5140), is
its décor. Zebra-skin rugs and pictures of wildlife cover the walls. Go late
and stay for the nightly singalong led by the pianist.
Staying Up Late: The Club Scene
Prime areas for clubs are River North; the Clybourn Corridor (along
Clybourn Avenue north of West North Avenue); Lincoln Park, especially
along Lincoln Avenue and Halsted Street; Bucktown and Wicker Park;
and the Randolph Street Market District west of the Loop.
Clubs generally open late and close in the early morning, so traveling to
and from them by taxi is best.
Used to be that this club offered a taste of post-apocalyptic décor in an
industrial neighborhood, but these days the atmosphere is open and
airy, and a bit more welcoming. Crobar, 1543 N. Kingsbury St. south of
North Avenue, Lincoln Park (% 312-337-5001; www.crobarchicago.
com), is where young, hip patrons wag their tails to trip-hop, techno, and
old-school beats in one of Chicago’s largest dance halls. Cover charge
ranges from nothing to $20.
Level, 1045 N. Rush St. (% 312-397-1045; www.levelchicago.com), is 
a late-night club with an elevated dance floor, and martinis that you 
can order by number. Level 5, for example, is a peach Bellini made with
Grey Goose, peach schnapps, and champagne. The look is sparse and
modern, and no one comes to eat — this is dancing and drinking only.
Cover ranges from $5 to $20.
At Hogs & Honeys, 1555 N. Sheffield Ave. (% 312-377-1733; www.hogsand
honeys.com), you can dance on the bar, ride the mechanical bull, and
enjoy the sounds of Kid Rock on the sound system. Cover is $5; if you’re
brave, you can pay $3 for a ride on the bull.
The music is throbbing, the dancing is rhythmic and the atmosphere is
romantic at Rednofive, 440 N. Halsted St., River West (% 312-733-6699;
www.rednofive.com), where the city’s top DJs spin techno until 4 a.m.
The cover charge is $5 to $20.
Smart Bar, 3730 N. Clark St., Wrigleyville (% 773-549-4140; www.smart
barchicago.com), in the basement of Metro (see “Rockin’ ’n’ rollin’ to
live music,” earlier this chapter), is one of the coolest clubs in Chicago.
The bar often fills when shows end at Metro. The DJs do some serious
spinning. Every night features a different style of music, so ask before
you enter. The bar stays open until 5 a.m. on weekends. There’s no cover
before 11 p.m. during the week; at other times, the cost is $5 to $15.
Dreadlocks and Red Stripe beer abound at the Wild Hare (the original
name was the Wild Hare and Singing Armadillo Frog Sanctuary), 3530 N.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 271

Clark St. between Addison and Roscoe streets, Wrigleyville (% 773-327-
4273; www.wildharereggae.com). Chicago’s premier reggae bar has
hosted such notables as the Wailers and Yellowman. There’s no cover
until 9:30 p.m. on Monday and Tuesday; afterward, the charge ranges
from $7 to $15.
Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
The Second City, 1616 N. Wells St. at North Avenue, Lincoln Park 
(% 312-337-3992; www.secondcity.com), packs a comic punch line —
with a pedigree. Alan Alda, Alan Arkin, Ed Asner, Dan Aykroyd, John
Belushi, John Candy, Dan Castellaneta (also known as “Homer Simpson”),
Chris Farley, Shelley Long, Elaine May, Tim Meadows, Bill Murray, Brian
Doyle-Murray, Mike Nichols, Gilda Radner, Joan Rivers, Martin Short,

Mixing humor and history: The Second
City Neighborhood Tour
Those who like their history sprinkled with improv comedy — and who doesn’t? —
should not miss The Second City Neighborhood Tour. A joint effort between the
Chicago Historical Society and The Second City, these humorous and historic guided
tours of Chicago’s Old Town neighborhood (where the improv theater has had its home
since 1959) take place on Sunday afternoons from April through September.
The tours are more than just fun: You can also gain real insight into the impact of pop-
ular entertainment on the history of Chicago and the role that humor has played —
sometimes unintentionally — throughout the decades.
The walking tours begin at the Historical Society, at Clark Street and North Avenue, and
are led by actors from The Second City. The route starts with a rapid history of America
since 1492, and includes stops at the Old Town Ale House (the favorite bar of many
Second City performers), Chris Farley’s former apartment (above a Mexican restau-
rant on Wells), St. Michael’s Church, Twin Anchors (Frank Sinatra’s favorite rib joint),
and the Crilly Court Apartments. The tours end with a visit to The Second City on Wells
Street.
It’s $15 for the two-hour tours, which begin at 4 p.m. each Sunday. I highly recommend
buying the $31 discounted package deal for the tour plus a show at The Second City
(every tour ticket also allows free admission to the Historical Society galleries). After
the tour, you’ll have time to eat dinner in the Old Town neighborhood, then catch the 8
p.m. performance. You may purchase tickets directly from The Second City box office
at 1616 N. Wells St., over the phone (% 312-337-3992), via The Second City Web site
(www.secondcity.com), or through a link at the CHS Web site (www.chicago
history.org). Advance reservations are recommended, especially for groups of
eight or more.

alumni of The Second City — Chicago’s comic breeding ground — read
like a laundry list of American comedic talent. Some of the alums hail
from the Toronto branch, but they’re all part of this improv factory, one
of the most prolific training grounds in American theater history. You
rarely see a bad show here. Tickets are easy to get, and shows change 
frequently — no doubt you’ll see at least one rising star. You can choose
between two sketch-comedy productions on the main stage and ETC 
(et cetera), a smaller venue. The cover charge runs $8 to $16.
A block away at Zanies Comedy Club, 1548 N. Wells St. between North
Avenue and Schiller Street (% 312-337-4027; www.chicago.zanies.
com), high-caliber comedians treat sold-out houses to the best in
standup. The cover charge is $18 to $20, with a two-item food/drink 
minimum.
ImprovOlympics, 3541 N. Clark St. at Addison Street, Wrigleyville 
(% 773-880-0199; www.iochicago.net), engages the audience as the
talented cast solicits suggestions and creates original performances. 
You pay a $5 to $14 cover charge.
Stepping Out: Gay and Lesbian Scene
The gay and lesbian scene plays out in clubs and bars in the Lakeview
neighborhood (especially along Belmont Avenue) and along North
Halsted Street, also known as Boys Town.
At Berlin, 954 W. Belmont Ave. at Sheffield Avenue (% 773-348-4975;
www.berlinchicago.com), the party doesn’t start until midnight. The
dance club showcases male dancers (sometimes on tables in G-strings).
The room is dark and the music loud. Weeknights, it’s a mostly gay
crowd, and weekends bring a more eclectic group. It’s open nightly, with
a $3 cover Tuesday to Thursday and a $5 cover on Friday and Saturday.
Big Chicks, 5024 N. Sheridan Rd. between Argyle Street and Foster
Avenue (% 773-728-5511; www.bigchicks.com), appeals to the culture-
hungry. The club generally attracts gay men and a few lesbians inter-
ested in checking out the artwork displayed on the bar and bathroom
walls. There’s no cover.
A bank of television monitors cycling through music videos and sporting
events greets visitors to the Closet, 3325 N. Broadway at Buckingham
Street (% 773-477-8533; www.theclosetbar.com). The bar attracts
mostly lesbian regulars. There’s no cover.
A lounge and dance club, Hydrate, 3458 N. Halsted St. at Newport Avenue
(% 773-975-9244; www.hydratechicago.com), opens onto Halsted Street
with garage door–like windows.
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 273

One of Chicago’s best-known gay bars, Roscoe’s Tavern, 3356 N. Halsted
St. at Roscoe Street (% 773-281-3355; www.roscoes.com), has six bars,
a huge dance floor, and antique décor. Check out the patio garden. The
$4 cover applies only after 10 p.m. on Saturday.
Across the street from Roscoe’s, Sidetrack, 3349 N. Halsted St. (% 773-
477-9189; www.sidetrackchicago.com), draws a diverse gay crowd
with its snappy video bar. The patio holds outdoor seating in the
summer. There’s no cover.

and Chicago clichés with my tips on ten Chicago experiences
to avoid. Soon, you’ll be experiencing Chicago as the locals do!

Chapter 17
Ten Oh-So-Chicago
Experiences
In This Chapter
 Experiencing the city like a local
 Sightseeing, shopping, and cheering the best of Chicago
 Going beyond the typical tourist destinations
I
n this vibrant, diverse city, you’ll be faced with a serious dilemma: One
person can’t possibly see and do everything. (Particularly on summer
weekends, when festivals, the beach, and Lincoln Park all beckon, I’d love
to be able to clone myself!) To get you started, this chapter includes a list
of what I consider quintessential Chicago experiences.
Every activity in this chapter qualifies as a local pastime.
Strolling the Lakefront
Chicagoans use the lakefront every possible way: for walking, inline 
skating, biking, running, swimming, picnicking, and playing volleyball.
Whatever you do, be sure not to miss Chicago’s endless blue inland sea.
The lake is a year-round destination. Summers on the lakefront can get
crowded, but that’s part of the fun. Even in winter, you can see hardy
souls out for a run while waves crash onto the shoreline. Most activity
takes place around Oak Street Beach (just north of the Magnificent Mile)
and North Avenue Beach (several blocks north of Oak Street).
Sightseeing on the Chicago River 
and Lake Michigan
By far the best way to scope out the city is by taking a boat tour. My
favorite is the Chicago Architecture Foundation’s “Architecture River
Cruise,” which travels up and down the north and south branches of the
Chicago River. Getting onto the water gives you a fresh perspective on a

city that grew up around a lake and a river. Nothing beats being on the
water on a warm day with the sun glinting off Chicago’s glorious sky-
scrapers and a cool breeze at your back. Other options include dinner
cruises, the “ducks” (amphibian land/water transports), speedboats,
and tall ships. To find a boat trip, see Chapter 11 for more information,
or head for the Michigan Avenue Bridge (Michigan Avenue and the
Chicago River) or Navy Pier, where most tours start.
Shopping on Michigan Avenue
Tourists aren’t the only ones crowding Michigan Avenue on the week-
ends: Chicagoans love to shop. Whether you want to browse, buy, or
people-watch, hit Michigan Avenue. And try, just try, to resist its tempta-
tions, from Niketown to Nordstrom, Burberry’s to Bloomingdale’s. (See
Chapter 12 for more on shopping.)
But don’t get so caught up in retail frenzy that you miss the charming
points of the avenue: Fourth Presbyterian Church, the plaza of the John
Hancock Center, and Water Tower (the actual tower, not the mall of the
same name). And do not — I repeat, do not — miss the best view of the
city from the Michigan Avenue Bridge, looking up and down the Chicago
River at the architectural gems lining the banks. Go at night when the
colored lights shine on the river and the Wrigley Building, and I guaran-
tee you’ll fall in love with Chicago.
Visiting State Street around the Holidays
Between the Daley Plaza Christmas tree, the Christkindlmarket featuring
vendors from all over Germany as well as Chicago, and the windows at
Macy’s (formerly Marshall Field’s), State Street puts on a real show
during the holidays. The unveiling of the Macy’s windows is a much-
anticipated event, and having breakfast or lunch around the gigantic
Christmas tree in the stately Walnut Room is a time-honored tradition
for generations of Chicagoans. (See Chapter 12 for more info.)
Cheering the Cubbies
Wrigley Field is not to be missed. In fact, Chicagoans regularly play
hooky to hang out in the bleachers on a perfect summer afternoon. Eat a
hot dog. Exercise your lungs during the singing of “Take Me Out to the
Ballgame.” Take a kid with you. I’m sure you’ll leave agreeing with me
that Wrigley Field is the most charming ballpark in America. (See
Chapter 11 for more on Wrigley Field.)
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
278

Getting the Blues
This most American of music forms is venerated by Chicagoans, who
keep the blues alive nightly in the city’s clubs. Chicago-style blues is
what most people think of when you mention live blues in a nightclub
setting. You can still find tiny bandstands in smoky bars where musi-
cians jam away on electric guitar, amplified harp (or harmonica to the
uninitiated), piano, bass, and drums. You can find a remarkable range of
clubs, from down-to-earth Buddy Guy’s Legends in the South Loop to
Kingston Mines in Lincoln Park, where musicians perform continuously
on two stages. (See Chapter 16 for more on the blues.)
Hearing Music under the Stars
Ah, summertime. In Chicago, summer is the season for spreading blan-
kets and picnicking on the lawns at the Ravinia Festival, located in sub-
urban Highland Park. Ravinia is one of the nation’s best-known — and
just plain best — summer music festivals. It runs nightly throughout 
the summer and offers Saturday matinee concerts especially for kids.
Ravinia is the unofficial summer home of the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra and also features pop performances. On summer eves, you
can see many people toting picnic baskets to catch the Metra train to
Ravinia from downtown. Grab your own refreshments and join them.
(See Chapter 15 for more on the Ravinia Festival.)
Taking in a Show
Chicagoans love their homegrown theater companies, including the
Goodman (which has a spectacular home in the Loop) and the innova-
tive Steppenwolf Theatre. You can also choose from shows in the revital-
ized North Loop Theater District with its Broadway-style theaters. The
city’s resident Shakespeare troupe is well-loved and makes its home on
Navy Pier. (See Chapter 15 for the Chicago theater scene.)
Riding the El
New York City buried its elevated train decades ago, but the noisy, dirty
El (Chicago’s elevated train), which blocks sunlight from the streets
beneath its tracks, is a quintessential part of Chicago. Even if you have
nowhere in particular to go, hop on the El and ride around the Loop. The
brown line heading south takes you on an up-close-and-personal view of
Chicago’s financial center. (See Chapter 8 for more on the El.)
Chapter 17: Ten Oh-So-Chicago Experiences 279

Discovering Wonders at Chicago’s Museums
Generations of Chicagoans recall certain exhibits at Chicago museums
with nostalgia. I remember Colleen Moore’s Fairy Castle at the Museum
of Science and Industry — the most fantastic dollhouse you’ll ever see.
My brother will never forget the Santa Fe Model Railway at the same
museum. Whatever your fancy, you can find an exhibit about it some-
where among the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, Field
Museum of Natural History, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Science
and Industry, John G. Shedd Aquarium, or Museum of Contemporary
Art. (See Chapter 11 for more on Chicago’s museums.)
Chicago’s Museum Campus is home to a trio of museums — the Field
Museum, Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum, and John G. Shedd
Aquarium — on a landscaped 57-acre area with terraced gardens and
broad walkways. In my humble opinion, the Museum Campus is the
most impressive collection of museums in the most beautiful setting
anywhere in the United States, so don’t miss out!

Chapter 18
Ten Things to Do 
in Bad Weather
In This Chapter
 Making the best of a cold or rainy day
 Hanging out indoors
 Keeping your spirits high when the wind blows
F
ace it: Chicago’s weather can throw you a curveball at any moment.
From sunny and warm to windy and cold, you can easily find yourself
wanting to take shelter from the city’s occasionally inclement weather. If
the weather gets in the way of enjoying Chicago, try one of these indoor
activities.
Taking Tea
For about $30, you can be served in one of Chicago’s finest hotels and
linger for hours over pots of tea, finger sandwiches, scones, and pas-
tries. Civilized, relaxing, and, best of all, sheltered from the storm,
having a civilized, sit-down tea is a great way to while away the day. 
Try The Drake Hotel, the Ritz-Carlton, The Peninsula, or the Four
Seasons. (See Chapter 10 for more on the best teas in town.)
Hitting a Michigan Avenue Mall
Chicago has a unique innovation: the downtown, high-rise mall. The 900
North Michigan, Water Tower Place, Chicago Place, and Westfield
North Bridge malls can keep you warm, dry, and entertained for hours.
(See Chapter 12 for more on shopping.)
Immersing Yourself in the Art Institute
When storms lash the lakefront, head straight for the Art Institute of
Chicago. The museum’s renowned Impressionist collection includes 
one of the world’s largest collections of paintings by Monet. A little

Impressionistic romance is just the thing on a rainy or snowy day. (See
Chapter 11 for details on the Art Institute.)
Luxuriating at a Spa
Indulge yourself in a massage, facial, or manicure at one of Chicago’s
many spas. Ask your concierge for a spa near you, or check out my
favorite, Mario Tricoci Salon and Day Spa, 900 N. Michigan Ave. 
(% 312-915-0960; www.tricoci.com). Also nearby is Kiva, 196 E.
Pearson St. (% 312-840-8120; www.premierspacollection.com),
named after sacred healing places in the Southwest, offering a peaceful,
soothing atmosphere, massage therapy, facials, and spa services.
Reading at a Cafe
Go to Borders on Michigan Avenue across from Water Tower Place, pick
up a book, and head for a comfy cafe. Farther north, in the Southport
neighborhood is a local favorite, Julius Meinl Café, 3601 N. Southport
Ave. (% 773-868-1857; www.meinl.com/southport/home.html). At this
first U.S. cafe by the venerable Viennese coffee and fine food purveyor,
Mr. Meinl himself has had a hand in translating the classic Viennese cof-
feehouse for the U.S. market. Pastries are out of this world — I love the
white chocolate mousse cake with layers of raspberry filling, covered in a
soft and creamy white chocolate icing — and coffee is served to you on 
a silvery tray, accompanied by a small glass of water. Order a steaming
mélange (coffee with milk), settle into a booth in front of the large picture
windows that front Southport Avenue, and enjoy the live music that’s fre-
quently on offer here.
Working Out in a Health Club
Ask your concierge about your hotel’s health-club facilities. If your hotel
doesn’t have its own club, it may have an agreement with a nearby club
that you can visit for a minimal fee. Chicago’s largest athletic club is the
East Bank Club, located in River North at 500 N. Kingsbury (% 312-527-
5800; www.eastbankclub.com). It features a mammoth 25,000-square-
foot cardiovascular room, two large indoor pools, two restaurants, and a
carryout food shop.
Seeing the Stars at the Planetarium
Even in cloudy weather, you can see the stars during the sky shows at
the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum (% 312-922-7827; www.
adlerplanetarium.org). Choose from a tour of the solar system or of
the Hubble Telescope’s view of the visible universe. You can also take a
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
282

voyage to the edge of a black hole. Shows change frequently, so call
ahead for the latest. (See Chapter 11 for details on this museum.)
Catching Up on a Movie
Time it right, and you may even get the matinee rate at one of Chicago’s
many theaters (see Chapter 11 for some listings). To find out what’s on,
call MovieFone at % 312-444-3456 or visit www.fandango.com. Buy
some candy and popcorn and you won’t mind that rain and blowing
wind so much.
One of my personal favorites is the Music Box Theatre, 3733 N.
Southport Ave. (% 773-871-6604; www.musicboxtheatre.com). The
ornate theater opened in 1929 and has a hodgepodge Spanish-Italianate
décor built to suggest that you’re watching a movie in an outdoor plaza
somewhere in Italy. The theater, which shows mostly independent films,
still has its own organist who plays before shows.
During the holidays, the Music Box sponsors a holiday movie marathon
and singalong. In between showings of movies such as White Christmas
and Holiday Inn, the organist and Santa lead the audience in singing
carols. Bring your jingle bells and Santa hat and get into the spirit.
Watching the Weather from the Oceanarium
John G. Shedd Aquarium is home to a 3-million-gallon saltwater ocea-
narium. A wall of windows reveals the lake outside, creating the illusion
of miles of sea. You’ll find beluga whales, dolphins, otters, and seals,
none of which could care less that it’s raining or snowing outside. (See
Chapter 11 for more on the aquarium.)
Going Out for Dinner
When the weather gets bad in wintertime, Chicagoans don’t hole up at
home. You’ll find them overcoming cabin fever by dining at the city’s
many fabulous restaurants. Go out, lounge at the bar, eat a leisurely
meal, and dream of the day that you can run off your meal on the lake-
front. (See Chapter 10 for restaurants.)
Chapter 18: Ten Things to Do in Bad Weather 283

Chapter 19
Ten Chicago Don’ts
In This Chapter
 Keeping it real in Chicago
 Skipping tourist traps
 Spending your money wisely
I
t’s easy to go astray when you’re visiting an unfamiliar city. From
coping with weather hazards to dressing the part, you can make a lot
of missteps before you figure out how to do things the way the locals do.
In this chapter, I reinforce the importance of avoiding tourist traps, and
give you some general advice for your visit to help you get the most
enjoyment out of it. You’ll be amazed at how much fun it is to bring your
kids along, find out about architecture, delve into neighborhoods that
aren’t packed with chain stores and restaurants, and experience some of
the new and exciting activities that Chicago offers, from Millennium Park
to the John G. Shedd Aquarium, and the hot shopping and dining areas
of Bucktown/Wicker Park, Lakeview, Southport Avenue, and more.
Don’t Get Blown Away
True story: Chicago’s famous winds once blew me off my feet and would
have rolled me into traffic on Lake Shore Drive if it were not for a light
pole, which I (fortunately) hit and clung to for dear life. It seems there’s
one day each year, usually in February or March, when the Windy City
becomes downright hazardous. I once saw a woman blown off her feet
while crossing Michigan Avenue — she landed flat on her back in the
middle of an intersection. Don’t get yourself into that position. (On such
days, you should definitely avoid construction sites, where building
materials may come loose.) Severe winds don’t usually last for more
than a day. Take shelter, and see Chapter 18 for ideas on how to stay
entertained inside until the winds subside.
Don’t Fall Prey to the Chain-Store Mentality
Like most large cities, Chicago is bursting with chain stores and restau-
rants, from Niketown to the Hard Rock Cafe. Now, I’m not against these

places in every circumstance. Yes, I have seen a great concert at the
Hard Rock, and yes, I have purchased sporting goods at Niketown, but
please make an effort to strike out into less-charted territory during
your stay. So many amazing stores, restaurants, and activities can only
be experienced in Chicago, from riding the El to eating a gigantic sundae
in a conch shell at Margie’s Candies, to viewing the skyline from the 
15-story Ferris wheel at Navy Pier. It’s all about having an authentic
Chicago experience, as opposed to having an experience you could have
in any one of a dozen big cities.
Don’t Relive Tired Clichés about Chicago
Yes, gangsters did live here in the 1920s; and yes, our politics are
stormy; and yes, a big fire caused by a cow did ravage the city once; and
yes, we had stockyards that weren’t particularly clean and nice; and yes,
Michael Jordan did play here; and yes, Oprah does live here. But don’t
fall prey to a dozen gangster tours and spend all your money on Michael
Jordan jerseys. You’ll miss the cosmopolitan, forward-thinking place that
Chicago is today. Head for Millennium Park, John G. Shedd Aquarium on
Museum Campus, and the lovely tree-lined streets and refurbished
brownstones of Lincoln Park, Lakeview, and Wrigleyville to see the
people and places that are making Chicago great today.
Don’t Fear That Appreciating 
Architecture Is beyond You
One of Chicago’s main claims to fame is its skyline, and you’d be missing
out by not learning a little about the buildings and architects who
shaped our city. The docents for the Chicago Architecture Foundation’s
tours do a good job of making the tours enjoyable for visitors with all
levels of architectural knowledge. In addition to pointing out famous
buildings — Marina City, the Civic Opera House, the Sears Tower, and
the Merchandise Mart, to name a few — they approach the sites themati-
cally, explaining, for example, how Chicagoans’ use of, and attitudes
toward, the river have changed in the past two centuries. You’ll hear not
just about architectural styles, but stories that bring the city to life.
On a recent tour of South Michigan Avenue, a docent pointed skyward
and asked us, “Did you notice that buffalo statue on top of that sky-
scraper?” It turns out that not only was there a buffalo statue perched
on top of a skyscraper, but the skyscraper next door was topped by
something just as interesting — a blimp port. Turns out that back in the
day, blimps were thought to be the next great mode of transportation,
and buildings installed landing ports in anticipation. Who knew? These
and many more fascinating facts come to light during a tour.
Chapter 19: Ten Chicago Don’ts 285

Don’t Leave Your Kids at Home
Of the largest cities in the United States, I think Chicago is easiest to 
navigate with kids in tow. Our streets are busy but not impossibly con-
gested, and you don’t have to drive long distances on snarled freeways
to get to attractions. Cultural attractions that please kids as well as
adults are many, from the Museum of Science and Industry to Navy Pier
to Millennium Park and Wrigley Field.
In the wintertime, stay in a hotel with a pool, and you’ll find yourself in
good company: Plenty of Chicago families check themselves in for the
weekend to swim and escape cabin fever (and the city’s great hotel deals
in Jan and Feb make these getaways completely affordable).
Chicago has the added benefit of the lakefront and a long string of emer-
ald parks — perfect for letting kids blow off steam after a day of touring.
Midwesterners have a friendly attitude that’s laid-back enough to put
most parents and kids at ease, so bring the kids along. Soon you’ll find
that you’ve established some family lore — from exploring the U-505 at
the Museum of Science and Industry, to having brunch at Macy’s Walnut
Room, to standing in the spray of Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park.
Don’t Choose Vanity over Practicality
In the wintertime, even the most stylish Chicagoans dress for the
weather. Parkas, scarves, boots with rubber soles, fuzzy hats, and mit-
tens are all very much required here. If you’re teetering along icy side-
walks in impossibly high heels and you’ve left your hat in your hotel
room for fear of ruining your carefully coiffed hair, Chicagoans are going
to look at you cross-eyed. Wear sensible boots so you don’t slip and
break your neck, and for goodness’ sake, cover your head!
Don’t Be Afraid to Venture into Neighborhoods
Some of the most authentic Chicago experiences can’t be found along
Michigan Avenue. Hyde Park’s unique combination of academia and
magnificent mansions, Andersonville’s Swedish bakeries, Lincoln
Square’s German delicatessens, Pilsen’s Mexican murals and taquerias,
Greektown’s candle shops and outdoor rooftop restaurants, Devon
Avenue’s Indian “chat” (or snack) shops in Rogers Park, Uptown’s his-
toric theaters and Asian grocery stores — you have a whole world of
neighborhoods to explore. Try to visit at least one to gain an under-
standing of how Chicagoans really live.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
286

Don’t Be Naive about Dangerous Areas
Now that I’ve encouraged you to explore, I have to add a caveat: Don’t
be naive about the city. Hyde Park, for example, is one of Chicago’s most
interesting neighborhoods and definitely merits a visit, but venture
beyond its borders, and you’ll find yourself in some of the most blighted,
crime-ridden areas of the city. It’s no joke. Keep your head on straight,
don’t wander into new areas at night, and keep within established neigh-
borhood borders. When in doubt, turn back to an area that you know 
is safe.
Don’t Get Stuck in Tourist Traps
Chicago can drain your resources, from pricey museum admissions to
pricey wares on the Magnificent Mile, to pricey meals in tourist areas
(especially those tourist areas where you’re a captive audience, such as
Navy Pier). Even if you’re not on a tight budget, you don’t want to feel
like you’re being taken advantage of. (And you may not want to waste
money on an overpriced cup of coffee when you could spend it on a 
souvenir in the Chicago ArchiCenter gift shop.) Use this book and its
Bargain Alert icons to save yourself some cash. Take advantage of
museum free days. Stock up on drinks and snacks at local grocery stores
before you head to Navy Pier. That way, you can eat, drink, and be merry
that night with dinner at the Atwood Café and a show in the North Loop
Theater District — a much better use of your money.
Don’t Go Fest-Crazy
In the summertime, Chicago becomes one big festival. By the middle of
summer, one seems to blend right into the next — from Puerto Rican
Fest to garden walks (really, just neighborhood street festivals in dis-
guise) to music fests from country to gospel. Some of these festivals are
worthwhile (Jazz Fest, Blues Fest, and the Air & Water Show come to
mind) and some are not (Taste of Chicago is an example). There’s a
point when many festivals become one sticky, humid, mess of humanity,
blended with the smells of grilled meat, funnel cakes, and Port-A-Potties.
Yuck! Plan your fest-going carefully. Go early in the morning, leave before
the crowds arrive, and head for another attraction. Think of it this way:
If everyone else in Chicago is at Grant Park for Taste of Chicago, you’ll
have the Field Museum all to yourself.

Where to Get More Information
Everything you need to know, you can find in this book. But if you want
to be really thorough, you can arm yourself with stacks of free informa-
tion, such as maps; brochures; calendars of events; and schedules for
sports, theater, concerts, and other happenings in the Windy City.
Contacting and visiting tourist offices
Chicago has two major sources of tourism information. Information from
the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau isn’t as comprehensive
