Dedication
This book is dedicated to the eBay entrepreneurs who have a zest for knowl-
edge and the “stick-to-it-iveness” to follow through on their projects and stare
success straight in the eye. It’s dedicated also to those who are convinced
that get-rich-quick schemes don’t work and that, in the long run, hard work
and loving what you do get the job done and lead to financial achievement
and contentment.
Good luck in your endeavors. I know this book will help you get started.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Updating a book like this is a challenge. Lots of people have helped, but 
the lion’s share of assistance comes from the encouragement that I receive
from the eBay community and those I’ve met when “doing it eBay.”
Thank you to the eBay sellers referred to in this book for helping me 
show how eBay can reach out to the world: Jody Rogers and Asad 
Bangash (Beachcombers!), Robin Le Vine (Bubblefast), Dan Glasure 
(Dans Train Depot), Evan and Sandra Prytherch (EvanP), Stephen Kline
(GalleryNow), Jonathan and Ellen White (Magic-By-Mail), Mary, Joanne, 
and Roz (MaryJoRoz_Aroma_Galaxy), Robert McMahan (McMahanPhoto),
Jeff Stannard (Melrose_Stamp), and SallyJo Severance (SallyJo),
Then, of course, I thank the upper crust at Wiley. My publisher, Andy
Cummings, and my acquisitions editor, Steven Hayes, have tried to reach
“out-of-the-box” with some of my crazy ideas.
In this book, I had an amazing editor: Susan Pink. Susan was with me for the
second edition and helped me upgrade this edition to make it even better. As
always, thanks to Patti “Louise” Ruby, my technical editor and dear friend.
This is the fifth book of mine that she’s worked on as tech editor; I just can’t
think of a smarter person to go to for bouncing off ideas.

Introduction
You’re here! You’ve made it! Welcome to the third edition of the best-
selling book on eBay business: Starting an eBay Business For Dummies.
This is the book you need to make that leap from casual seller (or buyer) to
online mogul. You’ve probably been on eBay for a while and have seen that
there really is a huge opportunity to make a part- or full-time living online.
This book will serve as your manual to get organized and get your eBay busi-
ness launched. Here you’ll find information from how to handle your selling
time more efficiently to stocking your store to the real way to set up your
books and daily operations. I give you all the details about running a success-
ful eBay business. I pass along not only my own experiences from eleven
years of selling on eBay and thousands of interactions with eBay sellers, but
also timesaving and moneysaving tips and lots of eBay secrets.
I’ve made a successful living while working out of my home for what seems
like a lifetime (those corporate newspaper years fade further into the back-
ground as time passes), and I share my personal experiences to show that
you, too, can run a successful home business. I started my own marketing
and advertising business so that I could be at home and near my daughter.
She’s a big-time executive now (don’t start counting the years — it’s not
polite), and I devote my time to selling on eBay (I’m a PowerSeller), running
my Web site, and writing and teaching for eBay University. Through persever-
ance and dedication, my small homegrown business financed my home and
my daughter’s upbringing, private school, and college education. I know that
the only limits to my eBay business are time. With the information in this
book and some hard work, you too can expand to be an online success.
One thing that I can’t guarantee is how much money you can earn. I’ve dis-
covered — perhaps the hard way — that it takes a good deal of discipline to
run a home business. Don’t look for shortcuts — the time you spend and the
amount of devotion you give your business will measure your success.
About This Book
Profits await! If you’ve read eBay For Dummies, you have the basics. You’ve
probably picked up this book because you’ve heard stories about people
making big money online, and you’re interested in getting your piece of the pie.

Do you have a full-time job, but you’d like to sell on eBay part-time? eBay can
easily supplement your income for the better things in life. Perhaps you’re
looking to make a career change, and jumping into an eBay business with
both feet is just what you have in mind. If so, this is the book for you.
I’ve watched eBay change from a homey community of friendly collectors to
a Wall Street giant with tens of thousands of categories of items and more
than 222 million registered users worldwide. What are you waiting for?
There’s no time like the present to get started on your new career. Thousands
of people around the world are setting up businesses online, and now is your
time to take the leap of faith to begin a profitable enterprise. eBay gives you
the tools, the customers, and the venue to market your wares. All you need is
a bit of direction.
Starting an eBay Business For Dummies picks up where my eBay For Dummies
leaves off. The tips I include here give you the opportunity to improve your
eBay moneymaking ability, and can possibly turn an eBay novice into a pro-
fessional running a booming eBay business. I also show the experienced user
the prudent way to turn haphazard selling into an organized business. I’ve
combined the fine points of eBay with real business and marketing tools to
help you complete the journey from part-time seller to online entrepreneur.
In this book, you find the answers to some important questions as I take you
through the following lessons:
 Reviewing what you know and introducing some of the finer points of
eBay auctions
 Sprucing up your auctions to attract more bidders
 Dealing with customers and their needs
 Setting up your business in a professional manner
 Deciding how to handle inventory (and where to find it)
 Figuring out what you need to be in an eBay business . . . for real
What You’re Not to Read
If you use this book the way you’d use a cookbook, jumping around from
recipe to recipe (or chapter to chapter), you’ll be able to find answers to par-
ticular questions. Or read the book from beginning to end if you’d like. Either
way, be sure to keep the book handy to answer future questions as they come
to you — there’s a concise index.

Foolish Assumptions
Because you’re reading this, I assume you’re getting serious about selling on
eBay and want to find out the fine points of just how to do that. Or perhaps
you want to know how much is involved in an eBay business so that you can
make the decision whether to give it a go.
If I have you figured out and you’ve decided that it’s time to get serious, here
are some other foolish assumptions I’ve made about you:
 You have a computer and an Internet connection.
 You’ve bought and sold on eBay and are familiar with how it works.
 You have an existing small business or you’d like to start one.
 You like the idea of not having to work set hours.
 You feel that working from home in jeans and a t-shirt is a great idea.
I must stop here and say that it would really help (especially if your total
transactions on eBay are less than 100) if you read my beginning book, eBay
For Dummies, 5th Edition. That book gives you all the basics you need to get
started selling successfully.
If you can say yes to my foolish assumptions, you’re off and running! Take a
few moments to read the following section to get a feel for how I’ve put
together this book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts. The parts stand on their own, which means that 
you can read Chapter 12 after reading Chapter 8 and maybe skip Chapter 13
altogether (but I know you won’t because that’s where I discuss the money!).
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay
Reviewing what you know is always a great place to start. Considering the
way eBay constantly changes, you’ll probably find a little review worthwhile.
So in Part I, I delve into the finer points of eBay. Perhaps you’ll discover a
thing or two you didn’t know — or had forgotten.
3
Introduction

Setting up your eBay store is important, and in this part I show you step by
step the best way to do it — and give you tips to figure out when the timing is
right for you to open your store.
Part II: Setting Up Shop
You need to decide what type of business you plan to run and what type of
inventory you’ll sell. Here’s where I discuss how to find merchandise and the
best way to sell it. I also give you the lowdown on eBay Motors, real estate,
and some of the other unusual areas where you can sell.
You’ll also find out how to research items — before you buy them to sell —
so you’ll know for how much (or whether) they’ll sell on eBay.
I also discuss the importance of having your own Web site for online sales
and how to set one up quickly and economically.
Part III: Business Is Business — 
Time to Get Serious
In Part III, I discuss exactly how to use available online and offline tools,
implement auction management software, jazz up your auctions, and handle
shipping efficiently and effectively. Because working with customers and col-
lecting payments are important, too, you’ll find that information here as well.
Most importantly, you also find out how to get free shipping material for your
business delivered to your door, get your postal carrier to pick up your boxes
at no charge, and insure your packages without standing in line at the post
office.
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office
Setting up your business as a real business entity involves some nasty paper-
work and red tape. I try to fill in the blanks in Part IV, as well as show you
how to set up your bookkeeping. This is the place where you’ll find a check-
list of the items you’ll need to run your online business.
You also need to know how to set up your home business space and how to
store your stuff. I cover that here plus bunches more!

Starting an eBay Business For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part V: The Part of Tens
You can’t write a For Dummies book without including the traditional Part of
Tens. So in an untraditional manner, here are ten real-life stories of successful
(and happy) people selling at eBay. You also find out about ten places to
move your merchandise (if you want to sell elsewhere).
Part VI: Appendixes
I include a random collection of terms in Appendix A, the glossary. You’re
probably already familiar with many of these words, but others will be new 
to you. Refer to the glossary often as you peruse other parts of the book.
There’s also a short appendix on setting up a network at home.
Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books have cute little icons. I certainly wouldn’t want to ruin
your reading experience and leave them out. So, I selected a few and use
them sparingly throughout the book. Be sure to take heed when you see
them.
Here I share some of the interesting stories I’ve picked up from eBay sellers
over the years. Because I believe that knowledge is enhanced through learn-
ing from the successes and mistakes of others, I include these little auction
factoids so that you might gain some insight from them. After all, if someone
else has learned from a unique trick, you can benefit by taking heed.
If there’s something I need to interject — okay, something I’m jumping up and
down to tell you but it won’t fit directly into the text — I indicate it by placing
this tip icon in front of the paragraph. You’ll know the tip to follow will be
right on target!
Do you really know people who tie string around their fingers to remember
something? Me neither; but this icon gives me the opportunity to give you a
brief reminder. Kinda like a sticky yellow Post-it note.
I like this picture of the bomb device that Wile E. Coyote slam-dunks in the
cartoons  In that vein, if you don’t heed the warning indicated by the small
petard, you may be “hoisted by your own petard,” or made a victim of your
own foolishness.

Part I
Getting Serious
about eBay

In this part . . .
W
hen we’ve been doing something for a while (such
as selling on eBay), often we forget some of the
basics. eBay continually makes improvements, and some
of its features are like hidden gems in a diamond mine. 
In this first part, I delve into the finer points of eBay with
you. Perhaps you’ll discover a thing or two you didn’t
know or had forgotten.

Chapter 1
Launching Your Business on eBay
In This Chapter
 Getting serious about your business
 Making decisions about what to sell
 Having what it takes to make a living online
 Running your business efficiently
S
o you’ve decided to step up to the plate and start that eBay business.
You should first decide how much time you have to devote. I suggest
that you don’t quit your day job (yet). Instead, start expanding your sales in
baby steps. You can sell part time and still be a business and have a nice
chunk of extra income. A large portion of sellers, even eBay PowerSellers
(those who gross more than $1000 a month in sales), work on eBay only part
time.
eBay sellers come from all walks of life. A good number of stay-at-home moms
are selling on eBay. And so many retirees are finding eBay a great place to
supplement their income, that I wouldn’t be surprised if the AARP creates a
special eBay arm. If you’re pulled out of your normal work routine and faced
with a new lifestyle, you can easily make the transition to selling on eBay.
In this chapter, I talk about planning just how much time you’ll be able to
devote to your eBay business — and how to budget that time. I also talk
about figuring out what to sell. Your eBay business won’t grow overnight, but
with dedication and persistence, you may just form your own online empire.
Getting Down to Bidness (er, Business)
Before launching any business, including an eBay business, you need to set
your priorities. And to be successful at that business, you must apply some
clear level of discipline.

I won’t bore you with the now-legendary story of how Pierre Omidyar started
eBay to help fulfill his girlfriend’s Pez dispenser habit, blah, blah, blah. I will
tell you that he started AuctionWeb.com (the original eBay Web site) with a
laptop, a regular Internet service provider (ISP), and an old school desk. He
and his buddy Jeff Skoll (a Stanford MBA) ran AuctionWeb twenty-four hours
a day, seven days a week, all by themselves. When I began using the service, 
I had a lot of questions — and I always got prompt, friendly answers to my
e-mails. When the site started attracting more traffic, Pierre’s ISP began to
complain about all the traffic and raised his monthly fees. To cover the
higher costs, Pierre and Jeff began charging 25 cents to list an auction. Pierre
was so busy running the site that the envelopes full of checks began to pile
up — he didn’t even have time to open the mail.
When Pierre incorporated eBay AuctionWeb in 1997 with his partner Jeff,
they were each drawing a salary of $25,000. Their first office consisted of one
room, and they had one part-time employee to handle the payments. They
started small and grew. Now eBay is a respected, worldwide corporation,
employing thousands of people and trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Budgeting your time: eBay 
as a part-time moneymaker
A part-time eBay business can be very profitable. One thing that I stress in
this book is that the more time and energy you spend on your eBay business,
the more money you can make. That said, let’s examine the lowest possible
level of time that you should devote to your business.
Maybe you enjoy finding miscellaneous items to sell on eBay. You can find
these items randomly in your day-to-day life. So let’s suppose that you could
spend at least a few hours (maybe two to three) a day on eBay. Now you must
include the time it takes to write up your auctions. If you’re selling only one
type of item, allow about ten minutes to write your auction and photograph
the item (or scan it) and upload it to eBay or a photo-hosting site.
How much time is required to perform these tasks varies from person to
person and will improve according to your level of expertise. Regardless,
every task in your eBay auction business takes time, and you must budget for
that time. See the sidebar “Some handy eBay timesaving tips” for pointers.
You can take great photos and write brilliant descriptions, but cashmere
sweaters won’t sell for as much in the heat of summer as they do in winter.
Doing your research can take up a good deal of time when you’re selling a
varied group of items. Only you can decide how much time you can afford to
spend researching going rates for items on eBay.
10
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

You also have to consider how much time it takes to shop for your merchan-
dise. You may have to travel to dealers, go to auctions, or spend time online
discovering new ways to find your auction merchandise. Many sellers set
aside a full day each week for this undertaking. Your merchandise is what
makes you money, so don’t skimp on the time you spend identifying products.
Here’s a list of various activities that you must perform when doing business
on eBay:
 Photograph the item.
 Upload the images to eBay Picture Services when you list or before list-
ing to your ISP or third-party hosting service.
 Pack and weigh the item to determine the shipping cost.
11
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay
Some handy eBay timesaving tips
Crunched for time? The following are some fea-
tures you’re sure to find handy:
 HTML templates: In Chapter 11, I give you
some basic HTML templates for attractive
auctions (and show you how to find more).
These HTML templates cut your auction
design time to a few minutes. Most experi-
enced eBay sellers use preset templates to
speed up the task of listing auctions, and
this should be your goal.
 The Turbo Lister program: When you want
to list a bunch of auctions at once, I recom-
mend using the eBay Turbo Lister program.
I estimate that Turbo Lister enables you to
put together and upload ten auctions in just
fifteen minutes. In Chapter 9, I run down the
details on how to use this very cool tool.
 The Selling Manager and Selling Manager
Pro programs. These eBay subscription
programs can help you speed up the nuts
and bolts of an ongoing eBay businesswhen
you’re selling many items a week (more on
the Selling Manager program in Chapter 9).
 Relisting (or Sell Similar) feature: When
you sell the same item time after time, you
can use Turbo Lister (it archives your list-
ings so you can repeat them) or the handy
eBay relisting or Sell Similar feature. When
your auction ends on eBay, links pop up
offering to relist your listing or to Sell
Similar. If you want to run a different auc-
tion with a similar HTML format to the one
that just ended, simply select the Sell
Similar option and cut and paste the new
title and description into the Sell Your Item
page of your new listing. Use the Relist fea-
ture only when an item hasn’t sold the first
time, so it will qualify for a listing fee credit
when it sells. Use Sell Similar to relist the
same item after it fails to sell a second time.
 Auction management software: See the
“Software you can use” section in this
chapter, and also see Chapter 9, where I
detail various programs to integrate into
your eBay business.

 Choose an auction title with popular keywords.
 Write a concise and creative description.
 List the item for sale on eBay.
 Answer bidder questions.
 Send an end-of-listing e-mail (can be automated through PayPal).
 Carry out bookkeeping and banking.
 Address the label and affix postage.
 Ship the item safely and securely.
Time yourself to see how long it takes to accomplish each of these tasks. The
time varies when you list multiple items, so think of the figures that you come
up with as your baseline, a minimum amount of time that you must set aside.
This information can help you decide how many hours per week or month
you need to devote to running your part-time eBay business.
Jumping in with both feet: Making 
eBay a full-time job
As you can see in the list in the preceding section, the tasks required for your
eBay business can be time consuming. But careful planning and scheduling
can turn your business into an online empire.
The best way to go full time on eBay is to first run your business part time for
a few months to iron out the wrinkles. After you become comfortable with
eBay as a business (and decide that you enjoy selling and customer rela-
tions), you’re ready to make the transition to full-time seller. The minimum
gross monthly sales for a Bronze-level PowerSeller is $1000. If you plan your
time efficiently, you can easily attain this goal. Head to Chapter 3 for more
information on the PowerSeller program.
Running a full-time business on eBay is the perfect option for working parents
who prefer staying at home with their children, retirees looking for a way to
supplement their income, or those who’d just rather do something else than
work for their boss. Read some real-life profiles of happy full-time sellers in
Chapter 18.
See Figure 1-1 for an example of the eBay home page, the first stop for most
visitors to eBay. Note how eBay makes an effort to reflect some sort of pro-
motion to better market the items you put up for sale.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Deciding What to Sell
What should I sell? That is the million dollar question! In your quest for mer-
chandise, you’re bound to hear about soft goods and hard goods. Soft, or
nondurable, goods are generally textile products, such as clothing, fabrics,
and bedding. Hard goods are computer equipment, housewares, and anything
else that’s basically nondisposable.
Following are just a few points to consider when you’re deciding what to sell:
 Shipping costs: Some differences exist between shipping hard and soft
goods. Soft goods can fold up and be packed in standard box sizes, avail-
able from the USPS (U.S. Postal Service), or (better yet) in bubble or
Tyvek envelopes for much lower shipping costs. Most hard goods come
in their own boxes, which may or may not be individually shippable.
You’ll also need to use Styrofoam peanuts or bubble cushioning or
double package the item in an oddly sized box. See Chapter 17 for the
lowdown on shipping and packing.
 Other shipping considerations: Do you want to handle large boxes and
deal with the hassles of shipping them?
 Do you enjoy dealing with your products? I would have been out of the
eBay game years ago if I was forced to sell auto parts. Enjoying what you
sell makes you an expert and a top-drawer seller.
Figure 1-1:
The eBay
home page,
where it 
all starts!
13
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

 Possible storage problems: Do you have the room to store enough 
merchandise to keep you going? Soft goods can take up considerably
less space than hard goods.
You don’t always have to buy your items in bulk to make money on eBay. The
first things you sell might be items you find in your garage or attic. To find
out about some other fun ways to acquire goods to sell, check out the next
section.
Turning your hobby into a business
C’mon, you have a hobby; everyone does! Did you collect stamps or coins as
a kid? Play with Barbie dolls? Maybe your hobby is cars? Did you inherit a
bunch of antiques? Been collecting Hummel figurines for a few years? eBay
has a market for almost anything.
You can’t possibly be an expert on everything. You need to keep up to date
on the market for your items. Following more than four or five basic item
groups may divert your attention from selling.
Selling within a particular category or two can be a good idea for repeat busi-
ness. Should you decide to major in miscellany and sell anything and every-
thing, you may not realize the highest possible prices for your items unless
you thoroughly research them. This can be okay if you have a source that
permits you to buy items at dirt-cheap prices.
Collectibles: Big business on eBay
Pierre Omidyar started eBay with the idea to trade collectible Pez dispensers.
eBay now lists more than forty main categories of collectibles (see Figure 1-2),
and those categories are divided into thousands of categories, subcategories,
and sub-subcategories. Almost anything that you’d want to collect is here,
from advertising memorabilia to Girl Scout pins to Zippo lighters!
If you have a collection of your own, eBay is a great way to find rare items.
Because your collection is something dear to your heart and you’ve studied
it on and off for years, you could probably call yourself an expert. Bingo —
you’re an expert at something! I recommend that you hone your skills to find
things in your area of expertise at discount prices (you’re liking this more
and more, aren’t you?) and then sell them on eBay for a profit. Start small and
start with something you know.
14
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If there’s one thing you know, it’s fashion!
Are you one of those people who just knows how to put together a great
outfit? Do you find bargains at Goodwill but people think you’ve spent hun-
dreds on your garb? Do you know where to get in-season closeouts before
anyone else does? Looks like you’ve found your market (see Figure 1-3).

Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

Buy as many of those stylish designer wrap dresses (you-know-whose at you-
know-where) as you can, and set them up on the mannequin you’ve bought to
model your fashions for eBay photos. (For more on setting up fashion photos
on eBay, check out Chapter 11.) Within a week, you just may be doubling
your money — ’cause sweetie-darling, who knows fashion better than you?
If a ball, a wheel, or competition is involved — it’s for you
I don’t want to preach in generalities, but I think I’m pretty safe in saying that
most guys like sports. Guys like to watch sports, play sports, and look good
while they’re doing it. I see that as opening up venues for a profitable empire
on eBay. I don’t want to leave out all the women who excel and participate in
many sports. Women may have even more discriminating needs for their
sporting endeavors! I know I do. My golf game stinks — but I do make a point
to at least look good when I go out there, with respectable equipment and a
fabulous outfit.
eBay has an amazing market going on right now for exercise equipment, and 
I don’t even want to go into how much fishing equipment is selling on eBay.
And the last time I looked, golf items totaled more than 111,000 listings! What
a bonanza! New stuff, used stuff — it’s all selling on eBay. It’s enough to put
your local pro shop out of business — or perhaps put you in business.
Including the whole family in the business
Sometimes just the idea of a part-time business can throw you into a tizzy.
After all, don’t you have enough to do? School, work, soccer, kids glued to the
TV — you might sometimes feel as if you’ve no time for family time. However,
the importance of family time is what brought me to eBay in the first place. I
was working long hours in my own business, and at the end of the day, when
my daughter Susan wanted to go shopping, perhaps for some Hello Kitty toy
or a Barbie doll, I was just too tired. (Can you relate?)
I’d heard about AuctionWeb (eBay’s original site name) from a friend and had
bought some things online for my own collections. (Okay, you got me; I col-
lected Star Trek stuff — call me geek with a capital G.) I’d also browsed
around the site and found some popular toys selling for reasonable prices. So
one evening I introduced Susan to AuctionWeb, and life has never been the
same. We’d go to toy stores together right when they opened on Saturday
morning, so we’d get first dibs on shipments of the hottest, newest toys.
She’d go to the dolls and I’d go to the action figures. We’d buy several, go
home, and post them for sale on eBay. We made money, yes, but the best part
was our toy runs. They will always remain a special memory.
16
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Susan has since graduated from college (she majored in business and 
marketing — must have been inspired by our eBay enterprise), but she still
calls home when she finds a hot CD or closeouts of a top-selling item. We still
purchase and list items together. The family that eBays together . . . always
does.
My short trip down memory lane has a point: A family business can succeed
and everyone can enjoy it. (Take a look at some of the family sellers I profile
in Chapter 18.) I was in charge of the financing and the packing while Susan
looked up ZIP codes on the Internet and put pins in a four-foot-by-five-foot
map showing every city that we bought or sold from. She learned some excel-
lent lessons in marketing, advertising, and geography, all in one swoop.
Toys, books, and music — oh MY!
Having children in your home brings you closer to the latest trends than you
could ever imagine. I remember sitting at a Starbucks a couple of years ago
watching some dads and their sons poring over notebooks full of Pokémon
cards. (Actually, the kids were off playing somewhere and the dads were cov-
eting the cards.)
And what about Star Wars? Star Trek? G.I. Joe? Can you say action figures? 
(If guys have them, they’re not dolls — they’re action figures.) If you have
access to the latest and greatest toys, buy them up and sell them to those
who can’t find them in their neck of the woods.
If your home is like mine, books pile up by the tens! Old educational books
that your children have outgrown (even college textbooks) can be turned
into a profit. Remember that not every book is a classic that needs to be part
of your library forever. Let another family get the pleasure of sharing chil-
dren’s tales!
If anything piles up faster than books, it’s CDs, DVDs, and old VHS videos.
Somehow the old lambada or macarena music doesn’t hold the magic it once
did. Or maybe, those Care Bears cartoons don’t mesmerize the kids the way
they used to. You can get rid of your own items and find plenty of stock at
garage sales. Buy them cheap and make a couple of dollars.
Selling children’s clothes
When I recently checked eBay for the number of listings of infant and toddler
clothes up for sale, I found more than 198,000 — and the bidding was hot and
heavy. For stay-at-home parents, selling infant and children’s clothing is a
super way to pick up extra income.
17
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

If you’ve had a baby, you know all too well that friends and relatives shower
new moms with lots of cute outfits. If you’re lucky, your baby gets to wear
one or two of these (maybe only for a special picture) before outgrowing
them. These adorable portrait outfits can earn you a profit on eBay. Many
parents, with children a few steps behind yours, are looking for bargain cloth-
ing on eBay — a profitable hand-me-down community. As your children grow
up (and out of their old clothes), earn some money while helping out another
parent.
Bringing your existing business to eBay
Do you already have an existing business? eBay isn’t only a marketplace
where you’re able to unload slow or out-of-season merchandise. You can also
set up your store right on eBay (see Figure 1-4). An eBay store allows you to
list a fixed-price item at a reduced fee and keep the item online until it’s sold.
When you run your regular auctions for special items, they will have a link to
your store, thereby drawing in new shoppers to see your store merchandise.
Here are a few ways you can expand your current business with eBay:
 Open a second store on eBay: How many people run stores that sell
every item, every time? If you’re a retailer, you’ve probably made a
buying mistake or two. Many times the item that isn’t selling in your
store is selling like hotcakes in similar stores elsewhere in the country.
eBay gives you the venue to sell those extra items to make room for
more of what sells at your home base.
Figure 1-4:

18
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Perhaps you just need to raise some cash quickly. eBay has tens of thou-
sands of categories in which you can liquidate regular stock or specialty
items. For a caveat on what’s verboten, check out Chapter 4.
 Sell by mail order: If you’ve been selling by mail order, what’s been
holding you back from selling on eBay? It costs you far less to list your
item on eBay than to run an ad in any publication. Plus, on eBay, you get
built-in buyers from every walk of life. If your item sells through the mail,
it will sell through eBay.
 Sell property: Licensed real estate agents, take note. Plenty of land,
homes, and condos are selling on eBay right now. List your properties
online so that you can draw from a nationwide audience. When you offer
listings on the Web, you’re bound to get more action. Give it a whirl and
read more about selling real estate on eBay in Chapter 2.
You won’t find a cheaper landlord than eBay. Jump over to Chapter 5 if you
really can’t wait for more information about how to set up your eBay store.
Getting What It Takes to Sell
I’ve heard many sellers-to-be say they want to start a business on eBay so
that they can relax. Since when is running any business a way to relax?
Granted, you don’t need a whole lot of money to get started on eBay and you
won’t have a boss breathing down your neck. But to run a successful eBay
business, you need drive, determination, and your conscience to guide you,
as well as a few solid tools, such as a computer and an Internet connection. In
this section, I give you the lowdown on these things and more.
Computer hardware
First, you’re gonna need a computer. In my basic assumptions about you (see
the book’s introduction), I figure that you have one and know how to use it.
Your computer doesn’t have to be the latest, fastest, and best available. It
does help if your computer has a good deal of memory to process your Web
browsing and image touchups. One of my eBay listing computers is an
antique Pentium 3, an absolute turtle next to my new 4.3-GHz model. But
combined with a high-speed Internet connection, my little machine enables
me to run many eBay auctions easily.
Having a computer that will read all sorts of camera data cards is a timesaver.
Instead of having to hardwire your camera and download images, you can
just zip in the memory card and copy the pictures to your hard drive.
19
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

One thing to keep in mind is that hard drives are getting cheaper by the
minute. The bigger your hard drive, the more space you’ll have to store
images for your auctions. (Individual pictures shouldn’t take up much space
because each should be 50K max.) Make sure that you set up a sensible filing
system by using folders and subfolders.
Check out Chapter 11, where I talk more about the other stuff you might
need, such as a scanner and a digital camera.
Connecting to the Internet
If you’ve been on eBay for any length of time, you know that your Internet
connection turns into an appendage of your body. If your connection is down
or you can’t log on due to a power outage, you can’t function and instead
flounder around, babbling to yourself. I understand because I’ve been there.
If you’re selling in earnest, I recommend pulling the plug on your dial-up con-
nection unless you have no choice.
Before investing in any broadband connection, visit www.broadbandreports.
com (see Figure 1-5) and read the reviews of ISPs in your area. Users post
their experiences with the many providers across the country, so you can get
a good idea of what’s in store in your neighborhood in the connection arena.
The site also has more testing tools than you can imagine and will test the
speed of your (or your friend’s) Internet connection at no charge.

Dial-up connections
If you absolutely must use a dial-up connection, avail yourself of the many
free trials that different Internet service providers (ISPs) offer to see which
one gives your computer the fastest connection. After you find the fastest, be
sure that it’s reliable and has at least a 99 percent uptime rate.
Forty-four percent of the United States still logs on to the Internet with a dial-
up connection, so what can be so wrong about a dial-up connection? This
type of connection is painfully slow, and a listing with lots of images can take
minutes to load. The average eBay users want to browse many listings and
won’t wait while your images load; they’ll just go to the next listing.
To make the best use of your time when running your auctions and conduct-
ing research, you need to blast through the Internet. You need to answer
e-mail, load images, and conduct your business without waiting around for
snail’s-pace connections. Although a modem is supposed to link up at 56K,
FCC regulations state that it can’t connect any faster than 53K. In practice,
the highest connection I’ve ever experienced on a dial-up was 44K.
DSL
A confusing bunch of digital subscriber line (DSL) flavors (ADSL, IDSL, SDSL,
and more) are available these days, ranging from reasonably priced to out of
sight. DSL, when it works as advertised, is fast and reliable. A DSL line
depends on the reliability of your telephone service: Crackling or unreliable
phone lines can be a barrier to using DSL.
The main problem with a DSL connection is that your home or office needs to
be no farther than 18,000 feet from your local telephone office. The service
runs from $25 to $100 a month, and it might cost even more if you get DSL
through a booster that boosts the signal to a location farther away than the
minimum 18,000-foot border.
True DSL service can give you a connection as fast as 1.5MB per second
download. (IDSL is only 144K.)
I had DSL for about a year and was initially blown away by the speed.
Unfortunately, every time it rained (it does rain occasionally in Southern
California), my service went out. I had to call time after time to get a service
call. Sadly, this is a well-known drawback of DSL. Your local telephone com-
pany (telco in DSL-speak) owns your home or office phone lines. Because DSL
goes over POTS (plain old telephone service), your DSL provider has to nego-
tiate connection problems with the folks at your telephone company. As you
might guess, one company often blames the other for your problems.
21
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

A friend of mine tried to get around this issue by getting DSL from the local
phone company, which sounded great to me. It turned out to be not so great
because it seems that the local phone companies tend to form companies to
handle high-speed connections. So even though the two companies are tech-
nically the same, the two will still argue about who’s responsible for your
problems. Broadband with this much difficulty can be too much trouble.
Digital cable
Eureka, I think I’ve found the motherlode of connections: cable. If you can get
digital cable television, you can probably get a blazingly fast cable Internet
connection. Your cable company is probably replacing old cable lines with
newfangled digital fiber-optic lines. These new lines can carry a crisp HD digi-
tal TV signal and an Internet connection as well. Fiber-optic lines have plenty
of room to carry even more stuff (including telephone service), and I’m sure
it won’t be long before cable companies have some hot new services to 
sell us.
My digital cable Internet connection is generally fast and reliable. I can down-
load 2 megabytes of data in only eight seconds (compared to almost seven
minutes with a dial-up connection). So far, the service has been very reliable,
and I’ve experienced little downtime. For around $40 a month, I consider my
cable connection well worth the investment.
As far as the myth about more users on the line degrading the speed, a cable
connection is more than capable of a 10 Mbps transfer. That’s already about
10 times faster than DSL. It would take a whole lot of degrading to noticeably
slow down your connection.
Choosing your eBay user ID
“What’s in a name?” I believe that’s how the old quote goes. On eBay, there’s
a whole lot in your name! When you choose your eBay user ID, it becomes
your name — your identity — to all those who transact with you online. They
don’t know who you are; they know you only by the name they read in the
seller’s or bidder’s spot.
Ever wonder why you don’t see many banks named Joe and Fred’s Savings
and Loan? Even if Joe is the President and Fred is the Chairman of the Board,
the casual attitude portrayed by their given names doesn’t instill much confi-
dence in the stability of the bank. Joe and Fred might be a better name for a
plumbing supply company — or a great name for guys who sell plumbing
tools on eBay! Joe and Fred strike me as the kind of friendly, trustworthy guys
who might know something about plumbing.
22
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Does your retail business have a name? If you don’t have your own business
(yet), have you always known what you’d call it if you did? Your opportunity
to set up your business can start with a good, solid, respectable-sounding
business name. If you don’t like respectable (it’s too staid for you), go for
trendy. Who knew what a Verizon was? Or a Cingular? Or a Bubblefast, which
is one of my favorite eBay shipping suppliers.
Are you selling flamingo-themed items? How about pink_flamingos for your
selling identity? Be creative; you know what best describes your product.
Stay away from negative-sounding names. If you really can’t think up a good
user ID, using your own name is fine.
You’ve no doubt seen a bunch of lousy user IDs out there. Here are a few
examples of what not to use: ISellJunk, trashforsale, mystuffisgarbage.
eBay protects and does not reveal your e-mail address unless you’re in a
transaction with another member. If another user wants to contact you, he or
she can do so by clicking the Contact Seller link on the item page. The e-mail
will be sent to you through eBay’s e-mail system.
If you decide to change your user ID, don’t do it too often. Customers recog-
nize you by name, and you may miss some repeat sales by changing it.
Besides, eBay places a special icon next to your user ID to show others that
you’ve changed it. This icon will stick with you for 30 days. Your feedback
profile (permanent record) follows you to your new ID.
23
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay
The lowdown on user IDs
When choosing your user ID, keep the follow-
ing points in mind:
 Your ID must contain at least two characters.
 It doesn’t matter if you use uppercase; eBay
displays your ID in all lowercase letters.
 You may use letters, numbers, and any
symbol except @, ‘, <, >, and &.
 You can’t use URLs as your user ID.
 You can’t use the word eBay in your user 
ID; that privilege is reserved for eBay
employees.
 Spaces aren’t allowed; if you want to use
two words, you can separate them by using
the underscore key (press Shift and hyphen
to type the underscore key). You may not
use consecutive underscores.
 Do I have to tell you this? Don’t use a name
that’s hateful or obscene; eBay (and the
community) just won’t permit it.

Finding your eBay feedback
The number that eBay lists next to your name is your feedback rating; see
Figure 1-6 for my rating. Anyone on the Internet has only to click this number
to know how you do business on eBay — and what other eBay users think of
you. At the top of every user’s feedback page is an excellent snapshot of all
your eBay transactions for the past year, as well as detailed one- through five-
star ratings. For the lowdown on feedback, go to Chapter 3.
If you’re serious about this business thing and your feedback rating isn’t as
high as you’d like it to be, go online and buy some stuff. Even though eBay
now distinguishes between buyer and seller feedback, the numbers will still
grow. Feedback should always be posted for both buyers and sellers. Every
positive feedback increases your rating by +1; a negative decreases it by –1.
To get a high rating, you’d better be racking up those positives.
Making Your Auctions 
Run More Smoothly
In this section, I discuss a few more niceties that you’ll need to round out
your eBay home base. The following tools are important, but you must
decide which ones you’ll use. Some people prefer a totally automated office

24
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

while others prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. One of my favorite
eBay PowerSellers works with file folders, a hand-written ledger book, and
hand-written labels. If it makes you happy, do it your way. I’m going to sug-
gest a few options that will ease the pain of paperwork.
Software you can use
These days, software is available to accomplish just about anything. It would
seem fitting that an all-encompassing software package exists that can help
you with your auction, right? Well, maybe. It depends on how much you want
your software to do and how much of your business you want to fully con-
trol. In this section, I describe some software examples that you might find
useful.
Auction management
Auction management software can be a very good thing. It can automate
tasks and make your record keeping easy. You can keep track of inventory,
launch auctions, and print labels using one program. Unfortunately, most of
these programs can be daunting when you first look at them (and even when
you take a second look).
You have choices to make regarding the software: How much are you willing
to spend for the software, and do you want to keep your inventory and infor-
mation online? Maintaining your listing information online enables you to run
your business from anywhere; you just log on and see your inventory. Online
management software is tempting and professional, and may be worth your
time and money.
A good many sellers prefer to keep their auction information on their own
computers. This method is convenient and allows sellers to add a closer,
more personal touch to their auctions and correspondence. Some folks say
that keeping information local, on their own computer, is more suited to the
small-time seller. I think it’s a matter of preference.
In Chapter 9, I discuss the wide selection of management software available,
including Marketworks, Channel Advisor, Auction Wizard 2000, and the eBay-
owned Selling Manager.
HTML software
You may want to try some basic HTML software to practice your ad layouts. 
I tell you where to find some templates in Chapter 11, but you’ll want to pre-
view your auctions before you launch them. You might also enjoy my book
25
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies (co-authored with eBay tech maven Patti
Louise Ruby). Half the book is on HTML and the other half helps you perfect
your photography.
You can use a full-blown Web-page software package, such as FrontPage, to
check out how your auction will look, or you may want to keep it simple. The
simplest way is to use eBay’s intuitive listing tool, which works in the same
way as many word processing programs to format text. For more information,
turn to Chapter 11.
Spreadsheets and bookkeeping
Many sellers keep their information in a simple spreadsheet program such as
Excel. The program has all the functionality you need to handle inventory
management and sales info.
For bookkeeping, I like QuickBooks, which is as complete as it gets. It’s
straightforward and professional, and it no longer requires that you have a
basic knowledge of accounting. It also integrates with spreadsheets. In
Chapter 16, I discuss QuickBooks in some detail.
Collecting the cash
Credit cards payments are the way to go for the bulk of your sales. Often,
credit cards make the difference between a sale and no sale. People are get-
ting savvy (and more comfortable) about using their credit cards online
because they’re becoming better informed about the security of online trans-
actions and certain guarantees against fraud. So although you might truly
love money orders, you need to take credit cards as well. In this section, I dis-
cuss another decision you need to make: Do you want your own private mer-
chant account or would you rather run your credit card sales through an
online payment service? For more about these options, read on.
Online payment services
Until you hit the big time, you should save yourself a bucket of trouble and go
with the services of an online payment service such as the eBay-owned
PayPal. PayPal offers excellent services, and their rates are on a sliding scale,
according to your monthly dollar volume. Online payment services accept
credit cards for you. They charge you a small fee and process the transaction
with the credit card company. The auction payment is deposited in your des-
ignated bank account. Unless your sales go into tens of thousands of dollars a
month, an online payment service is far more economical than having your
own merchant account. For more about these services and accounts, see
Chapter 13.
26
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Your own merchant account
As you may or may not know (depending on the amount of spam in your
e-mail), thousands of merchant credit card brokers guarantee that they can
set you up so that you can take credit cards yourself. These people are
merely middlemen. You have to pay for their services, either in an applica-
tion fee or as part of a hefty percentage or by buying processing software.
Some of these brokers are dependable businesses and others are nothing
more than hustlers. If you have decent credit, you don’t need these guys: Go
straight to your bank!
Your bank knows your financial standing and creditworthiness better than
anybody. It’s the best place to start to get your own merchant account, an
account in which your business accepts credit cards directly from your
buyers. You pay a small percentage to the bank, but it’s considerably less
than what you pay to an online payment service. Some banks don’t offer mer-
chant accounts for Internet transactions because ultimately the bank is
responsible for the merchandise related to the account if you fail to deliver
the goods. Remember that your credit history and time with the bank play a
part in whether or not you can get a merchant account.
The costs involved in opening a merchant account can vary, but you’ll need
between $300 and $2000 to get started. Here are some of the possible costs
you may face:
 A monthly processing fee if you don’t reach the monthly minimum set
by your bank
 The discount rate (your bank’s cut) of 15–45 cents per transaction
 About $700 for software that processes your transaction costs
 A monthly gateway fee of as much as $40 (an online connection to
process charges)
This is quite an investment in time and effort. In Chapter 13, I get into the
details of a merchant account and explain exactly where all these costs go.
Home base: Your Web site
eBay offers you a free page — the About Me page — that’s the most impor-
tant link to your business on eBay; see Chapter 3 for more information. The
About Me page is part of your eBay store if you have one. You can insert a
link on your About Me page that takes bidders to your listings. You can link
also to your own Web site from the About Me page!
27
Chapter 1: Launching Your Business on eBay

If you don’t have your own Web site, I recommend that you get one, espe-
cially if you’re serious about running an online business. Check out Chapter
8, where I provide some tips on finding a Web host and a simple way to put
up your own Web site.
You can keep your complete inventory of items on your Web site and also list
them in your eBay store as their selling season comes around. Remember
that there’s no listing or final value fee when you have repeat customers on
your Web site.
Setting up your shop
Office and storage space are a must if you plan to get big. Many a business
was started at the kitchen table (that’s how Pierre started eBay), but to be
serious with a business, you must draw definite lines between your home life
and your online ventures. Concentrating when you have a lot of noise in the
background is difficult, so when I say draw a line, I mean a physical line as
well as an environmental one.
Your dedicated office
You must first separate the family from the hub of your business. Many eBay
sellers use a spare bedroom. (I started my home business in a 10-by-12-foot
room.) As time progresses and your business grows, you might have to move.
I chose to sacrifice my detached two-car garage. I guess I could have made it
into a one-car garage, but I decided to take over the whole thing instead.
Here’s what I did: Zoning laws in Southern California require me to have a
garage, so I put a false office wall in the back so that the garage door could
open normally. I used that area for extra storage. My garage had been wired
(for some guy who was going to use big-time power tools, I suppose) and had
its own breaker box. I hired an electrician to come in and place outlets
around my office and had a large window cut into the wall overlooking my
backyard (to remove the claustrophobic feeling and for ventilation). I now
had a window and electricity.
The phone man came by and brought a line into the garage; a friend installed
double jacks all around to accommodate the two phone lines. I picked out
some reasonably priced paneling and hired workmen to install it and to drop
a paneled ceiling with florescent lights. Finally, I bought furniture from my
local Goodwill store. Presto-chango — I had successfully transformed what
was once a dark, musty garage into a bright, gleaming 18-by-20-foot private
office. And here I successfully ran my advertising and marketing business for
more than ten years.
28
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

You, too, have adjustments and decisions to make, just as I did, because
you’re going to need office space and storage space, too.
One PowerSeller that I know moved all the junk out of his basement and set
up shop there. He now has three computers and employs his wife and a part-
time lister (who puts his items up on eBay) to run the show. His basement
office is networked and is as professional as any office.
Your eBay room
If you’re able to set up an office similar to mine, your storage space should be
covered for a while. For a real business, a closet just won’t do, even though
most sellers begin their eBay careers with an eBay closet. Seclude your stuff
from your pets and family by moving it into another room. You’ll also have to
get shelving and more supplies to organize things. I talk more about this in
Chapter 17.

 Finding the right category on eBay
 Figuring out whether fixed-price sales will work for you
 Selecting the auction type that works for you
 Pondering auction philosophies
 Breaking the rules: What you can’t do on eBay
A
t first glance, eBay is this behemoth Web site with millions of listings
that seems way too large for any novice to possibly master. On the sur-
face, that’s right. eBay is always growing and changing to meet the demands
of its users. Under all the cosmetic changes, however, you always come back
to the basics. eBay is still a traditional trading site: a community of buyers
and sellers who follow rules and policies, making eBay a safe place to trade.
As anything expands, it must compartmentalize to be manageable. The folks
at eBay have done this most handily. The original basic eight categories now
number in the thousands. The category breakdown is far clearer and more
concise than originally conceived. When a new trend begins, the eBay tech
gurus evaluate the sales and, when necessary, add new categories.
All this growth has forced eBay to expand. Aside from the traditional eBay
auctions, you’ll now find multiple item (Dutch) auctions, private auctions,
restricted auctions, and more. Whoa, that’s confusing! In this chapter, 
I explain the eBay features by reviewing how you can transact your business.
Armed with this knowledge, you can succeed with your listings — sooner
than later.

Finding Where to Sell Your Stuff
The Internet is crowded with e-commerce sites selling everything possible.
Many major portals also include auctions as part of their business. But the
majority of buyers and sellers go to eBay. Why? Because eBay is the largest,
attracting more buyers and sellers than any other site on the Web. More com-
puters and electronics are sold on eBay than at Buy.com; more used cars are
sold on eBay than in many states. Even name-brand manufacturers have
opened outlets on eBay to sell directly to their customers.
Whether you’re selling auto parts, toys, fine art, or land, eBay can work for
you. But first, you have to find your niche. Sounds easy enough. After all,
deciding where to put your stuff for sale is straightforward, right? Not neces-
sarily. The task is complicated by the inclusion of thousands of categories on
the eBay category overview page, shown in Figure 2-1.
Consider the example of a Harry Potter toy. Harry Potter toys are hugely pop-
ular, with the continuing saga in both the books and the movies. (Note: You
can replace Harry Potter with whatever the big pop-culture trend is when you
read this book.) The easy choice is to list the item under Toys & Hobbies: TV,
Movie, Character Toys: Harry Potter. But what about the category Collectibles:
Fantasy, Mythical & Magic: Harry Potter? This is the point where you must
decide whether you want to list in two categories and pay double (see the
review of extra charges in Chapter 10) or count on the fact that your beauti-
fully keyword-infested item title will drive prospective buyers who use the
search engine directly to your item.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

eBay supplies you with a great tool: What are you selling? is the first step in
listing your item for sale. Type a few keywords that describe your item, and
after you click the Sell button, the next page presents you with a list of cate-
gories where items similar to yours are listed, as shown in Figure 2-2. Each
category in the results will indicate the percentage of matching items within
the category.
Perhaps you aren’t selling Harry Potter toys. Suppose you’re selling a DVD of
the movie The Red Violin. Would listing it in DVD & Movies: DVD be the right
choice? Or would you reach an untapped audience of category browsers in
the Music: Musical Instruments: String: Violin?
I once came across a lovely small book featuring the fashions of the 1960’s
fashion icon, Emilio Pucci. Do you think such a book should be listed in
Books: Non-Fiction? I tried that category twice. Even with lowering my price, 
I couldn’t sell the book. Then inspiration hit! I listed the book at my original
starting price ($9.99) in the Clothing, Shoes & Accessories > Vintage > Women’s
Clothing > 1965-76 (Mod, Hippie, Disco) category. I had amazingly good luck
going directly to the fans of 60’s fashion. So much luck, in fact (the book sold
for close to $40.00), that I found an inexpensive source for the book, bought 
a case, and listed them one at a time (so they would seem exclusive and I
would continue to get the higher bids). During eighteen months, I bought and
sold several dozen until I could no longer get a supply!
The popularity of categories varies from time to time. News stories, the time
of year, hot trends, or whether Paris Hilton makes a comment about some-
thing can change a category’s popularity in a nanosecond. How can you pos-
sibly know the best category for your item? Research your items regularly
using my favorite tool: the awesome eBay search engine. (Visit Chapter 7 for
more about using the search engine.) Searching for completed listings, I check
Figure 2-2:
eBay’s

33
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

items that have sold for the highest prices and see which category they 
were listed in. After you’ve found the right category for the item you’re list-
ing, give it a try. However, be sure to throw in a wildcard occasionally by
trying alternatives.
After you’ve been selling a particular item for a while — and doing well with
it — selling it in a different but related category can boost your sales. A little
research now and then into where people are buying can go a long way to
increasing your eBay sales.
Automotive? Go eBay Motors
Anything and everything automotive can go in the eBay Motors category (see
Figure 2-3), and it will sell like giant tires at a monster truck rally. Following
are just a few of the car-related items that fit in this category.
Car parts
Have used car parts? eBay has an enormous market in used car parts. One
seller I know goes to police impound sales and buys complete wrecks for
close to nothing — just to save valuable parts that he can resell on eBay for
big money. (Have you priced replacing your bumper lately? Yeow!)
New car parts are in demand, too. So if you catch a sale at your local auto
parts store when it’s blasting out door handles for a 1967 Corvette (a vehicle
for which it’s hard to find parts), it wouldn’t hurt to pick up a few. Sooner or
later, someone’s bound to search eBay looking for them. If you’re lucky
enough to catch a trend, you’ll make a healthy profit.
Figure 2-3:

Cars
Yes, you can sell cars on eBay. In fact, car sales (used and new) have skyrock-
eted online thanks to the thousands of people who find eBay to be a trusted
place to buy and sell used vehicles every day. Check out Figure 2-4 for an
example of a used car auction. Selling vehicles on eBay is a natural business
for you if you have access to good used cars, work as a mechanic, or have a
contact at a dealership that lets you sell cars on eBay for a commission or on
a consignment basis. (For the ins and outs of consignment selling, check out
Chapter 6.)
eBay Motors and its partners offer useful tools to complete your sale. eBay
Motors features a free passenger Vehicle Purchase Protection up to $20,000
(with a $100 buyer co-pay should you have a claim), one-click access to vehi-
cle history reports, vehicle inspection and escrow services, and vehicle ship-
ping quotes from Dependable Auto Shippers. Access eBay Motors and its
services from the eBay home page or go directly to www.ebaymotors.com.
Here are just a few things to keep in mind if you plan to sell cars on eBay:
 Selling a car on eBay Motors is a bit different from selling on regular
eBay, mainly in the fees area. Take a look at Table 2-1 for significant dif-
ferences. In Chapter 10, I include a table of all basic eBay.com fees for
listings, options, and final values.
 To sell a vehicle on eBay Motors, you must enter the Vehicle Identification
Number (VIN) on the Create Your Listing page. This way, prospective
buyers can access a vehicle history report.

Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

 Although many people who have found the vehicle of their dreams on
eBay are more than happy to take a one-way flight to the vehicle loca-
tion and drive it home, shipping a vehicle is a reasonably priced alterna-
tive. You can make arrangements to ship a car quickly and simply. In
Table 2-2, I list some sample costs for shipping cars around the country
based on mileage.
 If your reserve isn’t met in an eBay Motors auction, you may still offer
the vehicle to the high bidder through the Second Chance option. More
information on that later in this chapter. You may also reduce your
reserve during the auction if you feel you’ve set your target price too
high.

An item that you’ve listed on eBay Motors will appear in any search, whether
potential buyers conduct a regular search on eBay.com or execute their
search in eBay Motors.
Live auctions
eBay also holds live auctions, where you’ll find rare and unusual items for
sale. You can access the live auction area from a link on the home page or by
going directly to www.ebayliveauctions.com.
To sell on eBay Live Auctions (shown in Figure 2-5), you must be a licensed
auction houses or seller using a licensed auctioneer to control the bidding.
eBay Live Auctions supplies buyers with exciting, nonstop, live auction
action right on their desktop. Joining a live auction is a lot of fun. These auc-
tions happen in real-time; you can see (and participate in) the bidding action
on your screen as it’s happening.
Licensed auction houses run the live auctions from their locations, which are
broadcast worldwide through eBay. You have to register individually for each
auction in which you want to participate, and a buyer’s premium is involved.
More and more auctioneers are using this format to expand their customer
bases.

Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

As an eBay community member, you’re able to bid on items featured in live
auctions. As a matter of fact, I got waylaid for a few hours while writing this
chapter, getting involved in bidding (and buying) in a coin auction! It’s a good
way to increase your own stock of merchandise to sell.
Real estate: Not quite an auction
eBay Real Estate isn’t quite an auction. Because of the wide variety of laws
governing the sale of real estate, eBay auctions of real property aren’t legally
binding offers to buy and sell. Putting your real estate up on eBay is an excel-
lent way to advertise and attract potential buyers. When the auction ends,
however, neither party is obligated (as they are in other eBay auctions) to
complete the real estate transaction. The buyer and seller must get together
to consummate the deal.
Nonetheless, eBay Real Estate sales are popular and the gross sales are grow-
ing by leaps and bounds. You don’t have to be a professional real estate agent
to use this category, although it may help when it comes to closing the deal.
If you know land and your local real estate laws, eBay gives you the perfect
venue to subdivide those 160 acres in Wyoming that Uncle Regis left you in
his will.
For less than the cost of a newspaper ad, you can sell your home, condo,
land, or even timeshare on eBay Real Estate in the auction format (see 
Figure 2-6). You can also choose to list your property in an ad format, accept-
ing not bids but inquiries from prospective buyers from around the world. On
the Create Your Listing form, shown in Figure 2-7, you must specify special
information about your piece of real estate.

Fixed-Price Sales on eBay
To compete with other e-commerce sites, eBay now includes a fixed-price
sales option. You put an item up for sale at a fixed price, and buyers pay the
price that you’re asking. Simple as that. Sellers are doing a great job at it, too.
You can also find fixed-price sales at eBay Stores and eBay Express (eBay’s
fixed-price, shopping cart venue at www.eBayExpress.com). Each eBay
store is run by an eBay auction seller. eBay Stores has its own space on 
eBay — accessible in the following ways:
 Through the home page navigation bar by clicking eBay Express
 By clicking the eBay Stores link on the eBay home page
 By going straight to www.ebaystores.com from the Web
Potential buyers will be able to access your items from anywhere on the eBay
site. The cost of an eBay store (see Table 2-5) compares favorably to any of
the Web’s megasite stores. There is no extra charge for your listings to
appear in eBay Express.

Just as with auctions, fixed-price sales that are successful incur final value
fees. eBay Express listings incur the same final value fees as auctions, but the
final value fees for eBay Stores sales are higher. See Table 2-6.

Types of eBay Auctions
An auction is an auction is an auction, right? Naw. eBay has five types of auc-
tions for your selling pleasure. Most of the time you’ll run traditional auc-
tions, but other auctions have their place, too. After you’ve been selling on
eBay for a while, you may find that one of the other types of auctions also
suits your needs. Keep in mind that eBay was founded on the regular auction
format — the allure of “winning” is what brings users back to the site. In this
section, I go over these auctions so that you fully understand what they are
and when it’s appropriate to use them.
Standard auctions
Auctions are the bread and butter of eBay. You can run a traditional auction
for one, three, five, seven, or ten days, and when the auction closes, the high-
est bidder wins. I’m sure you’ve bid on several and I hope you’ve won a few. 
If you’ve tried selling, I suspect you’ve made some money running some of
your own.
You begin the auction with an opening bid, and bidders bid up your opening
price, competing with one another and building a healthy profit for you on
your item.
41
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

If you’d like, you can set a Buy It Now option on your auction for an additional
fee. By setting fixed selling prices at the get go, buyers have the option of
buying your item outright. This is attractive for many users of the eBay
system. The Buy It Now price you post should be the price at which you’d be
happy to sell the item.
Even with a Buy It Now option, people can still bid on your item. After a bid is
placed, the Buy It Now Option disappears and the item proceeds in a regular
auction for the duration you indicated when you placed the listing.
Multiple Item (Dutch) auctions
When you’ve purchased an odd lot of five hundred kitchen knife sets or man-
aged (legally, of course) to get your hands on a truckload of televisions that
you want to sell as expeditiously as possible, you might want to use the
Dutch (multiple item) auction. In the Dutch auction (see Figure 2-8 for an
example), which can run for one, three, five, seven, or ten days, you list as
many items as you’d like, and bidders can bid on as many items as they’d
like. The final item price is set by the lowest successful bid at the time the
auction closes.
For example, suppose you want to sell five action figures on eBay in a Dutch
auction. Your starting bid is $5 each. If five bidders each bid $5 for one figure,
they each get a figure for $5. But if, say, two people bid $5, one person bids
$7, and another bids $8, all five bidders win the action figure for the lowest
final bid of $5.

42
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

In the following list, I highlight the details of the Dutch auction:
 The listing fee is based on your opening bid price (just like in a tradi-
tional auction), but it’s multiplied by the number of items in your auc-
tion to a maximum listing fee of $4.80.
 The final auction value fees are on the same scale as in a standard auc-
tion, but they’re based on the total dollar amount of all your completed
sales in the listing.
 When bidders bid on your Dutch auction, they can bid on one or more
items at one bid price. (The bid is multiplied by the number of items.)
 If the bidding gets hot and heavy, rebids must be in a higher total dollar
amount than the total of that bidder’s past bids.
 Bidders may reduce the quantity of the items for which they’re bidding
in your auction, but the dollar amount of the total bid price must be
higher.
 All winning bidders pay the same price for their items, no matter how
much they bid.
 The lowest successful bid when the auction closes is the price for which
your items in that auction will be sold.
 If your item gets more bids than you have items, the lowest bidders are
knocked out one by one, with the earliest bidders remaining on board
the longest in the case of tie bids.
 When the auction closes, the earliest (by date and time) successful high
bidders win their items.
 Higher bidders get the quantities they’ve asked for, and bidders can
refuse partial quantities of the number of items in their bids.
For a large quantity of a special item, your Dutch auction may benefit from
some of the eBay Featured auction options, which I detail in Chapter 10.
Reserve price auctions
In a reserve price auction, you’re able to set an undisclosed minimum price
for which your item will sell, thereby giving yourself a safety net. Figure 2-9
shows an auction in which the reserve has not yet been met. Using a reserve
price auction protects the investment you have in an item. If, at the end of
the auction, no bidder has met your undisclosed reserve price, you aren’t
obligated to sell the item, and the high bidder isn’t required to purchase the
item.
43
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

For example, if you have a rare coin to auction, you can start the bidding at a
low price to attract bidders to click your auction and read your infomercial-
like description. If you start your bidding at too high a price, you might dis-
suade prospective bidders from even looking at your auction, and you won’t
tempt them to even bid. They may feel that the final selling price will be too
high for their budgets.
Everyone on eBay is looking for a bargain or a truly rare item. If you can 
combine the mystical force of both of these needs in one auction, you have
something special. The reserve price auction enables you to attempt — and
perhaps achieve — this feat.
The fees for a reserve price auction are the same as those for a traditional
auction with one exception. eBay charges between $1.00 and $50.00 for the
privilege of running a reserve price auction. If the reserve price is $200.00 or
more, the reserve price fee is 1 percent of the reserve price (with a maximum
of $50.00). When your item sells, your reserve fee is refunded.
The reserve price auction is a safety net for the seller, but often an uncom-
fortable guessing game for the prospective bidder. To alleviate buyer anxiety,
I recommend that you put reserve prices in the item’s description. This
allows bidders to decide whether the item will fit into their bidding budgets.
You can’t use the reserve price option in a Dutch auction.
Restricted access auctions
eBay won’t allow certain items to be sold in nonrestricted categories, so you
must list them in the Mature Audiences category on eBay. eBay makes it easy
for the user to find or avoid these types of auctions by making this area
Figure 2-9:
Note that a
reserve has
not been
met for this
auction.
44
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

accessible only after the user enters a password and agrees to the terms and
conditions of the area.
Items in the Mature Audiences area are not accessible through the regular
eBay title search, nor are they listed in Newly Listed Items to those who
haven’t verified their identity.
Anyone who participates in Mature Audiences auctions on eBay, whether as 
a bidder or a seller, must have a credit card on file on eBay for verification
(see Figure 2-10).
Do not attempt to slip an adult-only auction into a nonrestricted category.
eBay doesn’t have a sense of humor when it comes to this violation of policy
and may relocate or end your auction. eBay might even suspend you from its
site.
Private auctions
Bidders’ names are often kept private when dealing in the expensive fine art
world. Likewise, to protect the innocent, eBay private auctions don’t place
bidders’ names on the auction listing. No one needs to know just how much
you choose to pay for something, especially if the item is rare and you really
want it.
Figure 2-10:
You must

45
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

As a seller, you have the option (at no extra charge) of listing your auction as
a private auction. The option can be found in the How You’re Selling portion
of the Create Your Listing form. To find this option (should it be hidden),
click Show/Hide Options in the top-right corner of the form, select Format,
and then select Private Listing.
The eBay search page features an area where you can conduct a bidder
search. You — and everyone else, including your family — can find the items
you’ve bid on. One December, my daughter told me that she didn’t want a
particular item — something that I had just bid on — for Christmas. My cre-
ative daughter had been regularly perusing my bidding action on eBay to see
what I was buying for the holidays! Buying from private auctions might have
kept my Santa shopping secret.
The private auction is a useful tool for sellers who are selling bulk lots to
other sellers. It maintains the privacy of the bidders, and customers can’t do
a bidder search to find out what sellers are paying for the loot they then plan
to re-sell on eBay.
A great option for sales of items that are a bit racy or perhaps for purchases
of items that may reveal something about the bidder, the private auction can
save you the potential embarrassment associated with buying a girdle or
buying the tie that flips over to reveal a racy half-nude female on the back.
Although the private auction is a useful tool, it may intimidate the novice
user. On the other hand, if your customer base comes from experienced eBay
users, and you’re selling an item that may benefit by being auctioned in
secret, you might want to try this option.
46
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 
Not quite adult enough . . .
I was surprised to see a private auction listed
on one of my favorite eBay seller’s lists. She
usually doesn’t sell items like “Fringe Black 
BRA 36B SEXY SEXY SEXY,” so I looked through
this seller’s past auctions. I saw that she didn’t
get any bids when she listed the bra in 
the restricted (Adult Only) area of eBay in the
category Everything Else: Mature Audiences:
Clothing, Accessory. When she put the bra up
for private auction in the category Clothing &
Accessories: Women’s Clothing: Lingerie: Bras:
General, she got five bidders and sold the item.
I guess it wasn’t sexy enough for the “adult”
crowd!

Running Your Auction
The basic plan for running an auction is the same for everyone, except for
decisions regarding the timing of the auction and the starting price. If you
speak to twenty different eBay sellers, you’ll probably get twenty different
answers about effective starting bids and when to end your auction. Until you
develop your own philosophy, I’d like to give you some ideas to help you
make a sound decision.
You can successfully promote your auctions online and offline, and can
legally offer your item to the next highest bidder if the auction winner doesn’t
come through with payment. I discuss a few of these ideas in this section.
Starting the bidding
The most generally accepted theory about starting bids is that setting the
bidding too high scares away new bids. Also, as in the case of the reserve
price auction, if the bidding begins too high, novices might be afraid that the
bidding will go too high and they’ll never win the auction.
Some sellers begin the bidding at the price they paid for the item and an addi-
tional amount to cover fees, thereby protecting their investment. This is a
good tactic, especially if you bought the item at a price far below the current
going rate on eBay.
To determine the current going value for your item, I recommend using the
Completed Listings search, which I explain in Chapter 7. If you know that the
item is selling on eBay for a certain price and that there is a demand for it,
starting the bidding at a reasonably low level can be a great way to increase
bidding and attract prospective bidders to read your auction.
My years of advertising experience have taught me a lot of marketing lessons.
If an item is in demand and people are actively buying, start the bidding low.
Retail stores have done this for years with ads that feature prices starting at
$9.99 or $14.98. Even television commercials advertising automobiles quote a
low starting price. To get the car as shown in the ad, you may end up paying
twice the quoted price.
When sellers know that they have an item that will sell, they begin their bid-
ding as low as a dollar or even a penny. Because of the eBay proxy bidding
system (which maintains your highest bid as secret, increasing it incremen-
tally when you’re bid against), it takes more bids (due to the smaller bidding
increments) to bring the item up to the final selling price.
47
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

The downside is that new bidders who aren’t familiar with the system may
bid only the minimum required increment each time they bid. This can be
frustrating, and they may quit bidding because it might take them several
bids to top the current bid placed by someone who’s familiar with the proxy
bid system. Very few of us know the proxy increments by heart, so as a
refresher, I give you the goods in Table 2-7.
Table 2-7

Auction timing
Another debatable philosophy is auction timing. People are always asking me
how long to run auctions and what’s the best day to end an auction. You have
to evaluate your item and decide the best plan:
 One-day auction: This format can be very successful if you have an item
that’s the hot ticket for the moment on eBay. I used this format when I
sold some Friends TV show memorabilia. The 24-hour auction opened
midday before the final show and ended the next day — at a healthy
profit!
One-day auctions also give you the benefit of pushing your auction to
the top of the heap in the listings. Because eBay defaults to show the
items ending first at the top of the page (just below Featured auctions), a
one-day listing posts right up there!
48
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

 Three-day auction: If the item’s price will shoot up right after you post
it, as in the heyday of Beanie Babies, a three-day auction works just fine.
And it’s great for those last-minute holiday shoppers looking for hard-to-
find items.
With the Buy It Now feature, you can pretty much accomplish the same
thing. When you list your item for sale, set a price at which you will sell
the item; this is your target price. This price can be any amount, and if
someone is willing to pay, it sells.
 Five-day auction: Five days will give you two days more than three and
two days less than seven. That’s about the size of it. If you just want an
extended weekend auction, or if your item is a hot one, use it. Five-day
auctions are useful during holiday rushes, when gift buying is the main
reason for bidding.
 Seven-day auction: Tried-and-true advertising theory says that the
longer you advertise your item, the more people will see it. On eBay, this
means that you have more opportunity for people to bid on it. The
seven-day auction is a staple for the bulk of eBay vendors. Seven days is
long enough to cover weekend browsers and short enough to keep the
auction interesting.
 Ten-day auction: Many veteran eBay sellers swear by the ten-day auc-
tion. Sure, eBay charges you an extra 40 cents for the privilege, but the
extra three days of exposure (it can encompass two weekends) can
easily net you more than 40 cents in profits.
49
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling
Pirates of the Caribbean, er, Carribean?
Just before the Pirates of the Caribbean movie
premiered, Disneyland gave out exclusive
movie posters to their visitors. My daughter,
savvy eBayer that she is, snagged several
copies to sell on the site. She listed them (one
at a time) when the movie opened and couldn’t
get more than the starting bid, $9.99, for each of
them.
When we searched eBay for pirates poster, we
found that the same posters with a misspelled
title, Pirates of the Carribean, were selling for as
high as $30 each. We immediately changed her
auctions to have the more popular (and mis-
spelled) Carribean in the title and quickly saw
those dollar signs! After selling out her initial
stock, she found another seller who had ten for
sale — in one auction — with the proper
spelling in the title. She bought those as well (for
$5 each) and sold them with misspelled titles on
the site for between $15 and $27!

If you’re selling an esoteric collectible that doesn’t appear on eBay often,
run a ten-day auction to give it maximum exposure. Start it on a Friday,
so it will cover the aforementioned two weekends worth of browsers. In
my book, eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, I examine in depth
the opinions on how long to run an auction and what day or time to
begin it.
Your auction closes exactly one, three, five, seven, or ten days — to the
minute — after you start the auction. Be careful not to begin your auctions
when you’re up late at night and can’t sleep: You don’t want your auction to
end at two in the morning when no one else is awake to bid on it. If you can’t
sleep, be productive and use Turbo Lister to prepare your listings ahead of
time and upload them for future launching when the world is ready to shop.
The specific day you close your auction also is no longer as important as it
was in the early days of eBay. Buyers browse the site seven days a week, 
24 hours a day. The weekdays and the weekends are full of browsers, so it’s
hard to guesstimate when your perfect buyer will be browsing. Take a look at
Figure 2-11, which is a screen shot outlining the days that all my items had
hits during the past thirty days. This chart is part of a valuable tool called
View Tracker, which is available from Sellathon.com. In Chapter 10, I show
you how to combine your search engine research with this special kind of
statistical counter to help you identify the best closing time for your items.
(See Chapter 7 for the details about using the search engine as a valuable
research tool.) The best person to figure out the closing information for your
auctions is you. Use the tools, and over time you’ll work out a pattern that
works best.
A definite time not to close your auctions? Experience has taught many sell-
ers never to close an auction on a national holiday. Memorial Day, the Fourth
of July, and Veteran’s Day may be bonanza sales days for retail shops, but
eBay auction items closing on these days go at bargain prices. I guess every-
one is out shopping at the brick-and-mortar stores.

Marketing your sales
How do you let people know about your listings? What do you do if all one
hundred million users on eBay happen to not be on the site the week that
your items are up for sale? You advertise.
Many mailing lists and newsgroups permit self-promotion. Find a group that
features your type of items and post a bit of promotion. This works best if
you have your own e-commerce Web site. Your site, which should be the hub
for your sales, can give you an identity and level of professionalism that
makes your business more official in the eyes of buyers. In Chapter 8, I detail
the ins and outs of business sites on the Web.
When you have an eBay store, eBay allows you to send a number of e-mails to
customers who request to be on your mailing list. Also, eBay will see to it
that your store (and its listings) appears in searches on Google. Take a look
at Figure 2-12, which shows my store in a Google search.
eBay to Go
A new feature on eBay allows you to transport your items to an outside site
using JavaScript code. I’ve put one on my MySpace page (see Figure 2-13). To
get code to insert in your listings, go to www.ebaytogo.com and make your
own widget. Click the OK, Let’s Go link, and on the next page, select which
type of layout you’d like to use and follow the steps to select the items you
want to promote. Just insert the code on any Web page on the Internet and
visitors to that page will see your listings and be able to click to your items.
Figure 2-12:

Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

This widget is run by eBay’s magic API (application program interface),
which is far too technical for the likes of me — I’m an expert at buying and
selling, not techie coding! Luckily, you don’t need to be a techie to use this
tool. It’s automatically put on your site after you insert a bit of eBay-supplied
HTML code into your Web page. The eBay API automatically updates your
listings.
Voila! A virtual showroom.
Link buttons
eBay supplies some nice link buttons (see Figure 2-14) that you can use 
on your Web site. Visit the following address to add these links to your 
site’s home page: http://pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/
link-buttons.html.
I’m guessing that you already know all about your About Me page, a handy
tool when it comes to marketing your auctions. In Chapter 3, I discuss the
values of the About Me page. You should link to your Web site from your little
home page on eBay.
Here’s a great way to market future listings: When you’re sending items after
making a sale on eBay, include a list of items that you’ll be selling soon (along
with your thank-you note, of course) — especially ones that may appeal to
that customer. If you schedule your auctions, you’re given the auction
number before the item is listed.
Figure 2-13:

52
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Do not link your auction to your Web site. It’s against eBay policy to possibly
divert sales away from the auction site. Do link from your About Me page. See
the “Linking from your auctions” section, later in this chapter, to find out just
what you can and cannot link to and from.
A second chance
The Second Chance feature on eBay helps sellers legitimize something that
previously went on behind closed doors and in violation of eBay policy. When
a winner doesn’t complete a sale, or you have multiple units of the same
item, or the reserve price wasn’t met but you are willing to accept the highest
bid that didn’t meet the reserve, the Second Chance feature allows sellers to
offer the item to the next highest bidders.
You must still go through the proper channels and file your nonpaying bidder
notice with eBay. After doing that, you can then send a Second Chance offer
to any underbidder no more than sixty days after the end of the auction. Your
final value fee is based on the price you receive when the offer is accepted.
In the Second Chance offer scenario, the seller can leave two feedbacks: one
for the winner (nonpaying bidder) and one for the person who bought the
item through the Second Chance offer transaction. The bidder to whom you
proffer your Second Chance offer is covered by the eBay fraud protection
program.
This feature does not apply to Dutch auctions.

Listing Violations
eBay does not sell merchandise. eBay is merely a venue that provides the
location where others can put on a giant, e-commerce party (in other words,
sell stuff). To provide a safe and profitable venue for its sellers, eBay must
govern auctions that take place on its site. eBay makes the rules; you and 
I follow the rules. I like to think of eBay as the place that lets you hold your
senior prom in its gym. When I was in school, my classmates and I had to
follow the rules or see our prom cancelled. If we don’t agree to follow eBay’s
rules, a safe and trusted eBay community can’t exist.
Listing policies
eBay has some hard-and-fast rules about listing your items. You must list 
your item in the appropriate category (that only makes sense), and I high-
light here a few other rules that you should keep in mind when listing. What 
I discuss in this section isn’t a definitive list of eBay listing policies and rules.
Take time to familiarize yourself with the User Agreement (which details all
eBay policies and rules) at pages.ebay.com/help/policies/uapp.html.
I recommend that you check the eBay User Agreement regularly for any policy
changes.
Choice auctions
Your auction must be for one item only: the item that you specifically list in
your auction. It’s against the rules to give the bidder a choice of items, sizes,
or colors. When you give your bidders a choice, it’s an illegal sale on eBay
and isn’t covered under the PayPal Buyer Protection program. Anything
that’s negotiated outside the eBay system can lead to misrepresentation or
fraud. You don’t want to be caught up in that sort of grief and misery. If eBay
catches you offering a choice, they will end the auction and credit the inser-
tion fee to your account.
Duplicate auctions
Remember the old supply and demand theory from your economics class?
When people list the same items repeatedly, they drive down the item’s going
price while ruining all the other sellers’ opportunities to sell the item during
that time frame.
eBay allows you fifteen identical listings at any time. If you’re going to list an
item that many times, be sure to list it in different categories. That’s a rule,
but it also makes sense. Nothing drives down the price of an item faster than
closing identical auctions, one after another, in the same category. eBay also
requires that you list your auction in a category that’s relevant to your item.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If you have multiple copies of something, a better solution is to run a Dutch
auction for the total number of items you have for sale. Or perhaps run two
Dutch auctions in different (but appropriate) categories.
If you’re caught with more than fifteen identical auctions, eBay may end the
additional auctions (any over fifteen).
Pre-sale listings
eBay doesn’t like it when you try to sell something that’s not in your hands
(known as a pre-sale listing). Doing so is a dangerous game to play anyway. In
many situations, being the first seller to put a very popular item up for sale
can get you some pretty high bids. And if you can guarantee in your auction
description that the item will be available to ship within thirty days of the
purchase or the auction closing, you can run a pre-sale. However, I don’t rec-
ommend even attempting a pre-sale listing if you’re not completely sure that
you’ll have the item in time.
If you know that you’ll have the item to ship — and it won’t be lost on its way
to you — you may list the item with the following requirement: You must
state in your auction description that the item is a pre-sale and will be
shipped thirty days from the end of the listing or purchase. You’ll also have
to use a little HTML here because the text must be coded with an HTML font
no smaller than font size 3.
Before you set up such an auction, check out the Federal Trade Commission
thirty-day rule covering these matters, which you can find at the following
address: www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/mailorder.htm.

Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling
Pre-selling: Not worth the hassle
A seller I once knew pre-sold Beanie Babies on
eBay. She had a regular source that supplied
her when the new toys came out, so she fell into
a complacent attitude about listing pre-sales.
Then her supplier didn’t get the shipment.
Motivated by the need to protect her feedback
rating (and by the fear that she’d be accused of
fraud), she ran all over town desperately trying
to get the Beanies she needed to fill her orders.
The Beanies were so rare that she ended up
spending several hundred dollars more than
what she had originally sold the toys for, just to
keep her customers happy.

Bonuses, giveaways, raffles, or prizes
Because eBay sells to every state in the United States, it must follow explicit
laws governing giveaways and prizes. Each state has its own set of rules and
regulations, so eBay doesn’t allow individual sellers to come up with their
own promotions. If your auction violates this rule, eBay might end it.
Keyword spamming
Keyword spamming is when you add words, usually brand names, to your
auction description that don’t describe what you’re selling (for example,
describing that little black dress as Givenchy-style when Givenchy has noth-
ing to do with it). Sellers use keyword spamming to pull viewers to their auc-
tions after viewers have searched for the brand name. To attract attention to
their listings, some sellers use not or like along with the brand name, such as
like Givenchy.

eBay Giving Works (charity) auctions
Tens of millions of dollars has been raised on
eBay for charitable organizations (see the
figure). If you represent a legitimate charity, you
may run auctions on eBay to raise funds. Just
follow these simple steps:
1. Register your charity to be certified at
MissionFish (www.missionfish.org/
register.jsp).
Select the Register Your Nonprofit check
box.
2. Register on eBay and create a Seller
account.
3. Go back to MissionFish and click the
Register to Sell link.
Explain what your charity is, what it does,
where the money goes, and so on. Set up
the page to Show No Feedback and Show
All Items. eBay will link this page to the
Giving Works area.
4. Create an eBay listing for your item.
In the Pictures & Details section of the Sell
form, click the Add link in the area titled
Donate Percentage of Sale. Select your
organization from the nonprofit directory
and specify that 100% of the sale price will
be donated to your organization.
Your listings will now get additional visibility
through a specialized search reserved for eBay
Giving Works and will have a ribbon icon in the
title bars.
The eBay Giving Works page is accessible from
a link on the home page or directly through
http://pages.ebay.com/giving
works.

Keyword spamming actually causes your auction to fall under “potentially
infringing” items for sale on eBay. Keyword spamming is a listing violation,
and I mention it here because it affects all listings. The wording you choose
when you run this kind of auction manipulates the eBay search engine and
prospective bidders. For a complete discussion of keyword spamming, see
Chapter 4.
Linking from your auctions
Few issues set sellers to arguing more than the rules on linking. In your auc-
tion item description, you can use the following links:
 One link to an additional page that gives further information about the
item you’re selling.
 A link that opens an e-mail window on the prospective buyer’s browser
so that the buyer can send you an e-mail.
 Links to more photo images of the item you’re selling.
 Links to your other auctions on eBay and your eBay store listings.
 One link to your About Me page, in addition to the link next to your user
ID that eBay provides.
 Links to vendors’ sites that help you with your auctions. eBay considers
listing services, software, and payment services to be third-party ven-
dors. You can legally link to them as long as the HTML font is no larger
than size 3; if you’re using a logo, it must be no larger than 88 x 33 pixels.
Most third-party vendors are well aware of these restrictions. They don’t
want their credits pulled from eBay, so the information they supply as a
link generally falls within eBay’s parameters.
In your auction description, you cannot link to the following:
 A page that offers to sell, trade, or purchase merchandise outside the
eBay site.
 Any area on the Internet that offers merchandise considered illegal on
eBay. See Chapter 4 for information on illegal items.
 Any site that encourages eBay bidders to place their bids outside eBay.
 Sites that solicit eBay user IDs and passwords.
57
Chapter 2: The Finer Points of eBay Selling

Linking from your About Me page
eBay rules on your About Me page are pretty much the same as they are on
the rest of the site. Because eBay gives you this page for self-promotion, you
may link to your own business Web site from it (e-commerce or otherwise).
Be sure not to link to other trading sites or to sites that offer the same mer-
chandise for the same or a lower price. Read more about the About Me page
do’s and don’ts in Chapter 3.

Cool eBay Tools
In This Chapter
 Making My eBay your home page
 Taking advantage of your About Me page
 Managing the business of your auction: eBay seller services
e
Bay offers you an amazing variety of tools. But because the site is con-
stantly changing, many users fail to notice when new tools appear on the
system. I must admit that I have fallen victim to the “Oh, I didn’t know I could
do that” syndrome. When I poke around eBay and find a new cool tool or neat
shortcut, it’s always an eye-opener!
eBay users frequently share with me some nugget of information that has
helped them along the way. And now I share these nuggets with you.
To stay on top of upcoming changes on eBay, you can subscribe to the
General Announcement e-mail. Unfortunately, eBay tends to fill these daily
missives with lots of promotional folderol, but a quick once-over will keep you
abreast of the many changes before they occur on the site. To sign up for this
e-mail, mouse over (hold your cursor still for a moment over) Community on
the navigation bar in the upper part of most eBay pages, and, from the drop-
down menu that appears, click Groups. On the Groups Center page, scroll
down to News & Events and click Announcements. On the resulting page, you
may join this group by clicking the eBay Announcements link.
Aside from the tools I tell you about in this chapter, the most important
shortcut I can give you is to remind you that when you sign in, but before you
start your business on eBay, select the Keep Me Signed In on This Computer
Unless I Sign Out check box. This permits you to close your window during
the day and reopen it later without having to sign in again.
If you have more than one user ID or share a computer with other people, be
sure to sign out when you’re finished. The cookie system has been changed
on eBay. Now, as on other sites, your computer will maintain your sign-in
information for a twenty-four-hour period (or until you sign out).

In addition, eBay has developed some incredibly useful features, such as My
eBay, which allows you to customize eBay for your home page. Another fea-
ture, the About Me page, lets you tell the story of your business to the world
as well as find out (with a click of the mouse) about the people you plan on
buying from. To get the lowdown on my favorite cool eBay tools, read on.
My eBay
The first tool eBay gives you is your My eBay page. Every time you sign on to
the site, this page will pop up on your screen with a cheery, “My eBay —
Hello, marsha_c (substitute your user ID for mine),” followed by your current
feedback rating. The My eBay page is the perfect tool for running a small
eBay business. It’s no longer a step-by-step list of what you’re bidding on and
selling; it’s an out-and-out Swiss Army knife of eBay tools.
Access the My eBay page by clicking the My eBay button in the eBay naviga-
tion bar, which appears at the top of every eBay page. You’ll see that if you
mouse over one of the five selections, a drop-down menu appears. You can go
directly to the main pages by clicking the navigation bar. But if you know that
you want to go to one of the specialized areas, you can mouse over and click
the individual links. A sample is shown in Figure 3-1.
When you arrive at your My eBay page, you see a summary of the business
that you have in progress on the site (see Figure 3-2). Each comment has a
link, so you can investigate the progress of the transactions.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Most My eBay areas are divided into several areas (My Summary, All Buying,
All Selling, Want It Now, My Messages, All Favorites, My Account, My Reviews
and Guides, and the Dispute Console), which you can visit by clicking links in
the My eBay Views area on the left side of the page. The top link of each My
eBay area presents you with a summary of the activity in that area. The links
below the top link take you to specific data, without having to scroll through
a long page.
At the bottom of My eBay Views is another area with Related Links to ser-
vices and to answers you may need while doing business at eBay. The task-
specific pages of My eBay may show a More link in this additional links box.
Click the More link and you’re presented with a page of links related to the
page you’re on.
The links in the Related Links box are different depending on the page, with
buying-related links on the All Buying page, selling-related links on the All
Selling page, account-related links on the My Account page, and so forth.
When you have a question regarding some eBay procedure, you’ll find these
links handy.

Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools
Setting a desktop shortcut to your My eBay page
People often tell me that they’d like a direct link
from their computer desktop to their My eBay
page. If you use Internet Explorer as your
browser, just follow these steps:
1. Sign in and go to your My eBay page.
2. In your browser’s toolbar, choose File➪
Send➪Shortcut to Desktop.
That’s it. A clickable shortcut to your My eBay
area is placed on your computer’s desktop.

At the bottom of each of the Views is a mini tote board, giving you a snapshot
of your financial business dealings. In the Buying area, it displays the number
of items you’re bidding on and the dollar amount of all your winning bids. In
the Selling area, you see the number of items and the dollar amounts bid (see
Figure 3-3).
All Buying
Here it is: All Buying is the hub for keeping track of your bids, your wins,
items you’re watching, and any items you didn’t win. Although you plan to
sell more than you buy at eBay, I’m sure you’ll occasionally find something to
buy if only to turn around and resell it. I’ve found many a bargain item at
eBay that I’ve re-sold immediately at a profit. Plus, I purchase most of my
shipping supplies on eBay. (In Chapter 17, I reference a few eBay sources with
great prices and fast shipping.)
Items I’m Bidding On
When you place a bid, eBay automatically registers it in the Items I’m Bidding
On area, such as the one shown in Figure 3-4.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If you’re shopping on eBay, make the bidding page a daily stop so you can see
the status of your bids:
 Bid amounts in green indicate that you’re the high bidder in the auction.
 Bid amounts in red indicate that your bid is losing. If you decide to
increase your bid, simply click the auction title to go to the auction.
 Dutch auctions appear in black. To determine whether you retain high
bidder status in a Dutch auction, you have to go to the actual auction.
 The My Max Bid column reminds you of the amount of your highest bid;
if you see a bid that surpasses your own, you’ll know it’s time to throw
in another bid (or throw in the towel).
 The Bidding Totals box, at the top of the Bidding page, lists the current
dollar amount you’re spending and the number of items you’re currently
winning in pending auctions. You’ll see the total amount you’ve bid and
a separate total representing auctions you’re winning.
 As auctions on which you’ve bid end, they automatically transfer to the
Won and Didn’t Win pages, based on your success or failure in the bid-
ding process.
You can make notations on your bidding or item watching, for example, to
help you organize your gift giving. (See the note I added in Figure 3-5.) Click
to place a check mark next to the item you want to annotate, click the Add
Note button, and then add the information.
Items I’ve Won
Clicking the Won link in the bidding area displays all the items you’ve won as
far back as the last sixty days. The default is thirty-one days, which should
suffice for most transactions. The Items I’ve Won page is a great place to keep
track of items that you’re waiting to receive from the seller. It’s also a conve-
nient way to keep track of your expenditures, should you be buying for
resale. Helpful features on this page include the following:
Figure 3-5:
My Father’s
Day notation

63
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

 Check box: Click the box to add a check mark, and you can indicate that
you’d like to add a note to your record or remove it from the list.
 Seller’s user ID: It always helps to remember the seller’s name, and this
link sends you to the seller’s Member Profile (feedback page) where you
can send an e-mail to the seller.
 Listing title: A link to the auction. I always use this when an item arrives
so that I can be sure that the item I received is exactly as advertised.
 Item number: The auction number for your records.
 Auction sale date: A convenient way to see whether your item is slow in
shipping. After a week, it doesn’t hurt to drop the seller an e-mail to
check on the shipping status.
 Sale price and quantity: Helps you keep track of the money you’ve
spent. Works with the totals in the tote board.
 Action: The drop-down menu displays different commands based on the
status of your transaction. You can click a link to pay for the item
through PayPal, view the payment status on paid items, mark the item
paid if you paid through other payment methods, or leave feedback
once you’ve received the item and are satisfied that it’s what you
ordered.
 Icons: At the end of each item’s listing are three icons that appear
dimmed until the selected action is taken. A dollar sign indicates whether
you’ve paid for the item, a star indicates that you’ve left feedback, and a
quote bubble indicates whether feedback has been left for you.
When you receive an item and leave feedback, select the check box next to
the item and then click the Remove button to remove the completed transac-
tion from view.
Items I’m Watching
Have you ever seen an auction that made you think, “I don’t want to bid on
this just now, but I’d like to buy it if it’s a bargain”? Clicking the Watching link
from the My eBay All Buying box will bring you to the Items I’m Watching
page (see Figure 3-6), one of the most powerful features of the My eBay area.
This page lists each auction with a countdown (time left) timer, so you know
exactly when the auction will close. When an auction on your watch list gets
close to ending, you can swoop down and make the kill — if the price is right.
Also a handy marketing tool, the Watching page allows you to store auctions
from competitive sellers. That way, you can monitor the status of items simi-
lar to ones you plan to sell later and see whether the items are selling high or
low, helping you to decide whether it’s a good time to sell.
64
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

You’ve probably seen the Watch This Item link at the top of each auction
page. If you’re watching items (eBay allows you to monitor one hundred auc-
tions at a time), you’ll see a notation on the page, indicating how many auc-
tions you’re currently watching.
My number-one reason for using the watch list function is that it allows me to
keep my bargain hunting quiet. Everybody — including the competition —
knows when you’re bidding on an item; nobody knows when you’re watching
the deals like a hawk. When you’re looking for bargains to buy and resell, you
may not want to tip off the competition by letting them know you’re bidding.
Selling
eBay provides some smooth management tools on your Selling page. You can
track items you currently have up for auction and items you’ve sold. It’s a
quick way to get a snapshot of the dollar value of your auctions as they pro-
ceed. Although this page isn’t as good for marketing information (detailed
counters are best — see Chapter 9), it’s a pretty good way to tell at a glance
how your items are faring.
Items I’m Selling
With the Items I’m Selling page, shown in Figure 3-7, you can keep an eye on
your store items, your fixed-price sales, and the progress of your auctions.
You can see how many bids your auctions have, whether your reserves have
been met, and how long before the auction will close. By clicking an item title,
you can visit the listing to make sure your pictures are appearing or to check
your counter.
Figure 3-6:
Sit back and
observe at
My eBay.
65
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

Many people watch auctions and don’t bid until the last minute, so you may
not see a lot of bidding activity on your page. The # of Watchers feature can
give you important information on the progress of your auctions.
The auctions that appear in green have received one or more bids (and met
any reserves you’ve set). Auctions in red haven’t received any bids or the set
reserve price hasn’t been met. Dutch auctions aren’t color-coded and appear
in black.
At the top of the Items I’m Selling area, eBay lists the current price of all
items, including items that have been bid on but that haven’t met your
reserve. The total dollar amount of the items that will sell when the auction is
over appears below these totals. On the right side of your listings, eBay has a
column for icons.
The tech crew is always adding more features to these pages. Occasionally,
go to the top right of these pages and click the Customize Display link. Here,
you see a chart of additional options that you may display on the page. They
will vary depending on the page.
Items I’ve Sold
Click the Sold link in the All Selling Views area and you’ll come to the Items
I’ve Sold area. The Items I’ve Sold area keeps your sales in a concise place, as
shown in Figure 3-8. You can use it in lieu of fancy auction management soft-
ware until you’re selling lots of items. If you’re selling hundreds of items, your
list will probably be too long to monitor individual auctions, but you can view
the total current price of the items that will sell.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If you’re selling more than twenty items a week, consider using eBay’s Selling
Manager to give you a more complete auction management solution. See
Chapter 9 for the lowdown on how to make this tool work for you.
The Items I’ve Sold page has the following features, which I’m sure you’ll find
helpful in completing your transactions:
 Check box: Click here to add a personal note to your record or to
remove an item from your list.
 Buyer’s user ID and feedback rating: The eBay ID of the winner of the
sale. Click it to go to the user’s Member Profile, where you can use
eBay’s e-mail sever to contact the buyer.
 Quantity: If the sale was for multiple items, the number of items is dis-
played here.
 Item title: A direct link to the auction. You can click this link to check on
your auction and see the other bidders, should you want to make a
Second Chance offer.
 Item number: The auction number for your records.
 Sale price: The final selling price for your item.
 Total price: The final selling price plus the shipping amount.
 Sale date: Keep an eye on the end date so that you can be sure you get
your payment as agreed.
 Action: Here’s where you find a hidden, drop-down menu that works
with the icons to the right and offers links to various actions that you
can take. Some of the more popular options are
Figure 3-8:
The Items

67
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

• Mark paid: If the customer hasn’t paid using PayPal, indicate their
method of payment (after you receive it).
• View payment status: See a copy of the payment receipt if the
buyer paid using PayPal, or see a notation you inserted regarding
other payment methods.
• Print shipping label: You can print a shipping label from here. See
Chapter 14 for more professional options.
• Leave feedback: Leave feedback with a single click once you’ve
heard that the item arrived safely and your customer is happy. For
more information on leaving feedback, check out the section
“Feedback: Your permanent record,” later in this chapter.
• Mark shipped: After you’ve shipped the item, click here to indicate
that it’s on the way.
• Second Chance offer: Make a Second Chance offer to one of your
underbidders if you have multiple items for sale.
• Relist: Here you can relist your item on the site.
 Icons: My eBay has several icons that appear dimmed until you perform
an action with the Action command. You may also click the icons at the
top of the list to sort your listings by actions completed, although most
sellers prefer to keep the listings in the default chronological order:
• Shopping cart: The buyer has completed checkout (supplying a
shipping address and planned payment method).
• Dollar sign: The buyer has paid using PayPal, or you’ve used the
drop-down menu to indicate that the buyer has paid with a differ-
ent form of payment (such as a money order or a personal check).
• Shipping box: The item has shipped.
• Star: You’ve left feedback.
• Comment bubble: The buyer has left feedback. A plus sign (+) indi-
cates a positive comment, and a minus sign (–) indicates a negative
comment.
All Favorites
If you sell and have an interest in a few categories, look no further than the
My eBay All Favorites pages, which give you some links for checking out
what’s hot and what’s not. The All Favorites pages help you track trends and
find some bargains to resell at eBay.
68
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Favorite Categories
eBay allows you to store hot links for four categories. These links give you
the chance to quickly check out the competition.
Before you list some of a popular item, estimate the date and hour that other
auctions selling that item will close. Then go into the category and check to
be sure that your auction won’t be closing during a flood of auctions for the
same item. Nothing kills profits more than closing an auction in the middle of
a series of auctions selling the same thing. You can watch the final values
drop one at a time.
Favorite Searches
Another tool that comes in handy for sellers as well as buyers is Searches
(see Figure 3-9). You can list as many as one hundred favorite searches; when
you want to check one out, simply click the Search Now link next to the item.
You can view, change, and delete saved searches, or indicate that you’d like
to receive e-mail notification when a new item is listed. To add an item to the
list, run a search from any search bar on any eBay page and click the Save
This Search link that appears at the top of the search results page. The next
time you reload your My eBay All Favorites page, your new favorite will be
listed.
Keeping track of favorite searches is a valuable tool when you’re looking for
particular items to resell and want to find them at bargain-basement prices.
Be sure to take advantage of asterisks (wildcard characters) and alternate
spellings so you can catch items with misspellings in the title. These are your
best bets for low prices. (See Chapter 7 for the lowdown on the search engine
and how it can help your sales.)
Figure 3-9:

69
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

If you choose to receive e-mail when your search locates a new listing, you
can request that you receive notification from seven days to a year. You’re
allowed to receive new listing e-mails on any or all of your hundred searches.
Just click the drop-down menu and click the Sign Up For Emails link (refer to
Figure 3-9). eBay sends its robot to check listings each night, so you’ll get
notification of a new listing the next morning.
Favorite Sellers
Favorite Sellers is where I keep a list of people who sell items similar to what
I sell. I can check up on them and see what they’re selling, when they’re sell-
ing it, and for how much. It’s a helpful tool that has prevented me from listing
an item at the same time as one of their auctions.
Favorite Sellers is also handy when your competition is selling an item that
you plan to sell, but at a deeply discounted price. When that happens, don’t
offer yours until they sell out of the item, at which time the price will most
likely go back up — supply and demand, remember? I have a few quality
wholesalers and liquidators under my favorite sellers, too, and search for lots
that I can resell at a profit.
To add a seller to your Favorite Sellers list, click the Add New Seller or Store
link in the upper-left corner of the page. On the page that appears, type the
seller’s user ID.
My Account
Your eBay account summary page (see mine in Figure 3-10) lets you know
how much you owe eBay and how much they will charge your credit card
that month. This is a quick way to check your last invoice, payments and
credits, and your account; all the links are located in one area.
You can also access your PayPal account to see, for example, when deposits
were credited to your checking account. (For a complete picture of how to
sign up and use PayPal, visit Chapter 13.)
Personal Information
The Personal Information page holds all the links to your personal informa-
tion at eBay. This is where you can change your e-mail address, user ID, pass-
word, and credit card information, and edit or create your About Me page.
You can also change or access any registration or credit card information
that you have on file at eBay.
70
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

The Personal Information page has a link for adding a wireless e-mail address
for your cell phone or handheld device. What a great idea: eBay can send End
of Auction notices right to your WAP-enabled cell phone. The trouble is,
sometimes these messages can get lost in cellular space. So don’t count on
always getting immediate updates.
Addresses
On the Addresses page, you can see the address you used to register on eBay
and edit (when necessary) your payment address and primary shipping
address.
Preferences
A nifty feature of the eBay Preferences page is the opportunity to customize
how you run your eBay business. There are sections on your buying, selling,
communication, and general preferences. This is an important area for you to
check out because setting some of these tools can make your selling career
on eBay go far more smoothly. You can change the following:
 Notification Preferences: Tell eBay whether (and how) you’d like to be
notified every time a function occurs in your eBay account. You can cus-
tomize buying, selling, and other transaction details, notifications, and
legal notices issued by eBay.
 Selling Preferences: In this area, you take control of how eBay helps
you run your business. Here you can customize your checkout proce-
dures, offer shipping discounts, and more. Most importantly, this is the
Figure 3-10:

place where you can decide to block certain buyers before they bid or
buy from you. Figure 3-11 shows my eBay buyer requirements. By click-
ing the Edit link, you can block the following:
• Buyers in countries to which I don’t ship: Every eBay seller (until
they find out about this option) has had an item won from someone
in a country to which they choose not to ship. You may choose not
to ship for any number of reasons. Maybe you don’t want to ship
internationally and accept foreign payments (along with the extra
fees from PayPal), or you don’t want to risk your packages getting
lost in a foreign postal system. When you get a sale like this, you are
basically forced to go through with the sale — or risk negative feed-
back. By indicating that you do not want to accept business from
buyers in particular countries, you avoid this problem.
• Buyers with a negative feedback score: If you don’t want to
accept customers who have been rapidly building negative feed-
back, you can remove them from your business here. You have a
choice of barring people with a –1, –2, or –3 total feedback score
(indicating these people have more negatives than positives).
• Buyers with unpaid item strikes: You may prevent those who have
had two unpaid item strikes within the last thirty days. This is a
good idea. If they haven’t paid for two items in the last thirty days,
they’re likely not to go through with your transaction, thereby
costing you time and money.
• Buyers who may bid on several of my items and not pay for
them: This title is a bit misleading. As often happens in any 
commerce, some people think shopping is a game. Many hyper-
caffeinated (to be kind) eBay joy riders will ferret out a particular
seller and buy every item they have for sale, with absolutely no
intention of paying. They seem to think this is fun.
I know several major sellers who went to bed with several hundred
items up for sale — only to wake up to find everything sold. After
the initial blush of victory, they realized that everything was
bought by the same buyer — often someone with a new account or
a low feedback rating. If that’s not bad enough, they check their
feedback and find that the buyer left negative feedback for every
item they bought. eBay is cooperative in helping to clean up this
mess, but all items need to be relisted, and the entire repair
process is hugely time consuming. Save yourself some grief and
limit your buyers here.
• Buyers without a PayPal account: You may choose to bar buyers
who don’t have a PayPal account, but why? New buyers are the
core of eBay, and signing up for a PayPal account is a simple task
for those who want to pay you with a credit card.

 Member to Member Communication: Once you’ve set up an account
with Skype, you can insert your Skype ID here and indicate that prospec-
tive buyers may contact you through Skype. They then can contact you
through chat or Skype voice.
 General Preferences: Here’s where you can set up all the other fun stuff
that has to do with your eBay business. Check it out. It changes as eBay
adds option, so it’s worth visiting on a regular basis.
If all the information on the My eBay pages seems daunting (indeed it is), you
can adjust how your My eBay pages are displayed. In the General Preferences
area, open the My eBay link by clicking the Show link in that area. (Take a
look at Figure 3-12 to see what happens when you click the Show link.) You
can then set your My eBay pages to Display Help Content in My eBay. That
way, you’ll have help links at the bottom of the pages should you get lost or
merely confused.
Feedback
Feedback is a crucial area. Clicking here shows you feedback you need to
leave and your last few feedback comments. This information is easier
accessed elsewhere.

PayPal
Links in the PayPal area allow you to view and update your PayPal account
information and profile summary. Clicking the links will take you directly to
the PayPal Web site.
Half.com Account
Old-time eBay sellers have been threatened over and over with the possible
demise of Half.com (eBay’s fixed-price media marketplace), and yet it still
hangs on. If you sell or buy on Half.com, you can access your information and
transactions from the Half.com Account area.
Seller Account
If you want to check to see how much you owe eBay for your listing and sale,
or want to make a payment, the Seller Account area is the place to go.
Subscriptions
When you subscribe to any of the eBay services, such as Selling Manager Pro
or Sales Reports Plus, the Subscriptions area is where you can cancel,
upgrade, or edit your level of subscriptions.
The About Me Page
If you’re on eBay, you need an About Me page. I hate to harp, but eBay is a
community and all eBay members are members of that community. Checking
out the About Me page of people you conduct business with gives you an
opportunity to get to know them. Because eBay is a cyberspace market, you
have no other way to let prospective bidders know that you’re a real person.
Don’t you shop at some stores because you like the owners or people who
work there? The About Me page is your first step toward establishing a pro-
fessional and trusted identity at eBay.
The About Me page enables you to personalize your business to prospective
bidders. (See Figure 3-13 for an example.) Your About Me page also becomes
your About the Seller page if you have an eBay store.
An About Me page benefits you also when you buy. Sellers usually like to
know about their bidders to build confidence in their trading partners. If
you’ve put up an About Me page, you’re halfway there.
74
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If you don’t have an About Me page, put this book down and set one up
immediately. It doesn’t have to be a work of art; just get something up there
to tell the rest of the community who you are. You can always go back later
and add to or redesign it.
When you plan your About Me page, consider adding the following:
 Who you are and where you live.
 Your hobbies. If you collect things, here’s where to let the world know.
 Whether you run your eBay business full time or part time and whether
you have another career. This is more integral information about you; let
the world know.
 The type of merchandise that your business revolves around. Promote it
here; tell the reader why your merchandise and service are the best!
 Your most recent feedback and a list of your current auctions.
To create your page, click the Me icon next to any user’s name, scroll to the
bottom of the About Me page that appears, find the line that reads “To create
your own About Me page, click here,” and click. You can also click the About
Me page link in the Personal Information of My Account area. Or go to
http://members.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?AboutMeLogin.
Then follow the simple preformatted template for your first page and work
from there.

eBay Seller Services
Most eBay users don’t know the extent of eBay’s seller-specific services. And
sometimes sellers are so involved with their auctions that they don’t take the
time to find out about new helper tools. So I’ve gone deep into the eBay pond
to locate a few excellent tools to help you with your online business. Even if
you’ve used some of these before, it might be time to revisit them because
eBay has implemented quite a few changes during the past year.
Bidder management tools
Did you know that you don’t have to accept bids from just anyone? Although
many people include notices in their auction descriptions attempting to qual-
ify bidders ahead of time, this doesn’t always prevent them from bidding on
your auction. Alas, part of the business is watching your bidders. With bidder
management tools, you can save yourself a good deal of grief.
Canceling bids
You could have any number of reasons for wanting to cancel someone’s bid.
Perhaps an international bidder has bid on an auction in which you clearly
state you don’t ship overseas. Here are a few more legitimate reasons for can-
celing a bid:
 The bidder contacts you to back out of the bid; choosing to be a nice
guy, you let him or her out of the deal.
 Your bidder has several negative feedbacks and hasn’t gone through
with other transactions that he or she has won.
 You’re unable to verify the bidder’s identity through e-mail or the phone.
 You need to cancel the auction (see following tip).
I don’t recommend canceling an auction unless you absolutely have to
because it’s just bad business. People rely on your auctions being up for the
stated amount of time. They may be planning to bid at the last minute, or
they may just want to watch the action for a while. You may lose potential
buyers by ending your listing early.
For whatever reason you’re canceling someone’s bid, you should first e-mail
that person and clearly explain why you’re doing so. Your bid cancellation
appears in the auction’s bidding history and becomes part of the auction’s
official record. For that reason, I recommend that you leave a concise,
unemotional, one-line explanation on the cancellation form as to why you’ve
cancelled the bid.
76
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

To get to the bid cancellation form, go to the Related Links box on the My
eBay page and click the word more, which appears at the bottom. On the
resulting page, you will find a Cancel Bids link. You can also get to the cancel-
lation form directly by typing the following in your browser: offer.ebay.
com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CancelBidShow.
End your listing early
You may decide to end a listing early for any number of reasons. If any bids
are on your auction before you end it, you’d be duty-bound to sell to the
highest bidder. So before ending an auction early, it’s polite to e-mail every-
one in your bidder list, explaining why you’re canceling bids and closing the
auction. If an egregious error in the item’s description is forcing you to take
this action, let your bidders know whether you’re planning to relist the item
with the correct information.
Only after canceling all bids should you go ahead and close your auction. To
end your listing, use the drop-down menu next to the item in your Items I’m
Selling area. Click the End Item link. You can also go directly to http://
cgi3.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?EndingMyAuction.
Following are some legitimate reasons for closing your auction:
 You no longer want to sell the item: Your account may be subject to a
“Non-Selling Seller” warning unless you have a really good reason. (See
Chapter 4 for more details.)
 An error occurred in the minimum bid or reserve amount: Perhaps
your wife said that she really loves that lamp and you’d better get some
good money for it, but you started the auction at $1.00 with no reserve.
 The listing has a major error in it: Maybe you misspelled a critical key-
word in the title.
 The item was somehow lost or broken: Your dog ate it?
Blocking buyers
If you don’t want certain buyers bidding on your auctions, you can remove
their capability to do so. Setting up a list of bidders that you don’t want to do
business with is legal on eBay. If someone whom you’ve blocked tries to bid
on your auction, the bid won’t go through. A message will be displayed noti-
fying the person that he or she is not able to bid on the listing and to contact
the seller for more information.
You can block as many as one thousand users from bidding on your auctions.
However, I recommend that you use this option only when absolutely neces-
sary. Situations — and people — change, and it’s best to try to clear up prob-
lems with particular bidders.
77
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

You can reinstate a bidder at any time by going to the Buyer Blocked Bidder/
Buyer list at http://pages.ebay.com/services/buyandsell/bidder
management.html. Click the Add an eBay User to My Blocked Bidder/Buyer
List link. The resulting page will allow you to delete the bidder’s user ID from
the Blocked list.
ID Verify
ID Verify establishes that you are who you say you are. It also enables you to
perform specialized eBay functions if you choose not to supply eBay with a
credit card when you register. ID Verify has a one-time charge of $5, and
Equifax (one of the nation’s largest credit security companies) conducts the
verification. It is not a credit check. Your personal information is checked
alongside consumer and business databases for consistency so that Equifax
can verify that you are who you say you are.
If you aren’t quite ready to get the SquareTrade seal (see Chapter 4) for your
auctions or you find the monthly fees involved in the seal currently prohibi-
tive, ID Verify is the next best thing. Following are the extra functions you can
perform without supplying your credit card:
 Buy an item for more than $15,000 through the eBay Buy It Now feature
 List and offer the Buy It Now or Best Offer options
 Place a bid above $15,000
 Bid on eBay Live Auctions
 Open an eBay store
 Sell and access items in the eBay Mature Audiences category
Feedback: Your permanent record
Just like your high school permanent record, your eBay feedback follows you
forever at eBay. If you change your user ID, it’s there. If you change your
e-mail address, it’s there. When you click the feedback number next to a
user’s ID, the user’s eBay ID card (see Figure 3-14) is displayed. The informa-
tion shown will tell you a lot about your bidder.
The most obvious tip-off to someone’s feedback is the star you see next to
the user ID. Different colored stars are awarded as folks reach milestones in
their feedback ratings. To decipher the star colors and see what they mean,
click the help link, and type the words star rating.
78
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Your feedback means a great deal to people who visit your auctions. By
glancing at your feedback page, they can see
 Whether you’re an experienced eBay user
 Your eBay history
 When you started at eBay
 How many bid retractions you’ve had in the past six months
This is valuable information for both the buyer and the seller because it
helps to evaluate whether you’re the type of person who would make a
responsible trading partner.
Worried about negative feedback? There are two possible ways to get nega-
tive feedback points removed from your record. One, you can file for media-
tion with SquareTrade (see Chapter 4 on how to do this). Two, if you and the
person who posted the feedback are both in agreement, you can file for
Mutual Feedback Withdrawal by going to http://feedback.ebay.com/
ws1/eBayISAPI.dll?MFWrequest. Enter the item number and continue
filing the form. If the person who posted the feedback agrees to remove the
negative feedback, eBay will oblige.

Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

Leaving feedback
Everyone in the eBay community is honor-bound to leave feedback.
Sometimes when you’ve had a truly dreadful experience, you hate to leave
negative or neutral feedback, but if you don’t, you’re not helping anyone. The
point of feedback is not to show what a great person you are but to show
future sellers or bidders where the rotten apples lie. So, when leaving feed-
back, be truthful and unemotional and state just the facts.
Feedback is important, so you should be sure to leave some for every trans-
action you take part in. If a week has passed since you’ve shipped an item,
and you haven’t heard from the bidder or seen any feedback, drop that
bidder an e-mail. Write “Thanks for your purchase. Are you happy with the
item?” Also emphasize that you’ll be glad to leave positive feedback after
you’ve heard a reply, and ask for the same in return.
Never leave feedback on a sale until you’re absolutely, positively sure that
the buyer has received the product and is happy with the deal. Many inexpe-
rienced sellers leave feedback the minute they get their money, but experi-
ence can teach them that it ain’t over till it’s over. A package can get lost or
damaged, or the bidder may be unhappy for some reason. A buyer may also
want to return an item for no good reason, turning a seemingly smooth trans-
action into a nightmare. You get only one feedback per transaction, so use it
wisely. You can’t go back and say that the buyer damaged the product and
then tried to return it.
eBay provides so many different links to leave feedback that I could probably
write an entire chapter on it. But I don’t want you to fall asleep while reading,
so I go through only the most convenient methods:
 Go to your auction page and click the Leave Feedback link, which
appears on the left.
 Click the number (in parentheses) next to the other user’s name. When
you’re on that user’s feedback page, click the Leave Feedback link.
 Click the Leave Feedback link in the drop-down menu next to the com-
pleted sale on the Items I’ve Sold page in your My eBay page.
 Visit the feedback forum (this link shows up on the bottom of every
page) and click the link that shows all pending feedback for the past
ninety days. When you’ve fallen behind in leaving feedback, this is a
super-fast way to catch up.
Reply to feedback received
You may occasionally get feedback that you feel compelled to respond to. Did
you know that you could? If the feedback is neutral or negative, I recommend
that you cover yourself by explaining the situation for future bidders to see.
80
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

If you receive a negative feedback rating, a well-meaning admission of guilt
would work. You could say something like, “Unfortunately, shipping was
delayed and I regret the situation.” Prospective bidders will see that you’ve
addressed the problem instead of just letting it go.
To respond to feedback, follow these steps:
1. In the My eBay Views area on your My eBay page, click the Feedback
link under My Account.
2. On the feedback page, click the Go to Feedback Forum link at the top
of the page.
3. On the resulting page, click the Reply to Feedback Received link.
The Reply to Feedback Received page appears, as shown in Figure 3-15.
4. Scroll to find the feedback comment that you want to respond to and
click the Reply link.
5. Type your response, and then click the Leave Response button.
The eBay PowerSeller program
I’m sure you’ve seen that PowerSeller logo on auctions. eBay PowerSellers
represent the largest gross sales users on eBay. The requirements for becom-
ing a PowerSeller follow:
Figure 3-15:
Review 
and respond
to your
feedbacks.
81
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

 You must have a gross monthly dollar volume of $1000 (Bronze level);
$3000 (Silver level); $10,000 (Gold level); $25,000 (Platinum level); or
$150,000 (Titanium level). To remain a PowerSeller, you must maintain
your level’s minimum gross sales for the past three months and keep
current with all the other requirements. To advance up the PowerSeller
chain, you must reach and maintain the next level of gross sales for an
average of three months.
If you miss your minimum gross sales for three months, eBay gives you a
grace period. After that time, if you don’t meet the minimum gross fig-
ures for your level, you may be moved down to the prior level or be
removed from the PowerSeller program.
 You must have at least one hundred feedback comments, with 98 per-
cent positive. To calculate your feedback percentage, divide your
number of positive feedbacks by your number of total feedbacks 
(negatives plus positives).
 You must average a minimum monthly total of four listings in the past
three months.
PowerSellers enjoy many benefits:

The best thing about being a PowerSeller is the awesome level of customer
service you receive, called Priority eSupport. When a PowerSeller dashes off
an e-mail to a special customer service department, a reply comes back at
the speed of light.
eBay doesn’t require you to show the PowerSeller logo in your descriptions
when you attain that level. Some PowerSellers don’t include the logo in their
auctions because they’d rather be perceived as regular folks on eBay.
eBay auction software
eBay has developed a fantastic software program called Turbo Lister, which
is free and downloadable from the site. They also have an online Selling
Manager to manage your auctions. For a breakdown of these software prod-
ucts and others to ease the seller’s burden, skip to Chapter 9.
82
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

PayPal Buyer Protection
When a buyer pays with PayPal, he or she is covered with its fraud protection
program. Tangible items sold on eBay that can be shipped (and are paid
through PayPal) are covered to $200. (Intangibles, such as services, licenses,
and other access to digital content aren’t covered.) PayPal covers some
items sold by the most reputable sellers up to $2000 of the final selling price.
The amount at which your sales are covered is indicated at the bottom of the
Meet the Seller area on each listing page.
The plan covers only fraud, not damaged packages. The United States Postal
Service offers insurance as an option, so I guess this means if your package
arrives damaged and isn’t insured, the buyer is out of luck and you’re going
to get some bad feedback unless you make things right. The protection pro-
gram covers eBay buyers only when they’re defrauded, the item is never
shipped, or the item is significantly different from the auction description.
When you ship an item through the USPS, PayPal will accept a delivery confir-
mation number that has been scanned at arrival as proof of delivery. If the
item you send is valued over $250, PayPal requires that you get a signature
delivery confirmation to protect the seller. The policy does not cover sellers
for anything — so don’t ship that item until you’re darn sure the check has
cleared!
Once a buyer files a successful claim against you, the money they paid you is
whisked out of your PayPal account immediately.
Note that there is also a PayPal Seller Protection program; see Chapter 13 for
details on how to stay protected.
eBay education
eBay offers many forms of training and education. No matter how advanced
you are, it’s fun to go to eBay University and take a refresher course on the
basics. You can also find some cool online interactive tutorials as you make
your way through eBay. When you can, take a moment and watch them —
you might just see one or two new features that you didn’t know about. 
More information about eBay education is available at www.eBay.com/
education.
eBay University
The eBay traveling tent show goes across the country, hosting thousands of
eBay members, spreading the eBay word to the masses. You get a chance to
meet some wonderful people who work for eBay and enjoy answering ques-
tions. eBay University follows two tracks:
83
Chapter 3: Cool eBay Tools

 Basic Selling: A beginning class for new sellers that lays out the basics
so they can progress from there.
 Beyond the Basics: A tutorial on eBay tools for advanced sellers.
Find out where classes are being held by going to www.eBay.com/
university.
Online workshops
eBay has ongoing online workshops that allow you to participate through a
chat screen. eBay members and staff give the one-hour workshops. eBay
records and archives many interesting classes in the eBay education area, so
you can see the classes after they premiere as well. Remember to take the
opinions passed on in these workshops as just that, opinions. Weigh the
ideas and balance them against what you’ve learned and what you know
rather than accept them as gospel.

T
here are a lot of shoulds in this world. You should do this and you should
do that. I don’t know who’s in charge of the shoulds, but certain things
just make life work better. You may or may not take any of the advice on
these pages, but they’ll make your eBay business thrive with a minimum of
anguish. If you’ve ever had an auction pulled by eBay, you know what anguish
truly feels like.
In the real world, we have to take responsibility for our own actions. If we
buy a fifty-two-inch plasma television for $250 from some guy selling them
out of the back of a truck, who do we have to blame when we take it home
and it doesn’t work? You get what you pay for, and you have no consumer
protection from the seller of the possibly “hot” TVs. Responsible con-
sumerism is every buyer’s job. Lawsuits get filed — and some are won —
when someone feels they’ve been ripped off, but my best advice is that if you
stay clean in your online business, you’ll keep clean.
eBay is a community, and the community was founded on the following five
basic values:
 We believe people are basically good.
 We believe everyone has something to contribute.
 We believe that an honest, open environment can bring out the best in
people.
 We recognize and respect everyone as a unique individual.
 We encourage you to treat others the way that you want to be treated.

eBay is committed to these values, and it says so right on its Web site. eBay
believes that community members should “honor these values — whether
buying, selling, or chatting.” So should we all.
Is What You Want to Sell Legal?
Although eBay is based in California and therefore must abide by California
law, sellers do business all over the United States. Therefore, items sold on
eBay must be governed by the laws of every other state as well. As a seller,
you’re ultimately responsible for the legality of the items you sell and the
way that you transact business on eBay. Yes, you’re able to sell thousands of
different items on eBay. But do you know what you aren’t allowed to sell 
on eBay?
The eBay User Agreement outlines all eBay rules and regulations regarding
what you can and can’t sell as well as all aspects of doing business at eBay. 
If you’ve never ever read the User Agreement, you really should — at least
once. You can find it at the following address:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html
These policies can change from time to time. As an active seller, you should
make sure that you’re notified of any changes. To request that you be notified
when eBay makes changes to the User Agreement or Privacy Policy, as well
as to control any correspondence you receive from eBay, follow these steps:
1. Sign in with your user ID and password.
You have to sign in with your password before the Legal and Policy
Notification Preferences page appears.
2. Go to your My eBay page. In the My eBay Views section on the left
side of the page, click the Preferences link under My Account.
3. On the resulting Preferences page, click the Show link, next to Legal
and Policy Notifications.
4. Click Edit.
5. Click to put check marks in the check boxes below the Email column
(see Figure 4-1).
This enables you to receive important information that may affect how
you run your business.
6. Click Save to save your changes.
86
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

The preceding procedure for changing notifications will work on any of the
options on this page. Take a moment and go through each of your options to
be sure everything is set up the way you like it.
By now, you should have a firm grasp of the rules and regulations for listing
auctions (if not, check out Chapter 2). But in addition to knowing the rules
for listing items, you must consider the items themselves. In this section, I
detail the three categories of items to be wary of: prohibited, restricted, and
infringing. Some are banned, period. Others fall in a gray area. You’re respon-
sible for what you sell, so you’d better know what’s legal and what’s not.
You may think it’s okay to give away a regulated or banned item as a bonus
item with your auction. Think again. Even giving away such items for free
doesn’t save you from potential legal responsibility.
Prohibited items
A prohibited item is banned from sale on eBay. You can’t sell a prohibited item
under any circumstance. Take a look at the following list. A little common
sense tells you there’s good reason for not selling these items, including lia-
bility issues for the seller (what if you sold alcohol to a minor? — that’s
against the law).
The following is a list of items prohibited as of this writing, so don’t try to sell
’em at eBay:

*Alcohol may be allowed if the value of the item lies in the collectible con-
tainer (bottle) exceeding the alcohol’s retail price. The item should not be
currently available at a retail outlet. The auction should state that the con-
tainer has not been opened, and the seller should be sure that the buyer is
over twenty-one. eBay does allow licensed and vetted sellers of wine to sell
on the site. For more information visit http://pages.ebay.com/help/

champagne designed by Frank Sinatra on eBay
in 1998. Korbel bottles have featured artwork by
designer Nicole Miller and comedienne Whoopi
Goldberg as well as designs by Tony Bennett
and Jane Seymour.
People also collect Jim Beam bottles, Dug’s
decanters, and miniatures that are even more
valuable when they’re full. You can sell these 
on eBay as long as you fulfill the following
requirements:
 The value of the item is in the collectible
container, not its contents.
 The auction description should state that
the container has not been opened, but any
incidental contents are not intended for
consumption.
 The item must not be available at any retail
outlet, and the container must have a value
that substantially exceeds the current retail
price of the alcohol in the container.
 Sellers should take steps to ensure that 
the buyer of these collectibles is of lawful
age in the buyer’s and seller’s jurisdictions
(generally 21 years old).

Potentially infringing items
Potentially infringing items follow a slippery slope. If you list a potentially
infringing item, you may infringe on existing copyrights, trademarks, registra-
tions, or the like. Get the idea? These items are prohibited for your own 
protection.
Items falling under the potentially infringing category are generally copy-
righted or trademarked items, such as software, promotional items, and
games. Even using a brand name in your auction as part of a description
(known as keyword spamming) may get you into trouble.
Keyword spamming manipulates the eBay search engine by including an unre-
lated item in the listing for a copyrighted or trademarked item, and then
diverting bidders to an auction of other merchandise. This is frustrating to
the person trying to use the search engine to find a particular item and unfair
to members who have properly listed their items.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 
The Chanel-style purse
I once listed a quilted leather women’s purse
that had a gold chain strap, which I described
as a Chanel-style purse. Within two hours, 
I received an Informational alert from the eBay
listing police. I described the item to the best 
of my ability, but found that it became a poten-
tially infringing item. My use of the brand name
Chanel caused my auction to come under the
violation of keyword spamming (more on that in
the section “Potentially infringing items”).
In its informational alert, eBay described my 
violation:
“Keyword spamming is the practice of
adding words, including brand names,
which do not directly describe the item you
are selling. The addition of these words may
not have been intentional, but including
them in this manner diverts members to
your listing inappropriately.”
Ooops! You can see how my ingenuous listing
was actually a violation of policy. Think twice
before you add brand names to your auction
description. Thankfully, the eBay police judge
each violation on a case-by-case basis. Because
my record is clear, I merely got a reprimand. Had
my violation been more deliberate, I might have
been suspended.
Note: In addition, in your title, you may not use
a brand name along with the words not or like.
As in Chanel-like purse or not Chanel. This is
also considered a violation of the keyword
spamming policy.
To see the Chanel USA statement on violations,
visit its About Me page. The violations apply 
to many items that may be listed at eBay:
http://members.ebay.com/aboutme/
chanelusa/.

Keyword spamming can take many forms. Some merely mislead the prospec-
tive bidder while others are legal infringements. A few of the most common are
 Superfluous brand names in the title or item description
 Using something like “not brand X” in the title or item description
 Improper trademark usage
 Lists of keywords
 Hidden text — white text on a white background or hidden text in HTML
code. The white text shows up in the search but is not visible to the
naked eye. Sneaky, eh?
 Drop-down boxes
To get the latest on eBay’s keyword spamming policy, go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/keyword-spam.html
Repeating various nontrademarked keywords can get you in trouble as well.
eBay permits the use of as many as five synonyms when listing an item for
sale. A permissible example of this might be: purse, handbag, pocketbook,
satchel, and bag. Adding many nontrademarked keywords would cause the
auction to come up in more searches.
93
Chapter 4: Safe Selling Equals Profitable Sales
The eBay Verified Rights Owners program
eBay can’t possibly check every auction for authenticity. But to help protect trademarked items, it
formed the Verified Rights Owners (VeRO) program. Trademark and copyright owners expend large
amounts of energy to develop and maintain control over the quality of their products. If you buy a
“designer” purse from a guy on the street for $20, it’s probably counterfeit, so don’t go selling it on
eBay. eBay works with VeRO program members to educate the community about such items. They
work also with verified owners of trademarks and copyrights to remove auctions that infringe on
their products. If eBay doesn’t close a suspicious or blatantly infringing auction, both you and eBay
are liable for the violation.
To become a member of the VeRO program, the owners of copyrights and trademarks must supply
eBay with proof of ownership. If you are a legitimate owner and someone on the site has violated
your rights, download the Notice of Infringement form at
http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/notice-infringe2.pdf
Note: eBay cooperates with law enforcement. Should you be a violator, they may give your name
and street address to a VeRO program member.
To view a list of other VeRO members’ About Me pages, go to
http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/vero-aboutme.html

Trading Violations
Both buyers and sellers can commit trading violations by attempting to
manipulate the outcome of an auction or a sale. Many of the violations aren’t
necessarily buyer or seller exclusive, but apply to both. Regardless of the
nature of a violation, such bad behavior harms everyone who’s part of the
eBay community.
As a valued member of the community, it’s partially your responsibility to look
out for such violations — so that eBay continues to be a safe venue in which
to do business. Should you see a violation, report it immediately to the eBay
Security Center (see “eBay’s Security Center,” later in this chapter). In this sec-
tion, I detail many common violations so that you can be on the outlook for
them — and I’ll just assume that you won’t be committing any yourself.
We need to be watchdogs because we need to protect the other users in our
community. Don’t feel like a squealer if you make a report. Remember that it
takes just one rotten apple to spoil the basket, so if you see a violation, do
your duty and report it.
When the competition doesn’t play fair
Unfortunately, you may sometimes encounter non-community-minded sellers
who interfere with your auctions or sales. This interference can take on sev-
eral forms, such as sellers who illegally drive up bids or “steal” bidders.
Again, should you fall victim to bad deeds, be sure to report the bad-deed-
doer’s actions immediately. (Check out “Taking Action: What to Do When
Someone Breaks the Rules,” later in this chapter.) eBay will take some sort 
of disciplinary action. Penalties range from formal warnings and temporary
suspension to indefinite suspension. eBay reviews each incident on a case-
by-case basis before passing judgment.
Shill bidding
Shill bidding is the practice of placing a bid on an auction to artificially inflate
the final value. It’s the bane of every eBay user (whether buyer or seller) and
undermines community trust. Shill bidding is a violation of the Federal wire-
fraud statute, which encompasses the practice of entering into interstate
commerce to defraud — it’s a felony and not something to toy with!
The practice of shill bidding has been a part of auctions from their begin-
nings. To prevent the suspicion of shill bidding, people in the same family,
those who share the same computer, and folks who work or live together
should not bid on each other’s items.
94
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Should you ever even dream of participating in any sort of auction manipula-
tion, I urge you to think twice. You might think you’re smart by using another
e-mail address and username, but that doesn’t work. Every time you log on to
your ISP, your connection carries an IP address. So no matter what name or
computer you use, your connection will identify you. eBay can use this
number to track you through its site.
Shill bidders are fairly easy to recognize, even for the eBay user who isn’t
privy to things such as IP addresses. By checking a bidder’s auction history,
you can easily determine a user’s bidding pattern. A bidder who constantly
bids up items and never wins is suspicious.
Spurious sellers often employ shill bidding to increase the number of bids on
an item to more quickly make it a hot item. This doesn’t mean that all hot
auctions are products of shill bidding; it means that hot auctions are desir-
able and pull in lots of extra bids (due to the herd mentality). Rogues would
like all their auctions to be hot and may take any road to ensure that they are.
Transaction interference
Have you ever received an e-mail from an eBay seller offering you an item
that you’re currently bidding on for a lower price? This is called transaction
interference, and it can prevent sellers from gaining the highest bid possible.
Transaction interference occurs also when a troublemaker who has it “in” for
a particular seller e-mails bidders participating in the seller’s current auc-
tions to warn them away from completing the auction. Tales of woe and much
bitterness usually accompany such e-mails. If a bidder has a problem with a
seller, that bidder can — and should — file a report with eBay and leave nega-
tive feedback for that seller. This sort of e-mail barrage can potentially fall
under the category of libel and isn’t a safe thing to practice. If you receive an
e-mail like this, ignore its message but report it to eBay.
Transaction interception
They say the criminal mind is complex; when it comes to transaction inter-
ception, it certainly is! Transaction interception occurs when an eBay
scalawag keeps track of closing auctions and then, when the auction is fin-
ished, e-mails the winner as if the scalawag were the seller. The e-mail often
looks official and is congratulatory, politely asking for payment. Interceptors
usually use a post office box for such mischief. This behavior goes beyond
being a trading violation — it’s stealing.
The best way to protect yourself from such miscreants is to accept payments
through a payment service, such as PayPal, by using a Pay Now link. For
more about setting up a payment service account, see Chapter 13.
95
Chapter 4: Safe Selling Equals Profitable Sales

Fee avoidance
Basically, fee avoidance is the practice of evading paying eBay fees by going
around the eBay system. You can commit fee avoidance in many ways —
sometimes without even realizing it. Read this section carefully so that you
don’t fall into this violation by mistake.
You’re guilty of fee avoidance if you
 Use an eBay member’s contact information in an attempt to sell, off the
eBay site, a listed item
 Use an eBay member’s contact information to sell, off the eBay site, an
item from a closed auction in which the reserve wasn’t met
 Close your auction early so you can sell the item to someone who has
e-mailed you with an offer to buy the item
 Cancel bids to end your auction before it legally closes so you can sell
the item to someone who has e-mailed you with an offer of a higher
price
 Offer duplicates of your item to the unsuccessful bidders in your auc-
tion, unless you use the Second Chance option
Take a look at the discussion on listing policies in Chapter 2 for listing viola-
tions that also might fall into this category.
Excessive shipping charges
Although the excessive shipping charges violation falls somewhat in the Fee
Avoidance category, it has a rule all to itself. You, as a seller, are required to
charge reasonable shipping and handling fees. You may not charge a shipping
fee that’s disproportionate to the item you are selling. Charging $15 to ship a
cell phone accessory is a good example of unwarranted charges. A cell phone
accessory can most likely be shipped First Class — or at the very most at the
one-pound rate.
I know; you’re saying that you see lots of sellers violating this rule, but this is
a firm policy. Should you want to report another seller’s shameless shipping
charges, just click the Report This Item link at the bottom of every listing
page. If sellers are flagrant about breaking this rule and enough complaints
are in their record, they can be suspended from eBay.
Nonselling seller
Refusing to accept payment from the winning bidder and refusing to com-
plete the transaction is simply wrong. Very, very bad form! You are legally
and morally bound to complete any transaction in which you enter.
96
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Baaad bidders
Nothing can ruin a seller’s day like a difficult bidder, such as someone who
asks questions that are clearly answered already in your auction description
or someone who asks you to close the auction so that he or she can buy the
item offline. Sheesh — you’d think no one read the rules. From the nonpaying
bidder to the unwelcome and shady, you might encounter the buyers I
describe here.
Bid shielding
When two or more eBay members work together to defraud you out of real
auction profits, they’re guilty of bid shielding. One member, lets call him Joe,
places an early bid on your item, with a proxy bid. (An automatic bid that
increases your bid to outbid any competition, up to the highest amount you
specify.) Immediately, the accomplice (we’ll call her Ann) places a very high
proxy bid to drive it to the max or beyond. If legitimate bidders bid, they only
ratchet up the second bidder’s bid — they don’t outbid the high bidder’s
proxy. When the auction is coming to it’s twelve-hour bid freeze, the high
bidder (Ann) retracts her bid, thereby granting the winning bid to her buddy
(Joe), the original low bidder. The ultimate point of bid shielding is that it
increases the bid to such a high level that normal bidding by authentic bid-
ders is discouraged and they stop watching the listing.
This illegal bidding process is used not only to get bargain-priced merchan-
dise but also to drive bidders away from competitors’ auctions by artificially
inflating the high bid level.
Unwelcome bidder
In this business, you might think that you couldn’t possibly regard anyone as
an unwelcome bidder, but you just might. Remember how you painstakingly
explain your terms in your auction description? That’s lost on people who
don’t take the time to read those descriptions or choose to ignore them.
Consider the following points:
 You state in your description that you ship only within the United States,
but you see a bidder with an e-mail address that ends in .jp (Japan),
.au (Australia), .uk (United Kingdom), or whatever.
 A prospective buyer has three Unpaid Item strikes on his or her account
in the past thirty days and decides to bid or buy your item. You proba-
bly won’t get paid, but you still have the hassle of cleaning up and trying
to get fee refunds.
 You don’t want bidders who have a negative feedback, but someone 
fitting that description bids on your auction.
97
Chapter 4: Safe Selling Equals Profitable Sales

 You decide to cancel a bid for one of the previous two reasons, but the
bidder continues to bid on your auction.
 You’ve blocked a particular bidder who’s now using a secondary
account to bid on your auctions.
To solve these issues before they occur, you can set your Selling Preferences
to prevent bad bidding from ruining your sales. Visit Chapter 3 for instruc-
tions on how to block people who could ruin your sales.
Nonpaying buyers
If there’s one thing that just ain’t tolerated at eBay, it’s unpaid items. eBay
reminds all potential buyers, before they place a bid, that “If you are the win-
ning buyer, you will enter into a legally binding contract to purchase the item
from the seller.” You’d think that was clear enough, but sadly, many people
out there think bidding and buying on eBay is a game. If you see a high bidder
on your auction who has very low or negative feedback, dropping a line reit-
erating eBay policy never hurts.
How you, as a seller, communicate with the high bidder is also important.
Many times a well-written, congenial, businesslike e-mail can cajole the basi-
cally good person into sending payment. To see some samples that get the
job done, drop by Chapter 12.
I’ve been selling and buying on eBay for more than eleven years. During that
time, I’ve had to file only twenty nonpaying buyer alerts (see the steps a bit
later in this section). I think that nonpaying buyers tend to bid on certain
types of items. After you’ve seen some unpaid items, you’ll get an idea of
which items to stay away from. My items? A gas-powered scooter, a video
game, and some Beanie Babies. Serious collector or business items have
never been an issue.
To reduce the number of nonpaying buyers, eBay has established that all
eBay users are indefinitely suspended if they have three nonpaying buyer
alerts filed against them. An indefinite suspension is a suspension of mem-
bers’ privileges to use the eBay site for more than sixty days, with no definite
reinstatement date. If users attempt to re-register at eBay and use the system
under new IDs, they risk being referred to the United States Attorney
General’s Office for the Northern District of California for criminal 
prosecution.
Before filing an unpaid item dispute, give the winner a second chance to send
payment. If you still don’t receive payment, follow these steps to recoup your
final value fees and be eligible for the nonpaying buyer relist credit:
98
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

1. As soon as you have a winner, contact him or her.
2. If you don’t hear from the winner within three days of the auction’s
end time, send a payment reminder:
a. Go to the My eBay Views area on the My eBay page. Under
Selling, click the Sold link.
b. Click the View Payment Status link next to the pertinent auction.
c. Click the Send a Payment Reminder link.
You may send a reminder between three and thirty days after the auc-
tion closes.
If you still don’t hear from or receive money from your high bidder, it’s time
to swing into action by filing an alert.
You must file the alert no earlier than seven days and no later than forty-five
days after the auction has ended.
Follow these steps to file an unpaid item dispute:
1. In the My eBay Views area of the My eBay page, click the Dispute
Console link.
Alternately, go to the following address:
http://rebulk.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?CreateDispute
2. Check the Dispute Console to select the transaction that is eligible for
filing.
eBay sends the buyer an e-mail, and the buyer has the right to respond
in the dispute management process.
Eight days after filing an unpaid item dispute, you may close the dispute and
apply for a final value fee credit in the Dispute Console. At this point, eBay
offers several options. To close the dispute, you must select one of the 
following:
 We’ve completed the transaction and we’re both satisfied. You
received your payment and you’re ready to ship! The buyer will not
receive an undeserved Unpaid Item strike.
 We’ve agreed not to complete the transaction. If you feel sorry for the
buyer or believe their tale of woe as to how they cannot possibly buy
your item, you can select this option. The buyer won’t get a strike on his
or her permanent record, and you will receive a final value fee credit.
(The item is eligible for the standard relist credit.)
99
Chapter 4: Safe Selling Equals Profitable Sales

 I no longer wish to communicate with or wait for the buyer. You’ve
had it — either no response or no payment. The buyer receives their
well-deserved Unpaid Item strike and you get your final value fee credit.
(This item is eligible for a relist credit.)
You must file for your final value fee credit within sixty days of the transac-
tion’s close.
Don’t forget! When you file for your final value fee credit, you also have the
option of blocking that buyer from participating in your sales.
If you work things out with the winner, you may remove the unpaid item
strike within ninety days of the close of the listing. eBay sends an e-mail to
notify the winner that the strike has been removed at your request. You’ll
find the link to remove the warning at your Dispute Console:
1. Go to the My eBay page. Scroll down the My eBay Views to the
Dispute Console link and click it.
2. On the Dispute Console page, next to the dispute in question, select
Cancel the Unpaid Item Strike for This Dispute from the drop down
menu.
3. Click Confirm to remove the Unpaid Item strike.
An e-mail is sent to the buyer letting the buyer know that the strike has
been removed and his or her reputation is clear.
In the case of Multiple Item listings or eBay store items, you may file an
unpaid item strike only once per listing. You may file against as many buyers
as necessary in that one alert, but you can’t go back and file more strikes
later. You may remove an unpaid item strike at any time.
Not knowing who’s who
eBay members have user IDs rather than expose their e-mail addresses for all
to see. However, you must supply eBay with your contact information. When
you register with eBay, its software immediately checks your primary phone
number area code against your ZIP code to verify that the two numbers are
from the same city. If you’ve supplied incompatible codes, the eBay servers
will recognize that and ask you to reinput the correct codes.
An eBay member who’s involved in a transaction with you can get your
phone number by clicking Advanced Search next to the eBay search box and
then clicking the Find Contact Information link under the Members area on
the left side of the page.

Don’t be lured by phishing
Fraudulent e-mail has become a common
occurrence. Without warning, a request for
confirmation of your personal details arrives
allegedly from your bank, Internet ISP, credit
card company, PayPal, or even eBay. These
e-mails are phishing for your personal informa-
tion and passwords to defraud you of your
money or your identity.
These e-mails look just like a legitimate e-mail
from the company that holds your data. If you
follow the links in the e-mail to “update” your
information, you’ll be brought to a Web page
that duplicates a legitimate Web page. How can
you protect yourself from these scammers?
 Never go to the Web site in question 
from the link in the e-mail. Open up a new
browser and type the URL that you normally
use to enter the site. After you log in, you’ll
know whether there’s a problem with any of
your information.
 Always look for secure Web site informa-
tion. If you’re logged onto a secure Web
site, the URL will begin with https://
rather than the standard http://. You’ll
also see a lock symbol in the status bar at
the bottom of your browser window.
 Regularly log onto your Internet accounts.
By keeping in regular contact with your
providers, you’ll know about issues with
your accounts before they have a chance
to cause a problem.
 Report the e-mail. If you receive an e-mail
supposedly from PayPal, forward the e-mail
to spoof@paypal.com. Forward an
e-mail purportedly from eBay to spoof@
ebay.com.
I take things into my own hands by checking the
suspicious e-mail’s underlying code. You can do
this if you use Internet Explorer and Outlook, by
opening the e-mail, right-clicking it, and choos-
ing View Source. When you view the HTML
code, you’ll be able to see the actual URL of the
site that would get your response if you click the
link, as shown in the figure.

When you arrive at the page, you can then request contact information, as
shown in Figure 4-2.
To be on the up-and-up at eBay (and to keep others honest, too), make sure
that you
 Have your current phone number on file at eBay: If a buyer can’t reach
you, you’re in violation and you can be disciplined.
 Have your current e-mail address on file: If your buyer continually 
gets e-mail bounced back from your e-mail address, you could get in big
trouble.
 Report all underage buyers: If you suspect that a buyer in one of your
transactions is underage (eBay requires that all users be over 18), eBay
may close the account. Underage buyers may be using their parent’s
credit card without permission, or perhaps even a stolen card, for 
registration.
 Verify e-mail purportedly coming from an eBay employee: If someone
e-mails you claiming to work for eBay, be sure to check it out before
replying. When eBay employees conduct personal business on the site,
company policy requires that they use a personal noncompany e-mail
address for their user registration. If you suspect someone is imperson-
ating an eBay employee for harmful purposes, contact the eBay Security
Center.
Taking Action: What to Do When
Someone Breaks the Rules
You need to take a business-like approach to problems at eBay, whatever
those problems may be. In previous sections of this chapter, I outline eBay’s
many rules, as well as the bad deeds and bad seeds you’re likely to encounter
while doing business on eBay.

Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

As a member of the eBay community, you have the responsibility of knowing
and abiding by eBay’s rules and regulations. This responsibility includes noti-
fying eBay when someone tries to sell an illegal item (see “Is What You Want
to Sell Legal?” earlier in this chapter), an integral part of keeping eBay a safe
and lucrative place to do business. In this section, I discuss who to call when
someone breaks the rules and what to do when a third party is necessary.
Here are the basic steps you can follow:
 Contact the buyer: If you’re involved in a transaction, get the buyer’s
contact information by using the instructions outlined above. Then call
the buyer to see whether you can diplomatically resolve the situation.
 Seek out eBay security: Use the Security Center to report any shady
actions, policy violations, or possible fraud, such as a community
member impersonating an employee or a suspicious auction. Likened to
the front desk at your local police station, eBay’s Security Center report
form gets results. On an item’s page, scroll to the bottom and click the
Report this item link. On most other eBay pages, click the Security
Center link, which usually appears at the bottom. Then select the issue
you want to report and select the Report a Problem check box.
Alternatively, you can go directly to
http://contact.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ShowCUPortal
You’ll find an all-purpose security form on this page to help you in your
eBay transactions. These forms will be routed to the right department
for action.
 Apply for online resolution: SquareTrade (www.squaretrade.com)
offers online dispute resolution services and mediation for eBay mem-
bers. See the following section on how to involve SquareTrade.
 Contact the National Fraud Information Center (NFIC): If you feel
you’ve become a victim of fraud, be sure to file a report through eBay
channels. To really bring down wrath on your nemesis, report them to
the NFIC by calling 1-800-876-7060.
 Contact local law enforcement: If you become the target of a check-
bouncer, contact the local law enforcement in your bidder’s hometown.
eBay will supply any information necessary to help law enforcement
clear the world of fraud. Provide eBay with the name of the local law
enforcement officer, agency, telephone number, and case number or
police report number. Also include the offending user’s ID and the auc-
tion item’s number. For a state-by-state list of the possible criminal
penalties, visit

SquareTrade to the rescue
Threats of suing each other, filing fraud charges, and screaming back and
forth don’t really accomplish anything when you’re in the middle of a dispute
at eBay. Back in the olden days of eBay, when you weren’t able to respond to
feedback, users threw negative feedback back and forth willy-nilly, which
resulted in some vile flame wars.
You can handle this in eBay’s Dispute Console, or you can take it off eBay and
go to SquareTrade. When you’re selling regularly at eBay, you will undoubt-
edly run into a disgruntled buyer or two. SquareTrade, a Web-based dispute
resolution company, waits in the wings to pull you out of the most difficult
situations. SquareTrade pioneered large-scale online dispute resolution and
has handled more than two million disputes across 120 countries in five 
languages, helping consumers and merchants mediate resolutions to 
e-commerce disputes. 
Should you find yourself in an inexorably difficult situation with one of your
buyers, and you’d like to take the situation up a notch, go to the following
page, shown in Figure 4-3:
http://www.squaretrade.com/cnt/jsp/odr/overview_odr.jsp?

After you click the File a Case link on this page and answer a few questions
regarding the situation, SquareTrade generates and sends an e-mail to the
other party, giving instructions on how to respond. From this point, the 
case information and all related responses appear on a private, password-
protected page on the SquareTrade site.

this section:
 Online dispute resolution through direct negotiation
 Professional mediation
 SquareTrade Seal
Online dispute resolution
Online dispute resolution is a fast, private, and convenient way to resolve
your auction disputes — and it’s free. Both you and the buyer work together
through the SquareTrade Web-based system. Online dispute resolution (ODR)
works whether your transaction is in the United States or in another country.
The SquareTrade Web-based negotiation tool is automated, and you and the
other party get to communicate on neutral ground. When (and if) the buyer
responds, the two of you can work out the situation online and without
human interaction. If you’re unable to reach a solution, you need to move on
to professional mediation (see the following section).
SquareTrade states that problems are usually solved in ten to fourteen days
and 85 percent of all cases are resolved without going to mediation. The
process will run a quicker course if both people in the transaction are at their
computers and answer e-mail during the day.
Participation in ODR is voluntary. If a buyer is set on defrauding you, he or
she probably isn’t going to engage in a resolution process. If you get no
response to your ODR, report your situation to the Security Center.
Professional mediation
If push comes to shove, and in auction disputes it certainly may, you might
have to resort to professional mediation. A mediator, who is neither a lawyer
nor a judge, but an impartial professional, works with both parties to bring
the situation to a convivial conclusion. This service is available for a reason-
able fee of $29.95 per issue.
If both parties participating in dispute resolution agree to mediation, each
party communicates with only the assigned mediator, who communicates
with both parties through the same case page. Your case page shows only
your communications with the mediator. The mediator reviews both sides of
the story to find a mutually acceptable solution to the problem. He or she
tries to understand the interests, perspectives, and preferred solutions of
both parties, and tries to help both parties understand the other’s position.
105
Chapter 4: Safe Selling Equals Profitable Sales

The mediator is there to disperse highly charged emotions commonly associ-
ated with disputes and recommends a resolution only if both parties agree to
have the mediator do so. By using the mediation service, you do not lose
your right to go to court if things aren’t worked out.
SquareTrade seal
A SquareTrade seal lets prospective bidders know that you deal with cus-
tomers promptly and honestly. Should you choose to get a SquareTrade seal,
SquareTrade inserts it into your auctions automatically. (Each seal icon con-
tains a digital watermark with an encrypted expiration date.) You can use the
seal in your auctions only if SquareTrade approves you.
Your SquareTrade seal approval is based on several points:
 Identity verification: SquareTrade verifies your identity using the infor-
mation you provide through a third party.
 Superior selling record: SquareTrade runs your eBay feedback history
through five individual checks. It has an advanced system based on its
extensive experience of dispute resolution that allows it to evaluate the
quality and quantity of eBay feedback.
 Dispute resolution: They check whether you have a history of resolving
disputes.
 Commitment to standards: You pledge to meet the SquareTrade stan-
dards regarding selling and to respond to disputes within two business
days.
After you have a seal, you must continue to uphold SquareTrade standards
and maintain an acceptable feedback rating. The nifty little personalized seal
icon will appear on each of your auctions. Users can click the icon to access
your own Seal Display page on the SquareTrade site.
The SquareTrade seal is a fee program — an affordable and good idea if
you’re in this business for the long run. The seal tells prospective buyers that
you care about good customer service and don’t tolerate fraudulent activity.
It also says that you abide by the SquareTrade selling and customer service
standards, which dictate that you will
 Disclose contact information and credentials
 Provide clear and accurate descriptions of goods and services in your
auctions
 Clearly disclose pricing, including all applicable fees
 List clear policies on after-sales services, such as refunds and warranties
106
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

 Maintain privacy policies
 Conduct transactions only on secure sites
 Respond to any disputes filed against you within two business days
To provide a much higher level of security for your buyers, you can bond
your auctions using BuySAFE. Your listings will display the BuySAFE seal,
which backs them with a bond up to $25,000. Doing so increases buyer confi-
dence and also protects you. See Chapter 10 for more information.
eBay’s Security Center
The Security Center is the eBay version of the FBI. By rooting out evildoers, it
serves and protects — and puts up with an immense amount of e-mail from
users.
If you see an item on eBay that isn’t allowed (see “Is What You Want to Sell
Legal?”), be sure to make eBay aware of the auction. The Community Watch
team will then take over and investigate the item and, when necessary, end
the auction and warn the seller.
When you click the Security Center link, which is at the bottom of most 
eBay pages, you see the page shown in Figure 4-4. Click the Report Problem
button to get action. You then fill out a step-by-step customer service report.
Alternatively, you can get to the Security Center customer service reporting
form at http://contact.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ShowCUPortal.

f you’re doing well selling your items on eBay auctions, why open a store?
Have you used the eBay Buy It Now feature in one of your listings? Did it
work? In an eBay store, all items are set at a fixed price and are online until
cancelled (or listed at least thirty days), so it’s kind of like a giant collection
of Buy It Now featured items. Get the idea?
When you open a store, you have just three main rules to remember and
apply: location, location, location. If you were going to open a brick-and-
mortar store, you could open it in the corner strip mall, a shopping center, or
even somewhere downtown. You’d have to decide in what location your store
would do best; that goes for an online store as well. You’ll find tons of loca-
tions to open an online store, including online malls (when you can find
them) and sites such as Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and, of course, eBay.
You have to pay rent for your online store, but opening and running an online
store isn’t nearly as expensive as a store in the real world (where you also
have to pay electrical bills, maintenance bills, and more). Plus, the ratio of
rent to sales makes an online store a much easier financial decision, and your
exposure can be huge.
In this chapter, I show you, step by step, how to hang out your virtual shingle
and get business booming by opening your own eBay store.

Online Stores Galore
Amazon.com, Yahoo!, and eBay make up the big three of the online stores.
They are the top locations and get the most visitors. These sites garnered an
astounding number of unique visitors (that counts all of one person’s visits to
the sites just once a month) within any given day.
No doubt feeling competition from Yahoo! and Amazon.com, eBay decided to
open its doors (in July 2001) to sellers who wanted to open their own stores.
Fixed-price stores were a normal progression for eBay in its quest to continue
as the world’s marketplace. And eBay Stores make sense: It benefits all cur-
rent eBay sellers and opens doors to new shoppers who don’t want to deal
with auctions.
eBay is an online marketplace that specializes in giving you a place to sell your
stuff, not theirs. It doesn’t stock a stick of merchandise, and it isn’t in competi-
tion with you. In addition to its staggering number of visitors, eBay offers you
the most reasonable store rent. You may be able to get an introductory rate
for the first few months on any of these services, but the ongoing rates are
static. To see what I mean, check out the costs in Tables 5-1 and 5-2.

Even the basic ($15.95) eBay store gives you so many extras:
 Selling Manager: This is the super eBay software that replaces your All
Selling page in My eBay. I use it and love it. The $4.99 a month fee is
waived with your basic store.
 Five custom pages: You can use custom pages to customize the look of
your store, make different landing pages, list store policies, and make
the store your own. (I use only a few custom pages and it suits me fine!)
 Web address: Your store has its very own Internet address (URL). This
way you can drive buyers directly to your store. Mine is www.stores.
ebay.com/Marsha-Colliers-Fabulous-Finds.
 Promotion boxes: By using the promotion boxes, you can highlight 
featured merchandise on the top of your store pages.
 Three hundred store categories: You sell sporting goods in one cate-
gory, women’s fashion in another, fine art in one more. . . . You have up
to three hundred custom categories for your varied merchandise.
 Custom store header: Get your own brand by designing a graphic store
header.
 Markdown Manager: Hold a sale in your store! Select items to discount
for a period of time and offer discounted pricing! You can run sales on
up to 250 two hundred fifty listings a day.
 Vacation hold: Ever wish you could make your listings temporarily
unavailable, or let your customers know you’ll be out of town? This
great feature allows you to do just that.
 Picture Manager: Host pictures on eBay’s servers for no extra charge.
Basic store owners get 1 MB free.
 E-mail marketing: Basic store owners can send up to five thousand
e-mail newsletters a month to those who have selected you as a favorite
seller. You can find customized e-newsletters and promotional e-mail lay-
outs in your store’s marketing area.
 Listing feeds: eBay automatically distributes your listings to buyers,
search engines, and comparison shopping sites via online feeds.
 Downloadable business card and stationery templates: If you’ve ever
wanted collateral to go with your eBay store and have wondered about
the legalities of using the eBay logo, you’re not alone. eBay offers pre-
designed (perfectly legal to use) downloadable templates for store
owners to use. Just print them on your color printer and you’re set!
 Search engine keyword management: You may customize search
engine keywords in Manage My Store to improve your store’s page rank-
ings in the search engines to which eBay feeds.
 Traffic reports: Use the eBay store traffic report to improve your 
merchandising and listing strategies.
111
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store

 Store referral credit: If you refer new customers to your store from
flyers, e-mails, and other Web sites, you can get a 75 percent rebate on
Final Value Fees. Visit pages.ebay.com/storefronts/referral-
credit-faq.html for full details.
I don’t think it’s going to take a rocket scientist to convince you that having a
space in eBay Stores (see Figure 5-1) is better than setting up shop anywhere
else. No one I know of gives you more features and improves your chances to
grow a business. I know that stores aren’t based on auctions, but fixed-price
store listings are as easy to handle as auctions.
To review current prices and rules before opening your store, go to
pages.ebay.com/storefronts/subscriptions.html.
Your eBay Store Name
You’ve decided to take the plunge and open an eBay store. Do you have an
eBay user ID? Have you thought of a good name for your store? Your store
name doesn’t have to match your eBay user ID, but they’re more recogniz-
able if they relate to each other. You can use your company name, your busi-
ness name, or a name that describes your business. I recommend that you
use the same name for your eBay store that you plan to use in all your online
businesses. By doing so, you’ll begin to create an identity (or as the pros call
it, a brand) that customers will come to recognize and trust.
Figure 5-1:

112
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

Your online eBay store should not replace your e-commerce-enabled Web site
(see Chapter 8); it should be an extension of it. When people shop at your
eBay store, you must take the opportunity to make them customers of your
Web site through your store’s About the Seller page (which is also your
About Me page on eBay). Good deal!
Setting up Shop
It’s time to get down to business. Go to the eBay Stores hub from the link on
eBay’s home page and click the Why Open an eBay Store link in the upper-
right corner of the screen (refer to Figure 5-1). This takes you to the seller’s
hub of eBay Stores, as shown in Figure 5-2. If you click all the links you see
here, you get the company line about how good an eBay store can be for your
business. You already know how good an eBay store can be for your busi-
ness, so skip the propaganda and get right down to business (but don’t forget
to check for any policy changes that may affect your store’s operations).
Before you click that link to open your store, ask yourself two questions:
 Can I make a serious commitment to my eBay store? A store is a com-
mitment. It won’t work for you unless you work for it. You have to have
the merchandise to fill it and the discipline to continue listing store and
auction items. Your store is a daily, monthly, and yearly obligation. You
can close your store temporarily, but eBay will reserve your store name
for only thirty days. After that, you have to come up with a new name
(and your competition may have taken over your famous store name).
113
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store
Mind your underscores and hyphens
If you want to use your eBay user ID for your
store name, you can — unless it contains a
hyphen (-) or an underscore (_). Remember how
eBay recommends that you break up words in
your user ID with a dash or an underscore? 
Uh oh, that’s no good for an eBay store name.
I’m in that situation. My user ID is marsha_c;
without the underscore, it translates into a user
ID that someone else has already taken! Even
though it hasn’t been used since 1999, someone
else has it, which means I can’t use it.
(marsha_c is probably a crummy name for a
store anyway!)
A favorite seller of mine — mrswarren — 
realized that mrswarren isn’t a good name for a
store either. So she named her store Pretty
Girlie Things, which suits her merchandise 
to a T.

 Will I work for my eBay store even when I don’t feel like it? You have
to be prepared for the times when you’re sick or just don’t feel like ship-
ping, but orders are waiting to go out. You have to do the work anyway;
it’s all part of the commitment.
eBay gives you the venue, but it’s in your own hands to make your mercantile
efforts a success. If you can handle these two responsibilities, read on!
If you’re serious and ready to move on, click the Open a Store link in the upper-
right corner of the page (refer to Figure 5-2). You’re escorted to a page remind-
ing you that eBay stores fall under the same User Agreement that you agreed to
when you began selling on eBay. Click the Continue button to access the Build
Your Store pages similar to the image in Figure 5-3. Because I have an eBay
store, eBay allows me to make changes and redesign my store at any time.
You need to make a few decisions to create a good store. So before building
your store, read the following sections.
Depending on the whims and changes on eBay, the order in which you have
to make these decisions may change, but these are choices that you must
make:
1. Choose a color theme.
eBay provides some elegant color and graphics themes (see Figure 5-3).
You can change the color scheme or layout later, so until you have 
time to go hog-wild and design a custom masterpiece, choose one of 
the fourteen clearly organized layouts, either predesigned or with easily
Figure 5-2:
The seller’s
welcome
page to
eBay
Stores.
114
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

customizable themes. Don’t select something overly bright and vibrant;
you want something that’s easy on the eyes, which is more conducive to
a comfortable selling environment.
You have the option of selecting a store theme that doesn’t require you
to insert a custom logo or banner. I highly recommend against it. You
need to establish a unifying brand for your online business.
2. Click Continue.
3. Type your new store’s name.
You’ve decided on a store name, right? Your eBay store name can’t
exceed thirty-five characters. Before you type it, double-check that you
aren’t infringing on anyone’s copyrights or trademarks. You also can’t
use any permutation of eBay trademarks in your store’s name.
4. Type a short description of your store.
When I say short, I mean short. The paragraph you’re reading is 249 char-
acters, and you have only 300 characters to give a whiz-bang, electric
description of your store and merchandise. You can’t use HTML coding
to doll up the description, and you can’t use links. Just the facts please,
and a little bit of dazzle.
The importance of this description is huge. When people search eBay
stores and descriptions, the keyword information you put here is refer-
enced. Also, if the store header contains your description (as in the
Classic style themes), search engines such as Google and Yahoo! will
look in this description for the keywords to classify and list your store.
Write your copy ahead of time in Word. Then, still in Word, highlight the
text and choose Tools➪Word Count. Word gives you the word count of
the highlighted text. Check the character count with spaces, to be sure
your text fits.
5. Select a graphic to jazz up the look of your store.
You can use one of eBay’s clip-art style banners or create a custom 
310-x-90-pixel one. If you use one of eBay’s graphics, you must promise
(hand over heart) that you won’t keep it there for long. (See the text
after this set of steps for info on designing your own graphics — or
hiring someone to do it.)
6. Click Continue.
Now you should have an idea of what your store will look like. You are
about to open an eBay storefront (drumroll, please).
7. Sign up for the basic store ($15.95 a month), and click the 
Start My Subscription Now button.
115
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store

Your store is now live on the Internet with nothing up for sale — yet.
8. Click the supplied link to get in the trenches and customize your store
further.
If you’re wondering in which category your store will be listed on the eBay
Stores home page, it’s all up to you. eBay checks the items as you list them in
the standard eBay category format. For example, if you have six books listed
in the Books: Fiction and Nonfiction category and five items in the Cameras &
Photo category, you’ll be in the listings for both of those categories. Your
custom store categories (read on) will be used to classify items only in your
store.
If you use one of eBay’s prefab graphics, people shopping your eBay store
will know that you aren’t serious enough about your business to design a
simple and basic logo. I’ve had many years of experience in advertising and
marketing, and I must tell you that a custom look will beat out clip art any
day. Your store is special — put forth the effort to make it shine.
If you have a graphics program, design a graphic with your store’s name.
Start with something simple; you can always change it later when you have
more time. Save the image as a GIF or a JPG, and upload it to the site where
you host your images (your own Web site, your ISP, or a hosting service).
A bunch of talented graphic artists make their living selling custom Web
graphics on eBay. If you aren’t comfortable designing, search eBay for web
banner or banner design. Graphic banners on eBay sell for about $10 to $20 —
certainly worth the price in the time you’ll save.

Running Your Store
As part of your store subscription, your My eBay selling area is replaced with
eBay’s Selling Manager. Selling Manager gives you easy access to customize
your store at any time by going to the Manage My Store box, on the lower
right of your Selling Manager summary page, shown in Figure 5-4.
Store design
In the Store Design area (see the screen shot of mine in Figure 5-5), you can
perform major tasks required for your store.

117
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store

Here are a just few of the tasks you should consider revisiting:
 Store design: You can always go back here to change the name of your
store or the theme of your pages. You can also change the way your
items are displayed: gallery view (as shown in Figure 5-6) or list view.
Neither view is inherently better, but I like the gallery view because it
shows the thumbnail gallery pictures of my items.
You should also select the order in which your items will sort. Highest
Priced First, Lowest Priced First, Items Ending First, or Newly Listed
First. I like Items Ending First as my sort, so that buyers can get the
chance to swoop in on items closing soon.
 Custom pages: Most successful eBay sellers have (at the very least) a
store policies page. Figure 5-7 shows you the one for my store. When you
set up a policies page, eBay supplies you with a choice of layouts. Just
click the Create New Page link to select the template that you want to
use. Don’t freak out if you don’t know HTML, eBay helps you out with an
easy-to-use HTML generator, as in the Sell Your Item form.
Following are some important policies to include:
• Indicate to what locations you’ll ship.
• Specify the sales tax you plan to collect. If your state doesn’t
require you to collect sales tax, leave the area blank. If it does,
select your state and indicate the proper sales tax. Most states
won’t require you to collect sales tax unless the sale is shipped to
your home state. Check the links in Chapter 15 to verify your
state’s sales tax regulations.
Figure 5-6:
My eBay
store in

118
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

• State your customer service and return policy. Fill in the informa-
tion regarding how you handle refunds, exchanges, and so on. If
you’re a member of SquareTrade (see Chapter 4) or BuySAFE, men-
tion here that you subscribe to its policies. Be sure to include
whatever additional store information you think is pertinent.
You can also set up a custom home page for your store, but it’s not a
popular option. Most sellers feel it’s best to let your visitors go right to
the listings of what you’re selling.
 Custom categories: Here’s where you really make your store your own.
You may name up to three hundred custom categories that relate to the
varied items you sell in your store.
 Promotion boxes: Set up some promotion boxes and change them every
month or so to keep your store’s look fresh. Select items for promotion
that work well with the particular selling season.
 Search engine keywords: Check out this area to see the keywords that
eBay forwards to the major Web shopping and search feeds. If you think
there are better keywords, be sure to add them.
Marketing tools
Under the Marketing tools heading, you can perform many tasks that help
bring customers to your store. You have the option of clicking a Summary
page, which gives you a quick look at how your store’s marketing features are
currently set. You have a lot of options in this area. Here are a few of the
many offered:
Figure 5-7:
My eBay
store
policies
page.
119
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store

 Email marketing: When you want to design an e-mail campaign to your
buyers, you have all the tools here. Create an e-mail newsletter, create
one for sending later, manage your subscriber lists — all from one con-
venient area.
 Listing frame: Select this option once you get an eBay store. Don’t ask
questions, just do it. The custom listing header display is one of the best
tools you can use to bring people into your store (see how effective it is
in my listing in Figure 5-8). Click the link and select the option to Show
Your Custom Listing Header on all your eBay auctions and fixed-price
sales. This will encourage shoppers to visit your eBay store when they
browse your eBay listings. When customizing, be sure to include your
store logo as well as a store search box.
Item promotions
eBay has added some excellent ways to promote your store. As an eBay store
owner, you have access to promotional tools that other sellers can’t use. One
of the most valuable of these is cross-promotions — there’s no charge to use
it either!
 Cross-promotions: The cross-promotion box appears after a buyer
places a bid on or purchases an item from an eBay seller. The beauty 
of having a store is that the cross-promotion box appears twice: once
with your regular listings and again with a different assortment of items
(if you want), after someone buys an item. Best of all? You get to select
Figure 5-8:
A store
listing frame
surrounding
one of my
auctions.
120
Part I: Getting Serious about eBay 

which categories’ items are selected from to display with your individual
auctions. Figure 5-9 shows a cross-promotion box that appears when
someone views one of my auctions.
You can set up the promotions so that they default to show other items
from related store categories. Again, every listing has two sets of
options: one for when a user views your listings and the other for when
someone bids or wins your item.
 Markdown Manager: So you say you have to raise some cash to buy
new merchandise? Why not run a sale? By clicking here you can select
items to put on sale. After they’ve been marked down, they will appear
branded as “On Sale.”
Logos and branding
As a store owner, you can customize just about everything that you do on
eBay. In Logos and Branding, you can add a store banner and a personalized
message (if you’d like) on your end-of-auction e-mails and on your eBay
checkout invoices. Figure 5-10 shows an invoice customized with my logo 
and message.
Figure 5-9:

121
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store
Create an About the Seller page
If you haven’t already created an eBay About
Me page, do it now! The About Me page
becomes the About the Seller page in your
store. This page is a primary tool for promoting
sales. (See Chapter 3 regarding About Me
pages.) You can put this page together in about
ten minutes — max — with eBay’s handy and
easy-to-use templates!

Manage your items
We’ve all listed items on eBay, so I don’t plan on boring you with a tutorial on
how to list your items here (although I give you some listing and photo image
tips in Chapter 11). Following are the main differences between listing an item
in your store and listing an auction on eBay:
 You have to assign your item to one of the prescribed store categories
that you designated while setting up your store. If your new item falls
into a category that you haven’t defined, you can always go back to your
store and add a category (as many as three hundred) or put the item in
the eBay-generated Other Items category.
 You don’t place a minimum bid or a reserve price on your store items
because everything you list in your eBay store is a Buy It Now (fixed-
price) item.
 Listings in an eBay store can be put up for sale for thirty days or on a
GTC (good till cancelled) basis.
The items you list in your eBay store will not appear in the regular eBay site title
search unless less than twenty of that item are listed on eBay. Then your items
will be listed below the regular search results as items found in eBay stores.
Your items will be seen if one of your buyers does a Seller or Stores search from
the eBay Search page. That’s why you pay only 5 or 10 cents per listing for
Figure 5-10:

thirty days. You must put a link in your auctions to your eBay store — and tell
the auction browsers that you have more stuff for them that they “can’t find in a
regular eBay search.”
Dressing Up Your Listings
eBay has more tempting options that you can use to spruce up your store
items. These options work exactly like the ones eBay offers for your auctions
(see Chapter 10). When choosing whether to use these options, remember
that your eBay store items appear only when someone searches in eBay
stores. eBay store items don’t appear in a regular eBay search, so the Gallery
option may be the most beneficial option at this time. Check out Table 5-3 for
a rundown of the optional feature and their associated fees.

Making a Sale
From the buyer’s point of view, shopping at an eBay store is much different
than winning an auction. eBay stores feature fixed-price sales; the buyer will
get the merchandise as soon as you can ship it (instead of waiting for the auc-
tion to run its course). Even though your auctions show up on your store’s
home page, all regular listings in your eBay store are Buy It Now items.
123
Chapter 5: Expanding Sales with an eBay Store

When a buyer makes a purchase from an eBay store, here’s what happens:
1. The buyer clicks the Buy It Now button on the listing page. The Review
Payments page appears, where the buyer can review the purchase. This
page contains the shipping amount you specified when you listed the
item.
2. The buyer provides shipping information (required). When eBay notifies
you that a sale has been made, you have all the information you need.
You don’t have to scurry around looking for the return address on the
envelope when the payment arrives.
3. The buyer reviews the transaction and then clicks the confirm button.
The information about the sale is e-mailed to you, and the buyer
receives confirmation of the sale.
Your eBay store will be an essential backup to your auctions. It’s a great place
to put out-of-season items, accessories for the items you sell actively, and
even consignment items between relisting. Considering the price of an eBay
store, you have to make only a few sales per month to pay for it — and when
your sales start to build, your efforts will be greatly rewarded!

In this part . . .
Your hobby is what you love, and I’m betting you have
a houseful of duplicate items — the perfect stuff 
to start to sell on eBay! Or why not buy from other 
collectors locally and become a specialist on eBay? Or
perhaps you’d like to sell inventory from an existing busi-
ness or for others on consignment. Or maybe you want to
start buying wholesale merchandise like the big boys.
As you can see, the options are countless. In this part, I
talk about how to find merchandise to sell, the best way
to sell it, and your ever-important Web site.

You’re probably wondering just how you can possibly get enough mer-
chandise to list as many as twenty (maybe fifty?) items a day. You’re
thinking that there aren’t possibly enough sources out there to fulfill that
kind of volume. Success on eBay isn’t easy. Despite the e-mail claims of the
huge money that can be made on eBay, it’s like everything else. No one has a
magic formula. (The only people who really make money from those e-mails
are the ones who send them to hopeful new sellers.) Many hours and a good
deal of perspiration — along with loads of inspiration — are necessary to
make a good living selling online. You can do it — if you apply the same
amount of effort in acquiring merchandise.
One of my favorite mottoes is “Buy off-season, sell on-season.” You can get
great bargains on winter merchandise in the heat of summer. January’s a
great time to stock up on Christmas decorations, and the value of those
trendy vintage aluminum trees doubles in November and December.
Cashmere sweaters, too! In the winter, you can get great deals on closeout
summer sports merchandise. It’s all in the timing.

How are you going to acquire the products you need? I’ve spent hours, days,
weeks, okay, even months trying to work out the best ways to stock an eBay
business. Ultimately this depends on you, your personality, and the type of
merchandise you plan to sell. I’ve tried many of the tactics that I discuss in
this chapter, as have some eBay sellers that I know, and I pass on the secrets
and caveats that each of us discovered along the way.
Dollar Stores
Dollar stores come in all shapes and sizes. They can be filled with junk or
treasure, and it takes a practiced eye to separate the wheat from the chaff.
Many an item can be found here that makes for great practice for beginning
sellers — and often goes for ten times what they paid. Try going in with a
teenager, and see whether he or she reacts to any of the items for sale.
Sometimes only one in five visits works out, but you’ll know when you see
the item — and at these prices you can afford to go deep! Stock at these
stores doesn’t stay on the shelf for too long; if you pass on an item, it may not
be there when you return for it the next day. Maybe another savvy eBay seller
picked up the values.
99¢ Only stores
The crème de la crème of the dollar-type stores on the West Coast are the 99¢
Only stores. (Okay, $.99 isn’t $1.00, but I still think it qualifies as a dollar
store!) You can find these stores in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.
The highest price in the store is 99¢, and some items can be bought for as
little as 29¢.
The bulk of the items sold at 99¢ Only stores are closeouts or special oppor-
tunity buys. When a company changes its labels, for example, it might sell all
remaining stock with the old labels to 99¢ Only. I’ve found some profitable
books, Olympics memorabilia, and pop culture items at this store. You can go
a long way here by being nice. Befriend the store manager, who might alert
you when merchandise that matches your specialty comes in. The chain is
expanding rapidly, so visit its Web site at www.99only.com to see whether a
store is opening near you. Other dollar stores are probably in your area. Pull
out the phone book (or bother the 411 operator) and see what you can find.
It’s not unusual for dollar store warehouses to sell direct to a retailer (that’s
you!). Find out where the distribution warehouse is for your local dollar store
chain and make contact. The 99¢ Only stores have a wholesale unit called
Bargain Wholesale that started in their City of Commerce California offices.
They sell directly to retailers, distributors, and exporters.
128
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

If you live in Los Angeles, Houston, or Chicago, you can visit one of their
showrooms. If not, you can purchase merchandise online on their Web site at
www.bargainw.com and shop for your business. To be able to buy at the
site, you must have a business license or a resale number from your state.
They also have a minimum order; if it’s too high for you, why not split an
order with another seller?
Big Lots
Another super selling chain is the Big Lots company, which encompasses the
Pic N Save, Mac Frugal’s, Big Lots, and Odd Lots stores. They may have items
priced at more than a dollar, but they specialize in closeout merchandise. All
their merchandise sells for well under what most discounters charge and at
deep discounts to retailers. This is a great place to find toys, household
goods — almost anything. Troll their aisles at least once a month to find
items that you can resell on eBay. The Big Lots company has stores in 
forty-six states; check its Web site at www.biglots.com for store locations
near you.
When you get your state’s seller’s permit (see Chapter 15), you can take
advantage of the Big Lots Wholesale Web site at www.biglotswholesale.
com. If you think that Big Lots regular prices are low, you should see their
wholesale prices! The minimum order from the Web site is $500, which will
get you a lot of merchandise. Before placing an order, be sure to check and
see whether the item is selling on eBay. If many eBay sellers are trying to sell
the item now, why not place an order and sell when the other sellers have
exhausted their stock? When fewer sellers are selling, the price usually goes
up. Supply and demand is the name of the game.
Tuesday Morning
One of my editors is going to kill me for mentioning one of her favorite eBay
merchandise sources — but here it is. Tuesday Morning has more than five
hundred stores scattered over the United States. They sell first-quality
designer and brand-name closeout merchandise at deep-deep discounts, 
50 percent to 80 percent below retail.
The key here is that the store sells recognizable brand names, the kind of
items that eBay shoppers look for. I’ve seem items at their store from
Samsonite, Thomas Kincade, Limoges, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Madame
Alexander, and even Barbie!
129
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

Find your local store at their Web site, www.tuesdaymorning.com. If you
sign up for their eTreasures newsletter, you’ll get advance notice of when the
really good stuff arrives at the store. (Sometimes they have only a dozen of a
particular item per store, so you have to be there when the doors open.)
Discount Club Stores
Warehouse stores made their mark by selling items in bulk to large families,
clubs, and small businesses. In case you haven’t noticed, these stores have
recently upscaled and sell just about anything you could want. Their shelves
are brimming with current merchandise ripe for the picking.
Sam’s Club
In addition to shopping for bargains at the Sam’s Club in your neighborhood,
you can now visit their wholesale auctions at auctions.samsclub.com.
What a fantastic place to find merchandise to sell on eBay. The closeouts on
the auction site can sell at a fraction of the retail price.
Costco
Believe it or not, one day I was wheeling my cart around Costco (to buy my
monthly ration of meat) and right in front of me was a huge display with
women jumping and grabbing at the merchandise. I glanced above to read
the sign: Fendi Baugette Handbags $199.99. My daughter and I elbowed our
way (in a not-too-ladylike fashion, I might add) through the crowd and saw
the regularly $450.00 purses stacked like lunchmeat. In those days, the
Baugette was new and sold on eBay for around $350.00. Needless to say, we
bought all that our credit cards could handle.
In the first edition of this book, I talked about a special on the Costco Web
site, www.costco.com, for a new Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs DVD. For
$18.49, you could pre-order the Snow White DVD and get a second Disney
DVD for free. When there’s an offer like this, you can sell two items on eBay
for the price of one. If I had followed my own advice and bought a case of this
deal and held some for future sales, I’d be in the money today. It seems that
Disney movies are released for a limited time only. Now, that original DVD set
sells on eBay for around $40.00.
130
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

When an item is new but has some collectibility, I suggest you buy in bulk,
sell some of the item to make up your investment, and save the balance for
later. This has paid off for me a good many times with Disney films, Barbies,
and Andy Warhol dinnerware.
Garage Sales
What can be better than getting up at 6 a.m. to troll the local garage sales? I
say nothing — if you’re motivated to find lots of good eBay merchandise and
prepared for the garage sales. Buy the newspaper or check your local news-
paper’s classified ads online (just run a Google search for your local news-
paper’s name), and print maps of the sale locations from MapQuest or Yahoo!
You know the neighborhoods, so you can make a route that makes sense
from one sale to the next — and figure in bathroom stops and coffee breaks.
Neighbors often take advantage of an advertised sale and put out some stuff
of their own. Bring a friend; you can cover more ground faster if two of you
are attacking the sales.
A few tips on shopping garage sales:
 Fancier neighborhoods have better stuff than poor or middle class ones.
I know that sounds unfair, but I know for sure that rich folks’ trash is
better than mine.
 Look for sales that say “Early Birds Welcome,” and make them the first
on your list so you can get them out of the way. It seems like a universal
bell goes off somewhere and all garage sales start at 8 a.m. sharp!
 The stuff you find at estate sales is often of a higher quality. These sales
feature things that have been collected over many, many years.
 Keep an eye out for “moving to a smaller house” sales. These are usually
people who have raised children, accumulated a houseful of stuff (col-
lectibles? old toys? designer vintage clothes?), and want to shed it all so
that they can move to a condo in Palm Springs.
Any toys people are selling while downsizing are usually good ones.
 I usually put sales that feature “kids’ items and toys” on the end of my
list, and I go only if I’m not too tired. These are generally young couples
(with young children) who are trying to raise money or are moving.
More often than not, they’re keeping the good stuff and are simply shed-
ding the excess.
131
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

Going-Out-of-Business Sales
Going-out-of-business sales can be a bonanza, but be careful and don’t be
misled. Many states require businesses that are putting on a going-out-of-
business sale to purchase a special license that identifies the business as
really going out of business. Some store ads may read “Going Out for
Business” or some similar play on words, so you need to be sure that you’re
going to the real thing. When a retailer is liquidating its own stock, you’re
going to get the best buys. A retailer will often run the sale week by week,
offering bigger discounts as time goes by. If a company is really going out of
business, don’t be afraid to make an offer on a quantity of items.
Another benefit of going-out-of-business sales is that many times the stores
are selling their fixtures for rock-bottom prices. If you’re looking for a man-
nequin to model your fashions or display pieces for your photographs, run,
don’t walk, to that sale.
A chain of children’s wear went out of business here in Southern California a
while back. This chain also carried a smattering of popular dolls. A seller I
know made an offer for all remaining dolls and subsequently purchased them
at a great price. Throughout the following year, she sold them on eBay for
three to four times what she had paid.
Auctions
Two types of auctions where you can pick up bargains are liquidation and
estate auctions. (I also discuss charity auctions, where you may be able to
find bargains while donating to a good cause.) You’ll find perfectly salable
and profitable items, but each type of auction has its idiosyncrasies. Before
you go to any auction, double-check payment terms and find out if you must
bring cash or can pay by credit card. Also, before you bid on anything, find
out the hammer fee, or buyer’s premium. These fees are a percentage that auc-
tion houses add to the winner’s bid; the buyer has the responsibility of
paying this fee.
Liquidation auctions
When a company gets into serious financial trouble, its debtors (the people
to whom the company owes money) obtain a court order to liquidate the
company to pay the bills. The liquidated company then sells its stock, 
132
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

fixtures, and even real estate. Items sell for just cents on the dollar, and you
can easily resell many of these items on eBay. A special kind of auctioneer
handles these auctions. Look in the phone book under Auctioneers:
Liquidators and call local auctioneers’ offices to get on mailing lists. This
way, you’ll always know when something good comes up for sale.
Estate auctions
Estate auctions are the higher level of estate garage sales. Here you can find
fine art, antiques, ephemera, rare books, and collectibles of all kinds. Aside
from the large estate auctions, most auction houses have monthly estate auc-
tions in which they put together groups of merchandise from various small
estates. Find out when these auctions are being held and mark them on your
calendar.
These auctions are attended mostly by dealers, who know the local going
prices for the items they bid on. But because they’re buying to sell in a retail
environment, their high bids will generally be the wholesale price for your
area. If a particular item is flooding your market, the high bid may be low. I’ve
seen some incredible bargains at Bonham’s estate auctions here in Los
Angeles. When you’re in a room full of local dealers, they’re buying what’s hot
to resell in your city — not what’s going to sell across the country. That
entire market will be yours.
Charity silent auctions
I’m sure you’ve been to your share of silent auctions for charity. A school or
an organization will get everyone from major corporations to the local gift
shop to donate items. The items are then auctioned off to the highest bidder,
usually in a silent format.
You can find many a great item at these auctions. Aside from new merchan-
dise, collectors may feel good about donating some collection overflow to a
charity. I purchased the keystone of my Star Trek action figure collection at a
charity auction: the very rare tri-fold Borg (one of perhaps only fifty in exis-
tence). This figure has sold for as high as $1000 on eBay, and I paid just $60,
all while donating to a charity. (Okay, now it’s selling for only about $400 on
eBay — but heck, it was still a deal!)

Goodwill, Salvation Army, 
and Resale Shops
Participating in a charity such as Goodwill or the Salvation Army is a power-
ful thing with many benefits. You don’t have to worry about having a garage
sale to get rid of unwanted stuff (no need to have strangers trodding all over
the lawn, crunching the daisy borders while sniffing around at the stuff for
sale), and you can pretty much write off many items as a charity tax deduc-
tion. And it’s simple: You just load the goods into your car and take ’em to the

Have you seen this headline before?
“Make Hundred$ of thou$ands in profits by
reselling items from Government Foreclosure
auctions!” Yes, I’ve seen this headline too. You
send someone money, and they let you in on the
big “secret.” Here’s the secret: You can find out
about many government auctions at these sites:
 www.ustreas.gov/auctions/: This
site gives information on seized Department
of the Treasury property auctions held in
New Jersey, California, Florida, Texas,
Arizona, and other locations. The lists of the
lots for sale are posted about a month
before the auctions. You can also call the
hot line at 703-273-7373 for up-to-date infor-
mation. They also post the bid results for
previous auctions, so you can get an idea
about the selling price of various lots.
 www.ustreas.gov/auctions/irs/:
Our buddies at the Internal Revenue
Service have their own auction site. Here
you can find a wide assortment of real prop-
erty: patents, livestock, vehicles, planes,
boats, business equipment, household
goods, and real estate. They sell just about
everything. (These guys are serious about
collecting their tax money!)
 gsaauctions.gov/gsaauctions/
gsaauctions: This is the official link to
the General Services Administrations sur-
plus, seized, and forfeited property auc-
tions. These are electronic bidding online
auctions that are held daily. You can even
find used crash test vehicles here (good for
selling the undamaged parts on eBay).
 eBay seller ID usps-al-pmsc/:
Got a hankering to be tooling around town
in a modified postal truck? Well, here’s your
chance! The USPS sells all kinds of vehicles
on eBay.
 www.usps.com/auctions:Ever wonder
where all the post office’s lost packages go?
Check this site for auction locations and
times. Also search Google for mail recovery
centers.
 www.govliquidation.com: This is a
private company specializing in government
liquidation auctions.
For other sites, run a Google search for state
surplus (results include tons of links to individ-
ual state-seized property auctions), seized
property, tax sales, confiscated property, and
state auction. Remember, if you’re asked for
payment to get the information, it’s not an offi-
cial site.

store. It’s a win-win-win situation. The extra win is that you can also acquire
valuable pieces at bargain-basement prices.
At resale stores, such as Goodwill and the Salvation Army, you’ll sometimes
uncover treasures while other times you’ll find only junk. I recommend
befriending the manager who sees the merchandise as it comes in, will know
just what you’re looking for (because you said so in a friendly conversation),
and will call you before the items hit the floor. This type of relationship can
save you from making fruitless trips.
Some stores receive merchandise from a central warehouse, where donations
are first sent for minor rehabilitation and cleaning. Other, smaller operations
process items in-house, with the store manager supervising. The resale store
is a business that runs on a schedule. Ask the manager (whom you’ve
befriended) when the truck regularly comes in. Being there when the truck
arrives enables you to view items before the general public.
A sharp seller I know is always at his local Salvation Army when the trucks
come in. One day as workers unloaded the truck, he saw a plaque-mounted
baseball bat. Withholding his excitement, he picked it up and found that it
was a signed Ty Cobb bat with a presentation plaque. Although he didn’t
know exactly what it was, he took a gamble and brought it to the cash regis-
ter, where he paid $33 minus the senior citizen discount. He took the bat to
his office and made a few phone calls, later discovering that the bat was
indeed a rare Louisville Slugger bat that had been presented to the Georgia
Peach, Ty Cobb. But he’ll never sell it because it’s his good luck bat, which
now hangs above the desk in his warehouse.
Goodwill Industries is definitely gearing up for the twenty-first century. You
can shop at its online auctions and get super values on the best of their 
merchandise. Don’t forget to check the going prices on eBay before you buy.
Have fun at www.shopgoodwill.com.
Freebies
Freebies come in all shapes and sizes and — best of all — they’re free, of
course. Freebies are usually samples or promotion pieces that companies
give away to introduce a new product, service, or, best of all, media event.
Even carefully trimmed ads from magazines can fetch high prices from 
collectors.
When you go to the cosmetic counter and buy a way-too-expensive item, be
sure to ask for tester-sized samples. Name-brand cosmetic and perfume sam-
ples of high-priced items sell very well on eBay. Also, look for gift with pur-
chase deals. If it’s a specialty item, you can usually sell it on its own to
someone who’d like to try a sample themselves rather than plunge headlong
135
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

into a large purchase. Less special items can be grouped together as lots. Be
sure to put the brand names in the title.
Remember the talking Taco Bell Chihuahua giveaway? Those cute little dogs
were all the rage and sold for big money on eBay. It almost seems foolish to
remind you of the McDonald’s Teenie Beanie Baby giveaways; moms, dads,
and dealers were driving in circles through the drive-thru, purchasing as
many of the Happy Meals as each store would allow. They’d then drive to the
next McDonald’s to purchase a different toy. In my house alone, we had
frozen hamburgers for three months!
When Return of the Jedi was re-released in 1997, the first one hundred people
to enter each theater got a Special Edition Luke Skywalker figure. These fig-
ures are still highly prized by collectors, and when the next part of the Star
Wars saga is released, you can bet the prices on this figure will rise yet again.
In 1995, Paramount network premiered a new show, Star Trek Voyager. In
selected markets, Paramount sent a promotional microwave popcorn packet
as a Sunday newspaper insert. These are still selling well (when you can find
them), although the value rises and falls according to current interest in 
Star Trek.
Before you pass by a freebie, reconsider its possible future resale value.
Salvage: Liquidation Items, Unclaimed
Freight, and Returns
The easiest buys of all, salvage merchandise is retail merchandise that has
been returned, exchanged, or shelf-pulled for some reason. Generally, this
merchandise is sold as-is and where-is and may be in new condition. To buy
this merchandise, you must have your resale (sales tax number) permit and
be prepared to pay the shipping to your location — unless you’re buying the
merchandise on eBay.
Available all over the country, the liquidation business has been thriving as a
well-kept secret for years. As long as you have space to store salvage mer-
chandise and a way to sell it, you can acquire it for as low as 10 cents on the
dollar. When I say you need storage space, I mean lots of space. To buy this
type of merchandise at bottom-of-the-barrel prices, you must be willing to
accept truckloads — 40- to 53-foot eighteen-wheelers, loaded with approxi-
mately twenty-two to twenty-four 4-x-4-x-6-foot (or 7-foot) pallets — of mer-
chandise at a time. Often these truckloads have manifests listing the retail
136
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

and wholesale price of each item on the truck. If you have access to the more
than 10,000 square feet of warehouse that you’ll need to unpack and process
this amount of merchandise, you’re in business.
Several types of salvage merchandise are available:
 Unclaimed freight: When a trucking company delivers merchandise, a
manifest (a document containing the contents of the shipment) accom-
panies the freight. If, for some reason, a portion of the shipment arrives
incomplete, contains the wrong items, or is damaged, the entire ship-
ment may be refused by the merchant. The trucking company is now
stuck with as much as a truckload of freight. The original seller may not
want to pay the freight charges to return the merchandise to his or her
warehouse (or accept blame for an incorrect shipment), and so the
freight becomes the trucker’s problem. The trucking companies arrive at
agreements with liquidators to buy this freight in the various areas that
the liquidators serve. This way, truckers are never far from a location
where they can dump, er, drop off merchandise.
 Returns: Did you know that after you buy something and decide that
you don’t want it and return it to the store or mail-order house, it can
never be sold as new again (in most states anyway)? The merchandise is
generally sent to a liquidator who agrees in advance to pay a flat per-
centage for goods. The liquidator must move the merchandise to some-
one else. All major retailers liquidate returns, and much of this
merchandise ends up on eBay or in closeout stores.
If you’re handy at repairing electronics or computers, you’d probably do
very well with a specialized lot. You may easily be able to revitalize dam-
aged merchandise, often using parts from two unsalable items to come
up with one that you can sell in like-new working condition.
 Liquidations: Similar to the liquidation auctions that I mention in a previ-
ous section on auctions, these liquidators buy liquidation merchandise by
truckloads and sell it in smaller lots. The merchandise comes from finan-
cially stressed or bankrupt companies that need to raise cash quickly.
 Seasonal overstocks: Remember my motto? “Buy off-season, sell on-
season”? At the end of the season, a store may find its shelves overloaded
with seasonal merchandise (such as swimsuits in August) that it must get
rid of to make room for the fall and winter stock. These brand-new items
become salvage merchandise because they’re seasonal overstocks.
 Shelf-pulls: Have you ever passed up one item in the store for the one
behind it in the display because its box was in better condition?
Sometimes the plastic bubble or the package is dented, and you’d rather
have a pristine one. That box you just passed up may be destined to
become a shelf-pull. The item inside may be in perfect condition, but it’s
cosmetically unsalable in the retail store environment.
137
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

A proportion of liquidation items, unclaimed freight, and returns may not be
salable for the reasons that I discuss in the rest of this section. Although
you’ll acquire many gems that stand to bring you profit, you’ll also be left
with a varying percentage of useless items. Read on carefully.
Items by the pallet
Some suppliers take the risk and purchase salvaged merchandise by the
truckload. They then break up each truckload and sell the merchandise to
you a pallet at a time. You’ll probably find some local liquidators who offer
this service, or you can go online to find one. Here’s the rub: finding the right
person to buy from.
138
Part II: Setting Up Shop 
Drop-shipping to your customers
Some middlemen, wholesalers, and liquidators
specialize in selling to online auctioneers
through drop-ship services or warehouses.
Some crafty eBay sellers make lots of money
selling lists of drop-shipping sources to eBay
sellers — I hope not to you. Dealing with a drop-
shipper means that you don’t ever have to take
possession of (or pay for) the merchandise.
You’re given a photo and, after you sell the item,
you give the vendor the address of the buyer.
They charge your credit card for the item plus
shipping, and they ship the item to your cus-
tomer for you.
This way of doing business costs you more and
lowers your profits. If you’re in business, your
goal is to make as much money as you can.
Because the drop-shipper is in business too,
they’ll mark up the merchandise they sell to you
(and the shipping cost) so they can make their
profit. Drop-shipping can work as a supplement
to your basic eBay business.
Be careful when using a drop-shipper. Ask for
references. Don’t give them your credit card
number with carte blanche to keep charging
your account month by month if you’re not ben-
efiting from their services. See whether a zillion
sellers are selling the same merchandise on
eBay — and not getting any bites. Check, too,
that the price you will pay for the item leaves
you room for profit. I’ve researched some of
these items on eBay and noted that many inex-
perienced sellers only mark up drop-ship goods
by a fraction. They seem to be happy making $5
a sale; they don’t take into consideration how
much the listing fees for other, unsold items cost
them. That’s just not smart business on their
part, hence they can ruin the market for such
items for everyone else.
Also, what happens if the drop-shipper runs out
of an item that you’ve just sold? You can’t just
say oops to your buyer without getting some
nasty feedback. It’s your online reputation at
stake. If you find a solid source and believe in
the product, order a quantity and have it
shipped to your door. Don’t pay for someone
else’s mark-up for the privilege of shipping to
your customers.

As in any business, you’ll find both good-guy liquidators and bad-guy liquida-
tors. As you know, the world is full of e-mail scammers and multilevel mar-
keters who are in business to take your money. No one trying to sell you
merchandise can possibly guarantee that you’ll make money, so beware of 
liquidators who offer this kind of promise. I don’t care who they are or what
they say. Carefully research whomever you choose to buy from. Use an
Internet search engine and search for the words salvage, liquidation, and
pallet merchandise.
Some liquidation sellers sell their merchandise in the same condition that it
ships in to their location, so what you get is a crapshoot. You may lose
money on some items while making back your money on others. Other sellers
who charge a bit more will remove less desirable merchandise from the pal-
lets. Some may even make up deluxe pallets with better-quality merchandise.
These loads cost more, but if they’re filled with the type of merchandise that
you’re interested in selling, you’ll probably write better descriptions and sub-
sequently do a better job selling them.
Getting a pallet of merchandise shipped to you can cost a bundle, so finding a
source for your liquidation merchandise that’s close to your base of opera-
tions is a good idea. You’ll notice that many liquidation sites have several
warehouses, which translates to lower shipping costs for the buyer. (They
can then also accept merchandise from places close to the various ware-
houses.) You might see FOB (freight on board) and a city name, which means
that when you buy the merchandise, you own it in the city listed. You’re
responsible for whatever it costs to ship the merchandise to your door.
Search around; you may have to go through many sources before you find 
the right one for you.
When you find a source from which you want to buy merchandise by the
pallet, check out a few things before spending your hard-earned cash:
 Do they sell mostly to flea marketers (you might not want that kind 
of merchandise because you’re looking for quality at a low price) or
closeout stores (more retail oriented)?
 Did you get a reply within 24 hours after calling or e-mailing?
 Does anyone you speak to appear to care about what you want to sell?
 Are the available lots within your budget?
 Are the lots general or have they been sorted to include only the type of
merchandise that you want to sell?
 How long has this liquidator been in business and where does its 
merchandise come from?
139
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

 Does the source guarantee that you will make money or that you can
make money by buying the right merchandise? Remember: No one can
guarantee that you’ll make money.
 Does the supplier offer on its Web site references that you can contact
to find out some usable information on this seller’s items and the per-
centage of unsalable goods in a box or pallet?
 Is a hard sell involved? Or is it a matter-of-fact deal?
Before you get dazzled by a low, low price on a huge lot and click the Buy It
Now button, check the shipping cost. Many so-called wholesalers will lure
you in with bargain-basement prices, only to charge you three times the
normal shipping costs. Do your homework before you buy!
Job lots
Manufacturers often have to get rid of merchandise, too. Perhaps a particular
manufacturer made five million bobbing-head dolls and then sold only four
million to retailers. It has to quickly unload this merchandise (known as job
lots) so that it’ll have the cash to invest in next season’s array of items. Job
lots often consist of hundreds or thousands of a single item. You’d best enjoy
what you’re selling because you’ll be looking at the stuff for a while.
Remember supply and demand — don’t ever flood the eBay market. Other-
wise, your item will become valueless.
Many Web sites specialize in job lots, but you have to visit them often
because the deals are constantly changing. One worth checking out is
Liquidation.com, shown in Figure 6-1. Visit them at www.liquidation.com.

True Wholesale Merchandise
Purchasing wholesale merchandise may require that you have your state’s
resale license, which identifies you as being in the business. Be sure that you
have one before you try to purchase merchandise direct from another busi-
ness. Also, when you have a resale number and purchase merchandise from
another business — known as a business to business (B2B) transaction —
you probably won’t be charged tax when you purchase your stock because
you’ll be paying sales tax when you sell the items. Go to Chapter 15 to find
out how to get that magic resale number.
When you have your resale number, you can go anywhere you want to buy
merchandise. If you want to buy direct from a manufacturer, you can.
Unfortunately, manufacturers often have a monetary minimum for the
amount of your order, which may be more than you want to spend (and you’d
get more of a particular item than you’d ever want at once). To remedy that,
see whether you can find some independent retailers who buy in quantity
and who perhaps will let you in on some quantity buys with manufacturers.
To find wholesalers on the Internet, try Google.com. Refine your search to
your favorite categories: golf, jewelry, skateboards — get the idea? Then run
the following searches (inserting your choice of merchandise as indicated):
Dealer login jewelry; Wholesale login jewelry; Member login jewelry; Distributor
login jewelry; Licensed retailers only.
Sometimes the liquidators that I discuss in the preceding section get cases of
perfectly salable goods in their loads. Pallets break up into many cases, and
liquidators will often sell these cases individually on eBay. What a great way
to acquire goods for your eBay business; I know of several eBay sellers who
buy their merchandise this way.
Resale Items on eBay
I’ll keep this eBay buying technique short and sweet: Use the magic search
engine! But be careful; many a get-rich-quick schemer will use boldface key-
words in their auctions to attract your attention. Look only for good-quality
merchandise to resell. Remember that the only way to make a living on eBay
is to sell quality items to happy customers so that they’ll come back and buy
from you again. Be sure to search eBay auction titles for the following key-
words: resale, resell, “case of” (see Figure 6-2), “case quantity,” “lot of,” “pallet
of” (see Figure 6-3), closeout, and surplus. Be sure to use the quotes anywhere
that I’ve included them here because this forces the search engine to find the
words in the exact order you write them inside the quotes.
141
Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

Also be sure you check out the wholesale categories on eBay. After noticing
how many sellers were buying from other sellers, eBay set up wholesale sub-
categories for almost every type of item. You can find the wholesale items in
the category list on the left side of the page after performing a search, or just
go to the eBay home page, scroll down the list of categories, and click
Wholesale. You’ll be brought to the Wholesale Lots hub page, as shown in
Figure 6-4. Just click the category of your choice to find some great deals.

Consignment Selling
Consignment sales are the up-and-coming way for you to help newbies by
selling their items on eBay. Lots of sellers do it, and several retail locations
base their business on it. You take possession of the item from the owner and
sell it on eBay. You’re responsible for taking photos and marketing the auc-
tion on eBay — for a fee. In addition to the money you earn selling on con-
signment, you also get excellent experience for future auctions of your own
merchandise.
To set up your business for consignment sales, you should follow a few 
guidelines:
1. Design a consignment agreement (a contract), and send it to the owners
of the merchandise before they send you their items. Doing so ensures
that all policies are set up in advance and that no questions will arise
after the transaction has begun.
2. Have the owners sign and send the agreement to you (the consignor)
along with the item.
3. Research the item based on past sales so that you can give the owners
an estimated price range of what the item might sell for on eBay.
4. Photograph the item carefully (see Chapter 11 for some hints) and write
a thoughtful, selling description.
5. Handle all e-mail inquiries as though the item were your own; after all,
your fee is generally based on a percentage of the final sale.

Lots hub

Chapter 6: Finding Merchandise to Up Your Profits

What do you charge for all your work? I can’t give you a stock answer for that
one. Many sellers charge a flat fee for photographing, listing, and shipping
that ranges from $5–$10 plus as much as a 30 percent commission on the
final auction total (to absorb eBay fees). Other sellers base their fees solely
on the final sale amount and charge on a sliding scale, beginning at 50 per-
cent of the total sale, less eBay and payment service fees. You must decide
how much you think you can make on an item.
Traditional auction houses handle consignment sales in a similar fashion.
When you’ve reached the next level of your eBay enterprise and are looking
to spend some serious money on your merchandise, check out my book,
eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies. In that book I delve into the type
of wholesale-buying secrets normally reserved for the big-time retailers.

Become an eBay Trading Assistant
After you have fifty feedbacks under your belt
on eBay (and have sold at least four items in the
past thirty days), you can become a registered
eBay Trading Assistant. Check out pages.
ebay.com/tahubn (shown in the figure) to
get all the details.
eBay publishes a directory of consignment 
sellers that you can search by inserting 
your address. Check out who in your area is a
registered Trading Assistant. Read their terms 
and fees. Consignment sellers charge varied
amounts based on their geographic location
(some areas can bear higher fees than others).

I
f you don’t know what your item is worth, you may not get the highest
price in any market. If you don’t know how to make your item easy to find,
it may not be noticed by even the hardiest of collectors. If you don’t know the
facts or what to say, your well-written title and detailed description (com-
bined with a fabulous picture) may still not be enough to get the highest
price for your item.
Knowing your item is a crucial part of successful selling at eBay. This is why 
I suggest in Chapter 1 that you specialize in a small group of items in the
beginning so that you can stay on top of ever-changing trends. An item may
be appraised or listed in a book for a high value, but what you care about is
the price at which the item will actually sell. Imagine someone uncovering a
hoard of your item and, not knowing the value of it, dumping them on eBay
with low Buy It Now prices. This frequent scenario drives down the value of
the item within a couple of weeks.
The values of collectibles go up and down. Star Wars items are a perfect
example; values skyrocketed during the release of the latest movie, but now
prices have settled to a considerably lower level. A printed book of value list-
ings is valid only for the moment the book is written. If you stay on top of
your market in a few specialties, you’ll be aware of these market fluctuations.
If you’re looking for the highest price instead of looking to liquidate excess
inventory, I’d hold any special Star Wars items until the buzz starts up again.

You no doubt will purchase the occasional gem and will want to make the
most money possible, so in this chapter I examine the different ways you can
find out just how much something is worth. I start with the easiest and most
accurate method, and end with the most laborious. I hope you can get your
answer the easy way.
The Easy Way: eBay Search
Who woulda thunk it? The best tool for evaluating your items is right under
your nose. The eBay search tool is the best and quickest link to finding your
pricing information. To see how items like yours have been selling, search 
the completed auctions. You can search these results also to see in which
categories to list your item.
Every type of item has a different type of bidder. This makes sense, right?
Would a person searching for collectible dolls have the same shopping habits
as a coin collector? Probably not; coins tend to be more expensive than col-
lectible dolls. Although generalities can be dangerous, profiling your item’s
buyer is worthwhile. After you check out the completed auctions for items
like yours, you’ll be amazed at how the buying patterns of shoppers in differ-
ent categories become crystal clear. After you arm yourself with this knowl-
edge, you’ll know not only how much your items should go for but also the
best time to end the auction.
If you’re selling a common item, it’s also important to check to see how many
other sellers are selling the same item — and when their auctions close.
Nothing can kill your profits like being the second or third auction closing
with the same piece of merchandise. You have to space your auctions apart
from the others, or the law of supply and demand will kick in — and kick you
in the wallet.
The way the search system works has changed drastically over the years, so
be sure that you know how to use this valuable tool. Almost every eBay page
has a small box for searching. Initially you may find it easier to go to the
search page, but if you know the search engine syntax, or shorthand, you can
pinpoint your items with amazing accuracy.
Here are some pointers to help you get the most out of the eBay search
engine:
 The search engine isn’t case sensitive, so you don’t have to worry about
using capitalization in your search.
 To find more needles in the haystack, be sure to select the Search Titles
and Descriptions option.
146
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

 To find historical pricing (what the item has sold for in the past two
weeks), be sure to select the box to search Completed listings as well as
current.
 If you’re using common search terms, don’t search only auction titles
and descriptions; search by category, too. For example, suppose that
you’re searching for a Winnie the Pooh baby outfit. Type Pooh outfit and
you’ll get a bunch of results. Look to the left of the page, and see the cat-
egory that more closely matches your search. In Figure 7-1, the matching
category is Clothing, Shoes & Accessories. Click the link below for the
Infants & Toddlers subcategory. Now you’ll see the search results in the
appropriate category — I guarantee you’ll find exactly what you’re look-
ing for.
 Don’t use conjunctions (or, and) or articles (a, an, the) in your search;
the search engine might misconstrue these noise words as part of your
search. Some sellers use the ampersand (&) in place of the word and, so
if you include and in your search, you won’t find auctions that use the
ampersand. In addition, some sellers, due to the fifty-five-character limit,
may not place the in their title; the same goes for a, or, and and.
Advanced searching methods
If you need to pinpoint a particular item or just want to weed out bogus
responses, you can try a variety of advanced search methods, shown in 
Table 7-1. You can use these shortcuts in any of eBay’s search windows.

Now that you know how to finesse the search engine, head to the search page
and see if you can work some magic.
If you have the item number, you can type or paste it into any of the eBay
search boxes to get to that item.
Using eBay Advanced Search
By clicking the Advanced Search link just to the right of the Search button at
the top of most eBay pages, you can access eBay’s advanced search options.
With the advanced search, you can narrow your search to check out the com-
petition (who’s selling your items). The Advanced Search area has many
options; here are a few of the more important:
 View results: You can choose whether you want to see a mini-gallery of
photos or see your results by item number. Although this may not ordi-
narily help when you’re doing research, information is key; you might
just see a variation of the item in photos that you didn’t know about.
148
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

 Search in categories: You can narrow your search to one of the thirty-
four major categories at eBay. If your product is made for men, women,
or children, you may get more efficient results by looking in the category
that applies directly to your item. Strangely, when searching for a ladies
watch, I found the following synonyms and abbreviations for ladies:
lady’s, ladys, lds, and femmes.
 Completed listings only: Select this check box to go directly to com-
pleted listings for your item research.
 Sort by: You can find items by auctions that end first (default), newly
listed items first, lowest prices first, or highest prices first.
 Payment: You can isolate your search to only those sellers who accept
PayPal. This may enlighten you as to whether buyers of this product pay
higher prices if they have the option to pay with credit cards. (Although
the PayPal exclusion will not include other methods of credit card pay-
ments, it still speaks strongly for credit card users.)
 Locate items near you: If you’re selling something big that you can’t 
(or don’t want to) ship, you want to deliver it or have the buyer pick it
up. This option allows you to check out the competition only in your
closest major metropolitan eBay trading area.
 Multiple item listings: This option lets you search by quantity or lot.
So how can you search completed auctions to find bidding patterns on items
like yours? Here’s a way to dig out all the details you need: Perform a search
on the item for which you want information using the search box you see on
every eBay page. When the results appear (see Figure 7-2), you’ll see how
many other sellers are selling your same item. That way, you can determine
whether it’s the right time to sell. (If all active auctions for your items have
high bids, its time to sell — just be sure not to list your auction to end at a
similar time as another one.)
To dig into the details for historic pricing, you can scroll down (on the left
side of any search results page) to the Search Options area:
1. Select the Completed Listings check box in the Show Only area of the
page.
2. Click the Show Items button below the list of options.
You are presented with the search results of completed listings for the
past two weeks.
3. To sort by price, go to the Sort By drop-down box at the top of the list-
ings and select the Price, Highest First option.
149
Chapter 7: Pricing Your Items to Sell

The results of completed auctions of your particular item for the last four-
teen days appear sorted by highest prices first. Now you’re at the heart of
the matter (see Figure 7-3). Pull out your calendar and make note of what
days your item landed the highest bids. More often than not, you’ll find that a
pattern appears. Your item may see more action on Sunday or Monday or
Thursday or whenever. After you figure out the days that your item gets the
highest bids, pull out a copy of the eBay time chart, which appears on the
Cheat Sheet (at the front of this book), and evaluate what time of day your
high bidders like to bid.

There you have it: the method that will get you the most information that
eBay can give you on the sales trends on your item. It’s money in the bank.
Use it!
If you can’t find any auctions for your item, you have a few more options.
You’re not gonna believe I’m saying this, but try searching auctions.
amazon.com. At least you’ll see whether someone else in the world is selling
one of your items. None of the cool search features that I previously discuss
will work — hey, they ain’t eBay.
eBay also has a superior tool for checking your competitor’s auctions. After a
while, you will identify the sellers who frequently sell items similar to yours.
Aside from keeping them in your favorite sellers list on your My eBay page
(for more on that, see Chapter 3), here’s a way to see whether one of your
competing sellers has an item like yours up for sale:
1. Go to the Advanced Search area, and click the Items By Seller link on
the left.
2. Enter the seller’s user ID in the box provided.
a. If you’re not sure of the spelling of the seller’s ID, select the
Show Close and Exact User ID Matches option.
b. To search completed listings, select the option to Include
Completed Listings. From the drop-down menu, select the time
frame in which you want to search.
You may go back as far as thirty days.
3. Go to the bottom and click the Search button.
Useful Publications
So what if your item isn’t for sale on eBay and hasn’t been for thirty days?
What’s the first thing to do? Check out your local newsstand for one of the
many publications devoted to collecting. Go over to Yahoo! Yellow Pages at
yp.yahoo.com. Type your ZIP code to limit the search to your part of the
country, and type a search for newsstand and news stand. You can also search
for Magazines — Dealers in your area. Let your fingers do the walking and 
call the newsstands in your area and ask whether they have publications in
your area of interest. If no newsstands are listed in your area, visit the local
bookstore.

It seems that every leading magazine has its own Web site. In the next sec-
tion, I mention some useful Web sites for pricing references.
Online Sources of Information
Because you’re all so Internet savvy (what’s better than getting the informa-
tion you want at a millisecond’s notice?), I assume you plan to visit the maga-
zine Web sites that I mention in the preceding section. In this section, I give
you a few more fun online sources where you might be able to get more
insight about your items.
Web sites
Many Web sites devoted to different collectible areas list prices at recently
completed auctions. These auctions are the best evaluation of an item’s 
value because they’re usually directed towards specialists in the specific 
collectible category. Most of the participants in these auctions really know
their stuff.
You may have to poke around the following Web sites to find the prices real-
ized at auction, but once you do, you’ll have the holy grail of estimated
values. Look for links that point to auction archives. Many of these sites will
consign your item from you as well and sell it to their audience:
 Antiques, art, all kinds of rare stuff: www.sothebys.com
 Art auctions: www.artprice.com charges for its searches by artist, but
has an immense database
 Autographs, movie posters, and comic books: www.autographs.com
 Coins and sports memorabilia: www.collectors.com and www.
superiorsports.com
 Collectible advertising glasses: www.pgcaglassclub.com (you have to
see this stuff!)

Chapter 7: Pricing Your Items to Sell

 United States coin price guide: www.pcgs.com/prices/
 Currency auctions: www.lynknight.com
 Rare coins: www.bowersandmerena.com
Online appraisals
I’ve had a bit of personal experience with online appraisals, which seem quite
tempting at first glance. At second glance, though, I realized that unless the
person doing the appraisal could actually see and feel the item, an accurate
appraisal couldn’t be performed. Also, you have no guarantee that the person
at the other end is really an expert in the field that relates to your item.
I had a few items e-appraised by a prestigious (and now defunct) online
appraisal company, and the appraisals seemed a bit off. Then I took one, a
painting, to Butterfields (now Bonhams) in Los Angeles and found that the
value of the painting was ten times what my e-appraisal read.
The bottom line here is that if it’s an item of real value and it’s worth apprais-
ing, it’s worth getting appraised in person. Most large cities have auction
houses, and many of those auction houses have monthly consignment clinics
(a way for auction houses to get merchandise for their future auctions). If you
bring an item to the auction house, you aren’t legally bound to have it sell
your item for you, but it may not be a bad idea. All you’ll get is a free verbal
appraisal; the auction house won’t fill out any official paperwork or anything,
but at least you’ll get an idea of what your item is worth. Real appraisals are
expensive, are performed by licensed professionals, and come with a formal
appraisal document.

Get eBay pricing history as far back as sixty days
Marketplace Research is a new tool for sellers
who need to research pricing on eBay. This is a
subscription service from eBay that allows you
to get the lowdown on sales and pricing for your
items. You can find this tool at pages.
ebay.com/marketplace_research/.
Because it’s a subscription feature, you must
pay a minimum $9.99 monthly fee, unless you
just want to research a bunch of items at once.
A two-day pass to this service is available for
only $2.99. This can be handy should you come
across a large stash of items that you need to
research.

Authentication Services
Some companies provide the service of authenticating (verifying that it’s the
real deal) or authenticating and grading (determining a value based on the
item’s condition and legitimacy). To have these services performed on your
items, you’ll have to send them to the service and pay a fee.
Following are a few excellent sites for grading coins:
 Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS): www.pcgs.com.
 American Numismatic Association Certification Service (AMNACS) —
sold to Amos Press in 1990: www.anacs.com.
 Numismatic Guaranty Corporation of America (NGCA): www.ngccoin.
com/ebay_ngcvalue.cfm. The site offers eBay users a discount and
features a mail-in grading and certification service for your coins.
 PCI Coin Grading Service (PCI): www.pcicoins.com.
Stamp collectors (or those who have just inherited a collection from 
Uncle Steve) can get their stamps “expertized” (authenticated) by the
American Philatelic Society. Visit www.stamps.org/services/ser_
aboutexpertizing.htm for more information.
For comic books, Comics Guaranty, LLC (CGC), https://www.cgccomics.
com/ebay_comic_book_grading.cfm, will seal (enclose in plastic to 
preserve the quality) and grade at a discount for eBay users.
You can find more links and some authentication discounts for eBay users at
pages.ebay.com/help/community/auth-overview.html.
Sports cards and sports memorabilia have a bunch of authentication serv-
ices. If you received your autograph or memorabilia direct from the player or
team, you can assure its authenticity. Having the item authenticated may or
may not get you a higher price at eBay. Try these sites:
 Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA): Offers eBay users a discount
at www.psacard.com/cobrands/submit.chtml?cobrandid=23.
 Online Authentics: Reviews autographs by scans online or by physical
review. Look at its services at www.onlineauthentics.com.
The best way to find a good authenticator in your field is to search the items
at eBay and find the most prominent authenticator listed in the descriptions.
For example, note in the coins area that certain grading services’ coins get
155
Chapter 7: Pricing Your Items to Sell

higher bids than other services. You can also go to an Internet search engine
(Google or Yahoo!) and type the keywords coin grading (for coins). You’ll
come up with a host of choices; use your good sense to see which one suits
your needs.
Remember that not all items need to be officially authenticated. Official
authentication does add value to the item, but if you’re an expert on your
items, you can comfortably rate them on your own in your auctions. People
will know from your description whether you’re a specialist. Your feedback
will also work for you by letting the prospective bidder or buyer know that
your merchandise from past sales has been top-drawer.

 Marketing your piece of the Web
S
uccess in e-commerce follows a natural progression. There isn’t a quick
fix. All business expansion will cost you time and money. When you’re
rushing to make the big bucks — listing items so fast you can’t count them —
you can’t possibly learn from your mistakes. Also, expansion costs money, so
it only makes sense to make some profit before you spend it.
The progression goes like this. One, get started on eBay and get the hang of it
(make money). Two, open an eBay store and stock it (make more money).
Keep in mind that no one can learn the intricacies of running an online busi-
ness in a month or two. That said, here’s number three: After you’ve shown
some healthy profit, it’s time to expand and invest in your own e-commerce
enabled Web site.
Your eBay store is important to your business, but it doesn’t replace an 
e-commerce Web site. Yes, eBay is an important site (duh) for your sales and
store, but so is your own business Web site. You should establish your own
presence on the Web. And although you can — and should — link your site to
eBay, don’t miss out on the rest of the Internet population.

You don’t have a Web site yet? The Web has so many sites with pictures of
people’s dogs and kids that I just assumed you had your own site, too. The
space for a Web site comes free from your ISP. (I even have an embarrassing
one with family pictures.) One of these sites can be the practice site for your
business. Take down pictures of the baby, and post pictures of items you’re
selling — or at the very least, install the eBay-To-Go package (see Chapter 2).
You do have a Web site? Have you taken a good look at it lately to see
whether it’s up to date? Does it link to your eBay auctions or eBay store?
Most small and medium businesses are increasing their online revenue. In a
recent survey of small online businesses, 63 percent of respondents have five
or fewer employees — does that sound like you?
Whether or not you have a Web site, this chapter has something for you. I
provide a lot of detail about Web sites, from thinking up a name to choosing 
a host. If you don’t have a site, I get you started on launching one. If you
already have a site, I give you some pointers about finding the best host. For
the serious-minded Web-based entrepreneur (that’s you), I also include some
ever-important marketing tips.
Free Web Space — a Good Place to Start
Although I love the word free, in real life it seems like nothing is really free.
Free generally means something won’t cost you too much money — but may
cost you a bit more in time. When your site is free, you aren’t able to have
your own direct URL (Universal Resource Locator) or domain name. Most
likely, a free Web site has an address such as one of the following:
www.netcom.com/~marshac
home.socal.rr.com/marshac
www.geocities.com/marshac_1998
members.aol.com/ebaygal 
Having some kind of site at least gives you the experience in setting up the
site. When you’re ready to jump in for real, you can always use your free site
as an extension of your main business site.
To access the Internet, you had to sign on with an Internet service provider
(ISP), which means you more than likely already have your own Web space.
Most ISPs allow you to have more than one e-mail address per account. Each
e-mail address is entitled to a certain amount of free Web space. Through the
use of hyperlinks (small pieces of HTML code that, when clicked, route the
clicker from one place to another on the page or on other Web site), you can
combine all the free Web space from each e-mail address into one giant Web
site. Take a look at Table 8-1, where I compare some popular ISPs.

*Yahoo! GeoCities isn’t an ISP, but it is a reliable online community that gives each member online
Web space. Membership is free. Extra megabyte space is available for purchase.
If America Online (AOL) is your Internet service provider, you may already
know that AOL often has some serious issues regarding its users getting
e-mail from the rest of the Internet. You can’t afford to run a business in an
area that has e-mail issues. Your AOL account gives each of your seven
screen names 2MB of online storage space (refer to Table 8-1). You can best
utilize this space by using it to store images for eBay, not to run a business
site. Each screen name, at 2MB, can store fifty 40K images. (For more informa-
tion on how to use this space for your extra images, see Chapter 11.)
Many ISPs have their own page-builder (HTML-generating) program that’s
free to their users.
Poke around your ISP’s home page for a Community or Your Web Space 
link. For example, after looking around the Road Runner ISP’s home page
(www.rr.com), I found and clicked the Member Services link, which led me
to a page offering various options. I finally found a Personal Home Page link,
which took me to a page that would walk me through setting up my own
home page. After agreeing to the Terms of Service, I can simply log on and set
up my home page. Road Runner offered me the option of using Microsoft
FrontPage, which is considered to be one of the best and easiest Web
site–building programs around.
159
Chapter 8: Establishing a Base of Operations: Your Web Site

I’ve used Microsoft’s FrontPage in the past, and if you want all its benefits,
you need a site that uses FrontPage extensions (portions of the FrontPage
program that reside on the server and enable all the HTML magic to happen
automatically — you don’t have to write in the code). Save the use of
FrontPage extensions for hosted Web sites (the ones you pay for) when you
have a good deal of allotted space. Installing Microsoft FrontPage extensions
on a small Web site like the one that Road Runner provides will take up too
many of your precious megabytes. (Yahoo!, however, has them installed for
the GeoCities sites, and doesn’t count them as part of your allotted megabyte
count.)
Paying for Your Web Space
If you’ve been on the Internet for any length of time, daily spam has bom-
barded you with hosting offers. A Web-hosting company houses your Web
site code and electronically doles out your pages and images to Web page 
visitors.
If you take advantage of PayPal’s free Pay Now buttons or Shopping Cart, you
can turn a basic-level hosted site into a full-on e-commerce store without
paying additional fees to your hosting company. The PayPal tools are easily
inserted into your pages with a snippet of code provided by PayPal.
160
Part II: Setting Up Shop 
Why learn HTML when Web page editors 
can do it for you?
If you need some help designing those first
pages (I never became proficient in HTML and
still depend somewhat on software to design my
site), try looking for inexpensive HTML Web
software. I just checked eBay, and searched
web design in the Software category. Plenty of
software is available for as little as $9.99. The
key is to find one that includes a graphical
(WYSIWYG, or what-you-see-is-what-you-get)
interface that allows you to preview your pages
as you design them. Some have predesigned
templates. You can also use an older version of
Microsoft FrontPage (without the extensions) to
design simple Web pages.
Then again, the longer you’re on the Internet
and the more you study, the more you’ll learn
about HTML. It’s often just easier to type out
HTML code yourself once you get the hang of it.
That’s why Patti Louise Ruby and I wrote the
book, eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies. Only
two subjects are covered in the book: HTML
and photography for your online business. (Patti
covered HTML, and I covered the photography
portion.) It also has several HTML templates
that you might like to use as your own.

Before deciding to spend good money on a Web-hosting company, thoroughly
check it out. Go to that company’s site to find a list of features they offer. If
you still have questions after perusing the Web site, look for a toll-free
number to call. You won’t find any feedback ratings like you find on eBay, but
the following are a few questions to ask (don’t hang up until you’re satisfied
with the answers):
 How long have they been in business? You don’t want a Web host that
has been in business only a few months and operates out of their base-
ment. Deal with someone who’s been around the Internet for a while
and, hence, knows what they’re doing. Is the company’s Web site profes-
sional looking? Or does it look like your neighbor’s kid designed it? Does
the company look like it has enough money to stay in business? You
wouldn’t want it disappearing mysteriously with your money.
 Who are some of their other clients? Poke around to see whether you
can find links to sites of other clients. Take a look at who else is doing
business with them and analyze the sites. Visit several of their client
sites. Do the pages and links come up quickly? Do all the images appear
in a timely manner? Web sites that load quickly are a good sign.
 What is their downtime-to-uptime ratio? Does the Web host guarantee
uptime (the span of time its servers stay operational without going down
and denying access to your site)? Expecting a 99 percent uptime guaran-
tee is not unreasonable; you’re open for business — and your Web host
needs to keep it that way.
 How much Web space do you get for your money? MSN (Microsoft
Network Internet access service) gives you 30MB for free; you’d better
be getting a whole lot more if you’re paying for it!
 What’s their data transfer limit? Data transfer is a measurement of the
amount of bytes transferred from your site on the server to the Internet.
In July 2001, my site had 93,000 hits; in July 2004, it had more than
500,000. Each hit transfers a certain amount of bytes (kilobytes,
megabytes) from your host’s servers to the viewer’s computer.
 Do they offer toll-free technical support? When something goes wrong
with your Web site, you need it fixed immediately. You must be able to
reach tech support quickly without hanging around on the phone for
hours. Does the Web host have a technical support area on its Web site
where you can troubleshoot your own problems (in the middle of the
night)?
Whenever you’re deciding on any kind of provider for your business,
take a moment to call their tech support team with a question about the
services. Take note of how long you were on hold and how courteous
the tech was. Before plunking down your hard-earned money, you
should be sure that the provider’s customer service claims aren’t merely
that — just claims.
161
Chapter 8: Establishing a Base of Operations: Your Web Site

 What’s the policy on shopping carts? In time, you’re probably going 
to need a shopping cart interface on your site. Does your provider
charge extra for that? If so, how much? In the beginning, a convenient
and professional-looking way to sell items on your site is to set up
PayPal Shopping Cart or PayPal Pay Now button. When you’re running
your business full-time, however, a shopping cart or a way to accept
credit cards is a must.
 What kind of statistics will you get? Visitors who go to your Web site
leave a bread-crumb trail. Your host collects these statistics, so you’ll 
be able to know which are your most and least popular pages. You can
know how long people linger on each page, where they come from, and
what browsers they’re using. How your host supplies these stats to you
is important. One popular reporting format is provided from a company
called WebTrends (www.webtrends.com).
 Are there any hidden fees? Are they charging exorbitant fees for setup?
Charging extra for statistics? Imposing higher charges if your bandwidth
suddenly increases?
 How often will the Web host back up your site? No matter how redundant
a host’s servers are, a disaster may strike; you need to know that your Web
site won’t vaporize. Redundancy is the safety net for your site. You may be
interested in how many power backups a company has for the main
system. Perhaps it has generators (more than one is good) and more.
What’s in a Web Site Name: 
Naming Your Baby
What to name the baby, er, Web site? It’s almost as much of a dilemma as
deciding on your eBay user ID or eBay store name. If you don’t have an exist-
ing company name that you want to use, why not use the same name as your
eBay store? (Check out Chapter 5 for details about eBay Stores.) Lock it up
now so that you can keep your brand forever.
Name your site with a name that identifies what you do, what you sell, or who
you are. And be sure you like it, because once its yours and you begin operat-
ing under it and establishing a reputation, it’ll be with you twenty years from
now when you’re still selling online! (I know, it should only happen!)
A few Web sites offer wizards to help you decide your domain name. A partic-
ularly intuitive one can be found at www.snapitnow.com. In a small, Web-
based form, you input your primary business type and keywords that
describe your business. The wizard then displays a large number of options
and also lets you know whether the options are available. Very convenient.
162
Part II: Setting Up Shop 

Before you attempt to register a name, you should check to be sure it isn’t
anyone else’s trademark. To search an updated list of registered U.S. trade-
marks, go to the following and use the electronic trademark search system:
www.trademarksearchforfree.com.
Registering Your Domain Name 
(Before Someone Else Takes It)
Talk about your junk e-mail. I get daily e-mails advising me to Lose 40 pounds
in 40 days, accept credit cards now, and of course REGISTER MY NAME NOW!
The last scam seems to be geared to obtaining my e-mail address for other
junk mail lists rather than trying to help me register my Web site. Choosing a
registrar (the company that handles the registering of your site name) is as
important as choosing the right Web host. You must remember that the
Internet is still a little like the Wild West, and that the James gang might be
waiting to relieve you of your hard-earned cash. One of the ways to protect
yourself is to understand how the registry works (knowledge is power), so
read on.
In October of 1998, U.S. government officials decided to expand the domain
registration business by breaking up the Network Solutions site (previously
the only place that you could register your Web site). This opened up the
Web to all kinds of people selling domain names.
Before you decide on a registrar for your domain name, take a minute to see
whether the registrar is accredited by ICANN (Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers — the international governing body for
domain names) or is reselling for an official ICANN-accredited registrar.
(You’ll have to ask who they register with.) The Accredited Registrar
Directory is updated constantly, so check the following for the most recent
list: www.internic.com/regist.html.
163
Chapter 8: Establishing a Base of Operations: Your Web Site
Domain parking
Suppose that you’ve come up with a brilliant
name for your site and you get really big and
famous. Then someone else uses your Web site
name but registers it as a .net — while yours 
is a .com. To avoid this situation, when you’re
ready to register your site, make sure you 
register both domains (.com and .net) and park
them with your registrar. For example, www.
ebay.net and ebay org are registered to
(guess who?) ebay.com. You can check the
owner of any domain name at any of the Web-
hosting or registrar sites.

You’ll usually get a substantial discount from the more expensive registrars
when you register your domain name for multiple years — a good idea if you
plan on staying in business. Also, if you register your name through your
hosting service, you might be able to cut the price in half! The only drawback
is that your prepaid registration might go out the window if you choose to
change hosting companies.
If you’re registering a new domain name but already have a site set up with
your ISP, you need a feature called URL forwarding. This feature directs any
hits to your new domain name from your existing long URL address. Some
registrars offer this service, but watch out for hidden surprises, such as a
free offer of the service, which means they will probably smack a big fat
banner at the bottom of your home page. Your registrar should also have
some available tech support. Trying to troubleshoot DNS issues is a job for
those who know what they’re doing! Remember, sometimes you get what you
pay for.
Marketing Your Web Site (More 
Visitors = More Business)
After you set up your Web site, it’s time to let the world know about it. Having
spent many years in the advertising business, I can spot businesses that want
to fail. They open their doors and expect the world to beat a path to them
and make them rich. This doesn’t happen — ever.
164
Part II: Setting Up Shop 
Making your personal information private
ICANN requires every registrar to maintain a
publicly accessible WHOIS database displaying
all contact information for all domain names
registered. Interested parties (or fraudsters)
can find out the name, street address, e-mail
address, and phone number of the owner of the
site by running a whois search on the domain
name. You can run a whois search by going to
www.whois.net and typing the domain
name in question.
This information can be useful to spammers
who spoof your e-mail address as their return
address to cloak their identity, identity thieves,
stalkers, and just about anyone up to no good.
To see the difference between private and
public registrations, run a whois search on my
Web site, www.coolebaytools.com, and
www.yahoo.com.
Registrars such as Network Solutions offer pri-
vate registration for an additional $9 a year.
Check to see whether your registrar offers this
service and how much they charge.

You must take an active approach to letting the world in on the goodies you
have for sale. This means spending a good deal of time promoting your site
by running banner ads and getting your URL into a search engine. There are
no shortcuts.
About a trillion people out there want to take your money for advertising
your Web site. As with all transactions regarding your Web site, knowing who
you’re dealing with is key. If you want to run your banner on someone else’s
site, don’t spend money; ask to do an exchange. The more advertising that
you can get for free, the better. If you decide that you want to pay for adver-
tising, I recommend that you wait until after you’ve made a profit selling mer-
chandise from your site.
A simple link to your Web site from your eBay About Me page will draw
people to your site initially. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.
Getting your URL into a search engine
For people to find your site (and what you’re selling), they must be able to
locate you. A popular way that people do this is by searching with a search
engine. So you should submit your site to search engines. Go to the search
engines that interest you and look for a link or a help area that will enable
you to submit your site. Be sure to follow any specific instructions on the
site; some may limit the amount of keywords and the characters allowed in
your description.
To submit your URL to search engines, you need to do a little work. (Nothing’s
easy, is it?) Write down twenty-five to fifty words or phrases that describe
your Web site; these are your keywords. Now, using as many of the words you
came up with, write a description of your site. With the remaining words,
create a list of keywords, separating each word or short phrase by a comma.
You can use these keywords to add metatags to the header in your HTML 
document for your home page. Metatags are identifiers used by search engine 
spiders, robots that troll the Internet looking for new sites to classify on search
engines. Metatags are used like this:
<META NAME = “insert your keywords here separated by
commas” CONTENT = “short description of your
site”>
If you have a problem coming up with metatags, check out the free Yahoo!
GeoCities handy metatag generator at http://geocities.yahoo.com/v/
res/meg.html.
165
Chapter 8: Establishing a Base of Operations: Your Web Site

Google
Google crawls the Internet regularly with its spider, Googlebot, looking for
new sites to index on Google Search. If Googlebot has missed your site, 
go to the following and let Google know that you’re site is ready for listing:
www.google.com/addurl.html. Google doesn’t guarantee that your site
will be listed, but the process takes less than a minute. What could it hurt?
Yahoo!
Yahoo! is one of the more difficult sites to list with, although you can get a
free listing if you fill out all the forms correctly and wait six to eight weeks.
Instructions for the free listing are at http://docs.yahoo.com/info/
suggest/. Yahoo! guarantees that you’ll be reviewed in just seven busi-
ness days.
You’ll hear a lot about search engine optimization (SEO) when getting your
Web site set up. This basically means that you want to use the right keywords
in your metatags to get the spiders to see your site.
Paid search advertising
Paid search advertising helps you get visitors to your site. When you go to a
search engine, you’ll see several searches on the right side of the page
(Google) or on the top of the search results (Yahoo!); these are the paid list-
ings that match your search. Each time you click one of these links, the site
owners pay a fee for directing a new visitor to their site.
The two major players in the field are Google Adwords (adwords.com) and
Yahoo! (/smallbusiness.yahoo.com/marketing/).
In my book, eBay Powerseller Practices For Dummies, I go into far more detail
on how to take advantage of this service.

In this part . . .
L
et’s delve into the dollars and sense of your eBay busi-
ness. In this part, I discuss automating your business
by using online and offline tools, sprucing up your listings,
setting up your home photo studio, and handling shipping
(the bane of most businesses). I also give you the lowdown
on two other important aspects of your business: working
with customers and collecting payments.

Chapter 9
Software Built for Online Auctions
In This Chapter
 Figuring out what tasks you can automate
 Finding online auction management services
 Exploring auction management software
N
ow that eBay has become a world marketplace, a single-page auction or
item listing is becoming an increasingly valuable piece of real estate.
Millions view your sale, and the more auctions and fixed-price items that you
can list, the better your chance to make a good living. Time is money: You
need to post your auctions quickly and accurately.
Auction posting, record keeping, inventory cataloging, photo managing, and
statistic gathering are all tasks that you can automate. The more your busi-
ness grows, the more confusing things can become. Automated tools can
help you keep it all straight. But remember that the more tools you use, the
more expense you may be adding to your business. Always keep your bottom
line in mind when evaluating whether to use fee-based software and services.
In this chapter, I discuss how to automate different tasks, software that you
can use to automate, and Web sites that offer services to make your daily
chores considerably more bearable. After you read this chapter, you’ll be well
equipped to decide whether or not you want to automate your business.
Considering Tasks for Automation
You’ll have to perform certain office tasks, no matter how few or how many
auctions you’re running. Depending on your personal business style, you may
want to automate any or all of the following tasks. You may choose to use a
single program, a manual method, or some features from one program and
some from others. For those who aren’t ready for the automated plunge, I
offer alternatives. Where appropriate, I insert references guiding you to
where in this book or on the Web you can find more information about the
automated services I discuss.

Setting up images for 
automatic FTP upload
You have several ways to store the images in your auctions. If you’re using an
auction management service or software (such as Marketworks.com or
Channel Advisor, both of which I discuss later in this chapter), an uploader is
usually included as a part of the software. Many online services merely fetch
the photos from your hard drive without the need for additional FTP (File
Transfer Protocol) image uploading software.
With this format, you merely click the Browse button to access the Open File
window, and then find the location of the images on your hard drive. When
you’ve located the images that you want to upload (one per line), click the
Upload button and the images will be on their way to the service’s servers.
If you choose to keep images on your own Web site (which makes the images
available for your Web site, too), you’ll have to use some sort of FTP soft-
ware. You probably aren’t using close to the total space that your hosting ser-
vice allots for your Web site, whicl leaves plenty of room to store a separate
folder of eBay images. ISPs often also give you several megabytes of storage
space (see Chapter 8).
The Mozilla Firefox 2 Internet browser includes a free FTP program called
FireFTP. Just go to the Tools drop-down menu at the top of the Firefox
window and click FireFTP. It’s a straightforward FTP software program that
should be part of your auction arsenal, even if you use a service or other soft-
ware. You can download a free version of Firefox at www.mozilla.com/
en-US/firefox.
Sorting auction e-mail
A vital function of any auction software or system is the ability to customize
and send e-mails to your winners. Many sellers use the default letters in these
programs, which tend to be a bit — no, incredibly — impersonal and uncar-
ing. (To see some examples of customer-friendly e-mails and tips on drafting
your own, head to Chapter 12.) You must decide whether you want the pro-
gram to receive e-mail as well.
Most computer-resident auction management programs have their own built-
in e-mail software as part of the program. When you download your winner
information from eBay, the program automatically generates invoices and
congratulatory e-mails.
170
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

How to handle your auction-related e-mail is a personal choice. Although I
currently use eBay’s Selling Manager to send auction-related e-mails, I receive
auction e-mail through Outlook, using a separate folder titled Auctions that
contains subfolders for eBay Buy and eBay Sell.
Automating end-of-auction e-mail
If you want to set up e-mails to be sent automatically after an auction ends,
you must use a software application to do so. (I use Selling Manager Pro.) The
software should download your final auction results, generate the e-mail, and
let you preview the e-mail before sending it out. Many online sites that I dis-
cuss later in this chapter (see the section “Online auction management
sites”) send out winner confirmation e-mails automatically when an auction is
over; be sure that you set your preferences to Preview the e-mail before send-
ing if you want to use this option.
eBay sends an end-of-auction (transaction) e-mail as part of its standard 
procedure. What many sellers don’t know is that you can customize these
e-mails through your PayPal account. As long as you indicate PayPal as a 
payment option in your listings, you can add your logo and a personalized
message. To sign up for this, log on to your PayPal account and then follow
these steps:
1. Click the My Account tab, and then click the Profile tab.
2. In the Selling Preferences column, click the Auctions link.
3. Change the Off radio button to On and type your personalized 
message.
4. Click Submit.
Keeping inventory
Many eBay PowerSellers depend on the old clipboard or notebook method —
crossing off items as they sell them. If that works for you, great. Others prefer
to use an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of inventory.
Most of the auction management packages that I detail later in this chapter
(see the section “Auction management software”) handle inventory for you.
Some automatically deduct an item from inventory when you launch an 
auction. You have a choice of handling inventory directly on your hard drive
or keeping your inventory online with a service that’s accessible from any
computer, wherever you are.
171
Chapter 9: Software Built for Online Auctions

I handle my inventory on my desktop through QuickBooks. When I buy mer-
chandise to sell, and post the bill to QuickBooks, it automatically puts the
merchandise into inventory. When I input my sale, it deducts the items sold
from standing inventory. I can print a status report whenever I want to see
how much I have left — or have to order.
Generating HTML
Fancy auctions are nice, but fancy doesn’t make the item sell any better.
Competitive pricing and low shipping rates work in your favor — especially
with eBay’s Compare Items feature in Search. Also, a clean listing with as
many photos as necessary goes a long way to sell your product. Some soft-
ware and services offer a large selection of templates to gussy up your auc-
tions. But you must think of your customers; many of them are still logging
on with dial-up connections, which are notoriously slow. The use of simple
HTML doesn’t slow the loading of your page, but the addition of miscella-
neous images (decorative backgrounds and animations) definitely makes
viewing your auction a chore for those dialing up. And forget the background
music — it really slows things down!
Don’t fret; you can make do by repeatedly incorporating two or three simple
HTML templates, cutting and pasting new text as necessary. Most auction
management programs offer you several choices of templates. I recommend
that you stick with a couple that are similar, giving a standardized look to
your listings, the way major companies give a standardized look to their
advertising and identity. Your customers will get used to the look of your auc-
tions and feel comfortable each time they open one.
172

Inserting your hosted pictures in your description
An important line of code that everyone seems
to forget is the one that inserts a picture into
your auction description. On the Sell Your Item
page, click the tab to view in HTML mode, and
insert the following line below where you’d like

Be sure to substitute your own server and
image name. If you want to put one picture on
top of another, just type <P> between the lines
of code — repeat the HTML line with a different
image name for each image that you want to
display.

One-click relisting and 
selling similar items
Using auction software or an auction service speeds up the process of 
posting or relisting items. After you input your inventory into the software,
posting or relisting your auctions is a mouse click away. All the auction man-
agement software packages that I detail later in this chapter include this 
feature.
If you buy your items in bulk, you might want to take advantage of eBay’s free
relisting tool. By clicking the Sell Similar link on any ended listing, you can
automatically relist your items. Sell Similar starts the listing as new, so if your
item doesn’t sell, you can avail yourself of the Relist feature. This way, if the
item sells the second time, your listing (insertion) fees for the first listing will
be credited.
Although eBay says that Sell Similar is for relisting items, it also works when
listing a duplicate of an item that has sold successfully. The only difference is
that you aren’t credited for the unsold listing fee.
Scheduling your listings for bulk upload
If you want to schedule the unattended launch of your auctions without
incurring eBay’s 10-cent fee, you must use an online management service
(check out the “Online auction management sites” section, later in this chap-
ter). If you can be at your computer to send your auctions to eBay singly or
in bulk, you can use the Turbo Lister application, which eBay offers at no
charge. (For details, see the “Turbo Lister” section, later in the chapter.)
Researching your statistics
There are so many questions when you’re selling on eBay. What is the best
time to end my auction? What day should I start my listing? Is it better to run
a five-day or a seven-day auction? Now an online service can help you sepa-
rate the rumors from the facts.
Lots of eBay experts out there will give you hard-and-fast rules to guarantee
success with your listings. It’s a lot of bunk. Every category and every type of
item may draw shoppers at different times of the day and different days of
the week. The best experts are those who are selling every day on eBay, day

in and day out. They are usually PowerSellers and do their own research for
their listings. They don’t have the time to spout off and give you secrets. I’m
a regular seller on eBay (a PowerSeller too), and I’ve noticed distinct varia-
tions in my sales through a fantastic online service called ViewTracker from
Sellathon. It’s really one of a kind.
Sellathon tracks your listings using a small piece of code that you insert in
your auctions. The site gives you loads of information about your visitors,
without violating anyone’s privacy. Here are some of the things you can 
find out:
 How many times someone has visited your auction
 The date and time the visitor arrived at your auction, and what city,
state, and country your visitor is from
 Whether the reserve price was met when the visitor arrived
 When the item received a bid (and how many bids had been placed up
to that moment)
 Whether the visitor had chosen to watch this listing in his or her My
eBay page
 Whether the visitor browsed a category, searched a category, searched
all of eBay, used eBay’s Product Finder utility, or came from the See
Seller’s Other Items page or some other page and what category he or
she was browsing
 If the visitor was searching, what search terms he or she used to find
your item and whether the search was for Titles Only or Titles and
Descriptions
 Whether the user elected to view Auctions Only, Buy it Now, or both
You get all this information and more. Sellathon offers a thirty-day free trial at
www.sellathon.com. After that, the service is $4.95 a month.
To end an old wives’ tale about what days and times your listings get the
highest hits, Figure 9-1 shows you some charts from my Sellathon account,
showing how many visits my listings got each day. Verrry interesting.
Automating other tasks
That’s not all! You can automate a few more tasks. Having so many options is
like being in a candy store: You may want it all, but that might not be good for
you. For example, if you use online postage, you may not want to print your
labels because that would be doubling your work. Take a serious look at the
options you’re offered and see whether they fit into your particular work
style.
174
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Checking out
When someone wins or buys an item, eBay’s checkout integrates directly
with PayPal and will also indicate your other preferred forms of payment. If
you’re closing less than a hundred auctions a day, that’s all you need. eBay
and PayPal will also send an e-mail to you and the buyer so that you can
arrange for payment.
Some online auction management services offer your own private checkout
area, which will cost you a percentage of your sale, so you must decide
whether your business warrants this option. A personalized winner’s notifica-
tion e-mail can easily contain a link to your PayPal payment area, making a
checkout service unnecessary.
Printing shipping labels
Printing shipping labels without printing postage can be the beginning of a
laborious two-step process. Two companies, Endicia.com and Stamps.com,
print your labels and postage all in one step. Check out Chapter 17 for infor-
mation on how this works.
Some sites print your winners’ address labels without postage, as does
eBay’s Selling Manager. That works well if you don’t mind carrying your pack-
ages to the post office for postage. (Why would you do that? A burning need
to stand in line, I guess!)

Chapter 9: Software Built for Online Auctions

Tracking buyer information
Keeping track of your winners isn’t rocket science. You can do it in an Excel
spreadsheet by downloading the information from PayPal. If you choose to
have an online management service do this for you, be sure that you can
download the information to your computer (in case you and the online ser-
vice part ways someday).
Generating customized reports
Sales reports, ledgers, and tax information are all important reports that you
should have in your business. Online services and software supply different
flavors of these reports.
PayPal allows you to download your sales data into a format compatible with
QuickBooks, a highly respected and popular bookkeeping program. You can
also choose to download your data to an Excel spreadsheet. PayPal reports
are chock-full of intensely detailed information about your sales and
deposits. Putting this information in a standard accounting software program
on a regular basis makes your year-end calculations easier to bear. (In
Chapter 16, I detail what else you might need for this task.)
Submitting feedback
If you’re running a lot of auctions, leaving feedback can be a chore. One solu-
tion is to automate the submission of feedback through an online service or
software. But timing the automation of this task can be tricky.
Don’t leave feedback for an eBay transaction until after you’ve heard from the
buyer that the purchase is satisfactory. Leaving positive feedback immedi-
ately after you’ve received payment from the buyer is too soon. After you
receive an e-mail assuring you that the customer is satisfied, manually leav-
ing feedback by going to the feedback forum (or the item page) can be just 
as easy — if not easier — as bulk-loading feedback. The Selling Manager Pro
program on eBay has a setting that will automatically post positive feedback
for a buyer, after they’ve left positive feedback for you.
Managing Your Business with 
Online Resources and Software
If you searched the Internet for auction management services and software,
you’d come up with a bunch. For simplicity’s sake, I’ve chosen to examine
just a few of these services in this chapter. After speaking to many sellers,
176
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

I’ve found online services that offer uptime reliability (uptime is key here;
you don’t want the server that holds your photos going down or mislaunch-
ing your auctions) and software that’s continually updated to match eBay
changes.
Using a site or software to run your auctions takes practice, so I suggest that
you try any that appeal to you and that offer free preview trials. As I describe
these different applications, I include a link so that you can check them out
further. Table 9-1 compares the costs of many auction management and
online services.

Some software and services work on a monthly fee, whereas others work on a
one-time-purchase fee. For a one-time-purchase software application to truly
benefit you, it must have the reputation for updating its software each time
eBay makes a change in its system. The programs that I discuss in this chap-
ter have been upgraded continually to date.
177
Chapter 9: Software Built for Online Auctions

Most services have a free trial period. Be sure that you don’t spend a bunch
of your precious time inputting your entire inventory, only to discover you
don’t like the way the service works. Instead, input a few items to give the
service a whirl.
Online auction management sites
Auction management Web sites handle almost everything, from inventory
management to label printing. Some sellers prefer online (or hosted) manage-
ment sites because you can access your information from any computer. You
might use every feature a site offers, or you might choose a bit from column
A and a bit from column B and perform the more personalized tasks manu-
ally. Read on to determine what service might best suit your needs.
Although quite a few excellent online services for automating sales are avail-
able, I have room here to show you only a few. Remember that by using an
online service, your information resides on a server out there in cyberspace;
if you’re a control freak, it may be a bit much to bear. Many services are simi-
lar in format, so in the following sections I point out some of the highlights of
a few representative systems.
When selecting a service, look for a logo or text indicating that the service is
an eBay Certified Developer, Preferred Solution Provider, or API licensee.
These people have first access to eBay’s system changes and can implement
them immediately. Others may have a day or so lag time to update their soft-
ware. Note that these logos do not guarantee the quality of their service —
only that they subscribe (pay money) to eBay for the logo and use of the API.
ChannelAdvisor
ChannelAdvisor’s founder Scot Wingo got into the auction business around
the turn of the century. His first foray into the eBay world was AuctionRover,
a site that had tools to perform an extensive eBay search, list auctions, and
check pricing trends. The company’s old Rover logo was fashioned after
Wingo’s Border Collie, Mack.
Fast forward to today. ChannelAdvisor is a highly popular management 
service for all levels of eBay sellers. They supply listing and management 
services to everyone from Fortune 1000 companies to the little old lady next
door.
How? They offer three levels of software: Enterprise for large businesses that
want to outsource their online business, Merchant for midsized businesses
and higher-level PowerSellers, and Pro for small businesses and individuals.
The powerful software suites help eBay sellers successfully manage and auto-
mate the sale of their merchandise.
178
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Starting at the entry level, you can get the Pro version of ChannelAdvisor.
Here’s what they offer the beginner-level seller:
 Listing design and launching: Create your listings with their standard
templates or use your own HTML to design auction descriptions. List
your items immediately or schedule a listing. ChannelAdvisor will
launch the auction when you tell them to.
 Item and inventory management: If you want to keep your inventory
online, you can create it on their system. If you want to input your inven-
tory offline, you can import it from their Excel template. You can also
import open auctions or store listings to your ChannelAdvisor account
for relisting or servicing.
 Image hosting: You get 250MB of space to host your images. You can
upload images to the site four at a time, or use FTP to upload a large
quantity of images.
 Post-auction management: This function merges your winning auction
information and generates customized e-mails and invoices to your
buyers. You can print mailing labels too.
To tour the various offerings of ChannelAdvisor and find out about their free
trial period, visit www.channeladvisor.com.
Marketworks (previously AuctionWorks)
A group of collectors who saw the need for power tools for PowerSellers
developed this highly graphical site (www.Marketworks.com). I think they’ve
succeeded. (They were known in the eBay community as AuctionWorks but
changed their name in June 2004.) A high percentage of eBay PowerSellers use
the site. They launch approximately six million listings on eBay every month.
Marketworks offers help links at every turn, a first-rate online tutorial, free
toll-free support (that’s a free phone call and free support), and free interac-
tive training classes for registered users. The site integration is broad; here
are just a few of their features:
 Item and inventory management: Features the ClickLaunch Single Step
Launcher, which launches individual items to auction while adding 
them to inventory. (The site also has a bulk item-launching capability.)
LaunchBots provides automated launching of your listings. With their
Bulk Inventory Upload form, you can import existing auctions from eBay
into Excel and MS Access.
 Image hosting: Enables you to bulk upload fifteen images at a time to
their servers. The basic account allows 100MB of storage. If your images
average 30K each, you should be able to upload almost 3500 images into
the 100MB image-hosting space.

eBay’s Selling Manager
eBay replaced the All Selling tab of your My
eBay page with Selling Manager, which dis-
plays a summary of your current transactions.
Many sellers (even some PowerSellers) rely on
Selling Manager to handle their eBay manage-
ment chores.
From Selling Manager, you can
 View listing status: You can see which
sales activities you’ve completed and what
you still have to do.
 Send custom e-mail and post feedback:
Customize your e-mail templates and set up
stored feedback comments to help you run
through the post-sales process quickly.
 Relist in bulk: Relist multiple sold and
unsold listings at once.
 Maintain sales records: See individual
sales records for every transaction, includ-
ing a history of the transaction status.
 Print invoices and shipping labels: Print
labels and invoices directly from sales
records.
 Download sales history: Export your sales
records to keep files on your computer.
 Keep track of NPB and FVF: File nonpaying
bidder alerts and final value fee requests.
The fee to use Selling Manager is $4.99 a month.
(It’s free when you have a basic eBay store.)
They also offer a Pro version that incorporates
inventory management and more for $15.99 a
month. Many sellers (myself included) love the
Pro version. The figure shows a Pro summary
page.
 Auction reporting: Generates accounts receivable, item history, and
post-sales reports from the Reports area. Marketworks has its own
Traction System for sales and item tracking. The reporting feature offers
customizable views of your sales data, item and auction data, accounts
receivable, and sales tax by state!

 Templates and listing: Marketworks uses their own trademarked
Ballista template listing system. You can use their predefined color tem-
plates or use their macros with your own predefined HTML template,
substituting the macros for stock areas in your template. By using their
custom ad template option and well-thought-out macros, you can take
your own HTML and make a Marketworks template.
 Post-auction management: Sends out automated e-mail to your winners,
linking them back to your own branded checkout page. If customers
want to pay with PayPal or through your own Merchant Account, they
have to link from there. Marketworks combines multiple wins for ship-
ping and invoicing. You have the option to set six different feedback
comments, which you choose at the time of posting.
Marketworks offers all their users a StoreFront with its own URL at no addi-
tional charge. If an item sells from your StoreFront, you pay the usual 2 per-
cent commission. When you load items into inventory, you have the choice of
immediately listing them in your StoreFront. All your items are seamlessly
integrated. To get current information and sign up for a free trial, go to
www.Marketworks.com.
Auction management software
Many sellers prefer to run their auction businesses from their own hard
drives. I happen to like the option of being able to reference my old auctions
on my backups. Luckily, some valuable auction software programs are avail-
able to perform all the same tasks you get from the online services.
To those who would rather have the software at home, there are some solid
choices other than the ones I examine in the next section. You might also
want to visit these other sites for their quality auction management software:
 Auction Tamer (auctiontamer.com)
 Shooting Star (foodogsoftware.com)
 SpoonFeeder (www.spoonfeeder.com)
You can accomplish almost all the same tasks on your own computer as you
can with online services — except online auction checkout. You can always
use eBay’s checkout as your final stop or include a link in your end-of-auction
e-mails. And if you want, you can set up a checkout page on your own Web
site that gathers your auction information.
181
Chapter 9: Software Built for Online Auctions

Most of the software packages will perform the following operations:
 Maintain inventory
 Prepare and list auctions
 Manage e-mail
 Automate feedback
 Provide HTML templates
 Track income and expenses
Auction Wizard 2000
Way back in 1999, Standing Wave Software developed a product that would
handle large inventories and meet the needs of the growing eBay population.
Enter Auction Wizard. In 2000, the company introduced a more robust ver-
sion, Auction Wizard 2000, to meet the challenges presented by changes 
on eBay.
This software is a tour-de-force of auction management programs whose
pieces are integrated into one program. Aside from the processes just
described, you can also
 Keep track of consignment sales by consignees, including all fees.
 Import your images, and crop, rotate, or resize them before uploading.
 Upload your pictures with built-in FTP software while you’re working 
on your auctions, eliminating the need for another piece of auction 
business software.
The program interface is straightforward. I always plunge into new programs
without reading the instructions, and I was able to use the program right off
the bat. I’m still not an expert, but that’s probably because Auction Wizard
2000 has so many features that I haven’t had the time to study them all.
To begin using the software, simply download your current eBay auctions
directly into the program. When your auctions close, send customized
e-mails (the program fills in the auction information) and manage all your
end-of-auction business. Some sellers launch their auctions using Turbo
Lister (see the “Turbo Lister” section at the end of this chapter), and then
retrieve them and handle the end-of-auction management with Auction
Wizard 2000. For a sixty-day free trial, go to their site at www.auction
wizard2000.com.

Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Blackthorne Basic and Pro
Of the two versions of Blackthorne Basic and Pro, the professional version is
what you’re going to need for your eBay business (but it’s also the toughest
to learn). Because the software is owned by eBay, it’s the first to have
updates for eBay’s latest changes.
eBay’s Blackthorne Basic is a solid listing program, offering a variety of tem-
plates. Blackthorne automatically inputs your standard shipping information
and auction messages into your auctions so you don’t have to retype them
every time. You can customize your e-mail correspondence, and Blackthorne
will generate the appropriate e-mail messages after retrieving your completed
auction information from the site. The program is available as a monthly 
subscription fee charged to your regular eBay bill.
The Pro version (which supports multiple user IDs) takes things up a notch,
handling your auction listings as well as automating bulk listing and end-of-
auction business. For example, the Pro version will
 Spell check your auction listings
 Schedule your auction launches for a later posting (see the following tip)
 Keep track of your inventory
 Launch items directly from stock at hand
 Automate bulk-feedback postings
 Print shipping labels
 Create sales reports
One of the finer points of the Pro edition is that you can schedule your auction
listings for a particular time and space out your auctions (within a group of
items to be listed) by a set number of minutes. (You can also do this in eBay’s
free Turbo Lister.) This is valuable because so many bidders bid during the
last few minutes of an auction, when the highest bidding takes place.
To check out the latest changes and upgrades, and to compare all of eBay’s
selling program versions, visit pages.ebay.com/selling_manager/
comparison.html.
Turbo Lister
I like Turbo Lister because it’s simple and easy to use. It has a built-in WYSI-
WYG (what you see is what you get) HTML editor and makes preparing my list-
ings offline easy. When I’m ready, I just click a button and they’re all listed at
once. You can also stagger listings and schedule them for a later date for a fee.
183
Chapter 9: Software Built for Online Auctions

Using Turbo Lister is as simple and straightforward as posting a listing using
the Sell Your Item page on the eBay site. One of the benefits of Turbo Lister is
that it allows you to prepare auctions while offline and group them for
launching all at once to eBay. You can also keep listings in the program for
relisting in the future.
Using the program is a two-step process. First, you download the application
from eBay at pages.ebay.com/turbo_lister/download.html. Next,
you install Turbo Lister on your computer. What could be simpler?

Dollars and Sense: Budgeting 
and Marketing Your Sales
In This Chapter
 Marketing your listings by choosing the right category
 Using promotional options to your advantage
 Paying eBay: The lowdown on basic fees
Your entire online business is just that: a business. In every business,
decisions are made regarding how much money is spent for each divi-
sion of the company. Because you’re the head of your company, you must
make these decisions. Even if you’re selling on eBay on a part-time basis, you
still have to address budget concerns. The one area in which you don’t have
to set aside money is shipping and fulfillment; in the eBay business model,
the buyer pays your shipping and handling costs. (See Chapter 14 for more
on shipping.)
When you list an item for sale on eBay, you must consider what the item will
sell for, in what category to list it, and whether to add any eBay listing options.
Establish a minimum percentage that you assign as your profit so that you can
determine how much to spend on your advertising (marketing) budget. If your
item has a considerable amount of competition in its category, you may want
to add some of the options eBay offers to make folks notice it and want to buy
it. The cost of these options (or advertising) needs to fit into your established
budget for the particular item.
In this chapter, I give you a preview of the various options eBay offers its
users, highlighting the cost of these options along the way and the pros and
cons of each. I also detail the basic eBay fees. When you’ve finished reading
this chapter, you should be well on your way to establishing a working
budget and have a handle on marketing your items.

Listing Your Items
With tens of thousands of categories, finding the right place for your item can
be daunting. (For more on eBay categories, see Chapter 2.) You need to apply
some marketing techniques when deciding where to place your auctions. You
should always also be thinking about your budget; you can list an item in two
separate categories, but you have to pay double for that. Does your budget
allow for it? Will the added expense really bring in more customers? Figure 10-1
shows you how eBay lists the categories where your searched items appear. It
helps you hone your choice of popular category.
To find where other sellers have listed items that are similar to yours, per-
form a completed item search for your item in the Advanced Search page. In
the Search box, type your item keywords and click the option to search
Completed Listings Only. When you get the results, indicate that you want
them sorted by highest prices first by using the drop-down menu.
After you have your results, click the completed listings with the highest
bids. At the top of the auction page, you’ll see the listed category. You may
find that your item is listed successfully in more than one category.
Check the active listings; are lots of people selling your item? If you see that
you’re one of forty or fifty selling the item, you need to get creative as to
where to list your item. Evaluate the item and its potential buyers. In what
categories would someone shopping for your item search?
Figure 10-1:

showing the

in which the
item is listed
(on the left).
186
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Over my eBay career, I have sold several things in “iffy” categories. My catnip
cigars come to mind. I was selling these adorable seven-inch cigars filled with
organic catnip and was being blown away by the zillions of listings in the Cat
Toys category. So I got a little creative. It is a cigar, and one of eBay’s popular
categories is Tobacciana, so I listed it there. If someone is a cigar buff, they
may be browsing that category. And perhaps they just may happen to own a
cat they’d like to share a cigar with! I’m just stretching the category rules a
tad. I normally list the cigars solely in my store, but at other times (like holi-
days), I list them for auction.
Suppose you’ve found two perfect categories in which to list your item. eBay
allows you to list an item in two categories (see Figure 10-2), but does that
mean it’s the best marketing decision for your listing? That depends. When
you list an item in two categories, you must pay two listing fees. Depending
on the time, the season, the availability of your item, and how much you paid
for it, you probably don’t have the money to budget for paying double listing
fees (and double any options you use). In addition, most eBay buyers (busy
people that they are) use the search engine because they can find what
they’re looking for quickly. If they search for your item using the search
engine rather than by browsing the categories, listing the item in two cate-
gories is a needless expense.
You can change your category midauction, starting it in one category and
ending it in another, as long as your listing has no bids. And at the end of an
auction in which your item doesn’t sell, you can use the relisting feature to
run the auction again in another category.

You can

Chapter 10: Dollars and Sense: Budgeting and Marketing Your Sales

eBay’s Optional Listing Features
When you’re listing an item for sale, you’ll no doubt be presented with eBay’s
recommendations to improve your listing. This usually consists of recom-
mending that you add one of the options that (according to eBay’s research)
will improve your final selling price. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? But get-
ting carried away with these options is easy and can lead to spending all your
profits before you earn them.
In the eBay University classes, instructors quote auction success rates for
the various features, but in the real life of your business, success varies from
listing to listing and category to category. If you take the boldface option and
then your listing appears in a category full of boldface titles, the bold just
doesn’t have the punch you expected to get (and paid for). Your item would
stand out more without the bold option. It’s the same with highlighting.
Certain categories are loaded with sellers that go overboard in the use of this
feature — all the auction titles appear in a big lavender blur.
You need to weigh the pros and cons in terms of how these options affect
your eBay business. Will spending a little extra money enhance your item
enough to justify the cost? Will you be able to make the money back in prof-
its? You must have a good understanding of what the options are and when
and how you can use them to their fullest advantage.
For every item you put up for sale, you have to pay a minimum of two fees: an
insertion fee for listing the item and a final value fee. (I discuss these two fees
in the “eBay’s Cut of the Action” section, later in this chapter.) If you accept
credit card payments through PayPal, you must also pay a fee to the payment
service. Estimate your expenses from these basics before you consider
spending money for advertising.
When I get a new product, I put together a chart like the following to 
calculate my fees before I list the item. I run it through once or twice with 
my expected sales figures to get an idea of the costs for listing the item.
There is a free widget on the Web at http://www.sellathon.com/ebay_
calculator.html that can help you calculate your eBay fees.

Home-page Featured auctions
A new user going to visit eBay for the first time arrives at the eBay home
page, www.ebay.com. A Featured Items area appears in the middle of the
home page; below this area are links to six home-page Featured auctions.
When the user clicks the See All Featured Items link (see Figure 10-3), the
home-page Featured Items page appears (see Figure 10-4). Most of these
items are fixed-price listings that feature hundreds of items at a time. Many
also feature specialty items that list for tens of thousands of dollars.
If you want the opportunity to have your listing title link occupy this very spe-
cial piece of real estate, the home-page Featured auction option will set you
back $39.95 for a single item. If you have two or hundreds of widgets to sell,
it’ll cost $79.95. For big-ticket items, you’ve found the perfect location to draw
an audience that may easily earn back your $39.95. People who are new to
eBay come in through the front page; this is prime real estate. The six auctions

featured on the home page rotate randomly throughout the day. There’s no
guarantee that your item will be featured as one of the six home page links —
but it will appear in the home-page featured category linked from the home
page.
Another benefit of this option is that if someone searches your keywords or
browses through your category, auctions featured on the front page appear
at the top of the page (along with Featured Plus auctions, which I describe
next). But you must keep in mind how much you’re paying for this option.
Unless your auction will bring you more than several hundred dollars, this
feature probably isn’t worth the additional cost.
Featured Plus
Featured Plus is an option I’ve used with much success. When you choose
the Featured Plus option, your listing is listed at the top of the page when a
shopper searches for keywords or browses the category. Although your item
doesn’t appear on the eBay home page (see the preceding section), it will
appear at the top of your selected category home page (see Figure 10-5).
You get extra exposure for just $19.95, but you must still consider your auc-
tion budget. How much do you expect your item to sell for? Will the $19.95
expense benefit your auction enough to justify the expenditure? Be sure that
your item will bring you more than a few hundred dollars before choosing
this option.

Subtitle
You may use fifty-five characters for you item’s title. Title search is the de
facto, number-one way people search on eBay. From the statistics I’ve seen of
my own items, 90 percent of searches were made for title only, versus title
and description. But how can you make your item stand out when it shows
up with hundreds of other items that look the same? Use the subtitle option!
This can be a great marketing tool when you offer something special or have
a little more information to give those who are searching or browsing.
When your item has something special about it or could use some extra
punch, the subtitle option allows you more space to catch the eye of the
prospective buyer. Take a look at my example in Figure 10-6.
Highlight option
I was excited when eBay first announced the highlight option. I’m a big fan of
highlighting books, reports, and the like. Ever since college, I can’t read a
book without my trusty neon-yellow highlighter. Highlighting makes anything
stand out on a white page of text. This works on eBay, except eBay uses a
lavender-colored highlighter — ick!
Unfortunately, as with anything in life, less is more. If you choose to list your
auction in a category where all the sellers decide to use the highlight option,
the only listings that will stand out will be the ones without highlighting.

Chapter 10: Dollars and Sense: Budgeting and Marketing Your Sales

The highlight feature will set you back just $5. Does your budget allow for
that? To give your auction title a punch for a smaller amount of money, con-
sider the Border option.
Outline border
I like the outline border option. For only $3 your listing is outlined in a clean,
neat bold border that really draws the eyes! When looking at a page where a
listing is outlined with this option, the item immediately stands out. For $2
less than the highlight, I think it’s a much better way to go. It’s a low-price
option (when your item will sell for a couple of hundred dollars) that will
really pay back in page views — and, hopefully, in big bids.
Listing Designer
eBay comes up with options to fill the needs (or wants in this case) of users.
Sellers enjoy putting colorful graphics around their descriptions. It will also
help you design your description, placing pictures in different places on the
page. But if you have a good description (creatively done with HTML color
and emphasis) plus a good picture (inserted with the HTML code I gave you),
your item will draw bids just the same as if you spent $0.10 extra (per listing)
for the Listing Designer option.
If you want your descriptions surrounded by graphics, make sure the graph-
ics aren’t too intensive. Otherwise, the pages will load too slowly for dial-up
users. Also, take a look at eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies, a book I wrote
with eBay guru Patti Louise Ruby. It’s a comprehensive book that covers eBay
photography and HTML for listings. After you’ve set up your own templates
from the easy samples in the book, you’ll never have to lay out another
penny for more. In Chapter 9, I show you how you can buy reasonably priced
templates from savvy eBay graphics experts.
You can use a graphics template to “brand” your listings on eBay, giving them
a uniform look. If you want to use a template, decide on one and make it your
trademark.
Boldface option
The boldface option is probably the most used option in the eBay stable. An
auction title in boldface type stands out in a crowd, unless . . . you got it,
unless it’s in a category loaded with boldface auction titles. If the $1 that
eBay charges for this benefit is in your auction budget, odds are it will get
you a good deal more views than if you don’t use it.
192
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

To recap your title option costs, see the “Insertion (listing) fees” section later
in this chapter.
View counter
Counters have become a popular free option in the online world. Placed on
your listing in the Sell Your Item form, the numeric view counter ticks up
each time someone loads your page from eBay. This can add up to numbers
that impress bidders (convincing them they’re viewing a hot deal) or impress
other sellers to run out and sell the identical item at eBay.
193
Chapter 10: Dollars and Sense: Budgeting and Marketing Your Sales
eBay’s special combo deals
Any restaurant that serves up a menu of tempt-
ing treats will usually offer combo deals.
Surprise — so does eBay. They can be a great
way to save money while combining options:
Value Pack: I use the Value Pack all the time. It’s
only $0.65 and combines some of eBay’s best
features at a bargain-basement price:
 Gallery: You have to have a Gallery picture
to make your item stand out (regularly
$0.35).
 Subtitle: Give your item some extra selling
power with the extra information you put in
your subtitle (regularly $0.50).
 Listing Designer: This can be a little iffy.
Choose from one of the many colorful
graphics eBay has to offer if one appeals to
you. But you may have your own template,
or you may just not want to use one of the
kitschy graphics. That’s okay too. You don’t
have to use Listing Designer to get this deal;
just leave the Listing Designer box empty
when you get to that part on the Sell Your
Item form (regularly $0.10).
So, you actually get $0.95 worth of options for
$0.65. Even if you don’t use the Listing Designer,
you’re saving money.
Pro Pack: Whether the Pro Pack at $29.95 is a
good deal is a good question. You get several
big options here:
 Featured Plus!: I’m a big fan of this (it really
works), but it’s only $19.95 by itself.
 Gallery Featured: In this book, Gallery
Featured doesn’t even get its own heading
because I think it’s redundant. You get the
same push for your item by using Featured
Plus, but you get a slightly larger gallery pic-
ture and your link is laid out differently. I
doubt I’d ever use these two options
together; it’s an either/or proposition (regu-
larly $19.95).
 Border: Yep, a great option, but it only costs
$3.00 on its own.
 Highlight: $5.00 by itself; can be overkill
when combined with the Border option.
 Bold: Yep, a good option, but it’s regularly
$1.00.
Because you’re not an amateur (you know the
ropes of eBay), you don’t need to spend extra
for this package. You can simply put together
your own “pro” stand-out option package for
only $24.30 by using Featured Plus!, Border,
Bold, and a $0.35 gallery picture.

A counter is a terrific tool for marketing your auctions — sometimes. If you
have an auction with no bids and a counter that reads a high number, newbie
bidders may be dissuaded from taking a flyer and bidding on your auction.
Their thinking is, if that many people looked at this listing and didn’t bid,
something must be wrong with the item. They’ll tend to doubt their own
instincts as to what is and isn’t a good deal. In a situation such as this, how-
ever, what might be going on is that savvy bidders are just watching your
auction, waiting to bid at the last minute.
Also offered by eBay is a hidden counter that shields the numbers from the
eyes of casual lookie-loos. The figures are available only to you, after you sign
on to eBay and click the item in your My eBay page. The number of page
views appears at the top of the page.
Professional counters can be more sophisticated and can give you valuable
marketing data about your items. Smart counters offer a breakdown of visi-
tors hour by hour. Others can let you know where your customers have come
from and what keywords they used to find your item. The specialized type of
counter that I use is ViewTracker from Sellathon.com (see Figure 10-7 — more
information on how to get it is in Chapter 9). eBay offers you a free counter,
but it’s not a very smart one. By the way, readers of this book can get a thirty-
day free trial of ViewTracker by going to www.sellathon.com?af=0-186.
The gallery
Let me start by saying that a gallery picture is an absolute must for most list-
ings. eBay bills the gallery as its “miniature picture showcase,” and indeed it
is. By adding a gallery photo, a thumbnail image (96 x 96 pixels) of your item
appears next to your listing when the user browses the category view or
search results, which can reap you many benefits. When someone runs a
search, eBay defaults to showing all items, and that includes a gallery pre-
view, as shown in Figure 10-8.

Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

If you don’t use the gallery image, but still have a picture in your description,
your listing features only a sad little green camera icon in the gallery space
ina search. This makes choosing the 35¢ option a worthwhile expenditure. If
your item will sell for less than $10, however, I recommend that you recon-
sider the extra charge and simply rely on the lowly green camera icon to let
the folks know you have a picture in your description.
Nothing draws the eye better than the gallery photo next to a listing in a
search with hundreds of results. Which auction would you check out? The
one with the tiny camera icon, or the one with the crisp clear gallery picture
tempting you to open the listing? Pictures are the key to all quality advertis-
ing. Don’t miss an opportunity to add this extra little “billboard” to your 
listings.
eBay also offers to feature your gallery photo on the top of search and cate-
gory pages for $19.95. These photos run three across the top of the page
versus five across for regular gallery pictures. These featured gallery pictures
are also larger (140 x 140 pixels) than the regular gallery pictures.
When you take advantage of the gallery, be sure to crop your photo tight to
the subject. For more help with your images, see Chapter 11.
Buy It Now
The Buy It Now feature, shown in Figure 10-9, has many significant benefits. If
you have a target price for the item you’re listing, make that your Buy It Now
price. You can also use this option during frenzied holiday shopping times or
with very hot items. Try posting a slightly higher than normal price and per-
haps you’ll get a bite, er, sale.
Figure 10-8:

195
Chapter 10: Dollars and Sense: Budgeting and Marketing Your Sales

The Buy It Now feature disappears when someone bids on the item or, if
you’ve placed a reserve on the auction, when a bidder meets your reserve
price. You can’t use Buy It Now with a Multiple Item (or Dutch) auction.
To use this feature, you must have a feedback rating of at least 10, or be ID
verified. (ID Verify is eBay’s secondary form of identification, permitting you
to participate in the site without submitting a credit card. See Chapter 3 for
more info.)
Buy It Now adds costs to your listing on a graduated scale based on your sell-
ing price, as shown in Table 10-1. If your item will sell for a low price, remem-
ber my golden rule: Before paying for a feature, ask yourself whether it’s in
your listing budget.

eBay’s Cut of the Action
Becoming complacent and blithely ignoring your eBay costs as you list items
for sale is easy to do. As sellers, we easily can fall into the habit of listing and
relisting without reevaluating the profitability of our final sales. As a person
in business for yourself, you must always take into account outgoing costs as
well as incoming profits. The cost of your initial listing is just the beginning of
your advertising budget for that item; you have to factor in the cost of all the
options and features you use as well. Then, when the item sells, you pay eBay
an additional final value fee. (For fees regarding your eBay store, check out
Chapter 5.) In this section, I review the costs for listing an auction and for a
fixed-price listing on eBay.
The fees I detail here aren’t the end of your fees. If you use a credit card pay-
ment service like PayPal, they will also charge you a fee. In Chapter 13, I
examine the costs of the most popular credit card payment services.
Insertion (listing) fees
Your insertion fee is based on the highest dollar amount of two things: your
minimum opening bid or the dollar amount of your reserve price. If you start
your auction at $0.99 and have no reserve, the listing fee is $0.20. (By the
way, if you start your listing at $1.00, your fee is $0.40 — why double your
fees for just a penny more start price?) But if you start your auction at $0.99
and set an undisclosed reserve price of $50.00, your auction costs $4.40 to
post. When you place a reserve on your item, you’re charged an insertion fee
based on the amount of the reserve — plus the reserve auction charge.
The reserve auction charge is automatically refunded if the reserve price is
met and your item sells.
For a summary of eBay insertion fees, see Table 10-2. (The fees for eBay
Motors are in Chapter 2.)

Insertion Fee

If your item doesn’t sell, don’t think you can get your insertion fees back.
They are nonrefundable. You do have the option of relisting your unsuccess-
ful item without being charged a second listing fee, but only if your item sells
with the second listing. If it doesn’t sell the second time, the charge for the
second listing will stand. Writing a better title, starting with a lower opening
bid, or adding a snappier description will help in selling the item. Maybe you
should think about changing the category as well.
Whether you’re listing one item with a starting bid of $1000.00 or one hun-
dred items for $5.00 each in a Multiple Item (Dutch) auction, your insertion
cost per auction is never more than $4.80.
I recap the cost of the valuable eBay listing options in Table 10-3. Note that
eBay will no doubt come up with other tasty add-ons for your listings. One
that I’ll never figure out is their little blue gift box, which you can add to your
listing for $0.25. Who clicks something just because it has a gift box?

eBay final value fees
eBay’s version of the Hollywood back-end deal is the final value fee. Big stars
get a bonus when their movies do well at the box office; eBay gets a cut when
your auction sells. After your auction ends, eBay charges the final value fee
to your account in a matter of minutes.
An auction in the Real Estate category (Classified Ad) is not charged a final
value fee. Successful auctions in the eBay Motors category, however, are
charged a flat final value fee. (See Chapter 2 for information on fees in both
categories.)
Even a rocket scientist would have trouble figuring out exactly how much
eBay receives at the end of your auction. To help you calculate how much
you’ll owe eBay, see Table 10-4.

R
ule #1: A good photograph and a concisely written description should
be the goal for all your auctions. My years of advertising and marketing
experience have proven this to me repeatedly in almost every type of media.
If you’re trying to fetch the highest possible price for an item, keep your 
listings simple and professional: no dancing clowns (unless you’re selling
clowns), no overdone graphics, and no difficult-to-read typefaces. Less 
is more.
In this chapter, you find out how to write eye-catching descriptions and
improve the visual elements of your listings. Once you have some solid 
recommendations, you can make your own decisions regarding what you
want to do and how to best accomplish your goals.
Writing Winning Text
When you write descriptions for your listings, be sure that you describe your
items clearly and completely. Mention everything about the article; if the
item is used or damaged, be sure to describe the flaws. When you’re honest
up front, you’ll have a happy buyer. Remember to include your terms of sale
and specify the types of payment and credit cards you accept. Be sure to
include appropriate shipping charges, too. Following is a checklist of some 
of the things to mention:

 Size, style, color (garment measurements in inches are also valuable
because sizes aren’t universal across brands)
 Condition (new, new with tags, used, gently used, well-worn)
 Manufacturer’s name
 Year of manufacture (if vintage, it’s always good to mention an era 
at least)
 Fabric or material
 Any damage to the item
 Special features
 That you’ve stored it in a clean, dry place (if you have)
After you list all the facts, get excited and add a little showmanship in your
description. Think infomercial! Think Shopping Channel! Whoopee! These
people know how to make things sound so good that you feel that you must
have whatever item they’re selling. You can do the same, if you just get those
creative juices flowing. In Chapter 12, I give you some more pointers on how
to write the best descriptions possible.
Your eBay Photo Studio
Taking pictures? No problem! You have a digital camera, and you know how
to use it. Just snap away and upload that picture, right? Sorry, but no. There’s
a good way and a bad way to take photos for eBay and, believe it or not, the
professional way isn’t necessarily the most expensive way.
I recommend that you have a mini photo studio for taking your eBay pictures.
That way, you won’t have to clean off your kitchen counter every time you
want to take pictures.
If you must use the kitchen counter or a desktop, be sure to use a solid color,
inexpensive photo stage, which you can find on — where else — eBay.
Beware of following instructions in books about digital photography. In most
cases, their instructions are valid for pictures that you want to print. Online
images are a horse of a different color (oooh, did I really say that?). Be sure
you follow instructions that are written for Web images, such as in the steps
in my eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies.
You need several basic things in your photo studio; the extras you should
have are based on the type of merchandise you’re selling. An eBay generalist,
someone who will sell almost anything online — like me! — should have quite
202
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

a few extras for taking quality photos. Check out a portion of my home photo
studio in Figure 11-1. The setup packs up neatly into a bag when I’m not 
using it.
What you find in this section might be more than you thought you’d need to
take good pictures. But quality photographs will sell your merchandise, so
you need to take this technical part of your business seriously. Of course, if
you sell only one type of item, you won’t need such a varied selection, but
you should have the basic photo setup. Go into it slowly, spending only as
much as is prudent at the time. Also check my Web site (www.coolebay
tools.com) for more ideas.
For the best images of your item, be sure to zoom in on it. No one needs 
to see the background — they want to see the merchandise up close and 
personal. Also, when it comes to the background, be sure it is solid and
preferably a neutral color.
Digital camera
Digital cameras are mysterious things. You may read about mega pixels
(a million pixels) and think that more is supposed to be better, but that 
doesn’t apply to eBay applications or to Web images. Mega pixels measure
Figure 11-1:
My eBay
photo setup.
203
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

the image resolution that the camera is capable of recording. For online use,
all you need from a camera is 800 x 600 pixels (or at most 1024 x 600) because
the majority of computer screens are incapable of taking advantage of more
pixels. If you use a higher resolution picture, all you’ll do is produce a pixel-
bloated picture that can take a looooong time to load online.
You don’t need a million pixels, but you do need the following:
 Quality lens: I’m sure anyone who has worn glasses can tell the differ-
ence between good lenses and cheap ones. Really cheap cameras have
really cheap plastic lenses, and the quality of the resulting picture is
accordingly lousy. Your camera will be your workhorse, so be sure to
buy a well-known brand from a manufacturer known for making quality
products.
 Removable media: Taking the camera to your computer and using
cables and extra software to download pictures to your hard drive is
old-fashioned and annoying. Removable media eliminates this annoy-
ance. The most popular are Smart Media cards (wafer-thin cards),
Secure Digital (even tinier than Smart Media cards), Compact Flash
cards (in a plastic shell), and Sony Memory Sticks; all are no larger than
a matchbook. You insert one of these cards into your computer, if your
computer has a port for it, or you can get an adapter that connects to
your computer through a USB port. You can get an adapter on eBay for a
few dollars.
 Tripod and tripod mount: Have you ever had a camera hanging around
your neck while you’re trying to repackage some eBay merchandise that
you’ve just photographed, and the camera is banging into everything? 
Or perhaps you’ve set down the camera for a minute (in a safe place) and
then can’t find it? Avoid all this by using a tripod to hold your camera.
Tripods also help you avoid blurry pictures from shaking hands — and
when you’re shooting in macro mode, shaking comes with the territory.
To use a tripod, your camera needs to have a tripod mount, which is the
little screw hole that you see on the bottom of most cameras. In the 
following section, I give you some tips on finding the right tripod.
 Macro setting capability: If you’re ever going to photograph coins, jew-
elry, or small detailed items, you must have a macro setting on your
camera (usually symbolized by a little flower icon). This setting enables
you to get in really close to items while keeping them in focus.
 White balance setting: Without getting into a long-winded discussion of
measuring Kelvin and color rendering (I did this in another book), just
know that good cameras have a sensor that ensures that colors are rep-
resented faithfully. It can be an automatic function of the camera, or you
can select presets based on the type of light you are using: daylight,
tungsten bulb, fluorescent bulb, and so on.
204
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

 High optical zoom: When you’re shopping for a digital camera, you’ll
see optical zoom and digital zoom. Optical zoom enlarges the pictures
through traditional quality lenses. The digital version pseudo-enlarges
your images with a software interface within the camera. If you’ve ever
enlarged a low-resolution photo and found that it got grainy and out of
focus, you have an idea of what happens with digital zoom. The quality
just isn’t there.
 Autofocus: This option just makes life easier when you want to take 
pictures.
The bottom line here is to buy a brand-name camera. I use a Sony; a fancy
Cybershot DSC-H1 (with a 12x optical zoom with image stabilization to over-
come shaky hands — available on eBay for under $200), and an old, outdated
Mavica FD92 (with a 10x optical zoom — available for around $60). Although
the FD92 is pretty much an antique, it has all I need for eBay photos. They
both store images on a Sony Memory Stick, which I just pop out and insert in
either of my computers.
I bet you could find a camera that fits your needs right now on eBay for less
than $150. Remember that many digital camera users buy the newest camera
available and sell their older, lower-megapixel cameras on eBay for a pit-
tance. Don’t forget that many brick-and-mortar camera stores also sell used
equipment.
Other studio equipment
Certain endeavors seem to be open pits that you throw money into. I promise
that your eBay photo studio will not be one of these pits — now or later.
Tripod
A tripod is an extendable aluminum stand with three legs (get it? tripod?)
that holds your camera steady for shooting pictures. You should look for one
that has a quick release so that if you want to take the camera off the tripod
for a close-up, you don’t have to unscrew it from the base and then screw it
back on for the next picture.
The tripod can be a tabletop version or one with extendable legs. The legs
should extend to your desired height, should lock in place with clamp-type
locks, and should have a crank-style geared center column so that you can
raise your camera up and down for different shots. Most tripods also have a
panning head for shooting from different angles. You can purchase a tripod
from a camera store or on eBay for as low as $25.

Power supplies
If you’ve ever used digital cameras, you know that they can blast through bat-
teries faster than sugar through a five year old. A reliable power supply is a
must. You can accomplish this in a couple of ways:
 Rechargeable batteries: Many specialists on eBay sell rechargeable 
batteries and chargers. Pick up quality Ni-MH (nickel metal hydride) 
batteries because this kind, unlike Ni-Cad (nickel cadmium) batteries,
has no memory effect. That means you don’t have to totally use them up
before you put them back in the recharger.
 CR-V3 lithium ion batteries: This is a new kind of battery that takes the
place of two standard AA batteries. Lithium batteries are the longest
lasting and lightest batteries available, but they’re also expensive. Then
some smart guy figured out a way to put the equivalent of two batteries
into one unit; considerably cutting the price. The CR-V3 can average 650
photos before you have to change it. The CR-V3 is available also in a
rechargeable form, thereby extending its life even further (and reducing
your battery budget significantly). Some cameras can use them; some
cannot. Check out yours before making the purchase.
If your eBay photo studio includes a camera on a tripod (and it should), you
can use a good, old-fashioned AC adapter (you know, the one that plugs into
the wall). As long as you pay your electric bill, you’re going to have power to
your camera.
Lighting
Trying to take good pictures of your merchandise can be frustrating. If you
don’t have enough light and use the camera’s flash, the image might be
washed out. If you take the item outside, the sun might cast a shadow.
In the early (stone-age) days of eBay, I used my camera’s flash and had my
daughter shine a flashlight on the item as I took pictures from different angles —
all the while hoping that the color wasn’t wiped out. Also, the autofocus feature
on many digital cameras doesn’t work well in low light.
After consulting specialists in the photo business to solve the digital camera
lighting problem, I put together an inexpensive studio lighting set for online
auction photography. Please check my Web site (www.coolebaytools.com)
for information on how to obtain this package. It’s the same one I success-
fully use in my home photo studio (refer to Figure 11-1). Or if you prefer,
search eBay for studio lighting; I’m sure you’ll find a good deal.
To eliminate shadows, it’s best to have at least two lights, one for either side
of the item.
206
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Professional studio lights bulbs aren’t necessary. Although they do the trick,
professional lights are very expensive and short lived.
Cloud Dome
If you’re going to attempt to photograph jewelry, collectible coins, or other
metallic items, you’ll quickly become frustrated at the quality of your pic-
tures. (Touching up the pictures in PhotoShop is a time-wasting option.)
Metallic objects pick up random color from any kind of light (other than true
color) you shine on them for picture taking. Gold jewelry will also photo-
graph with a silver tone and silver will look goldish!
After much experimentation, I learned the secret of getting crisp, clear, close-
up pictures: Use a Cloud Dome. It stabilizes your camera (just as if you were
using a tripod) and filters out all unwanted color tones, resulting in image
colors that actually look like your item.
The Cloud Dome is a large plastic bowl on which you mount your camera.
You take pictures through a hole in the top of the dome. The translucent
white plastic diffuses the light so that your item is lit evenly from all sides,
eliminating glare and bad shadows. Check out the manufacturer’s Web site at
www.clouddome.com to see some amazing before and after pictures.
The Cloud Dome also manages to get the best images from gems. You can
actually capture the light in the facets! Pearls, too, will show their luster.
Several eBay members (including yours truly) sell the Cloud Dome; I highly
recommend it!
Cloud Cube Tent
Cloud Cube Tent is an ingenious product that replaces the traditional (and
expensive) photographer’s tent. Professional product photography requires
pictures with no glare, no harsh shadows, and no burnout of item details. The
Cloud Cube Tents are made of translucent white fabric that diffuses the light
and provides a perfect lighting condition for many objects. There are plenty
for sale on eBay, and most sellers include wrinkle-free backgrounds. The
Cubes are also combined in kits along with floodlights, as in my own photo
studio.
Props
To take good photos, you need some props. Although you may think it
strange that a line item in your accounting program will read “Props,” they do
qualify as a business expense. (Okay, you can put it under photography
expense; props just sounds so Hollywood!)
207
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

How often have you seen some clothing on eBay from a quality manufacturer,
but you just couldn’t bring yourself to bid more than $10 because it looked
like it had been dragged behind a car and then hung on a hanger over the
bathroom door to be photographed? Could you see how the fabric would
hang on a body? Of course not. Take a look at Figure 11-2; that dress looks
simply fantastic, darling!
Mannequin
I hate to even say it, but if you’re selling clothing, you’ll get higher prices for
your apparel if you photograph your items on a mannequin. If you don’t want
to dive right in and buy a mannequin, at least get a body form to wear the
outfit. Just search eBay for mannequin to find hundreds of mannequin forms
selling for less than $20. I’ve seen the quality store kind on eBay for a low as
$75. If you sell children’s clothing, get a child’s mannequin form as well. The
same goes for men’s clothes. If worse comes to worst, find a friend to model
the clothes. There’s just no excuse for hanger-displayed merchandise in your
auctions.
I got my mannequin (Midge) at a department store liquidation sale here in
Los Angeles. I paid $25 for her. She’s showing her age and her face paint is a
little creepy, so I often crop her head out of the photos. She has a great body
and everything she wears sells at a healthy profit. Many stores upgrade their
mannequins every few years. If you know people who work at a retail store,
Figure 11-2:

successes.
208
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

ask when they plan to sell their old mannequins; you may be able to pick one
up at a reasonable price.
Steamer
Clothing is usually desperately wrinkled when it comes out of a shipping box.
It may also get crumpled lying around, waiting for you to photograph it and
sell it on eBay. If the clothing isn’t new, but is clean, run it through your dryer
with Dryel (the home dry-cleaning product) to take out any musty smells and
loosen the wrinkles. There’s nothing like old, musty-smelling clothes to sour
a potentially happy customer.
The clothes you want to sell may be wrinkled, but ironing is a bear (and may
damage the fabric), so do what the retail professionals do: Use steamers to
take the wrinkles out of freshly unpacked clothing. Get the type of steamer
that you can use while the article of clothing is hanging up so you can just
run the steamer up and down and get the wrinkles out. The gold standard of
steamers is the Jiffy Steamer. It holds a large bottle of water (distilled only),
rolls on the floor, and steams from a hose wand. Some models sell on eBay
for under $100. Until you’re ready to make an investment that big, at least get
a small handheld version that removes wrinkles; search eBay for (garment,
clothes) steamer to find some deals.
Display stands, risers, and more
Argh. I just browsed the jewelry category and saw some horrendous pictures.
Many sellers use photos supplied from the manufacturer, and those are beau-
tiful, but the majority of sellers either didn’t zoom in on the piece or the
colors were off. Jewelry does not photograph well on most people’s hairy
hands (that’s why hand models make the big bucks). It looks a lot better
when you display it on a stand or a jewelry display, or flat on a velvet pad. If
you’re selling a necklace, why not display it on a necklace stand. I bought my
display stands from a manufacturer, but had to wait several months to
receive them. These days, the manufacturers and sellers have moved to eBay
with ready-made goods. Just search for ring stand, necklace display, and the
like.
Risers can be almost anything you use to prop up your item to make it more
attractive in a picture. Put riser pieces that aren’t attractive under the cloth
that you use as a background. (You can also find risers on eBay.)
You wouldn’t believe what the back of some professional photo setups look
like. Photographers and photo stylists think resourcefully when it comes to
making the merchandise look good — from the front of the picture, anyway!
Throughout my years of working with professional photographers, I’ve seen
the most creative things used to prop up items for photography:
209
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

 Small bottles of sand: Use small bottles (prescription bottles work well)
filled with very heavy sand to prop up small boxes and other items in a
picture. (A photographer I once worked with used little bottles of mer-
cury, which is a heavy liquid metal but is also a poison, so I don’t recom-
mend using it.)
 Beeswax, putty, and clay: To set up photos for catalogs, I’ve seen pho-
tographers prop up fine jewelry and collectible porcelain with beeswax
(the kind you can get from the orthodontist works great) or clay.
Beeswax is good because it’s also a neutral color and doesn’t usually
show up in the photo. However, you must dispose of beeswax often
because it gets filthy when it picks up dirt from your hands and fuzz
from fabric.
 Museum Putty and Quake Hold: These two products are invaluable
when you want to hold a small object at an unnatural angle for a photo-
graph. (They’re like beeswax and clay, but cleaner.) Neutral colored
Museum Putty works very well — be careful not to use the clear version,
because it’s often difficult to get off the item. I discovered them after
losing everything breakable in my home in the Northridge earthquake.
Museums use these clay-like products to securely keep breakables in
one place — even during an earthquake!
 un-du and Goo Gone: un-du is a clear liquid that will get sticky residue
off almost anything. If your item has sticker residue on it, it’s bound to
show up in the picture. Squirt on a little un-du and use its scraper to
remove the goo and bring back the shine. Goo Gone is another product
useful for cleaning items. The product comes in several forms including
a sticker lifter. Some sellers use lighter fluid when they can’t find un-du.
The problems of working with lighter fluid are obvious. I don’t recom-
mend it.
 Clamps and duct tape: These multipurpose items are used in many
photo shoots in some of the strangest places. Your mannequin may be a
few sizes too small for the dress you want to photograph. How do you
fix that? Don’t pad the mannequin; simply fold over the dress in the back
and clamp the excess material with a metal clamp (even a heavy-duty
plastic hair clamp), or use a small piece of duct tape in the back to hold
the fabric taut.
Keep a collection of risers and propping materials in your photo area so
they’re always close at hand.
Backgrounds for your images
Backgrounds come in many shapes and sizes. You can use paper, fabric, or
one of the portable photo stages for smallish items.
210
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

In professional photo-talk, seamless is a large roll of three-foot (and wider)
paper that comes in various colors and is suspended and draped behind the
model and over the floor. (Ever wonder why you never see the floor and wall
come together in professional photos?) Photographers also drape the seam-
less over tabletop shots for an infinity look. Some people use fabrics such as
muslin instead of seamless.
I keep several backgrounds on hand. (If you use velvet, be sure to clean it
with sticky tape before you use it in a picture — lint appears huge in pic-
tures.) I recommend using neutral fabrics, papers, or plastics, such as white,
light gray (18%), natural, dark blue, and black, so that the color of the fabric
doesn’t clash with or distract from your items.
The Cloud Dome people have also invented a cool photo stage. I like it
because it’s portable (easy to store), nonbreakable, simple to clean, and inex-
pensive. It’s sold on eBay and is pictured in Figure 11-3.
Taking Good Pictures
If you have a small photo studio setup (see the preceding section) with a
quality camera, a tripod, props, and lights, you’re well on your way to taking
some quality shots for your auctions. A few things to remember:
 Zoom in on your item: Don’t leave a bunch of extraneous distracting
background in your pictures. Crop any extra background in your photo-
editing program (see the “Image-Editing Software” section, a bit later 
in this chapter) before you upload the images to eBay or your image-
hosting site.
Figure 11-3:
Cloud
Dome’s

211
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

 Watch out for distracting backgrounds: If you don’t have a studio table-
top, or if the item is something that won’t fit on a table, try to make the
background of the photo as simple as possible. If you’re shooting the
picture outside, shoot away from chairs, tables, hoses — you get the
idea. If you’re shooting in your home, move the laundry basket out of
the picture.
One of my favorite eBay pictures featured a piece of fine silver taken by
the husband of the lady selling the piece on eBay. Silver and reflective
items are hard to photograph because they pick up everything in the
room in their reflection. (This is when you need the Cloud Cube Tent). In
her description, the lady explained that the man reflected in the silver
coffeepot was her husband and not part of the final deal. She handled it
with humor and her faux pas added to the listing!
 Be sure the items are clean: Cellophane on boxes can get nasty looking,
clothing can get linty, and all merchandise can get dirt smudges. Not
only will your items photograph better if they’re clean, they’ll sell 
better, too.
Clean plastic or cellophane with WD-40 (no kidding); it will take off any
sticker residue and icky smudges. Un-Du or Goo Gone StickerLifter are
the best adhesive removers for paper, cardboard, clothing, and more,
plus they come with a handy plastic scraper. I also keep a kneaded
rubber art eraser around to clean off small dirt smudges on paper items.
Any cleaning solution helps your items (even a little Method or 409), but
use these chemicals with care so that you don’t destroy your items
while cleaning them.
 Check the camera’s focus: Just because a camera has an autofocus fea-
ture doesn’t mean that pictures automatically come out crisp and clear.
Low light, high moisture, and other things can contribute to a blurred
image. Double-check the picture before you use it.
Using a Scanner
Scanners have come a long way in the past few years. A once expensive item
can now be purchased new for a little more than a hundred dollars. If you sell
books, autographs, stamps, or documents, a scanner may be all you need to
shoot your images for eBay.
When shopping for a scanner, don’t pay too much attention to the resolution.
As with digital cameras, images for the Internet (JPEGs) needn’t be any
higher than 96 ppi (pixels per inch). Almost any scanner can get that resolu-
tion these days. Quality makes a difference in the manufacture of the scanner,
so stick with brand names.
212
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

You should use a flatbed scanner, on which you lay out your items and scan
away. I replaced my old scanner with an HP all-in-one product that combines
a scanner, fax machine, copier, and printer in one handy little unit that saves
me lots of space in my office. I’ve seen HP flatbed units, new in the box, sell
on eBay (and even at Office Depot) for as low as $100.
There’s an eBay store that sells Hewlett Packard authorized closeouts and
refurbished items — cameras, scanners, and even computers for the lowest
prices I’ve ever seen. Search eBay Stores for HP Marketplace.
A few tips on scanning images for eBay:
 If you’re taking traditionally processed photographs and scanning them
on a scanner, have them printed on glossy paper because they’ll scan
much better than those with a matte finish.
 You can scan 3-D items, such as a doll, on your flatbed scanner and get
some respectable-looking images. To eliminate harsh shadows, lay a
black or white t-shirt over the doll or her box so that it completely
covers the glass. This way, you’ll have a clean background and you’ll get
good light reflection from the scanner’s light.
 If you want to scan an item that’s too big for your scanner’s glass, simply
scan the item in pieces, and then reassemble it to a single image in your
photo-editing program (see the following section).
 Boxed items are a natural for a flatbed scanner. Just set them on top of
the glass and scan away. You can crop the shadowed background with
your photo-editing software (see the following section).
Image-Editing Software
Lose the idea that the software that comes with your scanner is good enough.
It may be just fine for some uses, but the kind of control that you need is 
only available in real image-editing software, not in a mere e-mail picture 
generator.
Because I have a graphics background, I’ve always been happy using
Photoshop, but it’s a large and expensive program. It’s also overkill for
eBay images. Most of the time I use Fast Photos by Pixby Software, a small
but professional program at a fraction of the price of Photoshop, because it
has just the tools that eBay sellers need for Web images, no more and no less.
It’s also one of the easiest-to-learn programs on the market because it works
intuitively.
213
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

Fast Photos offers features that enable you to make a good picture out of a
bad one. It also has an awesome export-to-Web feature that compresses the
images so that they hold their quality while becoming smaller. Images com-
pressed in this fashion download a lot faster. You can also touch up your
family photos for Web albums in this easy-to-use (okay, very low learning
curve) program.
And don’t forget that you’ll be working with images not only for eBay items
but also for your Web site. (Check out Chapter 8 for more about putting
together a Web site.) You can go to the manufacturer’s Web site http://
www.pixby.com/marshacollier and download a twenty-one-day free trial
for my readers.
A Home for Your Images
You need a safe place to store your pictures for eBay. If your images don’t
appear when someone clicks your auction, or if your images take too long to
load, a user might click off your auction and go to the next one. If you have
more than one option, test each with a few pictures because you want one
that’s reliable.
eBay’s Picture Services are great for your initial and gallery pictures — and
they’re built directly into the Create Your Listing form. The only problem is
that eBay charges $.15 for each additional photo you post using their service.
By hosting your own pictures, you can insert additional images into your
description without paying a penny more.
When you add your own photos, you may have to use an FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) program to upload your pictures to a server. In the old days, this
meant buying a program or getting shareware software. Now, if you use the
free Firefox browser (I keep Firefox on my computer, right along with
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, and often switch back and forth), you get a
built-in FTP program. Firefox is stable and updated frequently, so there’s no
reason to fear installing it on your system. Just go to www.firefox.com for
your free download and more information.
When you use auction management software to build your listings, you may
not need an FTP program to upload your images. Most complete management
programs integrate their own FTP program as part of the package and may
also include image storage space on their server. Check out Chapter 9 for
more about auction management software packages.
214
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

You should always put your eBay images in a separate directory — not in an
active part of your e-commerce (if you have one) Web site. You may think
that using your business Web site is a good place to store your images, but it
isn’t. If you want to keep track of your site statistics, such as the number of
hits, hosting your own images may ruin the data. A call for one of your eBay
images counts as a hit on your site, and you’ll never get accurate Web site
stats.
Free ISP space
Most ISPs (Internet service providers) give you at least 5MB of storage space
for your personal home page. Although this space isn’t appropriate for your
final business site, it’s a perfect place to host your pictures. Everyone has an
ISP, and all ISPs give you space. You may have to use an FTP program to
upload to your Web space, or your ISP may supply its own uploader. Go to
the home pages for your ISP (the member area), and check out what it offers.
Visit Chapter 8 for more information on ISP space.
If you use AOL software (which is free these days), you have a built-in Web
service. AOL would like you to build an AOL Hometown page, but here’s what
to do instead: Go to the top of the AOL page frame and type AOL Hometown
in the browser area. Then click the link to set up a blank Hometown page.
Then (again in the browser address line) type My FTP. The window that
opens, AOL My FTP Space, is the place where you can upload your photos 
for eBay.
From there you can upload all your files, up to a maximum of 20MB per
screen name. (20MB is more than enough for your eBay images — and your
personal Hometown page pictures.) Remember which photos are stored in
each screen name FTP space because the URL locator address for each
screen name is different.
To get the AOL browser, free e-mail addresses, and the FTP area, go to
free.aol.com/downloadaol.
Auction management sites
If you’re using one of the auction management Web sites that I discuss in
Chapter 9, you’re covered for most of your back office tasks. These Web sites
supply enough Web space to hold all your eBay images. They also have a 
convenient one-click upload from your hard drive.
215
Chapter 11: Setting Up Listings That Sell

If you find that you truly have no place to host your images, take a look at
some of the less expensive auction management sites. As of this writing, you
can get image hosting and other auction utilities for around $10 a month at
the following: AAASeller.com, AuctionHawk.com, Inkfrog.com, and
Auctiva.com (Auctiva is free of charge).
eBay Picture Services
You can also use eBay Picture Services to host your photos for eBay, but the
quality of your photos is better if you host them directly from a site. eBay
recommends that the image you upload be 1024 x 768 pixels. Then eBay
reformats your photo to fit in a layout 400 pixels wide by 300 pixels tall and
then compresses the file for quick viewing. This process can destroy the
quality of your carefully photographed images if you haven’t saved them in a
compatible size. You’re running a business, so be businesslike and use the
method that presents your photos in their best light.
To get the free top-of-page image that you see on many listings, you must use
eBay Picture Services. I suggest that you use eBay for your primary image
and also use secondary images of your items hosted elsewhere. If one of the
picture servers goes down, at least your listing will have pictures. The first
picture is free; all you have to do is click the Add Pictures box on the Create
Your Listing page. This picture will also be the default picture for use as your
all-important gallery image. (See Chapter 10 for more on using the gallery.)
eBay offers two versions of Picture Services. The basic version (see Fig-
ure 11-4) allows you to upload eBay-ready images as they appear on your
computer. Click the Browse button to find pictures stored on your hard drive
or media card.

If you want to rotate or crop the picture, you need to use the enhanced 
picture service. When you click the Add Picture link, a screen similar to
Figure 11-5 appears. From there you can select Basic or Enhanced or a place
to input the Web link to your image.
To upload your pictures using the enhanced version, after clicking Add
Pictures on the Create Your Listing page, you get a new window. Follow these
steps:
1. Click the Enhanced tab, which appears at the top of the window.
2. Click Add Pictures in the first box.
A browsing window appears.
3. Locate the directory that holds your eBay images on your computer.
4. Click the image in the browsing window.
The image name appears in the filename box.
5. Click the Open box.
The selected image appears in the picture frame.
6. To rotate the image, click the circular arrow (at the upper-left of the
main image box).
7. To crop the image to remove unnecessary background:

a. Click the crop box in the right corner of the larger image.
Two squares appear at opposite corners of your main image.
b. Click the frame on the outside of your image, and move the bar
until the offensive area is cropped out. You can do this from all
sides of the picture.
Sometimes Picture Services will shrink your image to a too-small size,
but you can’t do much about it. Just be sure to reload the image anytime
you relist the item; otherwise, the gallery image may just get smaller and
smaller. eBay continues to improve Picture Services, so don’t give up on
it. Use it for the free image, and be sure to upload secondary images
from an outside site.
8. To correct your image, do one of the following:
• You can automatically change the brightness, darkness, and 
contrast by clicking the AutoFix button. I don’t recommend that
you do that unless your picture is already a good one.
• Try the Advanced Edit button next to AutoFix. In the Advance Edit
area (see Figure 11-6) you can manually correct your image and see
the results as you go.
9. After you’re happy with the results, click Save and the image appears
as the default on the Create Your Listing page.
All store sellers receive 1MB of storage free through eBay’s Picture Manager
to host their store logo and store layout pictures, but that’s enough to hold
quite a few of your item’s images as well.

HTML and You
My small grasp of HTML gets me only so far. I usually use a shareware pro-
gram to produce code for my Web site or eBay listings. Luckily, you don’t
have to know a lot of code to produce eBay auctions.
The Create Your Listing form has an excellent, basic HTML generator that 
has a toolbar similar to the one in a word processor. As you can see in Fig-
ure 11-7, you can use the toolbar to change the size, font, or color of the text.
You can also insert code by switching from the Standard design view to the
HTML view of the description area to include your own hosted images in the
listing description. (Check out Chapter 9 for some sample code to use to add
images to your listings.)
For a quick and easy HTML fix, go to my Web site at www.coolebaytools.
com. Then go to the Tools area and click Cool Free Ad Tool. You’ll get a quick
HTML generator; feel free to use it as often as you like. There’s no charge. 
You can select border colors and include an image in your description area.
Nothing fancy, mind you, just nice clean HTML. You type your information as
indicated, and select colors, as shown in Figure 11-8.
When you’re finished, click the View Ad button. On the next page, you’ll see
HTML code for your auction description that you can cut and paste into the

Providing Excellent
Customer Service
In This Chapter
 Making a good first impression
 Writing the perfect e-mail
e
Bay’s supposed to be truckloads of fun! But if you’re making money, you’re
in business. When you’re in business, you must always deal with a few
boring and un-fun details. First and foremost, you must remember that your
customers are number one. Businesses become successful by providing fantas-
tic customer service and selling quality merchandise. The image that you pro-
ject through your e-mails and listings identifies you to the bidders as a good
guy or a bad guy. No kidding. Your e-mails should be polite and professional.
You shouldn’t make prospective customers feel like you’re hustling them,
sneaking in hidden fees, or being pushy with overbearing rules for bidding.
You don’t have to have the most beautiful listings on eBay to succeed. You
need products that people want, and you need to take the time to build good
customer relations. In this chapter, I cover some ways to let your customers
know that they’re number one in your book: from writing effective auction
descriptions to sending cordial e-mails.
Meeting Your Customers
eBay is a person-to-person marketplace. Although many sellers are busi-
nesses (like you), the perception is that sellers on eBay are individuals earn-
ing a living (versus big business). The homespun personal approach goes a
long way to being successful when selling on eBay. One of the reasons many
buyers come to eBay is that they want to support individuals who have the
gumption to start their own small enterprise on the site.

After you’ve written a brilliant title for your auction (not IN ALL CAPITAL LET-
TERS please), prospective buyers click your listing and scroll down to your
description. Do they have to dodge through pointless verbiage, losing inter-
est in your item along the way? Or do you get right down to business and
state the facts about what you’re selling?
Here are a few things to remember when writing your auction description
(see Chapter 11 for more tips for your listings):
 Write a factual description. Do you carefully describe the item, stating
every fact you know about it? Are you clear in your description and
careful not to use any jargon? Finally, does it answer almost any ques-
tion a potential buyer might ask? If not, do some revising.
 Include some friendly banter. You want to make the customer feel com-
fortable shopping with you. Don’t be afraid to let your personality shine
through!
222
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 
Telling your story
Being honest and forthright encourages cus-
tomers to consider your offerings on eBay. Also,
if you go the extra mile and give some bonus
information, the customer will feel more at ease.
An excellent example comes from an eBay
Motors seller, e.vehicles’ John Rickmon. He
throws in a few special touches to draw in the
customer.
When you shop eBay Motors, a prospective
buyer has the option of ordering a vehicle history
report from the car’s listing page. This costs the
buyer $7.99 just to view the report. John orders a
CarFax report himself and puts a link to a PDF
version of it right into his auction descriptions.
Saving the prospective buyer $7.99 doesn’t seem
like much, but its one of those simple touches
that sets a customer at ease.
John also posts his business philosophy at the
end of his auctions. Here’s part of it:
“My dealership is entirely focused on the
sales of vehicles via the eBay format. I
make all purchasing and sales decisions
and am 100% responsible for the content of
my auctions, including all text and photog-
raphy. I personally answer every email and
conduct all business regarding the sale of
this vehicle.
I buy and list approximately 5-10 units per
month; I look at hundreds of vehicles each
week that do not make the cut . . .
This is my living. I do this full time. I do not
have a “car lot.” EBay has been my dealer-
ship for years and all operations are
focused towards bringing you the best
vehicle possible at the best price you will
find. I am committed to this format and take
your vehicle purchase very seriously. You
are dealing with a secure seller.”
Wow, don’t you just want to buy a car from
this guy?

 Update your About Me page. The small me icon that appears next to
eBay usernames is an invitation to click. When viewers click the icon,
they see a page that’s all about you! Let people know who they’re deal-
ing with. When deciding between two people selling the same item and
when all else is equal, buyers will place their bid with the seller who
makes them feel secure. (Visit Chapter 3 for info on how to set up your
About Me page.)
 Limit the number of auction rules (or terms of sale). Some sellers
include a list of rules that’s longer than the item’s description. Nothing
will turn off a prospective buyer more than paragraph after paragraph
of rules and regulations. If you really must put in a litany of rules, use
the following bit of HTML to make the size of the text smaller: <font
size=-1>.
 Choose a reasonable typeface size. Many users are still looking at eBay
on an 800 x 600 display. If you design your auctions at 1024 x 768, your
typefaces may be way too large for the average user. Forcing a user to
scroll and scroll to find the details only leads to frustrated customers.
 Quote a flat shipping amount. Many bidders pass up auctions that don’t
disclose shipping charges. Make use of eBay’s shipping calculator to
give your customers a fair shake at the shipping costs. But if many other
sellers offer the same item, flat rates stand out in a search, and the
lowest rate may help you reel in an undecided buyer.
It’s just plain bad taste to overcharge on shipping (and a violation of
eBay’s rules — you can be suspended for it). eBay buyers expect that
you’ll add up to a couple of dollars for handling costs, but adding more
than that can make you look like you’re trying to squeeze every penny
out of your bidder . . . not a good feeling when you’re on the other end!
 Keep photos a practical size. Some users still connect with a dial-up
connection, and if they have to wait for your large pictures to load, they
may go elsewhere. If your listing doesn’t fully open within a few seconds,
the person will simply back out and go on to another listing.
Communicating with Your Customers
Perhaps English class wasn’t your favorite, but when it comes to being a pro-
fessional, incorporating good grammar, proper spelling, and punctuation in
your communications portray you as a pro. Before writing this book, even I
hooked up with some grammar and punctuation sites to brush up on my writ-
ing skills. (Okay, I also have brilliant editors covering up my transgressions.)
223
Chapter 12: Providing Excellent Customer Service

Throughout the rest of this section, I provide some examples of effective
seller e-mails. Don’t forget your good manners when writing, but don’t be too
formal — remain personable and polite.
The initial inquiry
The first written communication you may have with a prospective buyer is an
inquiry e-mail. Buyers can ask you a question about your item by clicking the
Ask Seller a Question link on the listing page, which automatically generates
an e-mail addressed to you. Often these questions are brief.
At least 50 percent of the inquiries that I send to a seller don’t get a response —
guaranteeing that I won’t be buying that product. Often, when I do get a
response, it’s a terse, brusquely written note. Many people choose not to use
punctuation or capitalization in their e-mails. How professional looking is that?
Not very. Sellers who take the time to write a short, considerate reply that
includes a greeting and a thank you for writing will get my money.
To respond, use the Respond link by the listing in your my eBay Selling area
or go directly to your My eBay Messages page. This way, you won’t get
sucked into responding to a spammer who’s impersonating an eBay e-mail
224

Helping your buyers buy safely
When selling items of high value, you can
attract new customers by bonding your eBay
sales. Surety bonding has been used for about
5000 years to guarantee business transactions
between buyers and sellers who don’t know
each other. It may be new to you and me, but
lots of people know about it, and when some-
one looks at your listing and sees that the trans-
action is covered up to $25,000, they may be
more likely to bid higher or pay more. BuySAFE
is a service that bonds select sellers through
various insurance companies. Shoppers like
seeing a warranty; when they see a BuySAFE
seal on your listings, they know they will get just
what they want.
BuySAFE will bond your transactions on eBay
or on your own Web site. To be eligible for the
BuySAFE seal, you must pass a rigorous check,
which proves to BuySAFE that you’re a solid
seller. After you get your seal and bond your
transactions, you are charged 1 percent of your
final selling price for the bonding. You don’t have
to bond all your listings. After you’ve been
approved, you can bond just the ones you think
will need the boost. I’ve found that the seal
easily boosts the bids on my listings by 1 per-
cent, so it works for me. For more details and an
introductory offer for readers of this book,
check out their site at www.buysafe.com/
coolebaytools.

just to confirm that your e-mail address is live. That said, respond quickly,
clearly, and politely — and with a sales pitch. Remind the soon-to-be buyer
that you can package several items in one box to save on shipping costs. And
by all means, use this opportunity to point out other listings you have that
may also interest the writer. That’s customer service.
Your note can be brief and straightforward. For example, I wrote the follow-
ing note in response to a question regarding the condition of the Christmas
tree in one of my auctions:
Hello,
Yes, the aluminum Christmas tree in my auction is in excellent condition. The 58
branches are full and lush and will look great for the holidays. Please write
again if you have any more questions or concerns.
Don’t forget to check my other auctions for a color wheel and a revolving tree
stand. They would look great with this tree, and I can combine your wins so you
can save on shipping.
Thank you for writing,
Marsha

Isn’t that nice? The note addresses the question in a respectful and person-
able manner. Writing a note like this doesn’t take long. You should be doing it.
Also, putting your Web site or eBay store URL in your signature is a great way
to get new customers to view your Web site or blog.
The winner’s notification letter
Have you ever received a bulk-generated, boilerplate winner’s confirmation
letter? The seller hasn’t bothered to fill in half the blanks, and you’re almost
insulted just by reading it? Receiving a note like this after you’ve requested
that the seller combine purchases (and the letter pays no attention to your
request) is especially annoying. E-mails can cross, but a personal approach
goes a long way with customers.
I’m not saying you shouldn’t automate your eBay business. I’m merely sug-
gesting — strongly recommending — that you take the time to personalize
even your canned e-mail responses. I admit that since I have my account set

up to automatically send out invoices when someone purchases something, I
do send out an automated e-mail. The following letter is just to let the cus-
tomer know that there’s a real person behind the automation:
Good news! You won eBay item #120089481873 Cloud Dome Photo Stage Studio.
Thank you for winning my eBay item. Buyers tend to go unrecognized on eBay a
little too often, so I want you to know that your purchase is very much appreci-
ated. If I can be of any assistance to you, please let me know. While this first
e-mail is being generated automatically, I do welcome one-on-one contact with
you. Just send a reply to this mail and I’ll answer your inquiries directly.
I am serious about my business and look forward to the opportunity to serve
you. I’d also like to invite you to check out my other items available on eBay.

The payment reminder
Writing a payment reminder can get sticky. You don’t want to aggravate the
buyer, but time is wasting and you could spend this time reposting your item.
When writing a payment reminder, you need to be firm but pleasant. Real
things can happen in people’s lives. Family members get sick, and people just
plain forget. Perhaps your payment fell between the seats of the winner’s car
on the way to the post office. (That’s the excuse I use when I forget to mail a
payment — feel free to use it yourself.)
When you honestly forget to send a payment, nothing is more humiliating than
someone debasing you through e-mail. So remember that people do make mis-
takes, and check the winner’s feedback before you send the letter. If you can
garner from the feedback that this winner has a habit of not following through
on bids, you can definitely be a bit firmer in your wording. Always set a clear
deadline for receiving payment, as shown in the following letter:
Hello,
You won an auction of mine on eBay last week for the Emilio Pucci book. Your
payment was due yesterday and it still has not arrived. Perhaps sending pay-
ment has slipped your mind considering your busy schedule. I know it can easily
happen.
227
Chapter 12: Providing Excellent Customer Service

Please e-mail back within 48 hours and let me know whether you want to go
through with our transaction. I’d like to put the item back up for sale if you don’t
want it.
Thank you for your bid,
Marsha Collier
How firm you choose to get with a nonpaying bidder is up to you. I’ve dealt
with a few nonpaying bidders on eBay, but I’ve left only two negative feed-
backs. Some people who tend to overbid are indeed violating the contract to
buy, but legitimate reasons might explain why someone hasn’t followed
through on an auction. You must decide which method to take and how far
you want to stretch your karma (what goes around comes around). Assess
each case individually, and don’t be hasty in leaving negative feedback until
you know the whole story.
The payment received and shipping notice
I know that you probably aren’t going to send out a payment received letter
for every transaction, but it would surely be nice if you did. Staying in con-
stant communication with your buyers will make them feel more secure with
you and with buying on eBay. You want them to come back, don’t you?
228
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 
Leaving feedback for buyers
After you leave feedback, you can’t rephrase or
change an erroneous evaluation of another
user. I know that it’s easier to leave feedback
once payment is received, but waiting to see
how the transaction evolves afterwards is pru-
dent — especially if the package gets lost in the
mail, turning a previously kind and sweet buyer
into an insane screaming nutcase. Same thing if
the item is damaged. You should evaluate a
buyer based on more than whether the person
pays for an item. (Buyers are supposed to do
that — it’s a contract, remember?) When leav-
ing feedback for buyers, consider the following:
 Did they return your communications
quickly?
 Did they pay in a timely manner?
 If a problem occurred with the item or in
shipping, did they handle it in a decent
manner or did they try to make your life a
living hell?
Remember that sellers are judged on communi-
cation, shipping time, the quality of packaging,
and friendliness. As a seller, you have the duty
of leaving quality feedback based on set guide-
lines that all sellers use to rate buyers.

When you receive payment and have shipped the item, sending a short note
helps to instill loyalty in your customer. I always send out the automatic
e-mail from UPS or FedEx announcing the shipment tracking number. You can
additionally have PayPal send out an e-mail by inserting the tracking number
into the PayPal payment record. Because PayPal e-mails aren’t very personal-
ized, I follow up with my own, more personal, note:
Subject: SHIPPED: eBay item: eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies
Hi (insert buyer’s name)!
Thank you for buying my New 2006 eBay Listings That Sell For Dummies and
paying so promptly! I’m looking forward to a smooth transaction — and positive
feedback for both of us.
If you paid through PayPal, please check your PayPal account because I have
posted your package’s delivery confirmation number in our transaction record.
Please note that if you purchased shipping insurance, you will not see the insur-
ance reflected on the package. I insure my packages with a private insurance
policy from U-Pic. (More information is on my Web site.)
If there is any question when the package arrives, PLEASE e-mail me immedi-
ately. Your satisfaction is my goal, and I’m sure any problem can be easily taken
care of. Please let me know when the package arrives so that we can exchange
some very positive feedback!
Marsha Collier
www.coolebaytools.com
Good customer service will get you many repeat customers and lots of posi-
tive feedback. Good communication will head off problems before they start.
If your customers have received communications from you during the entire
transaction, they’ll be more likely to discuss a glitch with you rather than
make a knee-jerk reaction and leave negative feedback.

Working Your PayPal Account
and Collecting Your Money
In This Chapter
 Finding the payment method that suits your needs
 Discovering the ins and outs of payment services
 Exploring merchant accounts
T
he hours spent selecting your items, photographing them, touching up
the pictures, and writing brilliant auction copy all come down to one
thing: getting paid. At first thought, you might be happy to take any form of
negotiable paper, bonds, and stocks (okay, not so much dotcom stock). As
you become more experienced and collect for more auctions, however, you’ll
decide which payment methods you prefer and which are more heartache
than they’re worth.
Receiving and processing payments take time and patience. The more pay-
ment methods that you accept, the more methods you have to keep track of.
Throughout this chapter, I detail some various payment options (including
how to handle payments from international buyers) and how each affects
your business.
It Doesn’t Get Any Simpler:
Money Orders
I begin my discussion of payments with money orders and cashier’s checks
because I think they’re the greatest way to receive payment. Money orders and
cashier’s checks are fast, cheap, and negotiable (just like cash). Cashier’s
checks are purchased at a bank and are generally debited immediately from
the winner’s checking account at purchase. For some unknown reason, banks
take it upon themselves to charge a minimum of $5.00 to issue a cashier’s

check. This is a pretty steep charge to the buyer, which is why I suggest money
orders. Money orders are available almost anywhere. In my neighborhood, the
stores I called charge from $0.50 to $1.29 for a money order up to $500.00.
There has been a spate of forged and counterfeit money orders. Beware of all
money orders and delay shipping until the money order has cleared. If you
have a U.S. post office money order, cash it at the post office. Postal counter
workers will be able to identify counterfeit money orders immediately. Never
accept a money order for more than the total price of the order, where the
buyer asks for a refund for the excess amount tendered. A request like this
should set off warning bells.
If you want to accept money orders, you should familiarize yourself with the
various charges so that you can recommend to your auction winners the ser-
vice with the most reasonable cost. Saving your customers money (especially
when it’s not going to you) is a sign of good customer service. Asking buyers to
pay a large additional fee is unfair — unless the buyers are international. In that
case, the best way for them to pay you is by money order through an issuer
such as American Express (which has offices in most countries). International
buyers deal in the currency of their own countries; when they purchase a
money order and send it in dollars, you’re paid with cash in good old American
greenbacks.
7-Eleven (and other convenience stores)
There are more than twenty-one thousand 7-Eleven stores in the world. I’ll
bet there’s one within driving distance of your house. For your customer, the
best part about 7-Eleven is that each has an ATM to draw cash from credit
cards with which to purchase a money order. At around $1, money orders
from 7-Eleven are a bargain! If you don’t know where the closest 7-Eleven is,
go to www.7-eleven.com/storelocator/PrxInput.aspx.
You can also buy money orders from several other convenience store chains,
such as Circle K, Dairy Mart, and AM/PM.
United States Postal Service
Most sellers love USPS money orders, which have all the benefits of a regular
money order — plus, because the post office issues these money orders, the
nice clerks at the post office will graciously cash them for you with proper
identification. Postal money orders are safe, too, and acceptable everywhere.
The post office goes to great pains to ensure authenticity by including a
Benjamin Franklin watermark, a metal security thread, and a double imprint
of the dollar amount on the money order. (No more fears that you’ve received
a color copy of a money order.)
232
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Both domestic and international (for sending U.S. dollars to foreign countries)
money orders are available at post offices in amounts up to $1000 ($700 inter-
nationally). For a trace of a lost or stolen money order, buyers must present
the receipt. For a small fee, buyers can also get a copy of a paid money order
(as long as they have the receipt) for as long as two years after the date it has
been paid.
Many sellers bring their money orders to the post office when they ship their
packages and cash them for their petty cash fund — or to pay for outgoing
postage.
Western Union
Western Union is the most popular money order seller, probably because it was
the first or maybe because it promotes better than anyone else. Depending on
the purchase location, they accept cash (duh), Visa, MasterCard, and Discover
payments from your buyers (both in the United States and internationally).
To purchase a money order, go to the Western Union Web site, www.
westernunion.com/info/osMoneyOrder.asp, and click the Find a
Location link. Type in your ZIP code and you’ll get a list (including phone
numbers) of the various locations that sell money orders in your area. Give
a few a call and find where you can get the best deal — different vendors
charge different rates.
Pay Me When You Get This:
Cash on Delivery
I can’t say enough to discourage you from using C.O.D. as a payment method.
But I’m gonna try! You give your package to the post office, UPS, or FedEx,
which collects the payment after delivering the package. Sound straightfor-
ward and easy? What happens when the carrier tries to deliver the package
and the recipient isn’t home? Your items can sit for a week or two, during
which time buyers may decide that they don’t want to pick up the items
from the shipper. If you’re lucky, you’ll get your items back in two to three
weeks. Not only that, but it’s also expensive. In addition to postage, the post
office charges from $5.10 to $16.60 for C.O.D. services (based on the amount
collected).
Another bad part of C.O.D.? You might wait a month to receive payment, even
when the addressee is home the first time and accepts delivery. Do yourself
a favor and don’t offer it as a payment option. You’re only asking for trouble.
You’re not a bank, and you’re not in the finance business. Get your money up
front.
233
Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

The Check’s in the Mail: Personal Checks
Personal checks are the easiest way for buyers to make payments. They can
just dash off a check, put it in the mail, and bam, you’re paid. But it’s not
always as easy for the seller. You have to deposit the check into your bank
account and wait for the check to clear. Believe it or not, in these days of
electronic transfers, wiring funds, and international money transfers, you
might wait more than two weeks for a check to clear.
Paper checks
After you deposit a check, your bank sends it to a central clearinghouse, which
then sends it to the signatory’s bank clearinghouse. Then the individual bank
decides whether the check can be paid. You may think that a way around the
system is to call the bank and see whether the account currently has sufficient
money in it. The account may have sufficient funds when you call, but the
depositor can withdraw money before the check gets through the system —
and then the check bounces. And don’t forget the 24-hour turnaround rule:
Even if the bank has the money and you’re standing there with the check, the
bank can deny payment within 24 hours, leaving you with a bad check.
Even though everything seems to be electronic these days, the paper routing
of old-fashioned checks can take two weeks or longer. I’ve received only one
bad check as an eBay payment. I deposited the check, waited ten business
days, and then shipped the item. On the eleventh business day, the bank sent
me the bounced check. The buyer clearly knew that the check had bounced
but didn’t notify me. Luckily the buyer made good on the check.
234
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 
Accepting cash payments
I’m sure you’ve received cash from some of your
winners. I don’t like cash. If the buyer doesn’t
send the exact amount due, you have to call the
buyer, who may claim that the correct amount
should be there. All of a sudden, you must have
lost the difference — and you have no recourse
with cash. Mail can be stolen, too. We had a rash
of mail thievery where I live; people were steal-
ing envelopes right out of mailboxes. 
Postal inspectors are constantly battling this
problem, but you won’t know your mail is being
stolen until you’ve missed enough mail — usu-
ally bills and outgoing checks. Explaining to a
buyer that the money never arrived is difficult.
The thief has the cash while your reputation may
be shot. You can e-mail, phone, and talk and dis-
cuss, but the bottom line is that you haven’t
received your money and they insist you have it.

If you find yourself with a check that’s bouncing higher than a superball and
an uncooperative buyer, remember that it’s against the law to pass bad
checks. To see a list of penalties, state by state, visit the National Check
Fraud Center at the following address:
www.ckfraud.org/penalties.html
In many states, if a resident passes a bad check, you are legally able to collect
three times the amount of the bad check!
Bottom line? I warn all my winners who pay with a personal check that I may
hold the item for more than two weeks before I ship. I make exceptions for
buyers who have an excellent feedback rating or who I’ve successfully done
business with before. Dealing with personal checks isn’t worth the potential
grief they can cause. Try to get an e-check or an instant transfer through
PayPal (see the following section), or have your winners pay with credit cards
through a payment service. For more on payment services, see the “I Take
Plastic: Credit Cards” section, later in this chapter.
Bank debits (e-checks and 
instant transfers)
Despite the attached fees and a short waiting period, accepting a PayPal 
e-check or an instant transfer is a nice, clean transaction because it’s
immediate cash in your account. After indicating that they want to pay
with an e-check, buyers must register their bank account with PayPal and
give them the information required, as shown in Figure 13-1
Figure 13-1:
The bank
information
required to
register
your
account
with PayPal.
235
Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

When a buyer pays with an electronic check, it will take as many as four days
to clear. An instant transfer (on the other hand) credits your account immedi-
ately as long as the buyer has a credit card (or bank debit card) as a backup
funding source — should your instant transfer fail. PayPal allows you to
accept e-checks for up to $10,000 and will charge you the standard fees.
Hold This for Me: Escrow Service
Escrow.com (eBay’s official escrow service) makes it more comfortable for a
buyer to proceed with transactions of more than $500. By using escrow, buyers
gain peace of mind because they know the transaction will be completed
securely and easily. See Figure 13-2.
Another way to assure your buyer when participating in high-dollar transac-
tions is to run a bonded auction. This type of service costs you far less time
and money than an escrow service.
When you want to offer escrow as a payment option in one of your sales, be
sure to indicate that you’re willing to accept an escrow payment in the
description area of the listing page. Be sure to clearly describe the terms. Are
you willing to pay all the fees? Does the buyer pay fees?
Figure 13-2:

Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

After you have a winning buyer, either you or the buyer should sign on to
Escrow.com and create a transaction. If they are not a registered member of
the site, they must register with Escrow.com. Registration is free.
To proceed with escrow, the buyer must send payment to Escrow.com.
Escrow.com accepts all credit cards (including American Express and
Discover), cashier’s checks, money orders, wire transfers, and personal or
business checks. A check is subject to a ten-day delay.
After the buyer makes the payment, Escrow.com asks the seller to ship the
item to the buyer. When the buyer receives the merchandise, the inspection
period begins promptly at 12:01 a.m. the next weekday and continues for a
time previously set by the buyer and seller.
The buyer notifies Escrow.com that the merchandise is approved, and then
Escrow.com releases payment to the seller. If the buyer doesn’t feel that the
merchandise is what he or she ordered, the buyer must return the item to the
seller in its original condition, adhering to the Escrow.com shipping require-
ments. The buyer also must log on to the Web site to input return shipping
information.
In the event of a return, the seller has the same inspection period to ensure
that the item was returned in its original condition. After that is confirmed,
Escrow.com will refund the buyer (less the escrow fee and, if agreed on ahead
of time, the shipping fee). Either the buyer or the seller can pay the escrow
fee; the two can even split the cost. But you need to decide who will pay the
fee up front and indicate this in your auction listing. The buyer is responsible
for paying the escrow fee for all returns, no matter who had initially agreed to
pay the fees.
In Table 13-1, I include a listing of current escrow fees. (Credit cards or PayPal
payments are not accepted for payments of more than $5000.)

Sadly, escrow service has become one of the most highly publicized scams
on the Internet. Unscrupulous sellers set up fake escrow sites, sell a bunch of
high-dollar items on eBay to unsuspecting buyers, and then direct the buyers
to the faux escrow Web site to set up their escrow. The buyers send their
money (thinking the transaction is safe). After the fraudulent seller collects a
bunch of money, he or she shuts down the Web site and absconds with the
money! Many buyers are gun-shy of using escrow to pay for expensive items.
Consider bonding your transactions to lure higher bids and confer a guaran-
tee to the buyer.
If you’re selling a vehicle, offering escrow can greatly enhance the activity of
your sale. Escrow.com has a couple of useful services to encourage buyers
and sellers to use their services:
 Inspection service: Following standard inspection procedures, trained
inspection personnel go to the seller to inspect the vehicle and electron-
ically record all information on handheld devices right in the field.
Cost: $125.
 Title transfer: A real pain for those who buy vehicles online is getting
the title transferred through their Department of Motor Vehicles.
Vehicles sold within the fifty contiguous states can have their titles
officially transferred and recorded for only $95.
Vehicle transactions come under a different fee schedule than regular mer-
chandise. I’ve listed the fees in Table 13-2.

I Take Plastic: Credit Cards
As people become more comfortable with using credit cards on the Internet,
credit cards become more popular for eBay payments. Plus, major credit
card payment services have insured eBay payments to registered users,
making credit cards safe for the buyer and easy for you. Credit card transac-
tions are instantaneous; you don’t have to wait for a piece of paper to travel
cross-country.
For all this instantaneous money transfer, however, you pay a price. Whether
you have your own merchant account (a credit card acceptance account in
the name of your business) or take credit cards through a payment service
(more on this in a minute), you pay a fee. Your fees can range from 2 to 7 per-
cent, depending on how you plan to accept cards and which ones you accept.
Unfortunately, many states have made it illegal to charge a credit card sur-
charge to make up this difference. You have to write off the expense of
accepting credit cards as part of your business budget in the COGS (Cost of
Good Sold, see Chapter 16 for an explanation).
The fees that brick-and-mortar stores pay for accepting credit cards are
much less than those paid by online, mail, or phone orders. In most promo-
tional material, the vendor usually quotes the “swiped card” rates. Because
you won’t have the buyer’s card in hand to swipe, be sure to inquire with
your provider for the proper rate before signing any papers.
I have to explain the downside of accepting credit cards for your online sales.
To protect yourself, please be sure to check the bidders’ feedback — both
feedback they’ve received and feedback they’ve left — before accepting any
form of credit card payment for a high-ticket item. Some buyers are chronic
complainers and are rarely pleased with their purchases. They may not be
satisfied with your item after it ships. In that case, they can simply call their
credit card company and get credit for the payment; you’ll be charged back
(your account will be debited) the amount of the sale. (See the “Forget the
buyer: Seller beware!” sidebar in this chapter.) PayPal protects sellers to an
extent and is a safer way to accept credit cards for your sales.
Credit card payment services
Person-to-person payment systems, such as eBay’s PayPal and BidPay, allow
buyers to authorize payments from their credit cards or checking accounts
directly to the seller. These services make money by charging percentages
and fees for each transaction. It all happens electronically through an auto-
mated clearinghouse — no fuss, no muss. The payment service releases to the
239
Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

seller only the buyer’s shipping information; all personal credit card informa-
tion is kept private. This speeds up the time it takes the buyer to get merchan-
dise because sellers are free to ship as soon as the service lets them know
that the buyer has made payment and the payment has been processed.
From the seller’s point of view, person-to-person payment service transaction
fees are lower than the 2.5 to 3.5 percent (per transaction) that traditional
credit card companies charge for merchant accounts. (Get the details in the
“Your very own merchant account” section, coming up.) Even traditional
retailers may switch their online business to these services to save money. In
this section, I discuss the top payment services and how each works.
240
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 
Forget the buyer: Seller beware!
When buyers dispute a sale, they can simply
call PayPal or their credit card company and
refuse to pay for the item. You lose the sale and
possibly won’t be able to retrieve your mer-
chandise. A payment service or merchant
account will then chargeback your account
without contacting you and without negotiating.
Technically, the buyer has made the purchase
from the payment service — not from you —
and the payment service won’t defend you. I’ve
heard of chargebacks occurring as long as six
months after the transaction, although eBay
says they can occur no later than two months
after they sent you the first bill on which the
transaction or error appeared. No one is forc-
ing the buyer to ship the merchandise back to
you. Just like eBay Fraud Protection (see
Chapter 3), the credit card companies skew the
rules to defend the consumer. As the seller, you
have to fend for yourself. See Chapter 4 on how
to report fraudulent buyers. You usually have no
way to verify that the shipping address is the
one the credit card bills to. So, to add to your
problems, the card may actually be stolen.
PayPal confirms through AVS (Address
Verification Service) that the buyer’s credit card
billing address matches the shipping address
and gives you the option to not accept payments
from buyers whose addresses don’t match.
PayPal offers seller protection against spurious
chargebacks under the following circumstances:
 Fraudulent card use
 False claims of nondelivery
See the section on PayPal for more details on
how to be covered by seller protection.
If the issuing bank resolves a chargeback in the
buyer’s favor, PayPal charges you $10 if you’re
determined to be at fault, but will waive the fee
if you meet all the requirements of the PayPal
Seller Protection policy.
Here’s some good news: Major credit card com-
panies are trying to curb online fraud for their
merchant accounts. Visa has the new Verified
by Visa acceptance, which takes buyers to a
Visa screen (through software installed on the
merchant’s server) and verifies their identity
through a Visa-only password. MasterCard
uses SET (Secure Electronic Transactions), a
similar encrypted, transaction-verification
scheme. These systems are expected to sub-
stantially reduce fraud and chargebacks.

Before you decide which credit card payment service to use, get out your cal-
culator and check their Web sites for current rates. Calculate your own esti-
mates; don’t rely on a site’s advertised samples. I’ve found that the charts on
the Web tend to leave out certain minor fees. I’ve also found that comparison
charts quoting the competition’s prices tend to include optional fees. Do your
own math.
When you pay the fee to your payment service, realize that the total amount
of your transaction — including shipping fees, handling charges, and any
sales tax that you charge — incurs a fee. The payment service charges a per-
centage based on the total dollar amount that’s run through its system.
BidPay
A respected name in the online payment provider service is BidPay, a divi-
sion of CyberSource. BidPay was launched in 1999 and was one of the original
payment options for online auctions offering money order payments. They
perform a service similar to PayPal, accepting credit and debit cards
(MasterCard and Visa). Isn’t it nice to have an alternative? BidPay is easy to
use and is an eBay Certified provider.
Once you join BidPay, you can indicate that you’d like their banners to
appear in your listings, giving your buyer the opportunity to have an option
to pay through a service other than PayPal.
To register with BidPay.com so that you can begin to accept them as a pay-
ment method for your sales, go to www.bidpay.com. Click Sign Up Now and
provide some basic information. After BidPay.com processes your applica-
tion, you will receive a confirmation.
BidPay is free for the buyer to use, but they will charge you, the seller, a
transaction fee. Every payment you receive through BidPay is subject to a
$0.50 transaction fee plus a percentage of the total amount sent. Their ser-
vice is highly competitive with traditional merchant account fees. The
charges for BidPay transactions are shown in Table 13-3.

PayPal
PayPal is the largest of the online person-to-person payment services.
Thankfully, eBay had the presence of mind to acquire this previously inde-
pendent service in 2002, so it has now become the de facto standard for
paying for items bought on eBay.
PayPal (see Figure 13-3) allows buyers to safely click and pay with a credit
card, instant transfer, or e-check directly from eBay after they’ve won an auc-
tion or made a purchase. PayPal conveniently integrates into all eBay trans-
actions. If your auction uses the Buy It Now feature or is a fixed-price listing,
you can require buyers to pay for their purchases immediately with PayPal
payments.
242
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 
Selling internationally through PayPal
PayPal operates in 190 markets and manages more than 133 million accounts. PayPal currently allows
users to send, receive, and hold funds in sixteen currencies: Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Czech
koruna, Danish krone, euro, Hong Kong dollar, Hungarian forint, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar,
Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, pounds sterling, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc, and
U.S. dollar. PayPal operates locally in thirteen countries, and payments from international buyers are
automatically converted to your desired currency.
There is a conversion fee for accepting foreign currencies from your buyers and having them con-
verted to U.S. dollars. Because PayPal is not a currency dealer, they must purchase foreign curren-
cies from a bank. PayPal receives a wholesale rate (twice a day) and adds an additional 2.5 percent
above this rate to determine their retail foreign exchange rate. This 2.5 percent is added to PayPal
fees as shown in the table.

Residents in forty-eight new markets can now use PayPal in their local markets to send money
online. These new markets include Indonesia, the Philippines, Croatia, Fiji, Vietnam, and Jordan. A
complete list can be viewed at www.paypal.com/worldwide.
Warning! It is against policy for you to charge your buyers additional funds to cover this expense.

To accept credit card payments, you must have a premier or business
account. Buyers may join when they win their first auction and want to pay
with PayPal, or they can go to www.PayPal.com and sign up. The story’s
slightly different for the seller. You need to set up your PayPal account before
you choose to accept it in your auctions or sales.
Here are more than a few particulars about PayPal accounts:
 Auction payments are deposited into your PayPal account. Choose one
of several ways to get your money:
• Have the money transferred directly into your registered checking
account.
• Receive payment by check (PayPal charges $1.50 for the check).
• Keep the money in your PayPal account for making payments to
other sellers.
• Withdraw the cash from an ATM with a PayPal debit card and get
back 1.5 percent of the money spent on purchases.
• Shop online with a virtual credit card that carries your balance to
any Web site that accepts MasterCard.
 PayPal has its own feedback system (actually called a reputation
number). The number after a username reflects the number of unique
PayPal Verified users with whom this user has conducted business.
Buyers will see a link to your Member Information box on the Send
Money Confirmation page. The higher the reputation number, the more
likely the user is experienced and trustworthy. Clicking the number pro-
duces a report, like the one shown in Figure 13-4, giving information on
the seller.
Figure 13-3:
The
PayPal.com
home page.
243
Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

 As a seller with a premier or business account, you can choose to accept
or deny a payment without a confirmed address. A confirmed address
means that the ship-to address indicated by the buyer is the same as the
billing address on the credit card the buyer chose to register with
PayPal. On the Accept or Deny page, information about the buyer is
shown, including verification status, account creation date, and partici-
pation number (same as your reputation number).
 PayPal assesses your account $10 for any chargeback. The fee is waived
if you’ve fulfilled the requirements in the PayPal Seller Protection policy
(see the next bullet). To specify whether you want to accept a credit
card payment from a buyer without a confirmed address, log on, go to
your account, and then click the Profile tab. Next, scroll down Selling
Preferences and click Payment Receiving Preferences. If you accept pay-
ment from a nonconfirmed address, that transaction will not be covered
by the PayPal Seller Protection policy.
 The PayPal Seller Protection policy provides up to $5000 in annual
chargeback protection, unauthorized card use, and nonshipments. To
qualify for this protection, you must do the following:
• Be a verified member of PayPal with a premier or business
account: Allow PayPal to confirm with your bank that your check-
ing account and address are your own.
Figure 13-4:
My PayPal
Member
Information
box.
244
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

• Ship only to a confirmed address: PayPal confirms that the
buyer’s ship-to address coincides with the address to which the
credit company sends monthly bills. Fraudulent shoppers often
ask you to ship to another address — don’t do it.
• Keep proof of shipping that can be tracked online: Here’s where
those delivery confirmation things come in handy. See Chapter 14
to find out how you can get them for free. For transactions greater
than $250, you must get a signed proof of delivery from the shipper.
• Ship tangible goods: PayPal doesn’t cover goods that are transmit-
ted electronically.
• Accept only single payments from a single account: Don’t let a
buyer try to pay portions of a purchase from different e-mail
addresses. Someone who’s trying to pay using several accounts
may be attempting to defraud you.
• The transaction must be between U.S., U.K., or Canadian buyers
and sellers: Seller protection isn’t extended to other international
shipments.
Other requirements change from time to time. Check PayPal’s help area for
updates. But know that if a transaction is eligible, Seller Protection Policy
Eligible will appear on the individual Transaction Details page.
If you have a personal PayPal account, you may still be able to accept credit
card payments, but you will have to pay a hefty fee. You’ll pay 4.9 percent of
the total amount collected, plus the standard $0.30 transaction fee. Seller’s
fee tiers for business and premier accounts are adjusted based on the prior
month’s transaction volume. Look at Table 13-4 for the updated PayPal fee
tiers.

Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

To receive the lower rates from PayPal, you must apply for merchant rate
pricing. Once your sales go over $3000 a month, you must log into your
PayPal account and apply. If you can’t find the link, call PayPal sales at
866-836-1648. If your sales dip below the minimum tier of $3000, you do not
need to reapply.
A brilliant feature of PayPal is the ability to download your sales and deposit
history to your computer. Although PayPal also offers files that integrate with
QuickBooks (for more on QuickBooks, see Chapter 16), the standard down-
loads are rich in features. Rather than importing just sales figures, you see
each and every detail of your transaction — dates, names, addresses, phone
numbers, amounts, and more. Even fees and taxes (if you charge sales tax)
are broken down separately, making bookkeeping a breeze. The download
imports into Microsoft Works and Excel.
Downloading your history will help you calculate income taxes and sales
taxes, reconcile your accounts, predict sales trends, calculate total revenues,
and perform other financial reporting tasks. It will also give you an excellent
customer database. The deposits download gives you detailed information
for all the deposits that you receive: payments, PayPal transaction and
deposit fees, refunds, rebates, and any adjustments made to your account.
Follow these steps to download your sales and deposit histories:
1. On your PayPal Main Overview page, click the History tab.
2. Click the Download My History link, on the left side of the page.
3. Enter the time span and the file format for the information that you
want to view.
4. Click the Download History button.
The information appears on the screen. Or if the servers are busy, you’ll
receive an e-mail (usually in a minute or two) when the reports are ready.
5. Save the file in a directory that you can conveniently access for
bookkeeping.
You can just double-click the file to open it in Excel or Microsoft Works. You
now have all the information you could possibly need to apply to your book-
keeping program.
Registering with PayPal
If you aren’t registered with PayPal yet (what’s holding you up?), use the con-
venient Selling link on the All Selling page, which you reach from your My
eBay page. To get more information, just click the PayPal link to arrive at the
PayPal overview page (see Figure 13-5), and then click the Sign Up for a
PayPal Account button to begin registration, as shown in Figure 13-6.
246
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

The convenience of PayPal integration into the eBay site shines when your
item is purchased. Winners just click a Pay Now button that pops up on your
auction page immediately after the listing closes. When you list auctions,
you pre-set the shipping and handling charges that appear in the shipping
box at the bottom of the page. When winners click the Pay Now button (see
Figure 13-7), they’re taken directly to a payment page set up with your infor-
mation. The process is as easy as purchasing something through Buy It Now.

Chapter 13: Working Your PayPal Account and Collecting Your Money

When a purchase is made and the payment is deposited in your PayPal
account, the system holds the money until you choose how you want to
withdraw it.
Because credit card and identity theft is so prevalent on the Internet — and
an expensive burden to e-commerce — PayPal uses the extra security mea-
sure provided by Visa and MasterCard called CVV2. Most credit cards have
three (or four) additional numbers listed on the back, immediately following
the regular 16-digit number. Merchants use these numbers for security or ver-
ification but aren’t allowed to store them, so they’re presumably protected
from hackers. However, in the unlikely event your credit card doesn’t have
these numbers yet, PayPal still allows you to use your card by verifying it
through a procedure known as random charge. PayPal charges a few cents or
so to your card and asks you to disclose the pin number printed on your
statement. Then PayPal knows that you control the card and didn’t steal it.
Withdraw your funds from the PayPal account on a regular basis; you need
that money to operate your business. Don’t let it become a temporary sav-
ings account — unless you choose the PayPal interest-bearing account
(check out www.PayPal.com for details). Also, any money you have in your
account can be extricated for a chargeback — and chargebacks can be
applied as many as 60 days after the transaction. For more about charge-
backs, see the “Forget the buyer: Seller beware!” sidebar, in this chapter.
Your very own merchant account
If your eBay business is bringing in more than $20,000 a month, a credit card
merchant account may be for you. At that level of sales, discounts kick in and
your credit card processing becomes a savings to your business rather than
an expense. Before setting up a merchant account, however, I recommend
that you look at the costs carefully. I get at least one e-mail each week beg-
ging me to set up a merchant account, and each one offers lower fees than
the last. But charges buried in the small print make fees hard to calculate and
even harder to compare. Even those who advertise low fees often don’t
deliver. Be sure to look at the entire picture before you sign a contract.
The best place to begin looking for a merchant account may be your own
bank, where they know you, your credit history, and your business reputa-
tion and have a stake in the success of your business. If your credit isn’t up
to snuff, I recommend building good credit before pursuing a merchant
account because your credit rating is your feedback to the offline world.
If your bank doesn’t offer merchant accounts for Internet-based businesses,
find a broker to evaluate your credit history and hook you up with a bank
that fits your needs and business style (or join Costco as a last resort; see the
following section). These brokers make their money from your application
fee, from a finder’s fee from the bank that you finally choose, or both.
248
Part III: Business is Business — Time to Get Serious 

After you get a bank, you’ll be connected to a processor, or transaction clear-
inghouse. Your bank merely handles the banking; the clearinghouse is on the
other end of your Internet connection when you’re processing transactions,
checking whether the credit card you’re taking is valid and not stolen or
maxed out.
The next step is setting up your gateway, the software (ICVerify or
PCAuthorize, for example) with which you transmit charges to the clearing-
house. Some gateways use HTML Web sites and take the transactions directly
on Web-based forms (Cybercash or VeriFone, among others). Web-based gate-
ways connect your Web forms to real-time credit card processing.
In Table 13-5, I highlight various possible costs associated with setting up and
maintaining a merchant account.

Payment services that eBay won’t allow
To maintain a safe marketplace, eBay likes to
check out and approve the many new payment
methods that crop up on the Internet from time
to time. They like to be sure that the service
offers substantial financial, privacy, and
antifraud protection for buyers and sellers,
amongst other requirements.
Before you add a new payment method (other
than checks, money orders, or PayPal), go to the
Help area and search accepted payments. You
can also go directly to http://pages.
ebay.com/help/policies/accepted-
payments-policy.html. Although this
policy may seem limiting to sellers, keep in mind
that we are selling on eBay’s site. If we choose
not to follow the rules, we can go elsewhere.
Assuming you want to continue selling on eBay,
I’d stay away from the following payment ser-
vices that can get your listings ended (or get you
suspended) for offering them: AlertPay.com,

Remember that some merchant accounts will charge you some of these fees
and others may have a bunch of little snipes at your wallet. In the following
list, I define some of the fees in Table 13-5:
 Setup fee: A one-time cost that you pay to either your bank or to your
broker.
 Discount rate: A percentage of the transaction amount (a discount from
your earnings), taken off the top along with the transaction fee before
the money is deposited into your account.
 Transaction fee: A fee per transaction that’s paid to the bank or to your
gateway for the network.
 Gateway or processing fee: Your fee for processing credit cards in real
time that’s paid to the Internet gateway.
 Application fee: A one-time fee that goes to the broker or perhaps to the
bank.
 Monthly minimum processing fee: If your bank’s cut of your purchases
doesn’t add up to this amount, the bank takes it anyway. For example, if
your bank charges a minimum monthly fee of $20 and you don’t hit $20
in fees because your sales aren’t high enough, the bank charges you the
difference.
If you’re comfortable with all the information in the preceding list and in
Table 13-5, and you’re looking for a broker, heed my advice and carefully read
everything a broker offers. Be sure you aren’t missing any hidden costs.

PayPal’s Virtual Terminal
If you want your own merchant account and want all the benefits of PayPal,
you can apply for their solution: Virtual Terminal. With Virtual Terminal you
can accept credit card payments by phone, fax, or mail. All this for only an
additional $20 a month over your regular PayPal fees. No extras and no
equipment to buy or rent. What a deal! Just log into your PayPal business
account online at www.paypal.com/vt and fill in the Virtual Terminal form.
You can also apply for the terminal through that link. You must have a
Business account to use the Virtual Terminal feature.
Virtual Terminal fees are the same as PayPal merchant tiers and are based on
the total amount of money you put through PayPal per month — including
regular PayPal payments. The buyer’s credit card charge will appear on their
bill with the name of your business.
Costco member’s credit card processing
Here’s some true discount credit card processing: a one-stop merchant
account and gateway! You can not only buy tuna fish in bulk with a Costco
membership, but also obtain a reasonably priced way to handle a merchant
account (check out Table 13-6) through the NOVA Network. Costco got
together with Nova Information Systems, one of the nation’s largest proces-
sors of credit card transactions, to offer Costco Executive members a dis-
counted Internet credit card processing service. Costco Executive
membership brings the cost of a Costco membership up from $45 to $100,
but you get the benefit of receiving 2 percent back for most purchases (not
including tobacco, gas, food, and some other purchases).

I
think the most satisfying part of an eBay transaction is making the sale and
receiving payment. After that comes the tedious process of fulfilling your
orders. You shouldn’t feel bad if this is the point that makes you take pause
and sigh. Order fulfillment is one of the biggest challenges (and yuckiest
chores) that face any mail order or online entrepreneur. The onerous task of
packing and mailing is the bane of almost all businesses.
But as an eBay businessperson, you must attend to these tasks, however much
you’d rather not. So in Chapter 17, I detail what you need for packing (boxes,
bubble pack, and so on) and some options for purchasing online postage. And
in this chapter, I explain just how your items will get to their destinations,
exploring your shipping options, costs, and insurance coverage along the way.
Finding the Perfect Shipping Carrier:
The Big Four
When you’re looking at your shipping options, you need to first determine
what types of packages you’ll generally be sending (small packages that
weigh less than 2 pounds or large and bulky packages), and then decide how
you’ll package your items. Planning this before listing the item is a good idea.

Deciding on your carrier can be the most important decision in your eBay
business. You need to decide which one is more convenient for you (close to
your home base, provides pickup service, gives better customer service) and
which is the most economical (leverages your bottom line). The efficiency of
your shipping is only as good as the people who service your account. If the
UPS man dumps packages at your door without ringing the bell, perhaps he’s
not the right person to entrust with the heart and soul of your business.
Maybe your letter carrier knows you by name and gives you good service;
if that’s the case, maybe the United States Postal Service (USPS) is the best
choice for the bulk of your shipments. Many eBay sellers send packages
using ground services rather than airmail or overnight, but a shipper who
can give you both options may be offering you a good deal because you don’t
have to deal with more than one vendor.
Settling on one main shipper to handle your shipments is important because
you’ll be able to have the bulk of your records on one statement or in one
area. You might also need a secondary shipper (most sellers do) for special
types of packages. One shipper can’t be everything to every business, so
having an account with more than one can be to your advantage. Also, ship-
pers may not sign up new accounts as readily in the middle of a strike or
work slowdown.
In this section, I give you the lowdown on the four major carriers — DHL,
FedEx, UPS, and the USPS — so you can see who fits your requirements. For a
summary of shipping costs from these four, see Table 14-1. Note that FedEx and
UPS include tracking numbers for delivery confirmation. The USPS charges
extra; delivery confirmation is $0.65 for Priority mail and $0.75 for Parcel Post.
For info on eliminating this fee for Priority mail, check out Chapter 17.

You can now prepare UPS or USPS shipping documents online through PayPal
and on Web sites for the other carriers. See Chapter 17 for the ins and outs
(and pros and cons) of shipping through PayPal.
When you start shipping a few dozen packages a week, you might want to
check out eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies, by yours truly, for an 
in-depth analysis of the big four and their variable shipping rates.
DHL@Home
Once considered the outsider in the shipping arena for eBay sellers, DHL has
come up with a class of service that makes sense dollarwise. Most sellers
consider DHL as the guy for big companies and their very big time logistical
needs, but this is no longer the case.
The company was founded in 1969 in San Francisco by Adrian Dalsey,
Larry Hillblom, and Robert Lynn (see the DHL?) and is now owned by the
German Deutsche Post.
DHL partnered with the U.S. Postal Service to create a service for shipments
to residences as part of the DHL/USPS. Drop off your parcels at a DHL loca-
tion, and the trackable package is delivered by the local post office, including
delivery to P.O. boxes.
You can sign up for an account and print your labels online at www.dhl-
usa.com.

Chapter 14: Shipping Your Items: Sending Them Fast and Saving Money
Shipping the really big stuff!
When it comes to shipping heavy or big stuff, you
have a few options. Because I like using FedEx,
I generally check FedEx Freight first. A friend of
mine once purchased four large heavy-equip-
ment tires on eBay, and there was no way he
could go with a regular carrier. We called FedEx
Freight and told the seller to place the tires on a
pallet and secure them. FedEx Freight picked
them up at their location in one shipment.
Shipping costs were reasonable, but the only
caveat was that the shipment had to be delivered
to a place of business, not a residential location.
This is easy to overcome, especially if you have
a friend with a retail store or a gym you go to.
A Web site called www.freightquote.com
negotiates rates with several major freight for-
warders and will give you a free quote on your
large shipment right on their Web site. Before
attempting to sell a heavy item, you can sign onto
their home page and enter the weight and
dimensions of your shipment, and they’ll give you
a free quote on the spot.

DHL has many benefits to the shipper, here are a few:
 Each shipment is covered for $100.00 in declared value. Additional insur-
ance is $0.35 per $100.00 or a fraction thereof.
 Residential deliveries are limited to 70-pound packages.
 Daily pickup service adds an additional charge to your account.
 Dropping off packages at DHL counters incurs no additional charge.
 DHL@Home delivers Monday through Saturday through the USPS.
Federal Express
Federal Express (FedEx) is world famous for its reliable service. It’s the
number-one choice for all major companies who “Absolutely, positively have
to get it there on time.” FedEx also has a reputation for some of the highest
costs in the business — but only to the untrained eye. FedEx acquired
Roadway Package Service (RPS) and formed FedEx Ground, which has a
separate division called FedEx Home Delivery that delivers to residences.
For the services they provide, you’ll be happy to pay what you do. Read on.
FedEx Ground and Home Delivery
When FedEx’s residential ground delivery service began, their slogan was
“The neighborhood-friendly service that fits the way we live, work, and shop
today.” Although I rarely get warm fuzzies from my package deliveries, this
slogan brought meaning to the philosophy behind their service: to bring pro-
fessional shipping to your home residence. FedEx Home Delivery offers low
rates and a high-quality service. They’re the only shipper that offers a money-
back guarantee on home service. They deliver until 8 p.m. and on Saturdays
but not on Monday.
To open an account, visit the FedEx Home Delivery Web site and sign up for
an account at www.fedex.com/us/services/us/homedelivery. Even if
you have a current Federal Express account, you need to sign on to add the
Ground service (which includes Home Delivery). Registering for Ground ser-
vice is even easier than registering on eBay, so give it a shot.
I opened my FedEx Home Delivery account through a link on the main FedEx
home page, and got the skinny on how to use the service. The online calcula-
tor allows you to choose the option of Home Delivery, so you don’t even have
to look up alternative rates and charts. And just as other shippers do, FedEx
Home Delivery gives you a service schedule to let you know how long it will
take your package to arrive at its destination.
256
Part III: Business Is Business — Time to Get Serious 

Here are a few fast facts about FedEx Ground services:
 You print your own labels and barcodes for your packages and track
them online.
 FedEx Home Delivery works on a zone system based on your ZIP code
and how far the package is going. Refer to the FedEx Home Delivery zone
chart or get the cost online through the online calculator.
 Each shipment is covered for $100.00 in declared value.
 Residential deliveries are limited to 70-pound packages.
 Daily pickup service adds an additional weekly charge to your account.
 Dropping off packages at Federal Express counters incurs no additional
charge.
 FedEx Home Delivery delivers Tuesday through Saturday till 8 p.m.
within one to five business days.
If FedEx Ground shipping charges seem to be a great deal, they are! But you
can get an even better deal if you charge your FedEx shipping to an American
Express Business card (one that gives you access to the American Express
Open Network). You save an additional 5% on all FedEx shipments when you
use online shipping and place your orders online. If you have the Amex card,
be sure it is officially linked so you get the discount.
FedEx Online
FedEx has one of the most intuitive online applications for shipping. The FedEx
Ship Manager interface will turn your computer into a one-person shipping
shop. You can generate labels for all forms of FedEx in one place. The site
allows you to search for rate quotes and track packages, and it includes a ship-
ping notification option to send tracking information e-mails to your recipients.
Larger businesses can get the Ship Manager workstation, complete with a PC
and printer. The workstation has the unique ability to choose from other car-
riers. Aside from FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, you can also access UPS
shipping services, which allow you to rate, track, report, and ship for multi-
ple carriers on one system.
United Parcel Service
Everyone’s familiar with the big brown trucks that tool around town deliver-
ing packages hither and yon. Those trucks belong to the United Parcel
Service, or UPS, whose home page is shown in Figure 14-1.
257
Chapter 14: Shipping Your Items: Sending Them Fast and Saving Money

UPS offers three levels of service based on your shipping needs:
 Internet account (on Demand): Print your own bar-coded labels so that
you can drop off packages at the UPS retail counter or store (you can
also do that without an account) or give packages to a UPS driver. You
can also use Internet account rates when shipping through PayPal.
 Occasional shipper account: Use UPS for the rare large box or heavy
shipment. An occasional shipper can call UPS for a next-day pickup. You
have to pay an additional fee per package for the driver to pick up from
you if you don’t feel like bringing the package to the UPS local counter.
 Pickup account: When you hit the big time, you’re able to get the lowest
UPS rates and have a driver make daily stops to pick up your packages.
Fees for a pickup account may run as much as $20.00 per week (based
on the amount of packages you ship each week) over the cost of your
package shipping.
For big shippers, UPS offers its Application Program Interface (API), which
can be integrated into a company’s home servers.
To register for UPS online, visit www.ups.com/content/us/en/index.jsx
or go to your PayPal account. After typing your personal or business informa-
tion and answering a few basic questions, UPS will decide what account is
right for you. By registering, you can also track packages and ship online.
Here are some quick facts about UPS:
 Shipping with UPS requires that you pay a different rate for different zones
in the country (the same as the other shippers). The cost of your package
is based on its weight, your ZIP code (where the package ships from), and
the addressee’s ZIP code (where the package is going). To figure out your
cost, use the handy eBay shipping calculator shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-1:
The UPS
United
States hub.
258
Part III: Business Is Business — Time to Get Serious 

 The UPS Web site offers a chart that defines the shipping time for your
ground shipments (remember, no weekend deliveries).
 Each package has a tracking number that you can input online to verify
the location of a package in transit and the time of delivery.
 Delivery to a residence is more expensive than delivery to a commercial
location.
 UPS delivers packages Monday through Friday.
 $100.00 in insurance is included with every shipment. Valuations from
$100.01 to $300.00 cost $1.50, and valuations over that are an additional
$0.50 per $100.00.
United States Postal Service
Whether you call it snail mail, POPS (plain old postal service), or whatever
nickname you like, the United States Postal Service has been delivering the
mail since 1775, when our first postmaster (Benjamin Franklin) took the reins.
The USPS has attempted to get every piece of mail delivered to every part of
our country. Check out its Web site in Figure 14-3.
The USPS is open to everyone. You don’t have to set up an account to use its
services. To get a basic idea of what you’ll pay to send a package, you can
access a rate calculator on the USPS Web site (www.usps.gov). The post
office provides many services; in this section, I go over the most popular
forms of mail used by eBay sellers.
Distance and weight aren’t the only measure for postal shipping fees; shape
matters too. Because the cost of handling each mail shape varies, letters,
large envelopes (flats), and packages (parcels) of different sizes can incur
different rates.
Figure 14-2:
The eBay
shipping
calculator.
259
Chapter 14: Shipping Your Items: Sending Them Fast and Saving Money

First Class mail
eBay sellers often forget that items that weigh 13 ounces or less can be
shipped by super-speedy First Class mail at considerable savings. I send my
First Class shipments in bubble-lined mailer envelopes and they arrive
swiftly. Delivery confirmation is available for First Class mail for $0.75 at
the post office counter or $0.18 when you print your postage electronically.
For use of delivery confirmation, First Class mail (large envelopes, flats, and
packages) must be greater than 3⁄4-inch thick at the thickest point, unless the
item is packaged in strong, rigid fiberboard or in a container that becomes rigid
after the contents are enclosed and the container is sealed. The package must
be able to maintain its shape throughout the mail process without collapsing.
Priority mail
The two-to-three-day Priority mail service is the most popular form of ship-
ping for eBay packages. You can get free cartons in many sizes, stickers, and
labels from the post office. (See Chapter 17 for a complete list of what the
USPS supplies for your mailing needs.) You can also print postage online
through PayPal, Endicia.com, or Stamps.com (again, see Chapter 17).
Priority mail rates are perfect for 1-pound packages ($4.60 flat rate cross-
country) and 2-pound packages (from $4.80 to $7.50, based on distance).
There’s a flat-rate Priority envelope in which you can jam as much as possi-
ble (regardless of the final weight) for the same $4.60. And you can use two
sizes of flat-rate boxes and load them chock-full of heavy books or whatever
and pay only $8.95 to get your items delivered — anywhere in the country.
The Priority mail rates (including free shipping materials) are attractive until
you get into the larger, heavier packages that won’t fit into the flat-rate boxes
Figure 14-3:
The United
States
Postal
Service
Web site.
260
Part III: Business Is Business — Time to Get Serious 

(refer to Table 14-1). Also, if you don’t print your postage online, delivery
confirmation costs an additional $0.65 for Priority mail ($0.75 for Parcel Post
and Media mail). Delivery confirmation tells you only if the package was
delivered; it doesn’t trace the package along its route.
Media mail
To stay hip, the post office has renamed its old Book Rate to Media mail,
causing many eBay sellers to mistakenly miss out on this valuable mailing
tool. The savings are immense (refer to Table 14-1). The drawback is that you
must mail only books, cassettes, videos, or computer-readable media. Transit
time on Media mail can be up to three weeks, but the cost savings on heavy
packages are worth it.
Parcel Post
If you want to use USPS and have a heavy package (up to 70 pounds) that
doesn’t fit the requirements for Media mail, use Parcel Post. However, USPS
Parcel Post rates don’t save you much when you compare them to UPS or
FedEx Ground rates.
USPS Application Program Interface
If you want to print your own postage, you can use USPS Click-n-Ship, PayPal,
Endicia.com, or Stamps.com — that is, unless you’re a large corporation and
you’d like to incorporate the post office tools into your own Web site. USPS
has an application program interface (API) that allows your Web site to inter-
act with USPS servers, as shown in Figure 14-4. With this software, big busi-
nesses can get delivery confirmation (among other services) at no charge and
print their own barcodes. The USPS Web Tools page is at www.usps.com/
webtools.
Figure 14-4:

tation

261
Chapter 14: Shipping Your Items: Sending Them Fast and Saving Money

The integration of USPS APIs isn’t for the meek and small (like me — and
maybe you?), but you can use a reliable independent service such as
Endicia.com or Stamps.com. They’re perfect for the e-commerce entrepreneur.
Protecting Packages with Universal
Parcel Insurance Coverage
If you think that printing your own postage is slick, you’re gonna love
Universal Parcel Insurance Coverage (U-PIC), a service that automates the
post office insurance hassle. U-PIC has been in the package insurance busi-
ness since 1989, mainly insuring packages for large shippers. U-PIC has
expanded its business to the online auction arena, and you can insure pack-
ages that you send through USPS, UPS, FedEx, and other major carriers. If you
use its insurance on USPS-shipped packages, you can save as much as 80 per-
cent on insurance rates. If you use U-PIC, you can stop purchasing package
insurance from your carriers.
The U-PIC service also enables you to print your postage through an online
postage service and, if you have just a few packages, give the packages directly
to your USPS mail carrier. (You don’t have to stand in line to get your insurance
form stamped.) If you have a ton of boxes, you’ll need to drive them to the post
office and shove them over the counter. No waiting in line, no hassle!
To apply for the U-PIC service, you must fill out a Request to Provide (RTP)
form. Go to their Web site at www.u-pic.com and click the Apply link (see
Figure 14-5). You must answer questions about who you are, how many pack-
ages you send, how many insurance claims you’ve filed in the past two years,
and your average value per package.
Figure 14-5:
The U-PIC
home page.
262
Part III: Business Is Business — Time to Get Serious 

After you fill out the online form and agree to the policy (Evidence of
Insurance), a U-PIC representative will contact you within forty-eight hours.
The representative will answer your questions and help you decide which
of their programs will work best for your eBay business. (I give you some
details about these in just a bit.)
Your U-PIC sales representative will explain to you exactly how to declare
value with U-PIC based on your present system. At the end of each shipping
month, you fax, e-mail, or snail mail your shipping reports to U-PIC.
To place a claim with U-PIC on a USPS shipment, you must do so no sooner
than thirty days after the date of mailing, and you must supply the following:
 A signed letter, stating the loss or damage from the consignee
 A copy of the monthly insurance report you turned in to U-PIC reflecting
the insured value
 A completed U-PIC claim form (one claim form per claim)
 A copy of the original invoice or the end of auction form
Because you’re paying for private insurance, U-PIC suggests that you include
in the package a copy of your insurance policy (or at the very least a note
explaining that you have an insurance policy covering your shipments) so
that your buyer doesn’t think you’re overcharging (which makes some folks
a bit cranky).
Table 14-2 compares USPS and U-PIC insurance rates. UPS charges $0.35 cents
per $100.00 package value (after the initial $100.00). U-PIC charges only $0.14
per $100.00 UPS shipment value. FedEx charges $0.50 per $100.00 value with a
$2.50 minimum. By using U-PIC, you can insure your FedEx packages for $0.20
per $100.00 value.

U-PIC will also insure international shipments. The cost to insure interna-
tional USPS parcels is only $1.00 per $100.00, with no deductible.
If you’re a high-volume shipper, you can negotiate an even lower rate with 
U-PIC. To reach U-PIC, call toll-free at 800-955-4623 or visit their Web site at
www.u-pic.com.
Occasional shipper program
The occasional shipper program is for the person who ships one to five pack-
ages per month. You can pay for your insurance online using a credit card,
but the rates are not as attractive as those for the standard program.
Offline standard program
The offline standard program is the service for eBay businesspeople who ship
a large amount of packages per month. At the end of each shipping month,
you generate an insurance report and use it to calculate your premium. You
can pay the premium by check or through PayPal. You can get a discount
when shipping with the post office when you use a delivery confirmation.

D
o you have all your licenses? You know, those silly gov-
ernment required things that allow you to legally run a
business — or, better yet, allow you to buy at wholesale.
Setting up your eBay business as a real business entity
involves some unpleasant paperwork. Applying for
licenses, organizing, and record keeping are never fun.
Even though you should talk to a professional, I fill in the
blanks and get you started on the right track. I also pro-
vide a handy checklist of the items you need to run your
business online, such as your legal status, bookkeeping
requirements, and software to automate shipping.

Chapter 15
Getting Legal: Understanding
Taxes and Licenses
In This Chapter
 Deciding on your business format
 Getting your seller’s permit
 Covering the legalities
“L
egal business format?” you ask. “What’s a legal business format?”
I hate to be the one to tell you: You can’t just say, “I’m in business,”
and be in business. When you started selling on eBay, maybe you were happy
just adding a few dollars to your income. Now that the money is coming in
faster, you have a few more details to attend to. Depending how far you’re
going to take your business, you have to worry about taxes, bookkeeping,
and possible ramifications down the line.
I want to remind you that I am not a lawyer or an accountant. The facts I give
you in this chapter are from what I’ve learned over the years. When you
begin a formal business, it’s best to involve an attorney and an Enrolled
Agent or a CPA. At the very least, visit www.nolo.com, a great Web site that
offers some excellent business startup advice and forms.
One of the rules in the eBay User Agreement reads “. . . you may not transfer
your eBay account (including feedback) and User ID to another party without
our consent” (emphasis mine). This means if you begin your business on eBay
with another person, you’d better have some kind of agreement up front about
who gets the user ID in case of a sale. And if you sell your business, the person
with the original ID had best be involved actively with the new company — as
the rules say, your feedback can never be transferred or sold without eBay’s
permission. eBay’s official permission may be a long time coming or may not
happen at all, and you don’t want to leave these details until the last moment
of signing a deal with a new owner. Otherwise, the new owner would have to
start a new account on eBay with a new name — unless the principal from the
old company was contractually involved and was the actual eBay member.

To my knowledge, no one has tested this rule lately, and I’ll bet you don’t
want to be the first to face eBay’s top-notch lawyers. Know that this is the
rule and plan for it.
Types of Businesses
Businesses come in several legal forms, from a sole proprietorship all the
way to a corporation. A corporation designation isn’t as scary as it sounds.
Yes, Microsoft, IBM, and eBay are corporations, but so are many individuals
running businesses. Each form of business has its plusses and minuses —
and costs. I go over some of the fees involved in incorporating later in this
chapter. For now, I detail the most common types of businesses, which I
encourage you to weigh carefully.
Before embarking on any new business format, be sure to consult with a cer-
tified professional in the legal and financial fields.
Sole proprietorship
If you’re running your business by yourself part-time or full-time, your business
is a sole proprietorship. Yep, doesn’t that sound official? A sole proprietorship is
the simplest form of business. Nothing is easier or cheaper. Most people use
this form of business when they’re starting out. Many then graduate to a more
formal type of business as things get bigger.
If a husband and wife file a joint tax return, they can run a business as a sole
proprietorship (but only one of you can be the proprietor). However, if both you
and your spouse work equally in the business, running it as a partnership —
with a written partnership agreement — is a much better idea. (See the next
section, “Partnership,” for more information.) A partnership protects you in
case of your partner’s death. In a sole proprietorship, the business ends with
the death of the proprietor. If the business has been a sole proprietorship in
your late spouse’s name, you may be left out in the cold.
Being in business adds a few expenses, but you can deduct many of those
expenses (relating to your business) from your state and federal taxes. A sole
proprietorship can be run out of your personal checking account (although
I don’t advise it). The profits of your business are taxed directly as part of your
own income tax, and the profits and expenses are reported on Schedule C of
your tax package. As a sole proprietor, you’re at risk for the business
liabilities. All outstanding debts are yours, and you could lose personal
assets if you default.
268
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

There’s also the issue of Uncle Sam. When you’re a sole proprietor, you are
required to pay a self-employment tax, over and above your regular state and
federal taxes. This tax covers the Social Security and Medicare taxes that are
normally paid by your employer. Currently, the self-employment tax is 15.3%
(for the first $94,200). That means the profits you make from your online
enterprise get taxed additionally! Yowsers!
You can deduct half of your self-employment tax in figuring your adjusted gross
income. This deduction affects only your income tax. It does not affect either
your net earnings from self-employment or your self-employment tax. Other
legal business forms can work around this scourge. For up-to-date data on this
tax, visit the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/
0,,id=98846,00.html.
Also, you must consider the liability of the products you sell on eBay. If you
sell foodstuff, vitamins, or neutraceuticals (new-age food supplements) that
make someone ill, you may be personally liable for any court-awarded dam-
ages. If someone is hurt by something you sell, you may also be personally
liable as the seller of the product.
Partnership
When two or more people are involved in a business, it can be a partnership.
A general partnership can be formed by an oral agreement. Each person in
the partnership contributes capital or services, and both share in the part-
nership’s profits and losses. The income of a partnership is taxed to both
partners, based on the percentage of the business that they own or upon the
terms of a written agreement.
You’d better be sure that you can have a good working relationship with your
partner: This type of business relationship has broken up many a friendship.
Writing up a formal agreement when forming your eBay business partnership
is an excellent idea. This agreement is useful in solving any disputes that may
occur over time.
In your agreement, be sure to outline things such as
 Division of profits and losses
 Compensation to each of you
 Duties and responsibilities of each partner
 Restrictions of authority and spending
 How disputes should be settled
 What happens if the partnership dissolves
 What happens to the partnership in case of death or disability
269
Chapter 15: Getting Legal: Understanding Taxes and Licenses

One more important thing to remember: As a partner, you’re jointly and sev-
erally responsible for the business liabilities and actions of the other person
or people in your partnership — as well as of your own. Again, this is a per-
sonal liability arrangement. You are both personally open to any lawsuits that
come your way through the business.
The partnership has to file an informational return with the IRS and the state,
but the profits of the partnership are taxed to the partners on their personal
individual returns.
LLC (Limited Liability Company)
A limited liability company, or LLC, is similar to a partnership, but also has
many of the characteristics of a corporation. An LLC differs from a partner-
ship mainly in that the liabilities of the company are not passed on to the
members (owners). Unless you sign a personal guarantee for debt incurred,
the members are responsible only to the total amount they have invested
into the company. But all members do have liability for the company’s taxes.
You’ll need to put together an operating agreement, similar to the partner-
ship agreement. This also will help establish which members own what per-
centage of the company for tax purposes. Most states will require you to file
Articles of Organization forms to start this type of business.
An LLC is taxed like a sole proprietorship, with the profits and losses passed on
to the members’ personal tax returns. An LLC may opt to pay taxes like a corpo-
ration and keep some of the profits in the company, thereby reducing the tax
burden to the individual members. Although members pay the LLCs taxes, it
must still file Form 1065 with the IRS at the end of the year. This gives the IRS
extra data to be sure that the individual members properly report their income.
More information on LLCs can be found on the Web site of my friend, Seattle
accountant Stephen L. Nelson, CPA. He’s the author of the bestselling books
QuickBooks For Dummies and Quicken For Dummies. He also publishes Do-It-
Yourself Limited Liability Company: LLC Formation Kits. Check out his informa-
tive (state-by-state) site at www.llcsexplained.com.
Corporation
A corporation has a life of its own: its own name, its own bank account, and its
own tax return. A corporation is a legal entity created for the sole purpose of
doing business. One of the main problems a sole proprietor faces when incor-
porating is realizing that he or she can’t help themselves to the assets of the
business. Yes, a corporation can have only one owner: the shareholder(s). If
270
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

you can understand that you can’t write yourself a check from your corpora-
tion, unless it’s for salary or for reimbursement of legitimate expenses, you
may be able to face the responsibility of running your own corporation.
The full brunt of that nasty self-employment tax on income doesn’t rear its
ugly head when you have a corporation. Because you become an employee of
your corporation, you pay yourself a salary. The Medicare and Social Security
taxes (approximately 15%) are paid only on the part of your profit that you
call wages. Niiiice.
You have your choice of either a C or an S corporation. They each have differ-
ent tax situations. An S corporation enables you to treat profits as distribu-
tions and pass them directly to your personal tax return. The C corporation
files its own returns and treats you like an employee. This is a pretty tricky
area and I suggest you consult with a professional before making a decision
on which type of corporation to form.
The state in which you run your business sets up the rules for the corpora-
tions operating within its borders. You must apply to the Secretary of State
for the state in which you want to incorporate. Federal taxes for corporations
presently range from 15 to 35 percent, and they’re generally based on your
net profits. Often employee owners of corporations use the company to shel-
ter income from tax by dividing the income between their personal and cor-
porate tax returns. This is frequently called income splitting and involves
setting salaries and bonuses so that any profits left in the company at the end
of its tax year will be taxed at only the 15 percent rate. It’s kind of fun to see
how much the big guys pay and how much you’ll pay in taxes if you leave
profits in a small corporation, so check out Table 15-1 for the rates.

Chapter 15: Getting Legal: Understanding Taxes and Licenses

Often in small corporations, most of the profits are paid out in tax-deductible
wages and benefits. The most important benefit for a business is that any lia-
bilities belong to the corporation. Your personal assets remain your own,
because they have no part in the corporation.
Taking Care of Regulatory Details
Let me give you some important words to make your life easier in the long
run: Don’t ignore city, county, state, and federal regulatory details. Doing so
may make life easier at the get-go, but if your business is successful, one day
your casual attitude will catch up with you. Ignorance is no excuse. To do
business in this great country, you must comply with all the rules and regula-
tions that are set up for your protection and benefit.
Fictitious business name statement
If you plan on running your business under a name different from your own,
you may have to file a fictitious name statement regardless of the legal format
of your business. Your fictitious name (or DBA, doing business as) is the name
under which the government and the general public know your business. In
most states, every person who regularly transacts business for profit under a

Getting your legal documents prepared online
You just knew legal services would go online
eventually, didn’t you? If you’re thinking of set-
ting up one of the business formats described
in this chapter, you might be interested in
putting things together online. Real lawyers are
there to help you. A new venture, www.legal
zoom.com, will handle legal document prepa-
ration for business incorporation, partnerships,
and more for incredibly low prices. This online
venture was developed by a group of experi-
enced attorneys, cofounded by Robert Shapiro
(yes, that Robert Shapiro — of O.J. fame).
They feature an amazing online law library that
can answer many of your questions and help
you make informed decisions. Documents are
prepared according to how you answer online
questionnaires, which are designed to cover
most legal transactions. LegalZoom checks
your work and then e-mails your documents or
mails them printed on quality acid-free paper for
your signature.
You may want to also do at least a phone con-
sultation with an attorney in your area, perhaps
one who is a member of the local Chamber of
Commerce.

fictitious business name must file. Depending on where you live, you gener-
ally file this form with the county clerk. You can run a Google search for your
county’s clerk office to find out the exact procedures and fees for your area.
After a certain length of time after you file, your fictitious name will be pub-
lished in a newspaper that has a section of fictitious names in its classified
section. Usually the newspaper files with county agencies and publishes for
you in one procedure.
If you have a small community or neighborhood newspaper, check with it to
see whether it files fictitious name statements or DBAs. These newspapers
also have the lowdown on all the licenses and certificates that you’ll need for
your locality. Choosing small newspapers to handle these issues for you is a
smart idea because they tend to charge a lot less than big-city dailies. Plus,
you get to help another small business in your area.
Business license or city tax certificate
Business licenses are the official-looking pieces of paper you see behind the
register at local stores. Every business must have one, and depending on
your local laws, you may have to have a city license or a city tax registration
certificate. Yes, even if you’re running a business out of your home and have
no one coming to do business at your home, you may still need this. If you
don’t have one, the authorities may charge you a bunch of penalties if they
ever find out. Avoiding this step isn’t worth the risk.
To save you hanging on the phone, listening to elevator music, and being
transferred and disconnected ad nauseam, I’m supplying you with the direct
links to apply for your licenses (see Table 15-2). These URLs are accurate at
the time of this writing, but as everybody knows, URLs change frequently.

Sales tax number
If your state has a sales tax, a sales tax number (the number you use when
you file your sales tax statement with your state) is required before you offi-
cially sell anything. If sales tax applies, you may have to collect the appropri-
ate sales tax for every sale that ships within the state that your business is in.
Some people also call this a resale certificate because when you want to pur-
chase goods from a wholesaler within your state, you must produce this
number (thereby certifying your legitimacy) so that the dealer can sell you
the merchandise without charging you sales tax.
To find the regulations for your state, try the following terrific site, which
should have the answers to your questions: www.taxadmin.org/fta/
link/forms.html.
276
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

Don’t withhold the withholding forms
Aye, caramba. I swear it feels like the rules and regulations are never going to
end, but if you have regular employees, you need to file withholding forms to
collect the necessary taxes that you must send to the state and the IRS on
behalf of your employees. You’re also expected to deposit those tax dollars
with the IRS and your state on the date required, which may vary from busi-
ness to business. Many enterprises go down because the owners just can’t
seem to keep their fingers out of withheld taxes, which means the money
isn’t available to turn in when the taxes are due (another reason why you
should have a separate bank account for your business).
If you have employees, you probably need to get the following:
 Federal Employee Tax ID number: File IRS form SS-4. You can apply for
this number online, by going to the following:
www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,
00.html
For more information, call 1-800-829-1040. For forms to fill out the old-
fashioned way, call 1-800-829-3676.
 State Employer number: You need this for withholding taxes if your
state has an income tax. Check the following site for more information:

Savvy Record Keeping —
Keeping the Tax Man at Bay
In This Chapter
 Understanding first things first: Bookkeeping basics
 Saving your records to save your bacon
 Finding bookkeeping software
 Using QuickBooks for your bookkeeping needs
B
ookkeeping, bah! You’ll get no argument from me that bookkeeping can
be the most dreaded and time-consuming part of your job. You may feel
that you just need to add your product costs, add your gross sales, and bada-
bing, you know where your business is. Sorry, not true. Did you add that roll
of tape you picked up at the supermarket today? Although it cost only $1.29,
it’s a business expense. How about the mileage driving back and forth from
garage sales and flea markets? Those are expenses, too. I suspect that you’re
also not counting quite a few other “small” items just like these in your
expense column.
Once I actually get into the task, I must confess that I enjoy posting my
expenses and sales. It gives me the opportunity to know exactly where my
business is at any given moment. Of course, I’m not using a pencil-and-paper
ledger system; I use a software program that’s easy enough. In this chapter,
I give you the lowdown on the basics of bookkeeping, emphasize the impor-
tance of keeping records in case Uncle Sam comes calling, and explain why
using QuickBooks is the smart software choice. Keep reading: This chapter
is required.

Keeping the Books: Basics That Get
You Started
Although posting bookkeeping can be boring, clicking a button to generate
your tax information is a lot easier than manually going over pages of sales
information on a pad of paper. That’s why I like to use a software program,
particularly QuickBooks (more about that in the section titled “QuickBooks:
Making Bookkeeping Uncomplicated”).
I suppose that you could use plain ol’ paper and a pencil to keep your books;
if that works for you, great. But even though that might work for you now, it
definitely won’t in the future. Entering all your information into a software
program now — while your books may still be fairly simple to handle — can
save you a lot of time and frustration in the future, when your eBay business
has grown beyond your wildest dreams and no amount of paper can keep
it all straight and organized. I discuss alternative methods of bookkeeping
in the “Bookkeeping Software” section. For now, I focus on the basics of
bookkeeping.
To effectively manage your business, you must keep track of all your
expenses — down to the last roll of tape. You need to keep track of your
inventory, how much you paid for the items, how much you paid in shipping,
and how much you profited from your sales. If you use a van or the family car
to pick up or deliver merchandise to the post office (I can load eight of the
light kits that I sell on eBay in my car), you should keep track of this mileage
as well. When you’re running a business, you should account for every penny
that goes in and out.
Bookkeeping has irrefutable standards called GAAP (Generally Accepted
Accounting Procedures) that are set by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board. (It sounds scary to me too.) Assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, income,
and expenses are standard terms used in all forms of accounting to define
profit, loss, and the fiscal health of your business.
Every time you process a transaction, two things happen: One account is
credited while another receives a debit (kind of like yin and yang). To get
more familiar with these terms (and those in the following list), see the defini-
tions in the chart of accounts later in this chapter (in Table 16-2) and in
Appendix A (a mini-glossary I’ve included for your convenience). Depending
on the type of account, the account’s balance either increases or decreases.
280
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

One account that increases while another decreases is called double-entry
accounting:
 When you post an expense, the debit increases your expenses and
decreases your bank account.
 When you purchase furniture or other assets, it increases your asset
account and decreases your bank account.
 When you make a sale and make the deposit, it increases your bank
account and decreases your accounts receivable.
 When you purchase inventory, it increases your inventory and decreases
your bank account.
 When a portion of a sale includes sales tax, it decreases your sales
account, and increases your sales tax account.
281
Chapter 16: Savvy Record Keeping — Keeping the Tax Man at Bay
Hiring a professional to do your year-end taxes
When I say that you must hire a professional to
prepare your taxes, I mean a certified public
accountant (CPA), if your business format is a
corporation, or an enrolled agent (EA), for a sole
proprietorship or partnership. An enrolled agent
is a tax professional who’s licensed by the
Federal government and specializes solely in tax-
ation and current tax laws. Enrolled agents must
pass an annual two-day exam (less than a third
of the people who take the test pass it) and are
required to fulfill continuing education require-
ments to maintain their standing. Just like a CPA
or a tax attorney, EAs are authorized to appear
before the IRS on your behalf in the event of an
audit. Unlike a CPA or an attorney, however, EAs
don’t charge an arm and a leg. They’re a valuable
addition to your business arsenal.
Although the folks at your local “We Do Your
Taxes in a Hurry Store” may be well meaning
and pleasant, they may have gone through only
a six-week course in the current tax laws. This
does not make them tax professionals. When
business taxes are at stake, a professional with
whom you have a standing relationship is the
best choice. If you don’t know one, ask around
or call your local Chamber of Commerce.
Posting bookkeeping can be boring. At the end of
the year when you have a professional do your
taxes, however, you’ll be a lot happier — and
your tax preparation will cost you less — if you’ve
posted your information cleanly and in the proper
order. That’s why using QuickBooks is essential
to running your business. (See the “QuickBooks:
Making Bookkeeping Uncomplicated” section.)

Manually performing double-entry accounting can be a bit taxing (no pun
intended). A software program automatically adjusts the accounts when you
input a transaction.
As a business owner, even if you’re a sole proprietor (see Chapter 15 for
information on business types), you should keep your business books sepa-
rate from your personal expenses. (I recommend using a program such as
Quicken to keep track of your personal expenses for tax time.) By isolating
the business records from the personal records, you can get a snapshot of
what areas of your sales are doing well and which ones aren’t carrying their
weight. But that isn’t the only reason keeping accurate records is smart;
there’s the IRS to think about, too. In the next section, I explain Uncle Sam’s
interest in your books.
Records Uncle Sam May Want to See
One of the reasons we can have a great business environment in the United
States is because we all have a partner, Uncle Sam. Our government regulates
business and sets the rules for us to transact our operations. To help you get
started with your business, the IRS maintains a small-business Web site at
www.irs.gov/businesses/small.
In this section, I highlight what information you need to keep and how long
you should keep it (just in case you’re chosen for an audit).
Supporting information
Aside from needing to know how your business is going (which is really
important), the main reason to keep clear and concise records is because
Uncle Sam may come knocking one day. You never know when the IRS will
choose your number and want to examine your records. In the following list,
I highlight some of the important pieces of supporting information (things
that support your expenses on your end-of-year tax return):
 Receipts: Dear reader, heed this advice: Save every receipt that you get.
If you’re out of town on a buying trip and have coffee at the airport, save
that receipt — it’s a deduction from your profits. Everything related to
your business may be deductible, so you must save airport parking
receipts, taxi receipts, receipts for a pen that you picked up on your way
to a meeting, everything. If you don’t have a receipt, you can’t prove the
write-off.
282
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

 Merchandise invoices: Saving all merchandise invoices is as important
as saving all your receipts. If you want to prove that you paid $400 and
not the $299 retail price for that Nintendo Wii that you sold on eBay for
$500, you’d better have an invoice of some kind. The same idea applies
to most collectibles, in which case a retail price can’t be fixed. Save all
invoices!
 Outside contractor invoices: If you use outside contractors — even if
you pay the college kid next door to go to the post office and bank for
you — you should also get an invoice from them to document exactly
what service you paid for and how much you paid. This is supporting
information that will save your bacon, should it ever need saving.
 Business cards: It may sound like I’m stretching things a bit, but if you
use your car to look at some merchandise, pick up a business card from
the vendor. If you’re out of town and have a meeting with someone, take
a card. Having these business cards can help substantiate your
deductible comings and goings.
 A daily calendar: This is where your handheld comes in. Every time
you leave your house or office on a business-related task, make note of
it in your handheld. Keep as much minutia as you can stand. A Palm
Desktop can print a monthly calendar. At the end of the year, staple the
pages together and include them in your files with your substantiating
information.
 Credit card statements: You’re already collecting credit card receipts
(although mine always seem to slip through the holes in my purse). If
you have your statements, you have monthly proof of expenses. When
you get your statement each month, post it into your bookkeeping pro-
gram and itemize each and every charge, detailing where you spent the
money and for what. (QuickBooks has a split feature that accommodates
all your categories.) File these statements with your tax return at the
end of the year in your year-end envelope (shoe box?).
I know that all this stuff will pile up, but that’s when you go to the store and
buy some plastic file storage containers to organize it all. To check for new
information and the lowdown on what you can and can’t do, ask an accoun-
tant or a CPA. Also visit the IRS Tax Information for Business site at
www.irs.ustreas.gov/businesses.
How long should you keep your records?
How long do you have to keep all this supporting information? I hate to tell
you, but I think I’ve saved it all. I must have at least ten years of paperwork in
big plastic boxes and old files in the garage. But you know, I’m not too extreme;
283
Chapter 16: Savvy Record Keeping — Keeping the Tax Man at Bay

the period in which you can amend a return or in which the IRS can assess
more tax is never less than three years from the date of filing — and can even
be longer. As of my last visit to the IRS Web site, the information in Table 16-1
applied.

Even though I got this information directly from the IRS Web site and litera-
ture (Publication 583, “Starting a Business and Keeping Records”), it may
change in the future. You can download a PDF copy of the booklet by going to
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p583.pdf. (The download requires Adobe
Acrobat Reader. If it isn’t installed on your computer, you can download the
software for free from the IRS Web site.) It doesn’t hurt to store your informa-
tion for as long as you can stand it and stay on top of any changes the IRS
may implement.
Bookkeeping Software
Keeping track of your auctions is hard without software, but keeping track of
the money you make without software is even harder (and more time con-
suming). If using software to automate your auctions makes sense, so does
using software to automate your bookkeeping. You can afford to make a mis-
take here and there in your own office, and no one will ever know. But if you
make a mistake in the books, your partner (Uncle Sam) will notice — and be
284
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

quite miffed. He may even charge you a penalty or two so that you’ll remem-
ber not to make those mistakes again.
Those penalties aren’t small either. A three-day-late tax deposit will cost you
an additional 10 percent tax penalty. That can be an expensive lesson.
When I started my business, I used accounting ledger pads (which had just
replaced the chisel and stone format). I soon found that I had way too many
ledgers to keep track of and cross reference. A calculator was useful, based
on the assumption that I typed the correct figures to start with.
Spreadsheet software can be a boon when you’re just starting out. A program
such as Microsoft Office Excel is an excellent way to begin posting your busi-
ness expenses and profits. The program can be set up to calculate your
expenses, profits, and (I hope not too many) losses. Microsoft Works comes
with several free financial worksheet templates that you can easily adapt for
an eBay small business. Also, you can find current Excel templates to get you
started at office.microsoft.com. There’s no need to spend any extra
money on templates when you’re first starting!
With official bookkeeping software, reconciling a checkbook is a breeze. You
merely click off the deposits and checks when the statement comes in. If I
made a mistake originally when inputting the data, the software (comparing my
balance and my bank’s) lets me know. This kind of efficiency would have put
Bob Cratchit out of a job!
I researched various Web sites to find which software was the best selling and
easiest to use. I had many discussions with CPAs, enrolled agents, and book-
keepers. The software that these professionals most recommend for business
is Intuit’s QuickBooks. (Thank goodness that’s the one I use.) QuickBooks is
considered the best, which is why I devote so much of this chapter to it. Some
people begin with Quicken and later move to QuickBooks when their business
gets big or incorporates. My theory? Start with the best. It’s not that much
more expensive — on eBay, I’ve seen new, sealed QuickBooks Pro 2007 soft-
ware for as low as $135 and QuickBooks for as low as $65 — and it will see you
directly to the big time.
QuickBooks: Making Bookkeeping
Uncomplicated
QuickBooks offers several versions, from basic to enterprise solutions tailored
to different types of businesses. QuickBooks Simple Start and QuickBooks Pro
have a few significant differences. QuickBooks Pro adds job costing and
285
Chapter 16: Savvy Record Keeping — Keeping the Tax Man at Bay

expensing features, payroll, and the ability to keep track of your inventory
through your sales receipts and purchases (making it a sound upgrade for
eBay sellers). QuickBooks Simple Start does a darn good job too, so check out
the comparison at quickbooks.intuit.com and see which version is best
for you. I use (and highly recommend) QuickBooks Pro, so that’s the version I
describe in the rest of this section.
Stephen L. Nelson wrote QuickBooks 2007 For Dummies (published by Wiley).
His book is amazingly easy to understand. I swear that neither Steve nor my
publisher gave me a nickel for recommending his book. (Heck, I even had to
pay for my copy.) I recommend it simply because it answers — in plain
English — just about any question you’ll have about using the program for
your bookkeeping needs. Spend the money and get the book. Any money
spent on increasing your knowledge is money well spent (and may be a tax
write-off).
I update my QuickBooks software yearly, and every year it takes me less time
to perform my bookkeeping tasks (because of product improvements). If you
find that you don’t have time to input your bookkeeping data, you may have to
hire a bookkeeper. The bonus is that professional bookkeepers already know
QuickBooks, and the best part is that they can print weekly reports for you
that keep you apprised of your business condition. Also, at the end of each
year, QuickBooks will supply you with all the official reports and data your
enrolled agent or certified public accountant will need to do your taxes. (Yes,
you really do need an EA or a CPA; see the “Hiring a professional to do your
year-end taxes” sidebar elsewhere in this chapter.) You can even send them a
backup on a zip disk or a CD-ROM. See how simple bookkeeping can be?

QuickBooks integrates with PayPal
PayPal can provide your payment history in
QuickBooks format. They even offer a settlement
and reconciliation system download that breaks
up your PayPal transactions into debits and
credits. A handy feature! One warning though:
These are only financial transactions. When you
use QuickBooks to its fullest, you will have your
inventory in the program. When you purchase
merchandise to sell, QuickBooks sets up the
inventory — and deducts from it each time you
input an invoice or a sales receipt. This way your
inventory receipts follow GAAP. In my books,
eBay Timesaving Techniques For Dummies and
eBay PowerSeller Practices For Dummies, I
show you my procedures for posting your weekly
(or daily) sales in QuickBooks by using sales
receipts versus clogging up your program with
thousands of customer listings. Which, by the
way, received an approving nod from Stephen
Nelson when I showed him my system.

QuickBooks Pro
When you first fire up QuickBooks Pro, you must first answer a few questions
to set up your account. Among the few things you need to have ready before
you even begin to mess with the software are the following starting figures:
 Cash balance: This may be the amount in your checking account (no
personal money, please!) or the amount of money deposited from your
eBay profits. Put these profits into a separate checking account to use
for your business.
 Accounts receivable balance: Does anyone owe you money for some
auctions? Outstanding payments make up this total.
 Account liability balance: Do you owe some money? Are you being
invoiced for some merchandise that you haven’t paid for? Total it and
enter it when QuickBooks asks you.
If you’re starting your business in the middle of the year, gather any previous
profits and expenses that you want to include, because you’ll have to input
this information for a complete annual set of diligently recorded books. I can
guarantee that this is going to take a while. But after you’ve gathered together
your finances, even if it takes a little sweat to set it up initially, you’ll be thank-
ing me for insisting you get organized. It just makes everything work smoother
in the long run.
Firing up QuickBooks for the first time
The first thing you need to do is organize finances. Put all your expenses in
one folder and sales information in another, and then you can proceed with
the QuickBooks setup interview. The interview is designed to give those with
accounting-phobia and those using a bookkeeping program for the first time
a comfort level.
QuickBooks asks you questions about your business and you fill in the very
intuitive form. If you mess things up, you can always use the back arrow and
change what you’ve input. If you need help, simply click the Help button and
the program will answer many of your questions. Hey, if worse comes to worst,
you can always delete the file from the QuickBooks directory and start over.
If you’re new to bookkeeping, you may want to go through the QuickBooks
startup interview step by step with a tutor at your side. For more details,
remember to check out QuickBooks 2007 For Dummies — this book can teach
you almost everything you need to know about QuickBooks.

Chapter 16: Savvy Record Keeping — Keeping the Tax Man at Bay

QuickBooks chart of accounts
After you’ve finished the setup and have successfully set yourself up in
QuickBooks, the program presents a chart of accounts. Think of the chart of
accounts as an organization system, such as file folders. It keeps all related
data in the proper area. When you write a check to pay a bill, it deducts the
amount from your checking account, reduces your accounts payable, and
perhaps increases your asset or expense accounts.
You have a choice of giving each account a number. These numbers, a kind of
bookkeeping shorthand, are standardized throughout bookkeeping; believe it
or not, everybody in the industry seems to know what number goes with what
item. To keep things less confusing, I like to use titles as well as numbers.
To customize your chart of accounts, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
2. Click the Accounting icon (on the left).
3. Click the Company preferences tab and indicate that you’d like to use
account numbers.
An editable chart of accounts appears. Because QuickBooks doesn’t
assign account numbers as a default, you’ll need to edit the chart to
create them.
4. Go through your QuickBooks chart of accounts and add any missing
categories.
You may not need all these categories, and you can always add more
later. In Table 16-2, I show you a chart of accounts that a CPA wrote for
an eBay business.

Learning about COGS
No, no, I’m not talking about Cogswell’s Cogs
(the company that George Jetson worked for);
I’m talking about Cost of Goods Sold. It’s a spe-
cial type of expense and often varies depending
on the type of business. The general definition
of COGS reflects the cost of purchasing raw
materials and manufacturing finished products.
Some accountants look at it slightly differently
in an eBay business: encompassing credit card
(PayPal) fees, eBay fees, and shipping costs,
making it include all direct costs of products
sold and shipped to customers.
I like it this way, because in the financial profit
& loss statement, QuickBooks lists COGS ahead
of other expense accounts. This gives me a
snapshot view of the sales profitability of my
eBay business without clouding things by
including telephone, payroll, travel, and all the
other expenses that affect the gross profits.

QuickBooks on the Web
If you want to handle everything on the Web, use QuickBooks online service.
The online QuickBooks program offers fewer features than the Pro version,
but if your accounting needs are simple, it may be right for you. Before you
decide, however, consider that while your accounting needs may be simple
now, they may not be so simple later.
Intuit charges from $19.95 a month for the service, which is comparable to
buying the QuickBooks Pro version — but at least you can continue to use pur-
chased software for more than one year. The online version also requires you
to have a broadband connection to the Internet so that you’re always online
(dial-up connections need not apply). The online edition doesn’t include inte-
grated payroll, purchase orders, online banking, and bill payments.

Chapter 17
Building an eBay Back Office
In This Chapter
 Organizing your stock
 Keeping inventory
 Exploring shipping materials
 Becoming your own post office
T
he more items you sell, the more confusing things can get. As you build
your eBay business, the little side table you use for storing eBay mer-
chandise isn’t going to work. You must think industrial. Even part-time sellers
can benefit by adding a few professional touches to their business areas.
In this chapter, I emphasize the importance of setting up and organizing your
back office. Organization will save you huge amounts of time when it comes
to fulfilling your orders. I cover everything from stacking your stock to keep-
ing inventory to indispensable packing materials and online postage services.
Organization will be your byword. Dive right in. The sooner you read this
chapter, the sooner you can build your eBay back office and get down to
business.
The Warehouse: Organizing Your Space
Whether you plan to sell large items or small items, you need space for stor-
ing them. As you make savvy purchases, maintaining an item’s mint condition
will be one of your greatest challenges. Organized storage is an art in itself,
so in this section I cover the details of what you’ll need to safeguard your pre-
cious stock.
Shelving your profits
Before you stock the shelves, it helps to have some! You also need a place to
put the shelves: your garage, a spare room, or somewhere else. You have a
choice between two basic kinds of shelves:

 Plastic: If you’re just starting out, you can always go to the local closet
and linen supply store to buy inexpensive plastic shelves. They’re light
and cheap — but they’ll buckle in time, rendering them useless.
 Steel: If you want to do it right the first time, buy steel shelving. The
most versatile steel shelving is the wire kind (versus solid-steel shelves),
which is lighter and allows air to circulate around your items. Steel wire
shelving assembles easily; I put mine together without help. They come
with leveling feet or four-inch casters, so you can move the unit, if neces-
sary. Installing the casters is up to you. You can combine steel wire
shelving units to create a full wall of shelves. Each shelf safely holds as
much as 500 pounds of merchandise.
Search eBay for shelving to find sellers offering this kind of industrial
shelving. The main problem with ordering this product online is that the
shipping usually costs more than the shelving.
To save you time, dear reader, I researched the subject and found some read-
ily available, reasonably priced shelves. Just go to Target or Costco and look
for steel wire four-shelf commercial shelving, sold in 36- and 48-inch-wide
units. Each shelf will hold up to 500 pounds. These shelves are available also
on the Costco Web site, but you have to pay for shipping.
Box ’em or bag ’em?
Packing your items for storage can be a challenge. As long as you’re picking
up your shelving (see preceding section), pick up some plastic bags in snack,
sandwich, quart, and gallon sizes. The snack baggies are perfect for storing
the smallest of items. When items are stored in plastic, they can’t pick up any
smells or become musty before you sell them. The plastic also protects the
items from rubbing against each other and causing possible scratches. If you
package them one item to a bag, you can then just lift one off the shelf and
put it directly into a shipping box when the sale is made. Also, when you ship
the item, the plastic protection may save the package from a rainy day.
Your bags of items will have to go into boxes for storage on the shelves. Clear
plastic storage boxes, the kind you often find at superstores, are great for
bulky items. They’re usually 26 inches, so before you buy these big plastic
containers, be sure that they’ll fit on your shelving easily and that you’ll have
easy access to your items. Using cardboard office-type file storage boxes from
an office supply store is another option. These cardboard boxes are 10 x 12 x
16 inches, which is a nice size for storing medium-size products. At around $1
each, they’re the most economical choice. The downside is that you can’t see
through cardboard boxes, so if your label falls off, you have to take the box off
the shelf and open it to check its contents. Smaller see-through plastic boxes
with various compartments, such as the kind home improvement stores carry
for storing tools, work great for storing very small items.
296
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

When using these large plastic bins, it’s always a good idea to tape a pad of
Post-it notes on the end of the box so you can quickly identify the contents.
You can use regular sticky labels, but changing them will leave large amounts
of paper residue over time, and your storage will look sloppy and icky.
Inventory: Keeping Track of What You
Have and Where You Keep It
Savvy eBay sellers have different methods of handling inventory. They use
everything from spiral-bound notebooks to sophisticated software programs.
Although computerized inventory tracking can simplify this task, starting
with a plain ol’ handwritten ledger is fine, too. Choose whichever works best
for you, but keep in mind that as your eBay business grows, a software pro-
gram that tracks inventory for you may become necessary. If you use
QuickBooks for your bookkeeping, this all-in-one software will also keep track
of your inventory (every time you post your purchases and sales).
Ledger systems wouldn’t work for a company with a warehouse full of stock,
but will work nicely in a beginning eBay sales environment. Many sellers tape
sheets of paper to their boxes to identify them by number, and use that as a
reference to a simple Excel spreadsheet for selling purposes. Excel spread-
sheets are perfect for keeping track of your sales as well, but if you’re using a
management service or software, you don’t need both for physical inventory.
After you’re running a real business, however, you have to keep Uncle Sam
happy with a dollars and cents accounting of your inventory, so keep your
inventory records in a standardized program such as QuickBooks (discussed
in Chapter 16). In Chapter 9, I detail a variety of auction management soft-
ware and Web sites, many of which include physical inventory tracking 
features.
297
Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office
Planning: The key to good organization
When it became time for me to put my eBay
merchandise in order, I was busy with my regu-
lar job, so I hired people to organize my eBay
area. This decision turned out to be one mas-
sive mistake. They organized everything and put
all my items in boxes — but didn’t label the
boxes to indicate what was stored in each. The
boxes also weren’t placed in an intuitive manner
for me to quickly assemble my packages. It took
me months to recover.
A bit of advice: Think things out and plan where
you’ll put everything. Organize your items by
theme, type, or size. In my eBay business area,
I have books in one area, DVDs in another, pho-
tographic equipment on shelves, and so on. If
you organize before planning, you might end up
with organized disorganization.

You may also want to use Excel spreadsheets for your downloaded PayPal
statements, to hold information waiting to transfer to your bookkeeping pro-
gram, or merely for archival purposes at the end of the year.
The Shipping Department: Packin’ It Up
If you’ve read eBay For Dummies, you know all about the various ways to
pack your items. I hope you’ve become an expert! In this section, I review
some of the things you must have for a complete, smooth-running shipping
department, such as cleaning supplies and packing materials. The handling
fee portion of your shipping charges pays for these kinds of items. Don’t run
low on them and pay attention to how you store them. They must be kept in a
clean environment.
Packaging clean up
Be sure the items you send out are in tip-top shape. Here are a few everyday
chemicals that can gild the lily:
 WD-40: This decades-old lubricant works incredibly well at getting price
stickers off plastic and glass without damaging the product. The plastic
on a toy box may begin to look scratchy and nasty, even when stored in
a clean environment. A quick wipe with a paper towel containing a dash
of WD-40 will make it shine like new. WD-40 also works well for untan-
gling jewelry chains and shining up metallic objects. (It also removes ink
and crayon marks from many items.)
 Goo Gone: Goo Gone works miracles in cleaning up gooey sticker
residue from nonporous items.
 un-du: This amazing liquid easily removes stickers from cardboard, 
plastic, fabrics, and more without causing damage. It comes packaged
with a patented miniscraper top that you can use in any of your sticker-
cleaning projects. You can also use lighter fluid (which is, of course, 
considerably more dangerous and may damage your item).
Packing materials
So that you can always be sure that your items will arrive at their destina-
tions in one piece, you’ll want to keep the following on hand at all times:
298
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

 Bubble wrap: A clean, puffy product that comes in rolls (see Figure
17-1), bubble wrap is available in several sizes. Depending on your prod-
uct, you may have to carry two sizes of bubble wrap to properly protect
your goods. Bubble wrap can be expensive, but check out vendors at
eBay; you’ll find quite a lot of them (and possibly a deal). The best part
about bubble wrap is that it’s highly recyclable, and the packing mater-
ial that comes in with your merchandise orders can be reused on your
outgoing items.

wrap in its

Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office
Removing musty odors from apparel items
Clothing can often pick up odors that you just
don’t notice. I once bought a designer dress on
eBay from a seller who had the typical dis-
claimer in her description: “No stains, holes,
repairs, or odors. Comes from a smoke-free,
pet-free home.” Unfortunately, the minute I
opened the box I could smell the musty odor of
an item that had been stored for a long time.
To prevent that icky, storage odor, keep a pack-
age of Dryel Fabric Care System around. This is
a safe, do-it-yourself, dry-cleaning product. Just
toss your eBay clothing items in the patented
Dryel bag with the special sheet and toss the
bag in the dryer as per the instructions on the
box. Your garment will come out smelling clean
— and wrinkle free. For more information, visit
their Web site at www.Dryel.com.

 Styrofoam packing peanuts: Why they call them peanuts, I’ll never know
— I guess somebody thought they look like peanuts. Nonetheless,
Styrofoam peanuts protect just about everything you ship. Storing them
is the tricky part. I store mine by putting the peanuts into 33-gallon
drawstring plastic trash bags, and then I hang the bags on cup hooks
(available at the hardware store) around the walls and rafters of my
garage. When packing your items with peanuts, be sure that you place
the item carefully and use enough peanuts to fill the box completely;
leaving any airspace defeats the point of using the peanuts in the first
place. (Don’t go short in the land of plenty.)
 Plastic bags: Buy plastic bags in bulk to save money. Make sure you buy
various sizes and use them for both shipping and storing. Even large
kitchen or trash bags are good for wrapping up posters and large items
before shipping; the plastic protects the item from inclement weather by
waterproofing it.
 Two- or three-inch shipping tape: You’ll need clear tape for finishing up
packages. You’ll also need the clear tape to place over address labels to
protect them from scrapes and rain. I once received a package with an
address label completely soaked with rain and barely legible. Don’t risk
a lost package for want of a few inches of tape.
 Bubble mailer envelopes: If you send items that fit nicely into bubble-
lined envelopes, use them (see Figure 17-2). This type of envelope —
with paper on the outside and bubble wrap on the inside — is perfect
for mailing small items or clothing using First Class or Priority mail. The
envelopes are available in quantity by the case (an economical choice)
and don’t take up much storage space. Table 17-1 shows you the indus-
try-standard sizes of bubble mailer envelopes and their suggested uses.
To get a real-world idea of how these mailers fit your items, bring the
items to a local office super store and buy one each of several different
sizes of envelopes before ordering.

Packaging — the heart of the matter
Depending on the size of the item you sell, you can purchase boxes in bulk at
reliable sources. Because you have a resale number (see Chapter 15), look in
your local yellow pages for wholesale boxes. (You still have to pay tax, but
the resale number identifies you as a business and often can get you a lower
price.) Try to purchase from a manufacturer that specializes in B2B (business
to business) sales. Some box companies specialize in selling to the occa-
sional box user. Knowing the size that you need enables you to buy by the
case lot.

In August of 1999, the United States Postal Service announced a new service:
information-based indicia (IBI). Targeted at the SOHO (small office/home
office) market, IBI is USPS-certified postage that you can print on envelopes
and sticker labels right from your PC. In this section, I give you the lowdown
on the main Internet postage vendors: Endicia.com, Stamps.com, and PayPal.
I’m a savvy consumer and businesswoman. I don’t believe in paying for
extras, nor do I believe in being a victim of hidden charges. The online
postage arena — while providing helpful tools that make running your eBay
business easier — is fraught with bargains, deals, and introductory offers. I
urge you to read these offers carefully so that you know what you’re getting
yourself into: Evaluate how much it will cost you to start and to maintain an
ongoing relationship with the company. Although you may initially get some
free hardware and pay a low introductory rate, the fine print might tell you
that you have agreed to pay unreasonably high prices six months down the
line. I always double-check pricing before getting into anything, and I urge
you to do the same.
Your old pal the United States Postal Service has Web tools that enable you
to print postage and delivery confirmations online. One caveat: This is a no-
frills online service, and you often get what you pay for. Keep in mind that
you can’t print the labels on a label printer. You must print to regular 81⁄2 x 11
paper. For more details, go to www.usps.com/clicknship.

Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office

Printing labels on your printer is convenient until you start sending out a
dozen packages at a time — then cutting the paper and taping the label gets a
bit too time consuming. I highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and
get a label printer. Yes, they can be expensive, but you can find some great
deals on eBay. I bought my heavy-duty, professional Eltron Zebra 2844 ther-
mal label printer on eBay for one-fourth the retail price. (Search eBay for
zebra 2844.) It’s saved me countless hours. Dymo also makes a very good
label printer for beginners.
If you’re asking yourself why I haven’t included a world famous, popular
postage meter service in this book, you have a good question. Purchasing
and printing online postage is just about the defacto standard in the online
selling industry. Postage meters not only eat up your profits in fees, but the
ink is sooo expensive. Inkjet ink is expensive enough (I know I don’t have to
tell you that), so if you’re going to print your labels on paper, try to use a
laser printer and put clear tape over the address. That’s another reason why I
love that Zebra label printer. No ink! It’s thermal and prints over and over
without ever needing ink.
Printing online postage with 
handy software
In the early days of online commerce, I had to scour the Internet to find
places to conveniently print my shipping postage. Previous editions of this
book listed each service individually, but now I examine how the current ser-
vices can save you time and money. Online postage labels have a unique look.
Figure 17-4 shows you a typical online 4 x 6 postage label printed from
Endicia’s DAZzle software.
Printing your postage the twenty-first-century way makes life a lot simpler:

Free USPS package pickup
Yes! Some things are free! If you print elec-
tronic postage through one of the vendors men-
tioned in this chapter, you can go the post office
Web site at http://carrierpickup.
usps.com and request a free pickup for your
items (as long as you have at least one Priority
mail package). If you misplace the URL, go to
the Post Office main page and type carrier
pickup in the search box. You can request a
next-day pickup as late as 2 a.m.

 Online postage purchases: With a click of your mouse, you can pur-
chase postage instantly using your credit card or by direct debit from
your checking account. You can register your preferences when you sign
up with Endicia.com.
 Hidden postage: A stealth indicia (also known as the postage-paid indi-
cia) is an awesome tool for the eBay seller. By using this feature, your
customer will not see the exact amount of postage that you paid. This
allows you to add reasonable shipping and handling costs to your
invoice and not inflame the buyer when they see final costs on the label.
 Free delivery confirmations on Priority mail: Delivery confirmations
may be printed for First Class, Parcel Post, and Media Mail. Priority mail
delivery confirmation is free (that’s right — no more $0.65 each) when
you print postage online. (First Class delivery confirmation is only $0.18
cents online versus $0.75 cents at the post office counter.)
 Address validation: Before printing any postage, the software contacts
the USPS database of every valid mailing address in the United States.
This Address Matching System (AMS) is updated monthly.
 ZIP code check: The software runs a check on your addresses and cor-
rects any ZIP code errors you’ve made.
 Addition of the extra four digits to your addressee’s ZIP code: This
nifty feature helps ensure swift delivery while freeing you of the hassle
of having to look up the extra digits.
 Packages are ready for the letter carrier pickup: Once you’ve used the
online services, you have all your mail ready to go. No more socializing
in the Post Office lines!

Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office

As you can see, the benefits hugely outweigh any possible service costs. The
two major players that cater to online sellers are Endicia.com and
Stamps.com. I give you a bit of background on both.
Endicia.com
At the beginning of PC graphics in the early ’90s, I attended a cutting-edge
industry trade show. I had a successful graphics and advertising business, so
I was interested in the latest and greatest innovations to bring my business
off the light table and onto my computer. In a smallish booth were a couple of
guys peddling new software to enable artists to design direct-mail pieces
from the desktop. Wow! What an innovation! Their inexpensive software even
let you produce your own bar coding for the post office. I fell in love with that
software and used it throughout my graphics career.
Today’s Endicia Internet Postage is based on DAZzle, their award-winning
mailpiece design tool that lets you design envelopes, postcards, and labels
with color graphics, logos, pictures, text messages, and rubber stamps. You
can print your mailing label with postage and delivery confirmation on any-
thing from plain paper (tape it on with clear tape) to fancy 4 x 6 labels in a
label printer from their extensive list of label templates.
DAZzle, combined with their patented Dial-A-Zip, became the basis for
today’s version of the software, which is distributed to all Endicia.com cus-
tomers. There isn’t a more robust mailing program on the market.
Their service also makes International mailings a breeze. From Anniston,
Alabama, to Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, the DAZzle software not only prints
postage but also lists all your shipping options and applicable rates. For
international mailing, it will also advise you as to any prohibitions (for exam-
ple, no prison-made goods can be mailed to Botswana), restrictions, neces-
sary customs forms, and areas served within the country.
A nifty thing that I love about Endicia is that you can highlight the buyer’s
name and address from an e-mail or from your PayPal history, click Copy, and
the data is automatically transferred to their DAZzle software in the address
field area. No pasting needed.
Endicia offers their own private (third-party) package insurance. They also
support U-PIC (one of the first private package insurers catering to online
sellers). The insurance cost is charged to you automatically. Or, in the case of
U-PIC, you can send your monthly insurance logs electronically to U-PIC at
the end of the month — a service that’s integrated into the DAZzle software.
That way, there’s no need to print insurance logs to mail.
306
Part IV: Your eBay Back Office 

If you’re using an auction management service or software, Endicia integrates
directly with the most popular: Channel Advisor, MarketWorks, Andale,
Blackthorne, Dek, and more. Visit www.endicia.com/endicia-
usa/Site/integratedpartners.cfm for the current list.
All the features just listed come with Endicia’s standard plan. Their premium
plan adds customizable e-mail, enhanced online transaction reports and sta-
tistics, business reply mail, return shipping labels (prepaid so your customer
won’t have to pay for the return), and stealth indicias.
With all this, you’d think their service would be expensive, but it’s not. The
standard plan is $9.95 a month ($99.95 if paid annually), and the premium
plan is $15.95 a month ($174.94 annually). For a free sixty-day trial just for my
readers, go to www.endicia.com/coolebaytools.
Stamps.com
Stamps.com purchased thirty-one Internet postage patents from e-stamp,
making its services a combination of the best of both sites. (I was a big fan of
e-stamp, but they discontinued their online postage service late in 2000.)
Many eBay sellers moved their postage business over to Stamps.com, which
is shown in Figure 17-5.
Stamps.com works with software that you probably use every day, integrat-
ing itself into many programs, such as Microsoft Word, Outlook, and Office,
Corel WordPerfect, Palm Desktop, and Quicken.
Figure 17-5:
The
Stamps.com
home page.
307
Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office

Stamps.com offers all the standard features of an online postage service, and
purchasing postage is as easy as going to www.stamps.com and clicking
your mouse. With Stamps.com, you don’t need any extra fancy equipment,
although most introductory deals come with a free 5-pound-maximum scale.
Serious users should get a better quality postage scale from a seller on eBay
or through an office supply store.
To find the Stamps.com introductory deal of the month, visit its Web site.
They charge a flat rate of $15.99 per month. The site regularly offers sign-up
bonuses that include as much as $25.00 free.
Because Office Depot, Staples, and OfficeMax deliver any order more than
$50.00 free the next day, it’s a great place to get paper and labels. Better buys
on scales, though, can be found on eBay, especially if you search postage
scale. I use a super small, 13-pound-maximum scale that I bought on eBay for
only $29.95, complete with a five-year warranty.

Figuring out the best solution for your business
Before deciding which service is the one for
you, check out the current fees and features
offered by each. Following are some of the spe-
cialized features you might want to look for:
 Mac compatibility: If you use a Mac in your
daily business, you need to be sure that your
postage vendor has easy-to-use Mac-com-
patible software that performs all the fea-
tures the service offers on the PC platform.
 Print customs forms for international mail:
Printing postage for international mail isn’t
enough. You must be able to print the asso-
ciated customs forms that go with each
package and their particular level of 
service.
 Mailpiece design: It’s nice to be able to add
your own logo or even slightly customize a
label (within postal guidelines).
 Use your printer to print envelopes: If your
printer allows it, you can even print logo-
designed envelopes along with bar-coded
addresses, your return address, and
postage. This saves quite a bit in label
costs.
 Third-party insurance: Save time and
money using a private postal insurance
company (get the lowdown on this money
saver in Chapter 14). Software that auto-
matically integrates this feature is worth its
weight in gold.
 Integrated package tracking: It’s nice to
have all your shipping data in one place,
and a sophisticated mailing system will
allow you to simply click a button or link to
discover whether your package has been
delivered.
 Hard drive records of shipping: Software
that permits you to keep your shipping
records on your computer is important. That
way, you can check records even if the
server on the Internet is down.

Postage online through PayPal
PayPal continues to add great features for sellers. Now you can not only buy
postage or ship with UPS through PayPal, but also print labels on your own
printer. If you ship lots of items and use a different service for printing your
shipping data (such as the other services mentioned in this chapter), PayPal
allows you to input the tracking information on the site even if you’ve printed
your delivery confirmations with postage elsewhere. Just click the Details
link for the transaction, and then click the Add Tracking Info link that
appears. Input the tracking or delivery confirmation information from USPS,
UPS, or another shipping company on the resulting page, as shown in Figure
17-6, and PayPal sends an e-mail to your buyer with that information.
The information you added appears in both the record of your PayPal trans-
action list and the buyer’s transaction list in their account, as shown in
Figure 17-7. (You can check whether the package has progressed by clicking
the Check Shipment link on the Transaction list.)

Chapter 17: Building an eBay Back Office

PayPal shipping services work great when you’re just starting out in your
eBay business, but once you get rolling, you need a mailing service that
includes e-mail and record keeping, such as Endicia or Stamps.com. When
you process your shipping (UPS or USPS) through PayPal, the shipping
amount is deducted from your PayPal (sales revenue) balance. This is an
important issue.
If you’re starting a business in earnest, you need to keep track of your online
expenses separately (see Chapter 16). Allowing PayPal to deduct your ship-
ping costs from your incoming revenue creates a bookkeeping nightmare. You
need to have exact figures for expense and income — and it really helps keep
confusion to a minimum when your deposits (withdrawals from your PayPal
account to your bank) match your sales receipts. If you want to ship through
PayPal, be sure you withdraw your sales amount from your checking account
before you process your shipping. That way, your shipping can be charged to
your business credit card for easier tracking.
To purchase postage and print your label for a specific purchase, click the
Print Shipping Label button next to the payment record in your PayPal
account overview, as shown in Figure 17-8. You’ll be taken through a step-by-
step process for paying for your shipping and printing the appropriate label
on your printer.

N
ot everyone is a shooting star or even a PowerSeller

tion, I’ve included profiles on some interesting people —
from all walks of life — who’ve turned eBay into a profitable
enterprise, some working only part-time. These are not

Ten (or So) Sellers Who’ve Made
the Jump from Hobby to Profits
In This Chapter
 People who make their living selling at eBay . . .
 . . . and love it!
I
love hearing stories about how much people like eBay. I enjoy it even
more when I hear that they’re doing something that they get pleasure from
while earning a good living. One of the best parts of writing and teaching at
eBay University is talking to the hundreds of sellers who attend my seminars
and send me e-mails. I get the opportunity to bounce ideas around with them
and find out about the creative ways they spend their time at eBay.
I thought you might like to know more about some of the people at eBay, too,
so I interviewed them; it was so much fun getting to know about each of
them. They have different backgrounds and lifestyles — but they all have one
thing in common: eBay!
In favor of highlighting some regular folks at eBay, I dispensed with the cus-
tomary writer thing (you know, finding the largest PowerSellers at eBay to
interview). No one’s a success overnight, and the people I discuss in this
chapter certainly have been plugging away at eBay, increasing their busi-
nesses and becoming successful. I dug through some old feedbacks (all the
way back to 1997) and contacted sellers to see how they’re doing these days.
Here are their stories (and their advice).
Beachcombers!
Member since December 2002; Feedback 4977; Positive feedback 99.7%
eBay store: stores.ebay.com/Beachcombers-Bazaar

Beachcombers! eBay store came into my search when I was looking for some
reasonably priced holiday gifts. I’ve shopped with them continuously since.
The store is run by Jody Rogers and her other half, Asad Bangash.
Asad started on eBay selling car parts for his previous employer. He was suc-
cessful, and after he got addicted to making a profit, he suggested to Jody
that they clean out their house in Ohio and sell things on eBay. After their
house emptied out, they went to neighbors’ houses.
Jody and Asad decided to move to Florida. Changing their home made them
think twice, and rather than getting new jobs, they decided to go into eBay
full-time.
Jody loved Indian glass bangles and khussa shoes and thought that mehndi
(Indian temporary tattoos) were a fun idea. She looked around for sources
and started selling these products on eBay. Now Jody even designs them for
the American market — making popular handmade khussa shoes beautiful
and in sizes that fit the larger U.S. foot. Funny thing, she’s also sold them to
people in India who can’t get the shoes to fit their larger feet! The glass ban-
gles they sell are custom made and are available only in limited quantities.
They’re strong on customer service; they offer a full return policy and have a
toll-free incoming number. They include complete instructions with their
mehndi kits. They’ve also come up with unique ways to get repeat business,
such as the bangle of the month club, where the recipient gets a handmade
bangle stand and Indian glass bangles for the first shipment, and then gets a
new bangle set every month for the duration of their membership. There is
also a Build-A-Bangle line, where you create and design your own bracelet set.
They started with Turbo Lister and now use MarketWorks.
Jody agrees with what I’ve been saying since 1998. Success in an eBay busi-
ness means selling what you know and enjoy. Mailing out merchandise every
day that doesn’t make you happy won’t make for a happy, profitable business
in the long run.
Bubblefast
Member since May 1999; Feedback: 20,597; Positive feedback 100%
eBay store: stores.ebay.com/Bubblefast
I first met the Bubblefast “family” when I needed to move my mother’s things
from Florida to California. When I got the price quote from the moving com-
pany for rolls of cushioning, it was so high I nearly fell over! I knew that I
314
Part V: The Part of Tens 

could find a better price at eBay — and I did. Bubblefast prices were 50 per-
cent less than the moving company had quoted, and they shipped the wrap
directly to my mom’s house so that I could meet it there to wrap her valuables.
The Bubblefast business began with Robin and her husband Alan. Their first
transaction on eBay took place in early 1999, when Alan bought a Macintosh
computer. When it came to finally selling, Alan figured that all eBay sellers
would need shipping supplies. At first, they sold just one product, a 150-foot
roll of 3⁄16” (small size) bubble cushioning. Now they sell more than sixty-five
variations of eight products: bubble cushioning, antistatic bubble wrap,
bubble bags, bubble-lined mailers, rolled shipping foam, boxes, sealing tape,
and stretch film.
Alan passed away in 2001, and Robin and her family carried on the business.
On the bright side, Robin remarried, and now (with a combined family) they
have even more indentured employees. The Le Vine Family — Robin, Mark,
Jenny 20, Steven 14, Sara 12, Michelle 23, and Grandma Gloria — and family
friend Syble work closely together, putting in 70 to 80 hours a week.
A seller with many repeat customers (more than 39,000 positives; repeat cus-
tomers help build businesses!), they decided to branch out and go into con-
signment selling. They registered on eBay as Trading Assistants and now
they’re “up to their eyeballs in new business.” It works out well for them,
because they’re already in the shipping supply business. No package is a
challenge!
They use Turbo Lister for listing their items. Fashion mavens Jenny and
Michelle help write descriptions for consignment listings. Robin still handles
order entry and answers the phone and e-mail. Grandma Gloria and her
friend Syble handle the packing and shipping. They ship anywhere from one
hundred to two hundred orders a day. The family has customers from around
the world who buy from their auctions, eBay store, and Web site (www.
bubblefast.com). Last year, their business grossed $650,000. The profit
margin on the Bubblefast products is low, so they have to make it up in
volume.
eBay has totally changed this family’s lives. Alan used to say “Our family is
together all the time now; we’ve learned to pull together for a common goal.”
It’s still true today with the family business he started.
The Le Vine family’s tip for eBay sellers: “If you want to create a thriving eBay
business and are willing to put the time and energy into it, the possibilities
are endless. With a minimal investment of money, you have the potential to
reach the world! Treat every customer like you want to be treated. After all
this time, the customer is still always right.”

Dans Train Depot
Member since January 1999; Feedback: 20,738; Positive feedback 100%
eBay store: stores.ebay.com/Dans-Train-Depot
Dan Glasure started selling comic books on eBay. Then he sold Legos and
they did well. But his real passion was model trains (and his wife was tired of
a living room full of Legos), so he branched out. He found a train collection
for sale in a local newspaper. He and his father checked out the collection
and were wowed by the price; $27,000.00! Their innate sales sense said that
this was still a good deal, so dad put a second mortgage on the house and
they took the plunge.
He sold trains out of his office at home, and the spare bedroom was the pack-
ing facility. They quickly learned the importance of going above and beyond
in packaging the precious trains carefully.
He did well on the trains and continued purchasing collections locally. Then
he branched out again, buying six brass model trains — having no idea what
they were — and then selling them for about $600 each on eBay. Getting even
braver, they purchased a large brass train collection for $45,000.00. Now
brass trains make up the largest percentage of their sales
(www.brasstrains.com).
Dan’s father passed away in 2000. His employees and his mom still keep up
the great service. They still buy out estates and hobby shops and large col-
lections, so you’ll never know what treasures they will find and put up for
sale on eBay.
Dan’s tip for eBay sellers: “Watch your cash flow. Treat your business profes-
sionally. Keep your profits separate so that you can make it through the slow
times.”

EvanP is a musical instrument and accessories business. They carry musical

Stephen Kline has been an artist for more than thirty-five years. He’s a self-
representing artist who runs his own eBay store. He designed the State of
Florida’s “State of the Arts” license plate and his work has been exhibited
worldwide and featured in “Art in America” and the American Kennel Club. 
Kline’s eBay store specializes in offering his signature dog and animal art
along with his renowned paintings. It all started one Christmas, when he sent
out a Santa lithograph drawn with the words “Season’s Greetings.” When the
next Christmas rolled around, many friends had framed and displayed the art
as part of their holiday celebration. So he decided to try a dog drawing out of
the breed’s name. When he placed the art on eBay, the response was over-
whelming. He sells pictures of more than one hundred breeds now, along with
other charming animals that his buyers love. He’s sold to every state in the
union and more than twenty countries around the world.
Stephen personally operates all functions of his eBay store, with marketing
support from his wife Kris. He’s hands-on all the way, from packing all the art
(guaranteeing a safe delivery) to answering all e-mail requests, questions,
and comments.
He lists manually with his own template.
Stephen’s tip for sellers: “Make sure that you treat the customer like gold.
Good feedback will be the key to success in your business.” Stephen also fol-
lows my advice by sending a note along with every order assuring the cus-
tomer that he appreciates their business.

eBay store: stores.ebay.com/MAGIC-by-MAIL
After twenty years on the job, Jonathan retired from his position as a police
officer in England, came to America, and met his lovely wife Ellen. They dis-
covered eBay together. Jonathan’s lifelong hobby was magic, so he developed
his own magic products and put them up for sale — they sold immediately.
What started as a means to supplement Jonathan’s pension became a bur-
geoning full-time business. They even opened their own Web site at
www.magicbymail.biz.
The best day they ever had on eBay was when they sold more than $3500 of
magic in ten hours! They once made a $1000 plus sale to a magician in
Australia and have had several other single sales between $500 and $900.
Although they devote many hours a day to their eBay business, it has
allowed them to be flexible with their schedules. Ellen is just finishing her
Bachelors degree in Professional Business Communication. She’s applied
much of what she’s learned to their eBay business.
They enjoy buying on eBay too. Their most treasured purchase is an 1857 first
edition magic book, “Magician’s Own Book,” which had been previously owned
by a relative of Martha Washington (the wife of America’s first president).
The biggest challenge in their business is keeping up with its growth! They’ve
had such a steady increase in monthly sales that they’re looking to move
their business to larger quarters. That’s a tough problem to have.
Magic-By-Mail’s tip for new sellers: “Plan ahead, start small, and let your busi-
ness grow. Look after your customers; they are your single biggest asset.
Without customers you would not have a business.” I think those are good
words to live by.

bined strength of the three women “has kept us going.” They’ve also opened
a Web site, www.aromagalaxy.com.
They strive to share their love for quality candles, oils, soaps, and lovely
accessories. They also sell the famous line of Yankee Candles, carrying a
large selection of current, retired, and hard-to-find scents.
They travel wherever they hear there is a good bargain. They visit
trade shows to meet with distributors and artists who create unique candle
products. This way, they can form a relationship with their sources so that
they’re always abreast of what is new for the next season.
They ship as soon as they receive payment. They believe that as soon as you
have paid for an item you want to have the item in your hands, so shipping
the item is equally as important as the merchandise.
What tip do Mary, Joanne, and Roz have for sellers? “We look towards what
we would want for ourselves and how we would want to be treated. This is
the philosophy we strive to put in practice with our customers.”

Robert McMahan was (and is) a talented freelance New York photographer.
Originally from Los Angeles, he began shooting pictures in 1991. Since 2001,
he has concentrated most of his work in the area of journalism. He continues
to build a body of travel, scenic, and holiday images, which lead to many
photographs for sale. Like many other people living in New York on
September 11, 2001, his life was changed. Heading down to the twin towers
with his camera, Robert caught a now-famous photo of firefighters entering
the smoke and dust of the collapsed World Trade Center, named “Walk of
Courage.”
Photography is his passion, “be it on the street capturing the often-
overlooked moments of everyday life, or in the lab producing the most 
stunning print possible.” That’s what Robert sells on eBay. He sells quality
photographs from both the Robert McMahan Collection and his RMP Archive
Collections, producing high-quality prints of some of the greatest documen-
tary photos ever taken.

A while back, I needed a rubber stamp or two for my business and didn’t
have time to go out to a printing store and place an order. I thought surely
someone on eBay sells custom rubber stamps! I was right. That’s when I met
Jeff Stannard of Melrose Stamp Company. He specializes in self-inking custom
rubber stamps and also sells stock design stamps.
Jeff was an assistant in a New York State economic development agency when
he started his part-time business on eBay. Being around entrepreneurs gave
him the inspiration he needed to quit his job and take his part-time sales to
the next level.
He’s had his eBay store since 2001 and works the business with his wife,
Donna, and his Mom, Diane. His biggest sale came from a Chamber of
Commerce in South Carolina. They ordered sixty-five custom stamps to use
for a promotional day, where various merchants stamp a customer’s card
indicating that the customer visited the store.
eBay has changed his life. No longer a nine-to-fiver, Jeff works more than sixty
hours a week. All his life he wanted to run his own business. “My business
model would fail if it were locally based only. With eBay, I’m living my dream
and selling my products globally. It’s a life of independence, free from the cor-
porate rat race!”
Jeff’s advice to new eBay sellers? “Invest time to create a business plan. A
business plan will help you identify your strengths and weaknesses, threats
and opportunities. Build into the plan a set of financial projections as well;
this will help you to clearly identify investment and working capital needs.
Treat your eBay operation as a real, sustainable business and you will go far!”

Looking around eBay for some unique items, I ran across Clarissa Parashar’s
eBay store, Perpetual Vogue. Clarissa, a native Southern Californian, has
developed a store with a style of its own. The store specializes in rock ’n roll,
musician, tattoo design, biker, and streetwear apparel and accessories.
She discovered eBay as a buyer and found it to be a fabulous marketplace to
find great items. After six months, she thought she’d like to become a seller.
That timing coincided with the first eBay Live Convention in Anaheim
California, which she attended. She was inspired to take a chance on an eBay
business. (She attended my class too!)
Her eBay business took off and she opened an eBay store to further expand
her sales. Although Clarissa runs the business, she gets quite a bit of help
from her family. Her husband often serves as the model for menswear. Her
mom is retired with lots of energy and helps when new shipments come in —
unpacking items, inventorying sizes, and folding the items away into their
bins.
This shrewd businesslady increases sales through marketing. She promotes
through a page on MySpace and sends out a regular newsletter to her cus-
tomers. Two years after she started sales on eBay, she opened her own Web
site, www.tattooapparel.com. The retail bug really hit her and she just
opened a retail store in LaHabra, California.
Clarissa bonds her transactions through BuySAFE so that her customers
receive a surety bond on their purchase that guarantees performance. “This
takes the risk out of shopping online for my customers. The customer pays
nothing for this added benefit. It is paid for by me as I feel the most impor-
tant thing I as a merchant can do is to give the customer confidence so that
they have the freedom to shop online without worry.”

Sally Severance is an eBay seller, a mother of four valedictorians, and a
rancher specializing in purebred Charolais cattle (her ranch Web site is
www.sdcbulls.com). She also runs a North Dakota farm with her husband.
She gave up a successful ten-year banking career to stay home with her
family, and by the way, she buys and sells at eBay.
From her ranch in North Dakota, Sally sells collectibles and general merchan-
dise on eBay to supplement her income. The twenty-five to thirty hours a
week that she spends on eBay earn her the money to buy things that she
wants.
Sally also shops for her family on eBay and considers that part of her busi-
ness. She can save money by finding special things for her children and
grandchildren. She has one daughter, Robyn, who is married with two chil-
dren, and three sons: Ryan, an engineer; Randy, a recent college graduate
working on the farm; and Rod, in the Army and recently returned after serv-
ing his second tour in Iraq. She has made many friends on eBay and enjoys
personal contact with customers. Sally spent an entire year using her eBay
earnings sending weekly care packages to our troops in Iraq.
Her new eBay store is slowly filling with items. She does not use software to
list her auctions but may do so in the future as her inventory grows.
Sally’s tip for eBay sellers: “My #1 tip on setting up a business on eBay is to
be honest, especially when writing a description of what you are selling!”

Your Merchandise

 Selling it cheap: A last-ditch effort
W
hen a corner of your eBay merchandise area becomes the graveyard
of unsold stuff (at some point it will — believe me), whatcha gonna
do? Inevitably, you’ll find yourself holding on to some merchandise that you
feel may never scrape together a profit, and you’ll become sick of looking at
it. (Besides, you undoubtedly have some cash tied up in it.) Whether you
have hundreds of salad spinners that are suddenly appearing in multiple 
auctions or you jumped on the opportunity to buy a truckload (literally) of
bargain-priced cat-scratching posts, you have to make room for this stuff
immediately or sell it fast.
Every business has a problem with excess inventory, so don’t feel bad about
it. You can’t expect to bat a thousand every time you select a product to sell.
The key is getting rid of excess merchandise while losing minimal amounts
on your investment. None of your merchandise is trash — I hope — so some-
one out there will want it and will pay something for it. If not, you can always
donate it and take a tax write-off. In this chapter, I highlight the top ten ways
to move that superfluous merchandise and still save your investment.

Donate to Charitable Organizations
Charitable donations are my favorite way of unloading unwanted items. Not
only are you doing something good for someone else, but your donation may
be a 100-percent business write-off. My community — no doubt yours too —
has many private schools, churches, and synagogues. What these places all
have in common are putting on fundraisers (auctions, raffles, tournaments,
bingo) and welcoming donations. You have to give the best stuff to your
schools or churches — especially if your item will be some sort of prize.
Some organizations even make up gift baskets of varied items to put together
a higher-value prize. Charities will often gratefully take boxes of miscella-
neous stuff (think Salvation Army and Goodwill).
Classy gifting
Something I like to do is put together little gift baskets for charity auctions.
I’ll take a bunch of female-related, male-related, or kids’ items and put them in
a basket on a base of shredded Sunday comics. I keep a roll of clear cello-
phane on hand to wrap the entire thing. I then top it off with a nice big bow.
It’s always an appreciated donation and, wrapped up this way, it always gets
a higher price at bazaars or silent auctions.
Online charities
One of my favorite Web sites, MissionFish.com (see Figure 19-1), joined
with eBay to organize eBay Giving Works. MissionFish helps nonprofit organi-
zations support their missions by teaching them to fish and to build their
own fisheries (to paraphrase the parable). Select your charity from the more
than ten thousand on their approved list, and MissionFish does the rest. See
Chapter 2 for more on charity auctions on eBay.
When an item sells, you (the donor) are responsible for shipping the item.
You must use a shipping company that supplies a tracking number, which
you submit to eBay Giving Works. (In addition to the item, the entire cost of
shipping is tax deductible.) After the winner receives the item, all proceeds
are sent from MissionFish to the designated nonprofit. You then receive a
thank-you letter as proof of your gift for IRS tax purposes. You’ll have a write-
off, and you’ll feel good about what you did to help others.
324
Part V: The Part of Tens 

eBay Giving Works (through MissionFish) has raised more than $34 million
for nonprofits to date. Many sellers have found that by participating in this
program and contributing a portion of their sales to a charity, they’ve
increased their bids and final sale prices. This merchandising model makes a
lot of sense because it helps your other listings as well. By donating your pro-
ceeds (or a portion of them) to a charity, you build an image of being a caring
business on eBay rather than just another seller. Remember these facts:
 Listings stand out with a Giving Works ribbon icon.
 Your chosen nonprofit’s mission statement is on every listing that 
benefits them.
 Each donation is tax deductible (MissionFish provides the receipt for
you).
 The eBay fee credit policy rewards your generosity.
Many other charities accept gifts-in-kind, items that are new or gently used
that they resell to raise funds. I’ve brought excess eBay inventory to the
American Cancer Society’s Discovery Shop, and they’ve been very gracious
about the donations. Now they also sell on eBay (aside from their many retail
locations) under their own user ID.

Chapter 19: Ten Other Places to Move Your Merchandise

Have a Garage Sale
Garage sales draw big crowds when promoted properly, and you’ll be sur-
prised at the amount of stuff you’ll unload. An especially good time to have a
garage sale is late fall or early winter — just in time for the holidays. (Before
it freezes)!
Because you’ve probably been to a bunch of garage sales but maybe haven’t
given one in a long time, here are a few reminders:
 Plan the sale at least three weeks in advance: Decide on the weekend
of your sale well beforehand and be sure to set a specific opening time. If
you welcome early birds (people who like to show up at 6 or 7 a.m.), be
sure to put that in your ad and flyers.
 Invite neighbors to participate: The more the merrier, right? Also, the
bigger the sale, the more customers you’re likely to entice. Everyone can
drum up at least a few items for a garage sale.
 Gather and price items to go in the sale: After you set a date, immedi-
ately start putting things aside and pricing them with sticky tags. This
way, you won’t have to scramble the day before to find things.
 Place a classified ad: Call your local newspaper a week before the sale
and ask the friendly classified department people when the best time is
to run an ad. Take their advice — they know what they’re talking about!
Also consider placing the ad on their online site.
 Make flyers to post around the neighborhood: Fire up your computer
and make a flyer; include your address, a map, the date, and the starting
time. Be sure to mention special items that you’ve thrown into the sale
to bring ’em in and mention also that many items are new. If two or three
families are participating in the sale, mention that too. If you have small
throwaway types of items, include the line “Prices start at 25 cents.”
Hang the flyers in conspicuous places around your neighborhood.
 Post large signs on nearby corners: The day before the sale, put up
large posters advertising the sale. (You can pick up 22 x 28 poster board
from an art store or office supply store.) When you make the posters,
use thick black shipping markers on brightly colored boards. Use few
words, including only the basic details, for example: “Garage Sale June
22–24, 8 a.m., Tons of Stuff, 1234 Extra Cash Blvd.” Also make a sign to
hang at the sale location “Sale Continues Tomorrow. New Items Will Be
Added!”
 Clean up any dusty or dirty items: If you want someone to buy an item
for a good price, you have to make it look good.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Gather supplies: Get lots of change; make sure you have plenty of tens,
fives, a ton of singles, and several rolls of coins. Get a calculator for each
person who will be taking money. Set aside a box to use as the cash box.
(Cigar boxes work nicely.) Collect all the supermarket shopping bags
that you can for those with multiple purchases.
 Hang helium balloons to draw attention to your signs: The day of the
sale, go to the busiest corner near your sale and tie some helium bal-
loons to your sign — that’s sure to attract attention. Do the same thing
at the corner near your sale and also at the curb of the sale.
 Display everything in an orderly fashion: Pull out your old card tables
and arrange items so that people can easily see what’s there; a literal
pile of junk’ll turn them off. Hang clothes on a temporary rack (or use a
clothesline on the day of the sale).
 Get ready to negotiate: Talk to people when they approach, use your
selling talents, and make that sale!
At the end of your sale, be sure to take down the signs you’ve plastered all
over the neighborhood. It’s the nice thing to do.
Rent a Table at the Local Flea Market
Local swap meets or flea markets (regularly scheduled events where you can
rent space for a token fee and sell your wares) can be a great place to meet
other eBay sellers. But whatever you do, don’t mention that you sell on eBay.
Let the customers think that you’re a rube and that they can get the best of
you. Offer great deals; give ’em a discount if they buy a ton of stuff. Just like
with a garage sale (see the preceding section), you can move lots of merchan-
dise here.
Don’t forget to try to unload your goods to other sellers; perhaps they can do
with a little extra inventory. Check the classifieds of local newspapers for
swap meets, which occur once a month in some towns.
If you have a weekly Farmer’s Market in your area, check it out. This might be
a great place to buy a table for a few hours — especially if you’re selling
related (culinary or home) items.
327
Chapter 19: Ten Other Places to Move Your Merchandise

Consign Merchandise to the 
Local Antique Mall
An antique mall is a retail store that’s often run by several people who take
your merchandise on consignment. You can probably find a few in your area.
Your items are sold in the store (good for you), and the storeowners take a
commission on each sale (good for them). They take your items, tag them
with your own identifying tag, and display them for sale. Antique malls usu-
ally see an enormous amount of foot traffic, and this may be as close to
having a retail store that you’ll ever get.
Take a Booth at a Community Event
Where I live, the local business community often holds special events: street
fairs, Fourth of July extravaganzas, pumpkin festivals, and more. As a vendor,
you can buy a booth at such events to peddle your wares. For seasonal
events, purchasing a bunch of holiday-related items to make your table
match the festivities is a savvy marketing idea. Your excess eBay inventory
will just be part of the display — and a big part of your sales. You might even
consider donating a percentage of your sales to a local nonprofit to help
boost traffic.
If the event is in the evening, purchase a few hundred glow-in-the-dark
bracelets on eBay (you can often get one hundred for $20). The kids love
them and will drag their parents to your booth. Be creative and think of other
ways to make your booth stand out. Support your community, have a barrel
of fun, and make some money!
Resell to Sellers on eBay
Sell your items to other eBay sellers. Hee hee, only kidding (maybe not).
Maybe another seller (your competition) is selling the same items but is
doing a better job with those items than you. If so, offer to sell your stock to
that seller. It’s a win-win situation. Perhaps some of the stuff you have may
appeal to the locals in your community (some of whom probably sell on
eBay).
Package up your items into related lots that will appeal to sellers who are
looking for merchandise online. Take a tip from the successful eBay seller
that often combines many lost packages into single lots to sell on eBay: the
Post Office Mail Recovery Center. If you’re overstocked with stuffed animals,
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

put together a lot of a dozen. If you don’t have a dozen of any one item, make
packages of related items that will appeal to a certain type of seller.
Be sure to use the words liquidation, wholesale, or resale (or all three) in your
title. A world of savvy sellers is out there looking for items to sell. Maybe
another seller can move the items later or in a different venue.
Note that eBay has Wholesale subcategories for almost every sort of mer-
chandise.
Visit a Local Auctioneer
Yes, when I say you should visit a local auctioneer, I mean a real live auction-
eer, one who holds live auctions at real auction houses that real people
attend. Many people enjoy going to live auctions. (I recommend that you go
occasionally to acquire unique items to resell on eBay.) Shopping at auctions
can be addictive (duh), and live auctions attract an elite group of knowledge-
able buyers.
The basic idea is to bring your stuff to an auctioneer, who auctions off lots for
you. Good auctioneers, such as those at the Los Angeles Bonhams &
Butterfields (www.bonhams.com), can get a crowd going, bidding far more
than an item was expected to sell for. Bonhams & Butterfields Appraisal Days
page is shown in Figure 19-2.

329
Chapter 19: Ten Other Places to Move Your Merchandise

Here are a few facts about real live auctioneers and some pointers to keep in
mind when looking for one:
 Make sure that the auction house you choose is licensed to hold auc-
tions in your state, insured, and bonded. You don’t want to leave your
fine merchandise with someone who will pack up and disappear with
your stuff before the auction.
 Get the details before agreeing to the consignment. Many auction
houses give you at least 75 percent of the final hammer price. Before you
consign your items, ask the auctioneer’s representative about the
details, such as
• When will the auction be held?
• How often are the auctions held?
• Have you sold items like this before? If so, how much have they
sold for in the past?
• Will there be a printed catalog for the sale, and will my piece be
shown in it?
Get the terms and conditions in writing and have the rep walk you
through every point so that you thoroughly understand each one.
 Search the Internet. Type licensed auctions and see what you come up
with; it can’t hurt.
 Contact local auctioneers. If your items are of good quality, a local auc-
tion house may be interested in taking them on consignment.
Find Specialty Auction Sites
If you have some specialized items that just don’t sell very well on eBay, you
might look for a different venue. Although eBay is the best all-purpose selling
site in the world, you may have an item that only a specialist in the field can
appreciate.
For example, I’ve seen some fine works of art not sell on eBay. But don’t fret,
you’ll find many other places online where you can sell these items. For
example, I searched Yahoo! for art auctions. Under the Web Results heading, I
found more than six million Web sites that auction artwork. You might want
to refine your search with your telephone area code so that you find auction
locations in your immediate area.
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You may find an online auctioneer who specializes in the particular item you
have for sale, something too esoteric for the eBay crowd. I’ve found some
incredible bargains for myself on elegant new sunglasses made by a company
in Italy called Persol, a company world famous for crystal lenses and ultra-
fine quality. The super-famous wear these sunglasses: Robert De Niro, Tom
Cruise, Donald Trump, Sharon Stone, Mel Gibson, and Cindy Crawford. These
sunglasses normally retail from $150–$300 a pair, but you can sometimes find
them on eBay for as low as $40. Unless you’re buying them dirt cheap, you’re
not making your profits on eBay. Maybe the crowd just doesn’t know about
them, but they sell well elsewhere.
Run a Classified Liquidation Ad
Sell your special items in the appropriate categories of the classifieds. Sell
the rest of them in preassigned bulk lots for other sellers. When you write the
ad, make your lots sound fantastic; give the reader a reason to call you. When
they call, be excited about your merchandise. But be honest and tell them
you’re just selling the stuff to raise cash.

extreme circumstances (such as when you type the wrong numerals).

bid shielding: An illegal process wherein two bidders work together to
defraud a seller out of high bids by retracting a bid at the last minute and

due to eBay’s new bid retraction policy; see also bid retraction.
bonding: A surety bond can be issued by a third party (usually an insurance
company) to guarantee a seller’s performance in a transaction.
card not present: Credit card services use this term to describe transactions

titles to describe items that are, uh, hard to find.
invoice: A bill that outlines the items in a specific transaction, who the item

the UPC on a can of beans, the ISBN identifies a book by a universal number.
keystone: In the brick-and-mortar retailing world, 100 percent markup. A
product sells for keystone if it sells for twice the wholesale price. Products
that you can sell at keystone are very nice to find.

merchandise, a portion to gas for business-related outings, and yet another
portion to eBay fees, you must post each amount to its own category.
tax deduction: An expenditure on your part that represents a normal and
necessary expense for your business. Before you get carried away and
assume that every penny you spend is a write-off (deduction), check with
your tax professional to outline exactly what is and what isn’t.
TOS: Terms of service. eBay has a TOS agreement; check it out at pages.
ebay.com/help/policies/user-agreement.html.
W-9: A form that must be filled out by any outside contractor you pay for ser-
vices. This form includes the contractor’s Social Security number and
address. Your outside contractors must give you an invoice for each payment
that you make to them. You use the information from this form to issue your
1099s at the end of the year. See also 1099.
wholesale: Products sold to retailers (that’s you) at a price above the manu-
facturer’s cost, allowing for a mark-up to retail. I hope you buy most of your
merchandise at wholesale. Stores such as Costco or Sam’s Club sell items in
bulk at prices marginally over wholesale. You must get a resale number from
your state to buy at true wholesale.

The Hows and Whys of 
a Home Network
W
hat is a network? A network is a way to connect computers so that
they can communicate with each other — as if they were one giant
computer with different terminals. The best part is that a network enables
high-speed Internet connection sharing, as well as the sharing of printers and
other peripherals. By setting up a computer network, one computer might
run bookkeeping, another might run a graphics server, and others might be
used as personal PCs for different users. From each networked computer, it’s
possible to access programs and files on all other networked computers.
Today’s technologies allow you to perform this same miracle on the home
network. You can connect as many computers as you like, and run your busi-
ness from anywhere in your home — you can even hook up your laptop from
the bedroom if you don’t feel like getting out of bed.
Now for the whys of a home network. A network is a convenient way to run a
business. All big companies use them, and so should you. You can print your
postage, for example, on one printer from any computer in your home or
office. You can extend your DSL line or Internet cable connection so that you
can use it anywhere in your home — as well as in your office.
In a network, you can set certain directories in each computer to be shared.
That way, other computers on the network can access those directories. You
can also password-protect certain files and directories to prevent others —
your children or your employees — from accessing them.
I devote the rest of this appendix to a quick-and-dirty discussion of home net-
works installed on Windows-based PCs. I give you a lesson on what I know
works for most people. (Hey, if it doesn’t work, don’t e-mail me — head back
to the store and get your money back!)
At this point, I want to remind you that I’m not a techno-whiz (just like I’m not
a lawyer or an accountant). For more information about anything you’d think
to ask about home networking, I defer to Kathy Ivens, author of Home
Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition (published by Wiley).

What I know about home networks, I’ve found out the hard way — from the
school of hard knocks. A lot of research went into this appendix as well, so
humor me and read on.
Variations of a Home Network
Basically, you have a choice of three types of home networks: Ethernet, pow-
erline, and wireless. See Table B-1 for a quick rundown of some pros and cons
of each.
Table B-1
Network Pros and Cons
Type
Pros
Cons
Traditional Ethernet
Fast, cheap, and easy setup
Computers and printers
must be hardwired;
cables run everywhere
Powerline
Fast; your home is already 
Electrical interference 
prewired with outlets
may degrade the signal
Wireless network
Pretty fast; wireless 
Expensive; may not be
(no ugly cords to deal with)
reliable because of inter-
ference from home elec-
trical devices
Many people still use an Ethernet connection to hardwire their main (desk-
top) computer to connect to a wireless router. If you have an office, it’s nice
to know that Ethernet cabling will work over 300 feet in distance. You can
then connect laptops (and desktops) throughout the house via wireless and
powerline.
The wireless network is the hot ticket and highly touted by the world in gen-
eral these days. However, in a home office setting, the wireless signal may
experience interference because many networks run with the same 2.4 GHz
technology as some home wireless telephones. I have a wireless network and
it works great. My primary network hookup is via Ethernet. But it’s actually a
hybrid, combining Ethernet, powerline, and wireless.
With broadband over powerline, you get high-speed Internet directly into
your home electrical system. Just plug in your powerline boxes (more on that
later) and you’re up and running!
342
Part VI: Appendixes 

All networks need the following two devices:
 Router: A router allows you to share a single Internet IP address among
multiple computers. A router does exactly what its name implies; it
routes signals and data to the different computers on your network. If
you have one computer, the router can act as a firewall or even a net-
work device leading to a print server (a gizmo that attaches to your
router and allows you to print directly to a printer without having
another computer on).
 Modem: You need a modem for an Internet connection. You get one from
your cable or phone company and plug it into an outlet with cable (just
like your TV) or into a special phone jack if you have DSL. The modem
connects to your router with an Ethernet cable.
If you have broadband, you don’t even need to have a main computer turned
on to access the connection anywhere in the house. If you keep a printer
turned on (and have a print server), you can also connect that to your router
and print from your laptop in another room — right through the network.
Hooking up with wireless
Wireless networking — also known as WiFi or, to the more technically
inclined, IEEE 802.11 — is the hot technology for all kinds of networks. It’s an
impressive system when it works, with no cables or connectors to bog you
down.
If you’re worried about your next-door neighbor hacking into your computer
through your wireless connection, stop worrying. Wireless networks are pro-
tected by their own brand of security, called WEP (or Wired Equivalent
Privacy). WEP encrypts your wireless transmissions and prevent others from
getting into your network. Another flavor of security is WPA, which is even
more secure. Although super-hackers have cracked this system, it’s the best
currently available for the home office user.
To link your laptop or desktop to a wireless network with WEP (or WPA)
encryption, you have to enter a key code from the wireless access point. Just
enter it into your wireless card software on every computer (or system-based
software) that uses the network, and you should be good to go.
You may get confused when you see the different types of wireless available.
Here’s the lowdown on the variations:
343
Appendix B: The Hows and Whys of a Home Network

 802.11a: This wireless format works really well — fast with good connec-
tivity. It’s also very expensive. This format is used when you have to
connect a large group, such as at a convention center or in a dormitory.
It delivers data at speeds as high as 54 Mbps (megabits per second). It
runs at the 5 GHz band (hence its nickname, WiFi5), so it doesn’t have
any competition for bandwidth with wireless phones or microwave
ovens.
 802.11b: My laptop has a built-in 802.11b connection, so I can log on to
the popular hotspots in Starbucks and airports. It’s the most common
wireless type, and it’s used on the most platforms. It travels over the 2.4
GHz band. The 802.11b version is slower than the 802.11a version, trans-
ferring data at only 11 Mbps.
The lower frequency of 2.4 GHz drains less power from laptops and
other portable devices, so laptop batteries will last longer. Also, 2.4 GHz
signals travel farther and can work through walls and floors more effec-
tively than 5 GHz signals.
 802.11g: This flavor is based on the 2.4 GHz band. It speeds data up to a
possible 54 Mbps, and it’s backward compatible with 802.11b service.
 802.11n: The latest fastest form of wireless, 802.11n is a dual frequency
that works through MIMO (multiple input/multiple output) technology. It
travels further and faster than any of the other formats — I’m using it
now as I write this, and it’s amazing!
Installing your wireless network isn’t a gut-wrenching experience either
(although it can be if the signal doesn’t reach where you want it). You hook
up your computer (a laptop works best) to the wireless access point (the
gizmo with the antenna that broadcasts your signal throughout your home or
office) to perform some setup tasks such as choosing your channel and set-
ting up your WEP (or WPA) code. (The wireless access point comes with its
own instructions.)
After you complete the setup and turn on your wireless access point, you
have a WiFi hotspot in your home or office. Typically, a hotspot provides cov-
erage for about 100 feet in all directions, although walls and floors cut down
on the range.
Here are some simplified steps on configuring your network:
1. Run a cable from your cable connection, or a phone cord from your
DSL line, to your modem.
2. Connect one Ethernet cable from your modem to your router.
3. Connect one Ethernet cable to your wireless access point.
Take a look at the network diagram from Netgear in Figure B-1.

Part VI: Appendixes 

Extending wireless with powerline
An ingenious invention, a powerline wireless extender uses your existing
home powerlines to carry your network and your high-speed Internet con-
nection. You access the network by plugging a powerline adapter wired to
your router into an electrical outlet on the wall. Then, another little box can
be placed farther away in your home to broadcast an additional wireless
signal. Standard powerline networks have been around for a while; this is the
second round of technological advances.
I have a powerline wireless extender so I can bring my network out to the
garage and to far points in my home.
Hooking up a wireless powerline extender is so easy that it’s a bit disappoint-
ing — you’ll wonder why it isn’t more complicated. Most installations work
immediately right out of the box. Hooking up the wireless/powerline network
goes like this:
Cable/DSL
Modem
Firewall
Router
Internet
Notebook PC with
802.11b Wireless
PC Card
802.11g Wireless

Desktop PC with
802.11g Wireless

Appendix B: The Hows and Whys of a Home Network

1. The high-speed connection comes in through your DSL or cable line.
2. Plug the cable line (or phoneline for DSL) into your modem.
3. Connect one “in” Ethernet cable from your modem to a router.
4. Connect the “out” Ethernet cable to the wireless powerline extender.
5. Plug the wireless powerline extender into a convenient wall outlet.
6. Plug the wireless powerline receiver box into a convenient wall outlet
wherever you want to extend the signal.
That’s it!
