About the Author
Pets and their quirks have been a part of Wendy Bedwell-Wilson’s
life for as long as she can remember, but it was through her profes-
sion that she grew to truly appreciate them. After working in the
publishing industry as a writer and editor for a variety of pet-themed
trade, consumer, and online magazines for nearly 15 years, she 
ventured outside the cubicle and delved into writing professionally
about four-legged friends from her home in Hawaii.
Her work has appeared in a range of pet publications, including Pet
Product News, Veterinary Practice News, DogChannel.com, Cat Fancy,
Koi World, FAMA, Aquarium Fish, Cats USA, Kittens USA, and the
Popular Pets series. She completed one book — Yorkshire Terriers
for the Animal Planet Pet Care Library series — before tackling
Boston Terriers For Dummies. Her muses include a rescued Pointer-
Hound mutt named Pete and two spoiled cats, Bubba and Benny.
They’re no Boston Terriers, but they’re still little gentlemen.


Dedication
To my mother, Ruth Bedwell, the strongest woman I know.

Introduction
I
f you’ve picked up this book, you’re either considering whether
to add a Boston Terrier to your life or you have already.
Educating yourself is the first — and most important — step in
becoming a responsible pet parent. Kudos to you for furthering
your knowledge about the breed!
Learning about Boston Terriers, however, is just the beginning.
After you encounter a Boston and get a feel for her good-natured
personality, see how intelligent and devoted she is to her owner,
understand her diverse and American-bred origins, and experience
what a sheer delight she is to be around, you’ll be hooked for life.
Making the most of your human-pet relationship involves not only
educating yourself about what makes your dog tick, but also realizing
how to nurture her and help her develop into the dog she was born
to be: a devoted friend, wise companion, and all-around dapper dog.
About This Book
This book serves as a reference guide for life with your Boston
Terrier. Its purpose is twofold: First, it’ll help you decide whether 
a Boston is the right breed for you and your family. Some families
want a larger breed like a Labrador; others want a fluffy lapdog,
like a Bichon Frisé. These pages break down the basics and give
you enough practical insight to make an informed decision about
whether a Boston will fit into your household.
Second, this book addresses some basic questions about the breed
and general dog care. You’ll find answers to questions like:
 Where did the breed originate, and why?
 What is a Boston’s temperament like?
 How do I prepare my home for her arrival?
 Will a Boston get along with children and other pets?
 How do I housetrain my Boston?
 What are her basic nutritional and grooming requirements?
 What are some common health concerns associated with the
breed?
 In case of a medical emergency, what do I do?

Conventions Used in This Book
This book contains a lot of information, so to help you navigate
through the text, I set up a few stylistic conventions, including:
 Italics: Italic type is used for emphasis and to highlight new
words or terms that are defined.
 Bold: Boldfaced text is used to highlight points in a series 
and bring attention to key concepts.
 Monofont: Monofont is used for Web sites and e-mail
addresses.
You’ll notice one other convention, and that’s the alternating use of
masculine and feminine pronouns. With the help of my astute copy
editor, I alternated between male and female, chapter by chapter.
I’m not trying to give our four-legged friends human qualities; it
just seems much more personable to use “he” and “she” rather
than “it.”
What You’re Not to Read
The information in this book ranges from the absolutely essential —
like how to provide adequate nutrition for your Boston — to the 
not-so-important — like how handlers dress in the dog-show ring.
You can find the necessary reading within the body of the book, 
but you can find the nonessential information in two places:
 Sidebars: The shaded boxes of text that appear throughout
the chapters contain supplementary information you can 
skip or flip through later. It’s interesting stuff, but it’s not 
necessary.
 Paragraphs highlighted with the Technical Stuff icon: If
you’re the type who likes to know why or how, you’ll appreci-
ate the technical information contained in these paragraphs.
You can, however, skip those nitty-gritty tidbits and still glean
what you need to know about Bostons.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I assumed several things about you and the
type of information you’d be looking for:
Boston Terriers For Dummies 
2

 You either have a Boston or you’re seriously thinking about
adopting one.
 You’re enamored with the breed and want to know more
about its history, distinguishing characteristics, and care
requirements.
 You’ve adopted your first Boston and you’re not sure what
specific things your dog will need.
 You have some experience with dogs, but you can use a
refresher course in basic care and training.
 You’re overwhelmed with all those doggy doodads that are
out there and you’re looking for some guidance.
 You’re having difficulty with housetraining or obedience, and
you’re looking for practical advice.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is put together in a logical way that allows you to find
information quickly and easily. It contains five parts, each dedi-
cated to a particular topic and broken down into several chapters
that go into greater detail.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier
This first part gives you a general overview of what to expect in
this book, and it provides an overview of the breed’s history and
temperament. It describes where and how the dog originated, what
a Boston needs, and what will be required of you and your family.
Ideally, you’ll read the chapters in this part before you adopt your
puppy so you know what you’re getting yourself into! Deciding to
add a Boston to your family is an important decision that will take
some education. Part I is a great place to start.
Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier
After you’ve decided to welcome a Boston into your life, you’ll
need to start thinking about how to care for her. This part guides
you through how to puppy proof your home and yard, what prod-
ucts you’ll absolutely need, how to provide for her nutritional
needs, and how to keep her looking her best.

You’ll also see the importance of setting up regular schedules for
your Boston. Dogs are creatures of habit and like routine in their
lives, from eating in the same place to going for walks at the same
time every day. Part II will help you through the different routines
to set up for your dog and your family.
Part III: Stepping Out
Well-trained and well-behaved dogs are a joy to be around. This
part delves into how to mold your dog into a healthy and happy
adult who thrives on being around humans and other dogs. You’ll
find out how to housetrain your dog. You’ll understand the impor-
tance of proper socialization at all stages of her life. And you’ll get
an introduction to basic training, competition, and trial events.
Because your Boston will likely shadow you wherever you go —
from the grocery store to Grandma’s house — you’ll want to keep
her safe while traveling. Part III also outlines ways to restrain your
dog in the car and how to prepare her for an airplane journey. If
you can’t take her with you, this section also describes how to find
a reputable dog sitter or dog daycare center.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being
Perhaps the most important portion of the book, Part IV addresses
health and well-being issues through all stages of your Boston’s
life. It offers guidelines for basic Boston care, including what to
expect during your dog’s first veterinary visit, breed-specific ail-
ments, first aid, and senior care.
You’ll also get an introduction to vaccinations, internal and exter-
nal parasites, and details about the special needs of brachycephalic
breeds (dogs with short heads), like your Boston. After reading
this section, you’ll have plenty to discuss with your veterinarian!
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part contains two chapters that give you fun facts about
Boston Terriers. You’ll find out ten interesting facts about the
breed and discover ten ways to enhance your pet’s life.

Icons Used In This Book
A useful feature in the For Dummies series, icons draw your atten-
tion to — or away from — particular types of information. I use the
following icons throughout the book:
This icon appears wherever a bit of advice can save you time,
money, hassle, or stress.
This icon points out important information that’s worth 
remembering.
When you see this icon, pay particular attention to the paragraph
next to it. It highlights information about dangers that could cause
your dog harm.
For those detail-oriented readers, the Technical Stuff icon indicates
interesting but unnecessary information that you can skip.
Where to Go From Here
Each chapter and part of this book is self-contained, so you can
jump to just about anywhere and find complete information.
Though you’ll get a more well-rounded understanding of Bostons 
if you read the book from cover to cover, you don’t have to, espe-
cially if you’re looking for a certain topic, like how to housetrain
your dog (Chapter 9), what to expect during your first veterinary
visit (Chapter 14), where the breed originated (Chapter 2), or what
kennel to purchase (Chapter 5). The Index will guide you to more
specific topics.
A logical place to start, of course, is Chapter 1, which is a general
overview of the book, and Chapter 2, which details the breed’s 
history, standard, and temperament. Regardless of where you
begin, however, you’re about to embark on a new adventure —
with your Boston!

B
efore you welcome a dog into your life, one of the
ﬁrst things you’ll do is ﬁnd out all you can about the
different breeds. You’ll research magazines, Web sites, and
books like this one. You’ll talk to breeders, dog club repre-
sentatives, friends, and neighbors. You’ll gather as much
information as you can so that you will choose the right
type of dog for your family.
In this ﬁrst section of Boston Terriers For Dummies, you
get an overview of the breed’s history and temperament.
It prompts you to take a look at your family’s lifestyle, lead-
ing you to decide whether the Boston Terrier will make a
ﬁtting addition to your household. You also understand
how to ﬁnd a reputable breeder and how to identify the
perfect pup for you.
You may ﬁnd, after reading this ﬁrst section, that a Boston
isn’t right for your family. Maybe you’re looking for a larger
breed or a petite lap dog. If that’s the case, that’s okay!
It’s better to decide that before you bring the puppy home.
But if you breeze through this section and still want to
share your life with a Boston, you’re on your way to a 
life-changing experience!

 Exploring Boston Terriers’ ancestors and canine appeal
 Understanding a pup’s basic needs
 Realizing the importance of housetraining and obedience
 Knowing how to care for his medical needs
W
hen you think of a Boston Terrier, what picture pops into
your mind? Perhaps you think of his unmistakable pug nose
and pointy ears, his one-of-a-kind black-and-white tuxedo of a coat,
or his endearing snorts and wheezes that trumpet his approach.
Bostons pack a lot of personality in their small 15-pound bodies.
It’s no wonder why you’re interested in this dapper little breed!
Before you invite a Boston to share your life, however, you should
know a little bit about what makes these dogs tick. In this chapter, I
describe why Bostons make such fantastic pets. I also offer point-
ers for how to care for their basic needs, from food and water to
shelter and wellness.
Lovers, Not Fighters
Boston Terriers earned the nickname “American Gentleman” for
good reason: They’re intelligent, affectionate, classy dogs who
make excellent companions. With their amiable demeanor, it’s hard
to believe that their ancestors were originally bred to be fighters!
The early days
Bostons are a blend of English Bulldogs and white English Terriers
(now extinct). The first of these dogs was named Hooper’s Judge,
owned by Robert C. Hooper of Boston, Massachusetts. He imported
the bulldog-terrier blend from his native England around 1870.

Early breeders in the United States admired the dog’s look, so 
they refined and stabilized the breed, selecting for a smaller size, 
a likeable personality, and large expressive eyes. Eventually, they
produced the American original that we know today.
These dogs enjoyed extreme popularity in the early 1900s. Placing
first or second on the American Kennel Club’s (AKC) list of regis-
tered breeds from 1905 through 1934, Boston Terriers were all the
rage among fanciers and socialites alike. Over the past century,
they’ve held a prominent position among the AKC’s most popular
dogs, consistently ranking among the top 20.
Today, Boston Terriers have made themselves at home in a range
of households, from small apartments to large farms and every-
thing in between. Though they retain hints of their terrier and bull-
dog ancestry, Bostons are unique, well-mannered dogs who bring
joy to just about any home. To read more about the origins and
breed standard of Boston Terriers, flip to Chapter 2.
Personality plus
Ask any Boston owner to describe her dog, and you’ll get nothing
but praise. Boston owners love their dogs, and for good reason!
They’re highly intelligent, low maintenance, well-mannered, and
ready for anything.
Here are some more reasons to love Bostons:
 They’re great with kids. Most Bostons adore children. When
children are taught how to behave around dogs, Bostons and
kids become fast friends, with the dogs often enduring wrestling
matches and playing dress-up without a hitch. Because they
have such a solid constitution, these little dogs can handle just
about anything that a child can dish out. Jump to Chapter 6 for
details about how to introduce your child to a Boston.
 They’re great with adults. Integrating well in any household,
Bostons make attentive companions for adults and seniors,
too. Some Bostons become good therapy dogs, well-behaved
pups who travel to nursing homes and hospitals to bring joy
to patients. Skip to Chapter 12 for details.
 They’re easy to care for. A definite perk, Boston Terriers are
simple to maintain. They have short coats that can be easily
washed and brushed. (See Chapter 8 for more about grooming
your Boston.) They don’t require a great deal of energy-
expending exercise. And they are very intelligent, taking to
housetraining and obedience training quickly. (Hop to Chapter
9 and 11 for housetraining and obedience-training details.)

Chapter 1: Welcome to Boston! 11
 They’re a relatively healthy breed. Though they do have some
difficulties stemming from their shortened snout, or being
brachycephalic, Boston Terriers are healthy dogs. They often
live 12 years, often reaching their 15th birthdays. (Chapter 15
describes some breed-specific ailments to watch for.)
 They fit in just about any home. Bostons are the perfect size for
apartments, townhouses, or single-family homes. Because they
don’t require a large yard, they make wonderful house pets.
 They get along well with other pets. Being an easy-going
breed, Bostons are happy to share their homes with other
dogs, cats, or even a caged hamster or bearded dragon. As long
as they are introduced slowly, they’ll get along like siblings!
(Chapter 6 covers introductions between four-legged friends.)
 They’re addictive. Once you get one, you can’t stop, or so
many Boston owners attest. Prepare to add a second Boston
to your menagerie shortly after you get your first!
Why go purebred?
With all the homeless animals crowding shelters, you may ask yourself, why should
I get a purebred dog when I can rescue a mutt? Purebred dogs have their advan-
tages, including:
 You can learn all about the breed before you bring him home. Unlike a mixed-
breed dog, purebred dogs have books like this one dedicated to them. You can
read all about Bostons and get an idea of what they’re like.
 With a purebred dog, you have a good idea of what you’re getting. After
researching about Bostons, you’ll know how large the dog will grow to be. You’ll
be prepared for his playful personality. You’ll be aware of any unique medical
conditions the breed faces.
 If you adopt your dog from a breeder, you also know the dog’s lineage and pedi-
gree. You can trace the dog’s ancestors and learn about her predecessors. You
may have a grand champion in your family!
 You’ll benefit from breed-specific clubs and organizations dedicated to Boston
Terriers. Often, these clubs offer a forum for discussing health and behavior
issues. You can learn about obedience courses and agility trials. Plus, it’s a great
place to socialize with other Boston lovers!
If you feel strongly about adopting a puppy or adult rescue, consider opening your
home to a rescued Boston. Organizations across the country continually look for
loving homes for special-needs or abandoned Boston Terriers, including: the Boston
Terrier Club of America (http://bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/
rescue.html), Boston Terrier Rescue (www.btrescue.org), Boston Terrier
Rescue Net (www.bostonrescue.net), and Nationwide Boston Terrier Rescue
Inc. (www.nationwidebostonrescue.org).

Give Me Shelter — And Food!
Like any pet, Boston Terriers require food and water, shelter, stim-
ulation, and lots of love to thrive. The following sections touch on
your pet’s basic needs and how you can fill them.
Feed me!
Because they’re considered small dogs, Bostons don’t require copi-
ous amounts of food, unlike their giant-breed cousins who can eat
up to 5 cups of chow a day or more!
Bostons eat a lesser amount, so quality matters when feeding your
dog. You need to provide a delicious diet that meets his nutritional
needs, which include digestible protein, carbohydrates, fats, vita-
mins, and minerals. Luckily, pet stores and veterinary offices offer
more variety than ever before — from dry kibble and canned foods
to holistic and prescription diets. You’ll find a formula that you and
your dog are happy with.
Chapter 7 gives you more-detailed nutrition know-how, but for now,
here’s a rundown of the different diets you can feed your Boston:
 Dried kibble: These crunchy little morsels are formulated to
contain all the nutrition your Boston needs. They come in a
wide range of flavors and formulas, and contain a variety of
nutrition sources. Whatever you choose, make sure that it’s a
quality recipe that derives its protein, carbohydrates, and fats
from easily digestible sources.
 Semi-moist: With a texture resembling moist clay, semi-moist
foods also contain balanced nutrition. They contain higher
water content than the dried kibble, but because of the higher
sugar content, semi-moist foods can cause plaque and tartar
buildup on a dog’s teeth, which can lead to tooth decay. Semi-
moist food is best served as a treat rather than daily.
 Canned: What dog doesn’t love a meaty stew? Canned diets
closely resemble “real” food. They’re often packed with car-
rots, potatoes, chunks of meat, and lots of gravy. Canned diets
provide complete nutrition, a good amount of water, and a
tempting meal for finicky eaters.
 Natural or organic: Very popular diets to feed dogs, many 
natural formulas derive their ingredients from organic farms
and often claim to contain “human-quality” ingredients. These
foods can be excellent choices for your Boston, but only buy
them from reputable sources.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
12

 Raw: Raw diets are just that: raw meat to feed to your pet. The
prepackaged meals can be found in your pet store’s freezer
case. If you choose to feed your Boston a raw diet, first consult
with your veterinarian. These diets lack the vitamins and min-
erals found in plant-based foods, so you’ll need to supplement
your pup’s meals to provide adequate nutrition.
 Homemade: Rather than purchase a premade dog food from
the grocery store, some people prefer to make their dog’s
meals from scratch. There are quite a few dog food cookbooks
on the market that contain mouth-watering recipes for your
pup. To ensure your Boston is getting all of his nutritional
requirements, however, consult with your veterinarian before
offering this type of diet to your dog.
 Prescription: Purchased through veterinary offices, prescrip-
tion diets are for dogs who may have allergies or special nutri-
tional requirements. Your veterinarian can prescribe the best
brand to ease your Boston’s condition.
Besides offering your pup a quality diet, you also need to feed him
the right amount of food. A 15- to 20-pound dog, like your Boston,
typically eats about a 1⁄2 cup per meal, twice a day. If you feed him
treats, you should decrease that amount to account for the extra
calories. You don’t want a bulging Boston!
Food is important, but clean water is even more so! All dogs
require access to fresh clean water to keep their bodies function-
ing normally. Fill his bowl daily and put one wherever your Boston
roams — including outside and near his food bowl.
A home of his own
Just like you, your Boston needs his own space — a safe, comfort-
able environment to call home. That home includes his own crate
or kennel, and his larger home — yours!
Creating his own space
Dogs are denning animals, which means that they like to have a
dark, enclosed cave where they can feel safe and secure. Their den
is where they can sleep, take a nap, or just enjoy some private time
with their favorite toy.
A crate or kennel makes a perfect den. Available at your local pet
specialty retailer, crates or kennels are typically made from plastic,
powder-coated metal, or durable canvas. No matter what type you
choose, make sure that it’s easy to clean and sized appropriately —
not too big and not too small. Jump to Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion about kennels.
Chapter 1: Welcome to Boston! 13

Crates are also a tool to help you housetrain your Boston. When
you housetrain your dog, you teach him to hold his bladder and
bowels until he’s in an approved bathroom area. Dogs rarely defe-
cate in the same place they sleep, so when you confine him to his
den, he’ll learn to wait to go to the bathroom. Chapter 9 gives you
step-by-step instructions for how to housetrain your Boston.
Adapting your space
Though he’ll have his own den, he’ll consider your home an exten-
sion of his domain. To keep him out of trouble, you need to dog-
proof your home, just as you would childproof a home. Get on all
fours — your hands and knees — and investigate each room from
your dog’s perspective:
 Kitchen: With all the smells to investigate and cabinets to
explore, the kitchen is a tempting place for a Boston. Install
childproof latches on all the cabinets and drawers, and keep 
a secure lid on the garbage can.
 Bathroom: The bathroom can be a dangerous place for your
pup. Cosmetics, medications, razors, and dangling cords look
like playthings to your Boston. Keep them out of his reach.
Your dog could ingest a stray cotton swab or bar of soap —
which could mean a trip to the emergency room!
 Living room: A busy area of the house, the living room con-
tains a range of temptations, from houseplants and electron-
ics to strewn shoes and books. Secure loose cords behind
furniture, and keep houseplants and other important objects
out of your Boston’s reach.
 Bedroom: If an item of clothing smells like you, it’s fair game
for your dog! To protect your belongings, keep your clothing
and shoes in a closed closet. Secure loose cords, position
plants out of your Boston’s reach, and keep the area tidy.
 Garage: Keep all those car fluids, yard tools, fertilizers, and
poisons behind closed and locked cabinets. Antifreeze is a
particular danger because it tastes sweet to animals, yet just 
a small amount can be toxic.
 In the yard: Rat poisons, snail bait, and fertilizer can be
deadly to your dog, and gardening tools look like fun toys 
to a playful pup. While your Boston is in his exploring 
stages, avoid using poisons and put away your tools to 
prevent bumps, cuts, and other injuries. It’s better to be 
safe than sorry!
Chapter 5 has more details about protecting your Boston from 
dangers in your home.

Time for fun!
Your Boston also needs some things to keep his little mind stimu-
lated. From balls and toys to interactive games and playtime with
you, you can offer your curious Boston all sorts of diversions.
Bostons in Toyland
Toys and games for your Boston include squeaky toys, plush 
animals, bouncy balls, and treat-dispensing Kongs. Your Boston
will choose his favorite and adopt it as his own!
Pet stores stock a variety of toys. Choose those that are sized
appropriately for your small Boston. Toys that are too small can be
a choking risk; too large may mean your dog won’t play with them.
To keep things interesting for your dog, rotate his toys. Instead of
giving him a dozen new toys at once, pull them out sporadically or
offer him a new one when the old one wears out. You’ll want to buy
him a fun new trinket every time you visit the pet store, but resist
the temptation to give it to him right away.
Get out and play
With their ceaseless energy — especially when they’re puppies —
Bostons love to get out and explore. Here are some fun things you
can do with your dog:
 Take a walk. Outfit your pup in a harness, attach a leash, grab
some pickup bags and go for a walk. Your Boston will explore
everything he comes into contact with! If you take your puppy
on dusty trails, however, keep the journey short. His promi-
nent eyes are prone to scratches and irritation. Stick to walks
through a grassy park or around the neighborhood where he’s
less likely to irritate his eyes.
 Visit your local dog park. As pet popularity continues to sky-
rocket, more dog parks are opening up. These fenced-in areas
allow you to let your Boston run free! Before you visit one of
these places, however, make sure he’s up to date on all his
vaccinations.
 Play a game of fetch. A great way to expend pent-up energy, a
rousing game of fetch challenges your Boston to retrieve and
return a ball, disc, or any other quarry. Some dogs enjoy this
fun for hours and hours!
 Get involved in organized sports. Enroll your Boston in com-
petitive sports like agility, tracking, or flyball. Agility requires
your dog to run through obstacles in a timed race, tracking
Chapter 1: Welcome to Boston! 15

challenges him to follow a scent over a distance through vari-
ous terrains, and flyball pits him against other dogs to jump
over hurdles to catch a flying tennis ball. Organizers of these
activities can be found through your local dog breed club.
Chapter 12 describes these fun sports in detail.
 Plan a party. Who doesn’t love a party? Gather your dog-
owning friends and host a dog social. Make a cake — for the
dogs, of course — plan games and activities for the dogs, and
have a fun time! The dogs will love to interact and socialize,
and you will enjoy spending time with other dog owners.
How to Be a Good Boy
Besides providing food, shelter, and toys for your dog, you also
want to train him to be a well-behaved member of society. Here are
some things to consider:
Socializing for life
Socializing your Boston is when you teach him how to interact with
his world. When your Boston is a puppy, he needs to experience as
many sights and sounds as possible. He needs to meet many differ-
ent people and be introduced to many different situations. When
you teach him these things, he’ll be on track for becoming a well-
mannered pooch.
Here are some milestones you should be aware of. (Chapter 10
contains additional pointers for bringing up a polite Boston.)
Part of the litter
From birth to about 6 weeks of age, puppies get their social stimuli
from their mother and littermates. They learn how to interact with
one another, begin to understand the social hierarchy, and start to
develop their own personalities. Because your puppy will likely
still be with his mother (and breeder) during these first formative
weeks, you won’t see too much of this developmental phase.
The human connection
Dogs begin to interact with humans when they reach 5 to 12 weeks
of age. They learn — hopefully — that people bring positive things,
like food, shelter, and lots of love. It’s critical at this phase to intro-
duce your Boston to as many people as possible. They should hold
your dog, pet him, and handle him. They should let the puppy sniff
them and get to know what humans are like.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
16

At about 8 weeks old, puppies enter their first fear phase. At this
age, he becomes aware of the world around him — and sometimes,
it can be frightening! Most breeders won’t let puppies go to their
new homes until after they pass through this fear phase.
The wide, wild world
By the time your Boston reaches his 3-month birthday, he’ll be
ready to explore the world. From about 12 weeks to 20 weeks old,
your Boston should experience as many different environments as
possible. He’ll want to inspect and sniff everything he sees. Take
your dog with you wherever you go (if possible) to open his eyes
to the world. The more things he experiences, the better.
Listening and obeying
Obedience is more than teaching your dog fun parlor tricks.
Obedience is when your dog learns to obey commands like “come”
or “stay” — edicts that may be very important if he is in a life-or-
death situation, like running into oncoming traffic!
When you’re teaching your Boston basic commands, always use
positive reinforcement rather than negative correction techniques.
Positive reinforcement recognizes the pup’s positive behaviors,
rewarding him with treats and praise for a job well done.
Puppy kindergarten is a great place to begin to teach your puppy
obedience. Often offered through veterinary clinics, pet specialty
stores, or humane societies, puppy kindergarten teaches you tools
for training your Boston. You learn basic commands, including the
following (which are also detailed in Chapter 11):
 Settle: This command puts your dog in a submissive position.
Your pup is calm and relaxed, with soft eyes, ears back, belly
up, and tail tucked. He is essentially relinquishing control.
 Sit: Sit is when you command your dog to stay in place, wait-
ing for your instruction. The starting point for most other
commands, Sit requires your pup to look to you for guidance.
 Stay: Paired with Sit, Stay is when your dog holds his position
until you tell him otherwise. It’s a posture that can save his life.
 Come: Another life-saving command, Come tells your dog to
return immediately to you. It’s one of the most important
commands your dog will learn.
 Heel: When you walk with your Boston, you want him to walk
beside you and not pull on the leash. This is especially impor-
tant for Bostons because some can have narrow windpipes,
which make it difficult to breathe.
Chapter 1: Welcome to Boston! 17

Caring for Your Boston’s Needs
To keep your Boston healthy and happy until his 12th or 15th
birthday (or longer!), you need to care for his medical needs. 
That includes establishing a good relationship with a veterinarian,
keeping a canine first-aid kit handy, and being aware of your dog’s
unique medical needs. Here are some things to consider:
 Veterinary visits are fun! Besides you and your family, your
dog’s veterinarian will be his best friend. Your vet will offer
preventive advice, emergency service, annual checkups, and
general advice about dog care. Teach your Boston early that
visits to the veterinarian are something to look forward to!
Chapter 14 describes qualities to look for in veterinarians and
what to expect during your pup’s vet visits.
 Know your Boston’s special medical needs. Bostons are 
a brachycephalic breed, which means that their shortened
snouts can create respiratory challenges. That snorting and
wheezing may be endearing, but it can be a sign of a debilitat-
ing medical condition. See Chapter 15 for details.
 Be prepared. Gather canine first-aid supplies and keep them
near your human first-aid kit. In case of emergency, those
tools can help to stabilize your Boston until you can get him
to an emergency clinic. The essentials are listed in Chapter 16.
 Check him while grooming. Your Boston can’t tell you when
something hurts, but you can watch his reactions when you
inspect his body while grooming or petting him. Look for
unusual lumps, bumps, or sore spots. If you see something
new, consult with your veterinarian.
 Aging Bostons have special needs, too. Elderly dogs have
their own set of medical conditions, including age-related 
disorders and dietary changes, that warrant your attention.
Chapter 17 goes through them in detail.

Tracking the Boston Terrier
In This Chapter
 Looking at the Boston Terrier’s lineage and history
 Meeting the first Boston Terrier and her offspring
 Developing a standard for the breed
 Getting to know the Terrier’s temperament and personality
B
oston Terriers enjoy a rich and well-documented history that
reaches back to the mid-19th century. They represent one of
a handful of breeds that claim the United States as their home turf.
You can learn a lot about your Boston by understanding the 
different breeds that make her up. In this chapter, you discover 
the origins and history of the Boston Terrier, how and why the 
dog was developed, her various breed standards as defined by 
the country’s top registries, and the Boston’s spunky yet gentle
temperament and personality.
Breed Origin and History
Boston Terriers, nicknamed the “American Gentlemen,” owe their
compact physique and exuberant charm to their forefathers:
English Bulldogs (commonly known as Bulldogs) and white English
Terriers (now extinct). They are two very distinct breeds, but they
blended together to create the stout, lovable dog you know today.
The roots of the Boston’s build
Early Bulldogs, known as Molossers, descended from ferocious
Mastiff-type dogs who were bred to fight in Roman arenas. These
same litters produced guard dogs, protectors, and draft dogs. 
They were known as Alains or Alaunts until the Middle Ages.
Large, solidly built dogs with heavy bones, muscular necks, and
short muzzles, Molossers comprise a group of early canines known

for their strength and courage. They were the predecessors of the
Mastiff, Great Dane, Newfoundland, Rottweiler, and other large- 
and giant-breed dogs who tip the scales at 100 pounds or more.
Embodying vigor and bravery, early generations of these massive
dogs guarded shepherds’ homes and flocks with their sheer might
and guttural barks.
In England, these vicious dogs were known as Bandogs because 
they required bands, ropes, and chains to contain them. Those who
weren’t cut out for the fight ring assisted butchers in controlling
savage bulls awaiting slaughter. (In those days, people believed 
that when the dogs harassed the bulls before butchering, the bulls
yielded a more tender and nutritious meat compared to those that
were immediately killed!)
Breeders developed these dogs with short legs and a stout body 
to keep them safe from the bull’s piercing horns. Eventually, these
dogs were bred to participate in a sport that pitted the dog against
a tethered bull. Known as bull-baiting, the dog clenched the bull’s
nose with its strong undershot jaw with the goal of taking down 
the restrained beast by suffocating or bleeding it to death.
The English Parliament banned the sport in 1835, but the dog’s
tenacious temperament and formidable traits remained in subse-
quent generations. Its physical characteristics — the undershot
jaw, its heavy body weight, and low center of gravity — became 
the standard by which the dog was bred.
You can see many of these qualities in the Boston Terrier. It cer-
tainly is no longer a fighter, but its stocky build, square and blocky
shape, and slightly undershot jaw are now hallmarks of the breed.
Stirring in some spunk
Energetic and spirited, terriers descend from working dogs bred to
hunt and kill vermin. Known as ratters, the dogs performed specific
jobs for their owners that required speed, agility, and a rapid
response.
When the British wanted to breed spunk and agility into their dogs,
they turned to the terrier. They chose the white English Terrier, a
small, white working dog who eventually evolved into Fox Terriers
and Jack Russell Terriers. The white English Terrier became extinct
in the 1870s, but it has been linked to several bulldog-terrier crosses,
including the English Bullterrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, and the
Boston Terrier.
As a group recognized by the various dog registries, terriers range
in size from the smaller West Highland White Terrier (14 to 21
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
20

pounds) to the large Airedale Terrier (43 to 60 pounds). Though
their sizes differ, they all exhibit the feisty, energetic nature that
made them such adept vermin catchers.
You can see the terrier’s traits in your Boston, too. (And not just 
in her name!) She is a very intelligent and lively breed who always
wants a job to do, whether it’s playing a game or chewing on a
piece of rawhide.
Building the First Boston
The Boston Terrier you fell in love with traces her ancestry to a
dog named Judge, who was owned by Robert C. Hooper. A resident
of Boston, Massachusetts, Hooper purchased an imported bulldog-
terrier crossbreed from his native England around 1870.
More resembling a bulldog than a terrier, Judge weighed 32 pounds
and displayed a stocky build with a short brindle coat (a coat pat-
tern speckled with varying shades of gray, brown, and tan fur) and
a white collar.
Edward Burnett of Southborough, Massachusetts, admired
Hooper’s dog and bred his 20-pound bitch (female dog), Gyp, with
Judge. Gyp displayed similar blocky characteristics to Judge, but
she was all white and shorter. Their mating produced only one 
offspring: Well’s Eph. Described as an unattractive dog, Well’s 
Eph produced eye-catching offspring, including a male named
Barnard’s Tom. Tom exhibited the characteristics embodied by
Bostons today, but most acknowledge Judge as the breed’s Adam.
Early breeders continued to refine the dog, selecting for compact
size, distinct look, and gentlemanly temperament. The Boston
Terrier took on the positive characteristics of both its bulldog and
terrier ancestors: lap dog, vermin chaser, watchdog, and down-to-
earth scrapper.
Join the club!
In 1889, Charles F. Leland, a Harvard University student and breed
fancier, located 40 others in the Boston area who shared his love of
the dog. He invited them to form a club called the American Bull
Terrier Club. They showed dogs under the name Round Heads or
Bull Terriers.
Gaining acceptance in the American Kennel Club, however, would
not come easy. Bull Terrier and Bulldog fanciers objected to the
new breed, claiming that it was distinctly different and protesting
the similarity of the breeds’ names.
Chapter 2: Tracking the Boston Terrier 21

Relentless, the new breed’s supporters pressed on, eventually
establishing the Boston Terrier Club of America (BTCA) in 1891,
taking on the name of the city where the dog originated. They
wrote a standard that still influences the breed standard today 
(see the “Developing a Standard” section later in this chapter).
By 1893, the AKC admitted Hector, the first Boston Terrier stud,
into its registry.
The Boston Terrier Club of America exists to this day, maintaining
the original breed standards through a network of breeders and
fanciers. To join the BTCA, you must submit an application with
two letters of recommendation from BTCA club members in good
standing, and be voted in by the board of directors. Once
accepted, you must agree to abide by the club’s constitution and
bylaws. Visit www.bostonterrierclubofamerica.org for more
information.
Renewed popularity
During the Boston’s early days, it enjoyed extreme popularity, con-
sistently holding the number-one or number-two spot among AKC
registered breeds from 1905 to 1935.
Its popularity has waxed and waned since then, but another peak
may be on the horizon. In 1995 and 1996, the breed ranked number
23 and number 21 respectively in the AKC registry, and by 2006, the
organization listed it as the 15th most popular registered breed. In
their namesake Boston, Massachusetts, Boston Terriers’ popularity
has risen even higher — they’re listed as the area’s 11th most popu-
lar dog. (Flip to Chapter 18 for more trivia tidbits about Bostons.)
They may never reach the number-one spot again, but as compan-
ion dogs, Boston Terriers are hard to beat.
Developing a Standard
You already know what your Boston looks like. She has those ador-
ing dark eyes, short black- or brindle-and-white coat, those perpet-
ually perked-up ears, and a stance that could scare off the brashest
bull (well, at least the neighborhood cat!).
Someone had to come up with the unmistakable “look,” or the
Boston’s breed standard, and that’s where breed clubs come into play.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
22

In order for a breed to be recognized by a country’s presiding
kennel club (in the United States, it’s the AKC), that breed’s
fanciers must organize and provide documentation certifying 
that their dogs had bred true to form and free from out-crosses
(introduction of other breeds) for at least five generations.
The breed club develops a written description of what the dog
looks like in her most ideal form. It details things like her eyes,
ears, nose, jaw, head, body, tail, forequarters, hindquarters, and
demeanor with humans.
Judges use breed standards to judge dogs during competitive events,
but many people use breed standards, too, to decide what type of
dog to introduce into their home. By reading the various breed
descriptions, prospective dog owners will know what to expect from
a particular breed; you can find out everything from its adult height
and weight to its care requirements and personality. If you’re looking
for a lap dog, you certainly wouldn’t want to adopt a Great Dane!
You can read a paraphrased version of the Boston Terrier’s AKC
breed standard in the following section and compare the descrip-
tions to your Boston (or, if you want, you can consult the AKC Web
site for the exact information and wording). The standard has been
revised since Charles F. Leland and the original Boston Terrier Club
wrote it in 1891, but it still retains many of the original characteris-
tics that made the dogs so endearing more than 100 years ago.
The standard is only a guideline for the ideal Boston Terrier. If your
dog doesn’t meet up to these marks, don’t worry, unless you plan
to show her, of course!
American Kennel Club standards
The American Kennel Club is the most well-known and recognized
dog registry in the United States. It was founded in 1884 with the
mission of “upholding its registry and promoting the sport of pure-
bred dogs and breeding for type and function.” It advocates pure-
bred dogs as family companions, and canine health and well-being.
It also stands up for the rights of all dog owners and promotes
responsible dog ownership.
The AKC was the first registry to recognize the Boston Terrier as a
unique breed in 1893 when it admitted the dog into its stud books.
The registry classifies Boston Terriers under the Non-sporting Group,
which is a catchall for dogs who don’t fit into other categories.
The following sections outline the breed standard for the Boston.
You can also check out Figure 2-1.
Chapter 2: Tracking the Boston Terrier 23

Figure 2-1: An “ideal” Boston wears a distinctive black- or brindle-
and-white coat, has a well-balanced and compact body with a short 
head, and exudes grace and strength.
A matter of size and proportion
The breed standard divides the Boston Terrier class into three sub-
categories: under 15 pounds, 15 to 19 pounds, and 20 to 25 pounds.
No matter her size, a Boston Terrier looks compact and sturdy but
not blocky, chunky, or spindly. Ideal examples of Bostons appear
well-balanced, meaning the dog’s body is proportionate to her legs,
neck, and head. Her back and muscles must also be in proportion
and enhance the dog’s weight and structure.
A square head
A Boston Terrier’s square-looking head is flat on top and wrinkle
free, reminiscent of that bulldog look. Her cheeks are flat, and her
brow is short and sloped. Her large, dark eyes, which are set wide,
and her small, erect ears, standing up on the corners of her skull,
give the dog her alert and kind expression.
The dog’s muzzle (made up of the nose, mouth, and jaws) is wide,
short, and square and has no wrinkles. The muzzle is no longer
than one-third the length of the skull and parallels the top of the
skull. The Boston’s black nose has a well-defined line between its
nostrils.

Chapter 2: Tracking the Boston Terrier 25
Grouping the breeds
Dog registries categorize the dogs into groups, which are collections of dog breeds
that exhibit similar traits, temperaments, or purposes.
The AKC divides dogs into eight groups:
 Sporting: This active and alert group of dogs includes Pointers, Retrievers,
Setters, and Spaniels. They are generally the dogs who participate in hunting
and field activities, so they require regular exercise — and lots of it — to expend
their endless supply of energy.
 Hound: These are the hunting dogs of the pack, using their keen eyesight, sen-
sitive noses, and stamina while tracking down prey. But their similarity stops
there because this group comprises a range of breeds, from Afghans and
Beagles to Dachshunds and Whippets.
 Working: Bred to guard property, pull sleds, and perform water rescues, dogs
in the Working Group are highly loyal and intelligent. They are large and strong,
so they don’t make suitable pets for most households. This group includes dogs
like the Doberman Pinscher, Saint Bernard, and Mastiff.
 Terrier: The terrier personality precedes itself. Lively and energetic, terriers
entertain their humans for hours on end. They were bred to hunt vermin, so they
still enjoy a good dig in the backyard now and then. Terriers range in size from
the small Westie (formally known as the West Highland White Terrier) to the
large Airedale.
 Toy: Dogs in the Toy Group have one job in life: to embody pure joy and delight.
Bred as companions, these diminutive dogs make ideal pets for people who live
in apartments or small spaces. Examples of dogs in the Toy Group include the
Chihuahua, Maltese, Pug, and Yorkshire Terrier.
 Non-sporting: Boston Terriers fall into this group, which also includes the
Bichon Frise, the Poodle, and the Bulldog. It’s a catchall category for dogs who
aren’t bred for a particular sport or job.
 Herding: Members of the Herding Group have the ability to control the move-
ment of other animals — including humans! Though many dogs in the Herding
Group no longer rustle up cattle or steer sheep into their pen, they still herd their
owners. Examples of dogs in the Herding Group include the Australian
Shepherd, Collie, and the German Shepherd Dog.
 Miscellaneous: Dogs in the Miscellaneous Group are on their way to becom-
ing recognized AKC breeds. When breed fanciers show that an interest in the
breed exists and steps are being taken to have it recognized as a breed, the
AKC places them in this category. Once listed among the Miscellaneous Group,
the Beauceron and the Swedish Vallhund, for example, have recently become
eligible for AKC registration and competition in the Herding Group shows.

A stocky body
Carrying that square head, the Boston’s neck, back, and body
should be proportionate to and balance the overall appearance 
of the dog.
Her slightly arched neck carries her head proudly, and her level
back is parallel to the floor and runs perpendicular to her legs. Her
chest is deep and extends back to her loins.
The Boston’s short and tapering tail sits low on her rump. The tail
can be straight or curly, but it shouldn’t be too long.
She’s got legs
A Boston’s forequarters include her shoulders, which are sloping 
and well laid back; and her elbows, which point straight back. Her
forelegs sit well apart and are lined up with the shoulder blades.
They’re straight with short, strong pasterns, or bones above her feet.
Her hindquarters feature strong, muscular thighs. She should have a
bend at her stifles, or knee joint, and it should be aligned vertically
with no bowing. Her hock, or ankle joint, should be well-defined, and
her hocks, or lower legs, should be straight and short to her feet.
At the base of her muscular legs, small sturdy feet support her
body. They should fall straight, and have well-arched toes and
trimmed nails.
Walk this way
The Boston Terrier walks like a graceful, sure-footed, powerful dog.
Moving with confidence and ease, her legs should move in a per-
pendicular line with the ground below; she should not cross one
foot in front of the other or turn her feet outward.
Coat of three colors
A Boston’s short, smooth coat comes in three colors, each with
white markings: brindle (a mixture of colors), seal (black with a red
cast), or black.
The Boston’s distinctive tuxedo-like coat pattern — a white streak
across her muzzle, a white shot from her forehead to her nose, a
white chest, and white boots on her feet — give her that unmistak-
able look.
Temperament
Described as intelligent, friendly, lively, affectionate, loving, and loyal,
the Boston Terrier’s amiable personality makes her an easy best
buddy. The dog truly deserves her nickname, “American Gentleman.”
Part I: That Bullish Terrier

United Kennel Club standards
Established in 1898, the United Kennel Club is the largest all-breed
performance-dog registry in the world. Listing dogs from the
United States as well as 25 foreign countries, the UKC distinguishes
itself by focusing on the “total dog package,” recognizing a breed’s
hunting ability and training instinct, as well as its looks.
The UKC first recognized Boston Terriers in 1914. Listed within its
Companion Dog Group, the UKC standard is virtually identical to
the AKC’s, with only one exception: The AKC recognizes three
weight subcategories while the UKC recognizes two, which are
under 15 pounds, and up to and including 25 pounds.
Personality Aplenty
With a nickname like “American Gentleman,” you can expect your
Boston Terrier to be good-natured, intelligent, and polite with a
sense of humor. But like many American gentlemen, they embody 
a little bit of spunk and spirit that makes them unique.
Breeders and fanciers describe Bostons as gentle, alert, and well-
mannered. The dogs can be rambunctious, harkening back to their
terrier ancestors. But that same energy can be redirected into
rousing games of fetch, flyball, or agility. (Check out Chapter 12 for
fun things to do with your Boston.)
Chapter 2: Tracking the Boston Terrier 27
Other registries
The AKC and the UKC are recognized dog registries in the United States. Other coun-
tries have registries, too, and they each have their own breeds and groups that make
up their stud books.
Other registries in English-speaking countries include:
 Canadian Kennel Club
 Australian National Kennel Council
 The Kennel Club (United Kingdom)
 Kennel Club of India
 Kennel Union of Southern Africa
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale, or the World Canine Organization, is an
international kennel club based in Belgium. The FCI claims 80 member countries
and recognizes 335 dog breeds.

Not known to be barkers, Boston Terriers don’t make the best
guard dogs — especially because they’re too friendly to strangers!
They adore children and senior citizens, making a properly social-
ized Boston an ideal pet for a young family or an empty-nester.
Bostons get along splendidly with other canine and feline pets.
They enjoy having one another for companionship. If you’ve ever
seen a pack of Bostons playing together, you know how much fun
they can have!
Despite the Boston’s charming characteristics, you should con-
sider these challenges that come with this canine “gentleman:”
 Unstable temperament: Bostons bred by unethical and 
inexperienced breeders may not exhibit stable demeanors.
Obedience instructors and veterinary behaviorists counsel
many clients whose Bostons display neurotic behavior, such
as ceaseless barking, hyperactivity, and aggression. Purchase
your dog from a reputable breeder who knows how to select
for stable temperaments. (Flip to Chapter 4 for advice on find-
ing a breeder and choosing a healthy puppy.)
 Housetraining difficulties: Drawing on that terrier stubborn-
ness, Bostons can be difficult to housetrain. Plan to spend at
least six months training your dog before you see results.
(You can help your Boston master housetraining basics with
Chapter 9.)
 Snorts and snores: Because of their shortened muzzles,
Bostons tend to snort, wheeze, grunt, and snore loudly. Some
Boston owners find these little noises endearing, but they drive
others crazy! In some cases, the noises can indicate breathing
difficulties, and your veterinarian can diagnose and treat any
problem or potential problems. (For more details about Boston
Terrier–specific health issues, turn to Chapter 15.)

Committing to a Lifetime 
of Care
In This Chapter
 Determining whether a Boston Terrier is the right dog for you
 Understanding how your Boston will fit into the family
 Delegating responsibility to family members
 Analyzing the real costs of dog ownership
A
n exuberant Boston draws smiles from virtually everyone he
meets, but choosing to spend the next 15 years or so caring
for the living creature is a commitment that you should not take
lightly. Do you think you’re ready for a Boston Terrier? More 
importantly, are you ready to welcome an energetic, intelligent,
well-mannered dog into your home?
High-spirited dogs, like a Boston, require even more tolerance 
and understanding. Boston Terriers are intelligent pets, and they
develop many interests and need challenging activities to keep
their busy minds occupied. When you’re choosing a type of dog 
to bring into your home, you should consider not only the dog’s
needs, but your needs, too. Your family’s expectations and lifestyle
should match what needs the dog may have.
You can discover more about the responsibilities involved in rais-
ing a Boston Terrier in the pages that follow. This chapter is really
all about what you and your family can expect when you commit to
care for your Boston.
Judging Your Compatibility
Truly an American Gentleman, your Boston Terrier will comple-
ment your household. Gentle and kind, entertaining and comical,
he will make you laugh with his antics and personality.

Boston Terriers make wonderful pets, especially for young, active
families or empty-nesters looking to add a dog to their home.
Bostons do very well with children; mature Bostons have been
known to stoically take almost any teasing or roughhousing that a
child can dole out! And because the dogs are so gentle and well-
mannered, they make ideal companions for seniors who may not
physically be able to vigorously exercise their pet.
If you and your family can commit to providing the dog what he
needs to thrive, like devoted training time, a regular schedule,
patience and understanding, near constant companionship, and
lots of love and attention, then you may have found a match made
in Boston! Here, you can read more about these traits that your
Boston needs to succeed.
Considering terrier needs
Though your Boston is a terrier, he’s not as rambunctious as some
breeds. He is lively and curious, but he’s far from his vermin-chaser
roots. (See Chapter 2 for more details about the Boston personality.)
To thrive in your household, he’ll need some boundaries to keep
him safe and content:
 Security: Bostons don’t make very vicious guard dogs. Your
Boston will rarely bark, unless he’s trying to communicate
with you. He’ll welcome strangers with a playful lick and wag,
and would happily go home with just about anyone — as long
as treats and attention are involved. For this reason, your
Boston must be kept in a fenced or enclosed yard. And when
you walk with him, he must always be on a leash.
 Training: A very intelligent dog, your Boston will benefit
greatly from puppy kindergarten and basic training classes.
He may choose to chase a butterfly or play with his class-
mates because he is easily distracted, but patience is para-
mount. If you’re diligent with his training, it will pay off in 
the long-run. For more info on training, flip to Chapter 11.
 Indoor living: Because of your Boston’s short coat and short,
flat nose, your dog will spend much of his time inside with
you. He won’t tolerate extreme temperatures or weather well.
When he is outside during the summer, you’ll need to provide
a cool, shady area for your pup; during the winter, you’ll want
to bundle him up before braving the elements.
 Regular schedule: Your Boston will also need to be welcomed
and loved by your entire family. Each person should dedicate
him- or herself to caring and nurturing the puppy or adult dog.
Establish chores for each person, agree to use the same train-
ing tools, and remember that this dog is part of the family.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
30

Impatient owners need not apply
In general, dog owners need to be patient and dedicated, and for
owners of a Boston Terrier, this statement couldn’t be more true.
Because he has terrier blood coursing through his veins, he will be
rambunctious and willful at times, pushing boundaries and testing
your tolerance. He is also very intelligent, which makes training
easy, but when that wit combines with a willful attitude, you may
need to out-think your dog.
You can expect to teach your dog everything from housetraining 
to behaving properly around other dogs. He’ll look to you for guid-
ance in any given circumstance, so you’ll need to be prepared to
lead your pup in a loving, tolerant way.
Accidents and trials will happen, and you will need to endure them
as any parent would. A male may mark his territory. Your dog may
use your favorite shoes as chew toys. Dog proofing your home may
detract from its décor. At the same time, your dog will absolutely
adore you, and your health will benefit from sharing your home
with a pet. After you welcome a dog into your home, your life will
never be the same again!
If you’re willing to devote energy to raising your Boston, he’ll
reward you with lifelong love and companionship. A patient and
understanding pet owner will raise a well-mannered pup. It just
takes time and dedication.
Chapter 3: Committing to a Lifetime of Care 31
Are you ready for a Boston?

At-home time: It’s a necessity
If you have the time to dedicate to raising a dog, a Boston makes a
wonderful companion in virtually any household.
Boston Terriers love to spend time with their human caretakers.
Through decades of selecting for specific traits, breeders have 
fostered characteristics that make these dogs companion animals.
Because they’re extroverts, Bostons thrive on contact with their
family and suffer if left alone for long periods of time.
An ideal home for a Boston is one that buzzes with activity all day
long. Bostons aren’t happy being alone and often benefit from
having a Boston brother or sister. When properly socialized and
trained, they get along splendidly with children and other pets,
both canine and non-canine.
Your Boston will want to spend all his time with you and your
family. If you travel frequently, work long hours, or are otherwise
committed to tasks that require you to be away from home for long
periods of time, you should think twice about adding this dog to
your home. And if you’re experiencing major life changes, such as
changing jobs, expecting a baby, mourning a death, or coping with
a serious illness, you may want to hold off on purchasing a puppy.
Establishing Family Dynamics
When you choose to adopt a Boston Terrier, he will become 
an integral part of your family. He is still a dog, but many of the 
decisions you make about travel, hobbies, purchases, décor, 
and lifestyle will require you to consider your family pet.
Because of this new ball of fur, the dynamics of your family will
change when your Boston comes home. Each individual — from the
adults to the children — will have new responsibilities. As a family,
you will need to communicate more with each other, making sure
that each person is on the same page when it comes to training and
discipline. It will be a learning experience for all of you.
If you have other pets, their roles will shift as well, especially 
as the animals establish their dominance order. Dogs are pack 
animals, so as soon as your Boston comes home, he’ll naturally
discern his place in your household ranking system. Just as your
family will adjust to the duties and responsibilities of owning a new
pet, your Boston will need to adjust to his new surroundings, too.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
32

Knowing who the main 
caregiver will be: You
If children are part of your family, it’s likely that your son or daugh-
ter is prompting the purchase of your puppy.
New and novel in her young world, your child will insist that she
will care for the dog, feed him, clean up after him, and bathe him.
And she just might — for a time. She’ll be happy to take your
Boston on walks and play fetch, but when it comes to getting up at
6 a.m. and taking him to the bathroom, or cleaning up an accident
in the middle of the living room floor, she’ll likely balk.
The reality is that you — the adult — will ultimately do most of the
work in raising and caring for the dog. You’ll be the one taking him
to the bathroom in the middle of the night. You’ll be the one who
makes sure he has the right amounts of food and water. You’ll be
the one who structures his playtime and makes sure that he social-
izes with other animals and humans.
Understanding your children’s role
Most children love dogs. They’ll play together from sunup to sun-
down, becoming constant companions and quick best friends.
Children, and even teenagers, however, can’t be expected to be 
the sole caregivers of a pet. Soccer games, schoolwork, and social
engagements often interfere with the day-to-day responsibilities
associated with raising and caring for a dog.
You can, however, delegate specific tasks to your children. If you
have more than one child, consider rotating chores to broaden
their experiences. Later in the chapter, you’ll find a list of duties
suitable for children of any age.
Helping your four-legged friends 
get along with each other
Most Boston Terriers are courteous and laid back enough to 
get along with other pets, both canine and non-canine varieties.
When raised from puppyhood in a home filled with other animals,
Bostons will learn to fit in without a hitch. With time and training,
adult Bostons, too, can be trained to bunk with other pets.
Chapter 3: Committing to a Lifetime of Care 33

Keep in mind, however, that Bostons retain their terrier roots 
and may try to chase down a pocket pet, like a guinea pig or rat.
Cautiously introduce them to each other in a safe, neutral environ-
ment, gradually giving each more freedom to sniff out the other.
Even if they do get along, supervise them. You don’t want your
Boston making a toy out of your beloved bunny!
If you care for an easily spooked or alpha cat, you can minimize 
the hissing and flying fur by following these steps:
1. Leave your Boston in his crate during the first few 
introductions.
Carefully hold the cat and sit next to the kennel containing
your dog. Let them smell each other through the kennel
walls or bars, and watch their reactions. If your cat hisses
and bears her claws, or if your puppy whimpers, back away
slowly and try again the next day, gradually increasing the
time they spend together. Give both animals lots of praise
when they can tolerate each other’s company.
2. After your cat shows signs of being comfortable with
your Boston, let your cat walk freely around the kennel
until she grows accustomed to the new smell.
As soon as she sniffs his kennel and approves of his pres-
ence, she’ll ignore the kennel and likely perch somewhere,
watching your new little dog and keeping a keen eye on
every move he makes.
3. In time, you’ll be able to leave your dog’s kennel door
open, and they’ll freely interact.
When you can give them this freedom depends on your
cat’s tolerance of the dog and your Boston’s exuberance
level. An uptight cat may become annoyed by a playful
pup, whereas a docile dog won’t cause a ruckus at all.
Watch your animals closely until you’re absolutely confi-
dent that they’ll get along. Ideally, they’ll be best friends
before long, sharing the same cushy bed.
Chapter 10 contains more advice on making sure your Boston
behaves like a gentleman around other animals (and people).
Divvying Up Duties
Who knew that welcoming a dog into your household could open
up so many job opportunities! Each family member will have some
sort of daily doggy duty to perform. Because humans have wel-
comed dogs into the domestic setting, your Boston can’t care for
himself as he would in the wild, so you’ll need to provide fresh
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
34

food and water for him, exercise him, take him to the bathroom,
and teach him basic manners, among myriad other tasks.
Besides the daily chores, you’ll also need to plan for weekly,
monthly, and yearly duties, such as attending basic training
courses, giving him a bath, feeding him heartworm medication,
and taking him to the veterinarian for his annual checkup.
Fitting in regular chores
To help with your planning efforts, you can follow the rough guide-
lines shown in Figure 3-1 for the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
chores required to keep your pup happy and healthy.
Of course, the schedule for each household will differ, but these
are intended to be a starting point for your life with your Boston.
Daily duties
These tasks will need to be performed every day, sometimes more
than once a day.
 Feeding: When your Boston is a puppy, he’ll need to be fed up
to four times a day; when he’s an adult, he’ll need two meals a
day. You should feed your dog on a regular schedule, such as
at 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., so he knows exactly what to expect.
Also keep in mind that just as you would wash your own dishes,
your Boston’s bowls need to be thoroughly washed with soap
and water after every meal. You’ll also want to keep an eye on
his eating habits and note any irregular behavior, like a poor
appetite or vomiting (see Chapter 7 for more on feeding).
 Keeping fresh water available: Often paired with the feeding
regimen, this is an ongoing job that requires you to check
your Boston’s water bowl and refill it with clean water when
necessary. Plan to wash the bowl on a daily basis.
 Bathroom responsibilities: A young Boston will require 
frequent bathroom visits while you housetrain him (see
Chapter 9) — at least every two hours, if not more often. 
As he gets older and learns how to ask to go outside, you’ll
need to supervise him while he does his business, eventually
letting him go by himself when he’s an adult. Every day, you’ll
need to clean up his bathroom area, scooping up his feces and
spraying down the area with water, if necessary. When you
take him for walks, you’ll want to carry plastic bags to clean
up the presents he leaves behind.
Chapter 3: Committing to a Lifetime of Care 35

 Exercise: Being the energetic dogs that they are, Bostons
require daily exercise. You can take yours for an hour-long
walk, play fetch for 20 minutes, or enjoy a fun session of flyball
(see Chapter 12). The more exercise, the better, because it will
allow your Boston — and you — to get a good night’s sleep.
 Grooming: They don’t require rigorous coat care like some
breeds, but Bostons do need a daily brushing to keep their
shedding under control. Plan to spend 10 minutes or so for
the day-to-day grooming regime.
 Training: When your Boston is old enough for training and
behavior classes (about 10 to 12 weeks old), you can plan 
to spend about 20 minutes each day practicing what you’ve
learned (see Chapter 11). It’s important to reinforce his learn-
ing every day because basic training forms the building
blocks for more advanced tricks later on.
Weekly chores
Though not as extensive as the care your Boston requires daily,
these weekly tasks are necessary and vary in each household.
 Socializing: Once a week, take your Boston to the local dog
park or dog-friendly shopping center where people and their
pets congregate. Let them greet your dog. It’s important that
your puppy experience as many people, smells, and experi-
ences as possible to grow into a healthy, well-adjusted adult
(see Chapter 10 for more info). Adults need ongoing socializa-
tion, too, but it’s not as critical as when your Boston is a pup.
 Training classes: Typically held once a week, puppy kinder-
garten and basic training classes get your Boston off to a great
start in proper obedience and behavior. If you’ve adopted an
adult Boston, he can learn new tricks, too! Obedience classes
will teach you and your dog the basic training skills intro-
duced in puppy kindergarten.
 Agility training or other sporting activity: After your dog
passes puppy kindergarten and basic training, enroll him in
some agility or flyball classes (see Chapter 12). They will
focus his energy into a positive outlet — and you’ll meet other
dog people who love their pets as much as you love yours!
 Brushing his teeth: Plan to brush your Boston’s teeth at least
once a week, though once a day would be ideal (but maybe
not realistic!). Good oral hygiene will keep your dog’s pearly
whites clean and tartar-free. (Chapter 8 tells you how.)
 Eye check: Because Bostons have such prominent eyes, check
them at least once a week for discharge, dryness, or other
irregularities (see Chapter 8). Consult your veterinarian right
away if you suspect a problem.

Monthly musts
Mostly related to health, these chores are best done around the
same time each month, such as within the first week.
 Giving heartworm medication and flea-and-tick prevention:
During routine exams, your veterinarian will prescribe heart-
worm and flea-and-tick prevention for your Boston (see
Chapter 14). To keep him parasite-free, give your Boston the
medication once a month.
 Grooming: Bathing, nail clipping, and ear cleaning should be
done once a month. Plan to spend a good hour at least giving
your Boston a bath, clipping or grinding down his nails, clean-
ing his ears, and making him handsome. (Flip to Chapter 8 for
pointers on sprucing up your Boston.)
 Overall health check: While you’re doing your monthly
grooming ritual, inspect your dog’s body. Look at his coat and
skin, checking for scrapes and lumps. Check his eyes, nose,
and mouth for signs of redness or irritation. Inspect his paws,
checking his pads for cuts. If you see anything out of the ordi-
nary, consult your veterinarian.
Annual checkups
You can plan to take your Boston to the veterinarian once a year
for his annual checkup. During that visit, your veterinarian will
weigh him, check his heart and lungs, look in his eyes and ears,
and perform an overall assessment of your dog’s health. The
annual checkup is the ideal time to bring up any questions about
your dog’s health or behavior. (Chapter 14 explains the details of
what to expect when you and your Boston visit the vet.)
Child-appropriate tasks
To ease the day-to-day chores that you need to do for your Boston,
enlist your children’s help. Under your supervision, of course, you
can involve them by assigning tasks such as these:
 Cleanup duty: Ask your child to accompany you when you take
your Boston to the bathroom. She can grab a plastic bag and
clean up the bathroom area after the dog does his business.
Make sure she washes her hands when she comes back inside.
 Feeding time: Make it your child’s job to remind you when it’s
time to feed your pup. If she’s old enough, ask her to measure
and pour the food into the dog’s bowl.
 Refilling the water bowl: Assign your child the chore of
making sure the water bowl is always full of fresh, clean water.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
38

 Cleaning out his kennel: You can ask your child to shake out
her pet’s blanket, straighten up the kennel, and gather strewn
doggy toys.
 Brushing and grooming: Daily grooming tasks give your child
a chance to bond with your Boston. Involve her as much as
possible with washing and brushing tasks.
 Training and behavior practice: Ask your child to attend
puppy kindergarten with you and practice simple commands,
like Sit and Stay, with your dog. You can also enlist your
child’s help when selecting reference and training materials.
The Real Costs
Dog ownership isn’t cheap. Though it’s common knowledge that
you’ll have to pay for dog food, supplies, veterinary bills, and
cleaning supplies, have you ever calculated the monthly costs?
In 2004, the American Kennel Club (AKC) surveyed more than 1,000
visitors to its Web site to determine what pet owners pay to care for
their pooches. In addition, the American Pet Products Manufacturers
Association Inc. (APPMA), a nonprofit trade organization that serves
the pet products industry, conducts a pet owners’ survey every two
years that tracks pet-product purchasing behavior of its respondents.
Between these two organizations’ reports, you can see in this sec-
tion that owning a dog has its costs (although most owners would
agree that it’s worth it!).
One-time and monthly expenses
When you purchase a car, you expect to pay the one-time costs of
the car itself, the taxes, and the warranty. You also expect to pay
the ongoing costs of gas, insurance, and maintenance. In the same
way, you can expect to pay one-time and ongoing expenses when
you bring your Boston home.
 One-time, major expenses: The APPMA’s 2005–2006 survey
reports that pet owners spent an average of $655 purchasing a
small purebred dog, like your Boston Terrier. The AKC’s num-
bers mirror the APPMA’s numbers at $646. So you can expect to
pay about $650 for your Boston, depending on where you live.
Adopting a Boston from a shelter or rescue can cut this cost
significantly, depending on the organization. Several rescues,
such as Wonderdog Rescue in San Francisco, California, offer
purebred adult dogs for $300 or less, and that price includes
spay or neuter surgery and vaccinations.
Chapter 3: Committing to a Lifetime of Care 39

You’ll also need to have your dog spayed or neutered, a cost
that runs $160 according to the AKC. Plan to spend another
$350 on training fees and supplies, the organization reports,
and an additional $350 on nonconsumable pet products, like
bowls, leashes, and a crate.
 Ongoing (and in some cases, fun) expenses: You’ll also need
to budget for routine expenses and consumable items, like
food, treats, leashes, and medication. The AKC reports that
survey participants spend an average of $2,489 per year in
food, veterinary visits, travel, grooming, boarding, toys and
treats, ongoing training, and dog events. Costs will, of course,
vary depending on where you live.
Unexpected bills
One expense you can’t plan for is an emergency. The AKC reports
that an emergency veterinary visit will cost $631; the APPMA says
that number is $594. If your Boston requires emergency veterinary
care, you can expect to pay a pretty penny to keep your dog healthy.
To cushion the cost of emergency veterinary care, you can pur-
chase health insurance for your Boston. It may seem like an extrav-
agant expense — about $300 to $400 per year — but it can save
you thousands of dollars if your Boston ever requires critical care.
You can find pet health insurance companies through a variety of
sources, including the AKC, your breeder, your veterinarian, or a
quick online search. You can also ask members of your local
Boston Terrier Club for referrals.
Like human health insurance, pet health insurance requires you to
pay a premium every month. In exchange, the policy covers annual
exams, prescription flea prevention, heartworm protection, vacci-
nations, hospitalization, accidents, radiology, surgeries, and even
cancer treatments. After you meet your deductible, the insurance
company pays a percentage of the medical costs.
Pet health insurance differs from human health insurance in that,
in most cases, you pay for the veterinary bill up front (no co-pay),
submit a claim form, and get reimbursed for a percentage (or all)
of the medical costs. This feature allows you to take your pet to
virtually any licensed veterinarian without worrying about
whether the clinic will accept your insurance.
Different policies offer different benefits, so look at all your options
before choosing one for your Boston. It’ll be worth it!
If you decide to forgo pet health insurance, squirrel some money
away — at least several hundred dollars — for medical emergencies,
just in case.

A Match Made in Boston
In This Chapter
 Deciding what gender of Boston to adopt
 Choosing between a puppy or an adult
 Finding the Boston of your dreams
 Identifying a healthy dog
I
t’s easy — and common — to follow your emotions when select-
ing a new dog. You fall in love with that adorable puppy in the
window, so you bring her home on a whim, only to find that you’re
not prepared or you don’t have time to share your life with a puppy.
You can approach the adoption process with greater success if you
decide in advance what breed, gender, and age suit you and your
family’s lifestyle. You’ve already chosen your breed — a Boston
Terrier — so now it’s time to decide whether you want a male or 
a female dog, and whether you want a puppy or an adult.
This chapter explores the personalities of both the male and the
female Boston, as well as compares the qualities of a puppy and an
adult. By educating yourself, you can make an informed decision
about what Boston Terrier is right for you.
After you’ve decided the age and the gender of your Boston, you
must go about finding one. This chapter also leads you through the
different sources for finding a dog, including breeders, rescues, pet
stores, and even newspaper advertisements.
Battle of the Sexes
Like humans, male and female Bostons embody distinct character-
istics that make them unique. You can see these behavioral differ-
ences readily when the dog is not spayed or neutered. Males are
loyal and devoted companions, but they will mark their territory.
Females, on the other hand, don’t lift their leg, but they come into
heat twice a year, requiring you to guard them from male suitors.

If you decide to neuter or spay your Boston, many of his or her
gender traits will diminish, but his or her personality won’t change.
(See Chapter 14 for details on spaying and neutering your Boston.)
Physiologically, Boston males are slightly larger than females.
Other than that, the two genders look identical. Ultimately, your
personal preference dictates which gender to choose.
Mighty males
Males make loving and devoted companions. True gentlemen,
males are playful and entertaining. They tend to maintain a con-
stant mood, though they can be rowdy and raucous depending on
the individual’s personality.
As such, males will search for females in heat, so they are prone to
running off and sowing their canine oats. Adolescent males may
also challenge and disobey your commands, especially if a female
is in the vicinity, so you’ll need to add an extra dose of patience
during training sessions.
Unaltered males (those who can reproduce because they haven’t
been neutered) tend lift their legs to mark their territory, letting
other dogs know that your home and yard are his turf. Male dogs
do this regardless of whether they are housetrained, so you’ll 
need to have some odor-busting cleaning products on hand. (See
Chapter 9 for more on housetraining.)
In altered males, however, these problems are virtually eliminated.
They will be less likely to roam, mark their territory, be aggressive,
and rebel against your authority. Unless you’re planning to breed
or show your Boston, you should definitely plan to have your male
Boston neutered.
Attentive females
Female Bostons make sweet and loyal companions, too. With her
mother-like instincts, she dotes on her human family just as she
would her canine family.
Unlike their male counterparts, however, unspayed female Bostons
(those who can have baby Bostons) can be moody and tempera-
mental, especially when they come into heat (their fertile period)
twice a year. When this happens, you’ll need to isolate her from
ready and willing male suitors. You’ll also need to clean up her
bloody discharge during that time or outfit her in a pair of
absorbent pet pants.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
42

After your female Boston is spayed, however, her bossy tendencies
will cease (for the most part!), and she’ll settle into a more emo-
tionally constant temperament.
Puppy or Adult?
There’s nothing quite like a puppy. They’re cute and cuddly, and
the gaze from a Boston puppy’s big, round eyes can melt any heart.
She’ll rely on you completely to care for her every need. You’ll
teach her how to act, where to sleep, and what to play with. As 
she grows up, you’ll help mold her personality and behavior.
An adult dog, however, can be a delight, too. She has graduated
from that awkward puppy stage into adulthood, rendering her more
manageable and independent. Depending on her history and train-
ing skills, you won’t have to send her to basic obedience classes or
housetrain her. She’s simply ready to be your constant companion.
Choosing between a puppy and adult can be a challenging task for
any dog lover. Each has its benefits and drawbacks. Before making
a decision, ask yourself these questions:
 Do you have the time to dedicate to raising and training a
puppy? If you work at home or have some flexibility with your
schedule, a puppy is for you! If not, consider an adult dog who
has been housetrained and is relatively independent.
 Is your lifestyle conducive to raising a dog? Pet owners who
prefer to stay at home rather than go out are a step ahead
when it comes to raising a puppy. If you enjoy going out, an
adult who is already trained would suit you better.
 Do you want to breed your dog? If so, you need to find a
breeder who is willing to adopt out a breeding young-adult
female dog who has already begun to display her adult 
conformation and temperament.
 Is it important that you raise the dog yourself? If so, defi-
nitely choose a puppy who you can watch grow up. An adult
dog has already established her personality, and she may
have some behavior issues left over from the previous owner.
 Do you have children? Older children can help with the
chores associated with raising a puppy; younger children may
not be ready for such responsibility. An adult Boston who has
been raised around kids will be tolerant of playful children,
though she should be supervised at all times.
 Is cost an issue? The purchase price of a purebred puppy is
often more than that of adults or rescues. If price is an issue,
consider adopting an adult.
Chapter 4: A Match Made in Boston 43

 Is it important for you to help a retired show dog or rescue?
If so, then open your home to an adult Boston. Many Boston
breeders will place a retired show dog or a female after she is
past the breeding age of 5 years old.
These questions are only a few that you should ask yourself and
your family before deciding on an adult or a puppy. Also consider
your experience in raising a puppy, the current — and future —
makeup of your family, and the activity level of your household.
Keep in mind that although puppies are adorable, many adult
Bostons are looking for homes, too.
If You Choose a Puppy . . .
Get ready for some fun! Raising a puppy to adulthood is one of the
most rewarding experiences you can imagine. Not only will you
watch your pup grow and develop into a healthy adult, but she’ll
also be adaptable and easy to train. You can look forward to a life-
time of companionship and adoration from your Boston baby.
You can also expect long hours training and socializing your
puppy. You’ll need to feed her at regular times throughout the day,
take her to the bathroom, and spend lots of time bonding with her.
The patterns and behaviors that you develop in her now will be
with her for her entire life, so you will need to be aware of your
actions and how they will affect her later.
But before all that, you’ll need to find your puppy first!
Locating a reputable source
You can find purebred puppies from breeders, online, at your local
pet store, and through sources listed in consumer magazines. You
can even find purebred puppies listed in the newspaper.
But how do you know if the breeder or dealer is reputable? How
can you be sure that the dog you’re getting is healthy, is bred from
quality parents, and has begun to be socialized? How do you know
that your Boston will be of sound temperament?
You need to look for upstanding breeders and dealers who are
experts at selecting, breeding, and preparing dogs for loving
homes. These breeders sell the animals through a variety of 
outlets, from individual placements by the breeders themselves 
to offering them through responsible pet stores.

Breeders
A reputable dog breeder is someone who seeks to preserve and
improve the breed that they love. Often, a breeder sticks to rearing
one type of dog. She is actively involved in the dog fancy and
shows her dogs at kennel club competitions. Her goal is to perfect
the traits that make the breed unique.
What makes a breeder reputable?
 She chooses her breeding stock very carefully, with the goal
of improving and preserving the breed. She uses the breed
standard as a guide to produce the best puppies she can.
 She tests her puppies for congenital defects and illnesses, 
and she tries to eliminate unhealthy dogs from her breeding
program.
 She supplies Boston buyers with a proof of health screening, 
a sales contract, and plenty of references.
 Though she may list her name among other breeders in
national magazines, she typically doesn’t sell her puppies
through local or regional newspapers advertisements. She
doesn’t need to because she often has a waiting list for her
healthy, well-mannered puppies.
 She will ask you about your home, your lifestyle, your experi-
ence with dogs, and your goals with the puppy. She may even
ask you to complete an application.
 She willingly opens her home so you can inspect her facilities.
She introduces you to the dam and her litter, and she’ll 
show you photos, pedigrees, and health certificates from 
the litter’s sire.
 She will take back a dog from her breeding program if you can
no longer care for the puppy.
You can find breeders listed in one of the many dog breed maga-
zines or from an online search, but your best bet is to locate your
regional kennel club or breed club and ask for a list of recommenda-
tions. The Boston Terrier Club of America (www.bostonterrier
clubofamerica.org), for example, maintains a breeder referral list
of members who have signed a code of ethics and conduct.
Dog shows offer another opportunity to locate Boston breeders.
After watching the dogs compete, talk to some of the people show-
ing their dogs. Ask them about their breeding program or where
they got their dogs.
When you find a breeder with whom you feel comfortable, ask her
some questions. She’ll be expecting you to do so! (Note: If she seems
put out or taken aback by your questions, that should be a red flag.)
Chapter 4: A Match Made in Boston 45

 How long have you been breeding? The more experience,
the better.
 How long have you been breeding Boston Terriers? Do you
breed other dogs? People who breed one particular type of
dog are truly dedicated to bettering the breed. People who
breed based on the latest fad or those who breed several 
different types of dogs should raise a red flag.
 What dog organizations do you belong to? Reputable breed-
ers should belong to some membership-based club or organi-
zation, like the Boston Terrier Club of America, with the goal
of continuing their education in the breed.
 What are the parents’ strengths? What shortcomings do
they have? Though most breeders will boast about the qual-
ity of the dam and sire, question her to learn about any behav-
ioral or temperament problems, like possible aggression or
poor socialization skills.
 Can I visit your facility and meet the dam? The answer to this
question should always be, “Of course.” Even if the breeder
has no puppies at the time, she should welcome you into her
facility so you can see the dogs in her breeding program.
 Where do you raise your puppies? How have you socialized
them? Ideally, the breeder has raised the puppies in her home
around the sounds of normal daily activities. You want to find
out whether the pups are getting used to being around people.
 What health problems do you screen for? What congenital
defects are common in Boston Terriers, and what are you
doing to decrease those defects? If the breeder says, “None,”
or “My dogs are perfect,” run the other way! All breeds have
the potential for some sort of genetic defect, so your breeder
should be upfront about health problems that may present
themselves. If possible, know the correct answer to this ques-
tion in advance. (Chapter 15 covers common Boston ailments.)
 What kind of health guarantee do you offer with your dogs?
At the very least, the breeder should guarantee against any
debilitating health problems and congenital defects.
 How many litters do you raise a year? Breeders who produce
more than three litters per year may not be paying enough
attention to the dogs’ health. Avoid breeders who always have
puppies because that can be a sign of irresponsible breeding
practices.
 When can I take the puppy home? A reputable breeder will
let her puppies go home when they’re 9 to 12 weeks old.

Pet stores
When it comes to selling purebred puppies, pet stores often have 
a bad reputation. Criticized as smelly shops that display their 
puppies in cramped, dirty kennels, some pet stores have earned
this reputation, to be sure.
Some pet store owners, however, do an excellent job at visiting
puppy breeders, scrutinizing puppy distribution centers, and find-
ing loving homes for puppies who they sell through their retail
shop. They keep the dogs in sanitized play areas and socialize
them with other puppies and people. They question potential
buyers, screening them and requiring them to fill out applications.
They act as a liaison between the breeder and the buyer.
The owners of one pet store in Southern California, for example,
regularly visit each breeder with whom they work. They take in
only as many puppies as their retail facility can handle, and they
keep them in an open play area during the day so the puppies can
interact with each other. Three designated employees are specially
trained to care for the puppies and check potential buyers. The
store owners recognize the need in the community for purebred
puppies from a reputable source, and they have filled that need
with healthy, well-cared-for puppies.
Chapter 4: A Match Made in Boston 47
Backyard breeders and puppy mills
These terms are packed with negative connotations, and for good reason. Some
backyard breeders and puppy mills breed and raise purebred puppies as a com-
modity, with little or no interest in the dogs’ well-being.
A backyard breeder is often a person who breeds her dogs to make some extra
money. She knows little or nothing about selecting for specific genetic traits or pre-
venting congenital malformations.
A puppy mill is just as it sounds: a facility that churns out puppies purely to make
money. Disreputable puppy mills are often on a farm or in a residence, and they
keep their animals in filthy, inhumane conditions. The dogs being used to produce
the puppies aren’t taken care of properly and are usually bred each season with no
chance to recuperate.
There are, however, reputable hobby breeders who are learning from an experi-
enced mentor. Similarly, puppy distributors raise puppies en masse, but the dogs
are cared for by a veterinarian, raised in pristine facilities, and socialized on-site by
staff members who adore the dogs.
Before pooh-poohing a novice breeder or puppy distributor, do your homework and
get the facts. It may not be as bad as you think.

Unfortunately, that shop is not the norm, but you can find respon-
sible pet stores that sell purebred puppies. You just need to know
what questions to ask.
First, arrange to meet with the pet store owner. If he isn’t available
or doesn’t have time to talk to you, run away! How could he have
time to care for the puppies if he doesn’t have time to talk to you!
Next, prepare to ask the shopkeeper these questions:
 Do you have a source for Boston Terrier puppies? Depending
on where you live, a Boston may be hard to find in a pet store.
Ask the shop owner whether he can get one, and if his answer
is yes, ask how involved you can be in selecting the puppy.
 What kind of background do you have on the puppies? While
many pet store owners won’t have the detailed information
and pedigrees that are available from a breeder, he should
have the dogs’ medical history, including shots and wormings
that have been done; whether the dogs can be registered, and
with what registry; the age of the puppies; and a list of medical
problems, if any.
 Where did the puppies come from? Have you inspected the
facility yourself? The shop owner should know exactly where
the puppies came from, and ideally, he should have inspected
the facility at least once. He should be keeping tabs on the
breeder or distributor, knowing as much as possible about the
facility, the breeding practices, and the care the animals receive.
 Do you work with a veterinarian? Puppies sold through pet
stores should be under the care of a veterinarian who over-
sees their health and well-being.
 How do you socialize the puppies? To grow up to be healthy
adults, puppies need to interact with other dogs, be handled
by humans, and introduced to a variety of sounds and smells.
Pet store owners should be able to describe how their pup-
pies are being socialized.
 Can I inspect the puppies? Look at the puppies to make sure
their eyes are clear and bright, that there are no signs of exter-
nal parasites, that their skin and coats look healthy, and that
they show no signs of hot spots (surface skin infections that
look like festering sores) on their backs or legs. The puppies
should be energetic and full of life.
 Can I inspect the facility? Look at the play area and kennels
where the puppies are housed. Is the area clean and sani-
tized? Is the air cleaned through air purifiers? You should
smell no odor at all, and you should see no feces or urine in
the kennels. The facility should be as pristine as possible.
Part I: That Bullish Terrier 
48

 What kind of guarantee do you offer? The pet shop should
offer a health guarantee in case the puppy becomes ill after
you take her home. A health guarantee ensures that you can
return the puppy within a specific time period (typically sev-
eral days, depending on the contract) if your veterinarian sees
any signs of health problems or congenital defects.
 What information do you need from me? To determine
whether your home is fit for a puppy, a reputable pet store
owner should ask you about your experience in keeping a
dog. He should ask if you live in a home or an apartment, and
whether you have a yard or outdoor area to exercise your pet.
If the shopkeeper doesn’t question your ability to care for the
animal, he’s not acting responsibly.
That puppy in the pet store window may tug at your heartstrings,
but don’t rush in and buy it just to rescue it from the retailer.
Though some pet stores offer healthy pups, many don’t, and that
expensive impulse purchase may lead to unanticipated veterinary
bills. Besides, by buying a pup from a disreputable pet store,
you’re supporting the production of puppy mill dogs.
Magazine advertisements
Perusing the classified section in dog magazines is another way 
to find a purebred puppy. Many of these sources, however, don’t
screen the breeders, so if you choose to find your Boston this way,
do so with caution.
Call the breeders in the advertisements and ask them the same
questions that you would ask a breeder who was referred to you
by another Boston owner or kennel club. Just keep in mind that
cold calling breeders is the riskiest way to find a pet.
Recognizing a healthy puppy
Regardless of where you get your pup, she should be as healthy as
possible when you bring her home. You want your Boston to begin
her life with you as a sound, well-adjusted pet without obvious
physical or behavioral flaws.
Physical characteristics
You can begin this puppy health-check while the dog is at the
breeder’s facility or in the pet store. If the puppy is still with her 
littermates, look at the entire group. They should all be active and
playful. There should be no sick or weak puppies in the bunch; if
one is sick, the others will likely come down with the same illness.
Chapter 4: A Match Made in Boston 49

The pups should all have clear, bright eyes with no redness or 
discharge; cold, damp noses; and clean ears with no signs of ear
mites. None should be shaking her head or scratching at her ears,
because this behavior can indicate an infection. Similarly, there
should be no odor around the dogs’ ears. Their gums should also
be pink and healthy.
Their coats should be shiny and clean, and their skin should
appear pink and healthy with no hot spots or sores. Their bodies
should appear full, firm, and muscular. Their bellies should not be
bloated, which could be a sign of worms.
If you see signs of any physical malady, point it out to the breeder
or shopkeeper right away. But if the Boston puppy you have your
eye on checks out, take a closer look at her behavior among her 
littermates. Get to know their personalities.
Behavioral characteristics
You want an alert Boston who leaps up to see you, wagging her
little tail in sheer ecstasy. You don’t, however, want a pup who
appears overly aggressive or domineering, charging over her litter-
mates to get close to you. That little pup is a discipline problem
waiting to happen!
At the other end of the spectrum, you don’t want a shy, submissive
pup who hides in the corner or appears listless. Stick with a dog who
falls in the middle: excited but not giddy, laid back but not listless.
If the breeder okays it, take the puppy into an area where she hasn’t
been before. Put her down and watch her reaction. If she follows
you, she’s eager to please. If she chooses to explore her surround-
ings, she’s a curious pup who may still have a short attention span.
All the different reactions point to the pup’s personality.
If You Choose an Adult . . .
An adult Boston makes an excellent choice for a family that wants
a dog but doesn’t want to endure trying puppy behaviors, like
housetraining, obedience training, and chewing. Hundreds of
healthy adult Bostons who are looking for a family to love are 
available across the country.
You can find adult Bostons through kennel clubs and breeders.
Often, after the dogs are past their reproductive stages, breeders
place Bostons in loving homes so they can enjoy the rest of their
lives being spoiled by loving owners. You can also find adult
Bostons through breed-rescue organizations that specialize in find-
ing homes for dogs whose owners can’t care for them anymore.

When you adopt an adult dog, remember that you’re saving a
Boston’s life. Most people gravitate toward puppies, but the adults
need homes, too, and you can feel good about giving the dog a
second chance.
Working with a breeder
Boston breeders can be an excellent source for finding an adoptable
adult dog. Many times, they have adult males or females who they
no longer use for breeding or who have developed flaws that no
longer allow them to compete in conformation shows. They may
also have an adult dog who was returned to them because the
owner was no longer able to care for her. These dogs make fine 
companions, and you can be sure that they have been well cared for.
You can find a reputable breeder by attending a dog show, contact-
ing your regional kennel club, searching through periodicals, or
asking your veterinarian or pet store owner for a referral. Assess 
the breeder just as you would if you were buying a puppy: Ask 
questions, visit the facility, and check references whenever possible.
(See the “Breeders” section earlier in this chapter for more info.)
Connecting with rescues
Purebred dog rescue has become quite popular over the past ten
years as the number of purebred dogs being euthanized in shelters
has increased. Sponsored by breed clubs and independent organi-
zations, these rescue groups have formed to save these animals
and find new homes for them.
Chapter 4: A Match Made in Boston 51
Rescuing a Boston
If you choose to adopt an adult Boston Terrier, one of these national rescue organ-
izations can help. They have hundreds of healthy Bostons who are looking for loving
“forever” homes. They even have special-needs dogs who require a little extra care
and nurturing.
 Boston Terrier Club of America (www.bostonterrierclubofamerica.
org/rescue.html)
 Boston Terrier Rescue (www.btrescue.org)
 Nationwide Boston Terrier Rescue (www.nationwidebostonrescue.org)
 The Boston Site (www.thebostonsite.com)
 The Boston Terrier Rescue Net (www.bostonrescue.net)

You can find a Boston rescue group in your area by contacting a
national group, or you can check with your regional humane soci-
ety, animal control facility, veterinarian, or even pet store for breed
rescue information. Many of them track rescues and can provide
whatever contact information you need.
Most rescues require that you complete an application and con-
duct an interview with the organization’s representative. He will
ask you questions similar to those a breeder would ask. When
you’re approved for an adoption, you’ll be placed on a waiting list
or told if there are dogs available.
You won’t likely be able to get as much information about the dog
as you would if she were a puppy from a breeder, but you can find
out if the dog is healthy and housetrained.
After the dog moves in with you, the organization will likely follow
up to be sure the dog is settling in okay. The group doesn’t want
the dog back in rescue again, so it takes every care to make sure
that the adoption will work out.
Recognizing a healthy adult dog
A healthy adult dog has the same characteristics as a healthy
puppy. It should be lively and energetic, happy to see you, and 
willing to approach you without fear.
In addition, look for the following features:
 Clear, bright eyes with no redness, discharge, or injuries
 A cold, wet nose with no discharge of any kind
 Clean, erect ears with no signs of ear mites or infection
 Clean and bright teeth with little tartar
 A smooth, clean coat free from external parasites, including
fleas, ticks, and mange
 Healthy, pink skin with no sores
 An overall sound structure with healthy legs, paws, and body
 No signs of coughing, congestion, or diarrhea
 Free and easy movement with no difficultly moving about
 Well-socialized, appearing confident and not afraid of sudden
sounds or movements
 Up to date on her shots and vaccinations

You’ve decided to welcome a Boston into your life.
So now what? Is your home prepared for the new
arrival? What supplies do you absolutely need? How do
you schedule and delegate all the chores associated with
your new pet?
This second section of Boston Terriers For Dummies

Preparing for Your Boston’s
Homecoming
In This Chapter
 Preparing your home and yard for your new arrival
 Licensing and registering your Boston
 Creating a shopping list of basic Boston necessities
Your Boston is coming home and will want to explore his new
surroundings. His arrival, however, requires some careful
planning to ensure his safety, health, and happiness. From putting
away puppy temptations to buying the most nutritious food, your
dog relies on you for his well-being and survival.
This chapter explains how to puppy-proof or dog-proof your home
and yard, describes how to properly license and register your dog,
and gives you a shopping list of essential equipment you need in
anticipation of his homecoming.
Puppy-Proofing Basics
Preparing your home and yard for a new puppy is similar to doing
so for a curious toddler. Look at the world from your Boston
Terrier’s perspective — about 2 feet off the ground! Your pup will
want to investigate every electrical cord, every closet, and every
rut in the yard, and he won’t distinguish between your favorite pair
of shoes and his chew toy.
The following sections point out common puppy temptations that
you’ll find both inside and outside. By removing the temptations
before he comes home, you’ll set up your Boston to succeed.

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
56
Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
These suggestions are intended to be an overview of what your
Boston may come across in his new home. Thoroughly inspect
your home and yard before your pup comes home, and continue to
do so daily. If your dog swallows something that may be harmful or
injures himself in any way, contact your veterinarian immediately.
Stashing stuff inside your home
From the kitchen to the office, temptations abound inside the
home. Small items that resemble playthings are easy prey for your
pup. Look at the surroundings from your dog’s point of view — best
done by getting down on all fours — and pay particular attention
to the following areas.
Kitchen
The kitchen contains all sorts of interesting drawers, cabinets, and
cords, not to mention smells and tastes. If he can get into a cabinet
or drawer, your Boston will explore everything inside. Childproof
latches, which can be found at your local hardware store, prevent
curious pups from investigating off-limit areas and keep potentially
dangerous foods and cleaning supplies out of reach.
Power cords look like fun chew toys to a teething Boston. Tucking
them out of reach, blocking them, or enclosing them in a chew-
proof PVC tube will divert your dog’s attention.
Tempting smells entice Bostons, too. Be diligent about putting left-
overs away rather than leaving them on the counter. And secure
the garbage can with a locking lid or store it behind a latched cabi-
net door to keep the rubbish inside the can — not all over the
kitchen floor (or inside your Boston’s belly)!
Bathroom
The bathroom can be a dangerous place for a Boston. Razors, pills,
cotton swabs, and soap left within your dog’s reach can be easily
chewed and ingested — which can mean an emergency visit to
your veterinarian. Family members need to be conscientious about
cleaning up after themselves in the bathroom. Put shampoos, soap,
tissues, and accessories out of reach or inside a cabinet or drawer.
Especially while your Boston is young, keep the toilet lid down at
all times, or keep the bathroom door closed. A curious pup can
jump into the bowl and drown.
As with the kitchen, use a trash can with a locking lid, or stash it
under the sink. Also install childproof latches on the drawers and
cabinets, and be sure to tuck dangling cords away.

Bedroom
Dogs are scent oriented, so they gravitate toward anything that
smells like you. Shoes, slippers, and clothing will quickly become
toys if you don’t safeguard such items behind a closed closet door.
Keep clothing picked up, store shoes out of reach, and put laundry
in a tall, closed hamper.
Store jewelry, hair ties, coins, and other small ingestible items in
containers or drawers, and secure any exposed cords or wires.
Many dogs like to den under the bed or wedge themselves behind
furniture, so put up temporary blockades to prevent your Boston
from hiding where he shouldn’t.
Office
Your Boston may be drawn by all sorts of temptations in your
office: papers, magazines, cords, wires, paperclips, rubber bands,
and staples. These items may be fun to play with, but they can be
fatal if chewed or swallowed. As with the rest of the house, pick up
strewn office supplies, secure or enclose cords and wires, and keep
decorative items well out of your Boston’s reach.
Plants attract dogs, too, so place them on a shelf or counter if pos-
sible. If not, consider putting them in a spare room and keeping the
door closed until your Boston has graduated from his curious
puppy stage.
Minimizing outdoor hazards
When you look around your garage and yard, you’ll see many obvi-
ous and not-so-obvious dangers to your Boston. Just as you
inspected and puppy-proofed the inside of your home from your
dog’s perspective, do the same with the outside of your home.
Poisons and chemicals
Paint, cleaners, insecticides, fertilizers, antifreeze, and gasoline
represent a handful of poisons and chemicals that you may have in
your garage or outdoor shed. Antifreeze, for example, has a sweet
taste that attracts animals, but it can be deadly if ingested, even in
small amounts. Secure all bottles, boxes, and containers of these
substances behind a locked cabinet door, or store them on high
shelves that your pup can’t reach.
Rat poisons, snail bait, and ant traps can look like toys or tasty
treats to your pet, but they, too, should be put away when your
Boston comes home.

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
58
Plants
Bostons are curious dogs, and they’ll investigate — and possibly
dig up — many of the plants in your yard if left unattended. Some
plants, such as daffodils, foxglove, Bird of Paradise, and lupine, can
be poisonous to your dog and cause varied reactions, ranging from
a rash to vomiting and diarrhea. You can find a list of the most
commonly encountered toxic plants at the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal’s Animal Poison Control Center
Web site: www.apcc.aspca.org.
Protect your pup — and your foliage — by fencing in plants and
delineating where he is allowed and where he isn’t.
Tools and gardening equipment
Though they may be too unwieldy for a Boston pup to wrangle,
power tools, cords, and gardening equipment should also be kept
out of his reach. Sniffing a sharp blade could cut his delicate nose,
or tugging on a cord may cause a heavy saw to fall and break one
of his bones, or worse.
License and Registration, Please
In most counties and states, licensing your Boston Terrier is the
law. You will need to apply for and obtain a dog license from your
local animal control agency soon after you bring your pup home.
Registering him with one of the national or international dog reg-
istries is voluntary. This process begins with the breeder, who first
registers her dog’s litter. When you take ownership of the puppy,
the breeder gives you a dog registration application, which you
must complete and mail to the registering organization. You can do
this before or after you bring your Boston home, but it must be
done before the pup reaches his first birthday.
Making your Boston legal
Depending on where you live, county or state laws require that
your dog be licensed. A dog license gives you permission to legally
own the animal. The dog-licensing agency issues an identification
number along with a dog tag bearing the number that your Boston
wears at all times.
The licensing laws are in place to protect your dog and other ani-
mals against rabies, which can threaten their lives. Licensing your
Boston also ensures that he will be returned to you if he wanders
away from home and is picked up by animal control. The fees you

pay for licenses go toward returning thousands of animals to their
homes each year, finding homes for thousands more, and con-
tributing to spay/neuter programs in your area.
To apply for a dog license, contact your local animal control
agency. They will send you a form that will ask for your name,
address, and phone number, as well as your pet’s name, breed, sex,
age, microchip number (if applicable), and whether your Boston
has been spayed or neutered. The agency may also require a copy
of your pup’s rabies vaccination and sterilization certificates.
Upon approval of your documentation, you will receive a licensing
tag with a unique number that you need to attach to your dog’s
collar and make sure he wears it at all times. If your Boston makes
a run for it, chances are good that he will be picked up and returned
to you if he is wearing his collar and tag.
Licensing fees vary from area to area, but generally, unaltered 
animals cost more to license than spayed or neutered animals.
Renewal forms are sent annually.
Registering with the AKC and UKC
The American Kennel Club (AKC) and the United Kennel Club
(UKC), the two most well-known dog registries in the United States,
record purebred dogs and issue them an AKC or UKC registration
number.
Dog registries have specific requirements for eligibility. For exam-
ple, to be eligible for registration, your Boston’s parents, the sire
(the papa dog) and the dam (the mama dog), and their litter must
also have been registered by their owners and the breeder. You can
check with the individual registries for additional requirements.
Benefits of registering your Boston include
 Permanently recording him in the AKC or UKC registry
 Obtaining a certificate of registry
 Gaining access to various ancillary benefits. For example, the
AKC offers a free pet healthcare trial, a certificate for a free
veterinary visit, a new puppy handbook, and eligibility to par-
ticipate in competitive AKC-sanctioned events.
To register your Boston, you need to fill out the application jointly
with the litter’s owner. She provides the dog’s sex, color and mark-
ings, whether the registration is standard or limited (meaning a
single dog whose litter won’t be eligible for registration), transfer
date, your name and address, and her signature.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 59

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
60
You provide the dog’s name, payment information, registration
options, and your signature. Both registries charge a nominal, non-
refundable fee. When the application and fees are approved, you
receive an official certificate of registry.
To delve further into choosing and buying a Boston from a regis-
tered breeder, turn to Chapter 4.
Time to Go Shopping
Shopping for your Boston, which is like shopping for a furry
member of the family, can be intimidating! Walk through any pet
boutique, big-box retailer, or local department store, like Target or
Wal-Mart, and you’ll see aisles of premium diets and treats, plush
beds, toys of every shape and size, and even haute doggy couture.
It’s temping to splurge on your new dog. Don’t worry: You’ll have
plenty of time to do that. To begin with, however, you can pick up
a few items to make your Boston Terrier’s homecoming smooth.
Brands, quality, and costs run the gamut. Shop around, but don’t
sacrifice quality for price.
So many leashes and collars, 
so little time
Your Boston will need a collar, leash, and possibly a harness soon
after you bring him home. This section gives you the scoop. Also
check out Figure 5-1 for an assortment of popular choices.
Collars
A collar makes more than a fashion statement; it also holds the
dog’s licensing tag and ID tag, which lists your contact information
should he ever get lost. The collar also attaches to the leash,
which you need to walk your Boston.
For your dog’s first few collars, pick up an adjustable nylon type
with a buckle. These collars come in a variety of colors and styles
to fit your Boston’s personality. To find the right size, either meas-
ure the diameter of your Boston’s neck and add 2 inches for some
growing room, or take your dog to the pet store and try some on
him. Plan to buy several collars as your pup grows.

After your Boston is fully grown, decorative collar choices are end-
less. You can buy a diamond-encrusted leather collar, a colorful
vinyl collar, or even a studded motorcycle-dog collar! You can even
buy collars to match outfits or to celebrate seasons.
Figure 5-1: Collars, leashes, and harnesses come in many varieties.
Whatever collar you choose, be sure that it’s sized and weighted
appropriately for your Boston. Big heavy collars can catch
on objects and choke your dog; small cat collars can be too 
restrictive.
Other collars designed for training purposes, such as slip chain or
choke collars, can be purchased after your Boston’s a little older
and you’ve consulted with your veterinarian or a professional
trainer on how to use them correctly.
Leashes
The leash, which attaches to the collar, gives you control during
walks or obedience training. You can coordinate the leash and
collar so they match. When you purchase a leash, make sure the
attachment won’t break or unhook from the collar, and choose one
with a strong and comfortable loop for your hand.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 61

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
62
Like collars, leash choices include an array of lengths, styles,
and materials, including nylon, hemp, cotton, leather, and vinyl.
For your Boston’s first few leashes, a 4-foot nylon, cotton web-
bing, or leather variety is all you need. As you begin obedience
training, you’ll need longer leashes, including 6-foot and 15-foot
lengths.
Harnesses
You can also choose a harness for your Boston. Rather than loop
around your dog’s neck, a harness loops around his shoulders and
torso (see Figure 5-1 for an example). The dog steps into it, and
you simply snap or buckle it closed. The leash attaches to the back
of the harness instead of the collar, putting the pressure around his
body instead of his neck.
You can use a harness and collar interchangeably, but a harness is
especially suitable for Bostons who pull when walking. A harness
doesn’t give you as much control as a collar, but it does prevent
the dog from gasping or choking if he leads you on excursions.
Unmistaken identity
Your Boston will require some identification, and you can choose
from several options: ID tags, tattoos, and microchips. They each
have their benefits and drawbacks, so the best option is to use a
combination of at least two.
 ID tags: Readily visible on your dog’s collar, ID tags list infor-
mation about your dog and you, such as your Boston’s name
and your name, address, and telephone number. At the very
least, list your name and the best way to contact you, whether
it be a cellphone, office phone, or home phone. (If you’re 
wondering how an ID tag is different from a license tag, the
answer is simple: The license tag usually lists the dog’s license
number and the animal control agency’s phone number. It
generally doesn’t list all of the personal information included
on an ID tag.)
ID tag styles include plastic, engraved metal, and reflective
tags in all shapes, sizes, and colors. You can order them from
your veterinarian or purchase them at your local pet store.
These tags are the most common form of identification, and
they are often used to reunite a lost dog and owner. If you
have several collars for your Boston, be sure each one has
an ID tag.

ID tags can fall off the collar, and sometimes the engraving
wears off, the imprint fades, or the tag becomes too worn to
read. So regularly check the ID tag to make sure it’s still
attached to the collar and is readable. And if you move to a new
home, make sure the tag has your current information on it.
 Tattoos: Tattoos are another identification option (and I’m not
talking about an image of a fire hydrant permanently painted
on his foreleg). An authorized tattooer, generally recommended
by your veterinarian or breeder, tattoos a unique number
on your Boston’s skin, typically on his belly or inner thigh.
A virtually painless procedure, the tattoo is done with no
anesthetic and takes only minutes to do. First, the dog is
placed on his side, and you hold his head and front paws
while an assistant holds his back paws. Then, the area is
shaved and disinfected. The tattoo is applied, the area is
washed thoroughly, and a light coating of petroleum jelly is
applied over the top. The area heals completely in several
days, leaving behind a permanent identification number.
The number can be virtually any sequence you choose: the
dog’s AKC or UKC number, a random number selected by the
tattoo registry, or even your Social Security number, which,
historically, has been the number of choice. The number is
then listed with one of several national tattoo databases.
When your dog is found, the shelter contacts the various 
registries and matches the tattoo number to you.
This ID method is a less reliable way to guarantee that your dog
will be returned to you. The person who finds your dog may
not know to look for a tattoo, and if she does, she may not
know what it signifies or how to access the national database.
If you decide to tattoo your Boston, use a secondary form of
identification, like an ID tag, that lists your contact information.
 Microchips: A rice-sized microchip is another method of identi-
fying your Boston. Injected by your veterinarian between your
dog’s shoulder blades, this microchip contains a code that is
stored in a database with your contact information. When your
dog is found, a staff member at the shelter uses a handheld
scanner to read the code in the microchip. The code is then
entered into the database, which tells the shelter your name
and phone number, so you and your dog can be reunited.
If you have your dog microchipped, take the time to register
your contact information and keep it up to date. The microchip
won’t do any good if there’s no name or phone number associ-
ated with it, or if the information is incorrect! Similarly, if you
move, change your phone number, or sell your dog, notify the
registry and update it as necessary.

Fine china or basic bowls
Your Boston will need food and water bowls when he comes home.
These doggy dishes vary as much as dinnerware patterns for
people. From custom-painted ceramic ware and hand-thrown pot-
tery to sleek stainless steel bowls and durable plastic dishes, place
settings for your pooch have as much personality as the Bostons
themselves. Elevated racks adorned with wrought iron or carved
wood add elegance to the food and water bowls (see Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2: You can go as low- or high-end with food bowls as you like.
Each material has its benefits and drawbacks:
 Plastic bowls are lightweight and inexpensive, but they
retain residue and harbor bacteria as they break down.
Your Boston may chew on his bowl and swallow the little plas-
tic pieces. Then you may be making an unplanned trip to the
vet. If you choose plastic, purchase a harder, dishwasher-safe
plastic and replace it at the first signs of wear.
 Custom ceramic pieces weigh more than plastic dishes,
so they’re not likely to tip over or be turned into a toy.
However, these dishes are more expensive and breakable, and
if they’re made overseas, they may contain lead, which can be
harmful to your Boston. Make sure any piece you choose is

sturdy, lead-free, and dishwasher safe. You can find beautiful
bowls in designs to match virtually any décor.
 Stainless steel bowls, though generally the most expensive,
clean and sanitize easily. They’re heavy enough that your
dog won’t wander off with one, and they’re virtually indestruc-
tible. Some designs include rubber bases to keep them from
sliding across the floor as your Boston scarfs down dinner.
Your Boston will need at least two sets of bowls (two for food and
two for water) that you can rotate so you can wash them regularly.
Because your Boston will grow to only 25 pounds, a 16- or 24-
ounce, standard-depth bowl will suffice.
Items to keep your Boston contained
A must for any puppy owner, containment devices keep your
Boston in a confined area where you can monitor and housetrain
him. You will need a dog crate or carrier, and an X-pen, playpen, or
gate when you bring your Boston home.
Carriers come in three categories:
 The crate or travel carrier, which doubles as a den and can
be used in the home, the car, or on an airplane
 The around-town tote, which transports a pup into dog-
friendly establishments
 The pet purse, which looks like a handbag and takes the pet
into taboo places, like restaurants and theaters
X-pens, playpens, and baby gates corral curious puppies. If you are
unable to keep your eyes on your Boston, pens and gates offer an
excellent short-term solution.
You can find a full range of carriers at your local pet store or pet
specialty boutique; look for the X-pens, playpens, and baby gates
in the baby section of most major department stores.
Quality matters when selecting crates, carriers, and containment
devices. Choose the highest quality that you can afford to keep
your Boston safe while he’s contained.
Crates and travel carriers
Crates and travel carriers not only provide for your Boston’s easy
transport to and from the veterinarian’s office, but they also serve
as a housetraining tool, a cozy dog den, and a place for him to hide
when strangers come to visit.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 65

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
66
Crates and kennels come in a wide variety of sizes and materials,
including plastic, nylon, powder-coated wire, and stainless steel
(see Figure 5-3). The hard-sided plastic and fiberglass models,
which are generally lighter and more portable, frequently double
as airline-approved carriers (check with your airline to be certain).
They also keep your Boston warmer in the winter. The wire and
stainless steel varieties allow for more air flow during hot sum-
mers, but they don’t provide the privacy your Boston may want.
Figure 5-3: Choose crates and carriers according to your needs.
Your dog should be able to stand up, turn around, lie down, and
stretch out in his kennel. Bostons enjoy a cozy den-like area rather
than a wide-open space. Though you may want to give your Boston
an entire room of his own, he prefers to feel enclosed in his crate.
When you bring the crate home, put it together and make sure the
pieces fit together properly, the door latches correctly, and the
handle works as it should. Also check for any sharp spots that may
cut your Boston. Lay down a washable fleece lining or blanket to
create a comfy space for your pup.
Soft-sided carriers and pet purses
In addition to a crate, many small-dog owners purchase a portable
soft-sided carrier (see Figure 5-4). These about-town totes resem-
ble trendy purses or shoulder bags, and they feature a range of

accoutrements, such as a cellphone holder and pockets for keys,
your wallet, dog treats, and plastic bags. Some of these carriers are
also airline approved, so you can take your Boston with you wher-
ever you go. If you’re ready to hit the road with your Boston, read
Chapter 12 first.
Figure 5-4: Soft carriers and totes are for portability, not safety.
The smaller pet purses and totes allow you to take your Boston
with you when you attend meetings, shop, or dine. You and your
pooch will look fashionable when motoring about town, but
don’t think that these small bags will provide much protection
when your dog travels in a car or airplane. Unlike the soft-sided
carriers, the purses lack the structural integrity required by airline
regulations.
Designer carriers in fashionable designs and materials often come
with a removable fleece liner (for easy cleaning and comfort), as
well as matching collars, leads, and food bowls, creating a coordi-
nated look for your Boston. There’s no reason why you and your
dog can’t be cosmopolitan!
Depending on his final adult weight, your Boston will likely out-
grow his portable doggy bag as he matures. When he gets too big
to sling over your shoulder, outfit him with a fashionable collar-
leash combo and let him strut his stuff.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 67

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
68
X-pens, playpens, and gates
X-pens are a set of portable wire panels that confine your pup to a
specific area. You can adjust them to fit any space. After you have
assembled the pen, you can enclose your pup, his crate, food and
water bowls, and toys inside the space. Playpens, much like those
for human babies, serve a similar purpose. You can take both the
X-pen and the playpen outside so your Boston can enjoy a little
sunshine, though always under your watchful eye.
Baby gates will give your Boston a little more freedom inside the
house. They confine your pup to one room or one part of the
house, keeping the rest off limits. They easily attach to door
frames, and you can remove them whenever you want. For more
about establishing off-limit areas, turn to Chapter 6.
Both X-pens and baby gates are safe ways to keep your Boston
confined to a particular area. Never leave him alone for too long,
however. Puppies need bathroom breaks and stimulation, and ram-
bunctious adolescents could knock the barrier down!
Cuisine for your canine
When it comes to food and treats for your Boston, you can choose
from countless diets and menus. From crunchy fortified kibble and
canned stews to organic blends fit for human consumption, pet food
manufacturers roll out hundreds of healthy diets and treats for dogs.
Diet
As a puppy, your Boston requires food formulated for growth and
development. It contains more essential nutrients, such as protein
and carbohydrates, that encourage the growth of healthy bones
and muscles. When he’s an adult, he can eat food designed for
maintenance. These diets pack less of a punch than the puppy for-
mula, but they still provide everything your Boston needs to be
healthy. (See Chapter 7 for more on choosing the best diet.)
Selecting the right food can be daunting. You can feed the same
diet that the breeder fed your Boston to prevent an upset stomach,
or you can talk with your veterinarian about the right diet for your
dog. Keep in mind, however, that your Boston will do much of the
choosing; if he doesn’t like the taste, he’ll let you know!
Treats
Treats vary almost as much as diets. You can give your Boston the
traditional biscuit. You can tantalize him with freeze-dried meat.
You can visit your downtown doggy bakery and order him some
freshly baked cookies. You can even make your own treats!

When purchasing treats, note the ingredients and nutrition infor-
mation so you know what you’re feeding your pup. Though you’ll
be tempted to treat your Boston often, remember that these are
treats, not meals. Too many goodies can spoil your pup’s appetite
or lead to a weight issue.
In addition, many treats are not intended for puppies, so check the
label for feeding instructions.
Bedding for your Boston
Everyone loves a comfy bed, and Bostons are no exception. The
first night your pup comes home, you’ll want to give him a warm
cozy place of his own to lay his head — inside his crate, of course.
Besides possibly suffocating your puppy or ruining your sofa, shar-
ing your bed with your dog or letting him sleep wherever he
pleases can lead to dominant behavior issues down the road.
While you’re housetraining your Boston, you may have him sleep
in his crate or kennel. Smaller beds and bumper beds covered in
fleece or sheepskin are designed just for this purpose. They keep
the dog warm and cozy while he’s sleeping the night — or day —
away.
After your Boston is housetrained and graduates from his crate to
a real dog bed, you can choose from all shapes and sizes: round
beds, square beds, basket-style beds filled with cushions, and even
beds that look like mattresses. The beds are often stuffed with
cotton, poly-blends, or memory foam, along with cedar chips for
odor and insect control. Most beds have removable, washable
covers.
As with the other Boston essentials, purchase a bed that is sized
appropriately for your dog. You want him to feel cozy and safe, and
your pup won’t get that feeling from a giant bed.
If your pup tends to chew on his bedding and ingest some of the
foam or stuffing, remove it from his crate or take it away from him
to prevent possible intestinal blockage. Offer him a blanket or
towel to sleep on until he gets over his chewing phase.
Playtime! Picking out toys
Bostons love their toys. They wrestle with them, carry them from
room to room, and chew them until they’re unrecognizable. The
highly intelligent Boston needs the stimulation that toys provide.

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
70
Like every other section in the pet store, the toy choices seem end-
less. From squeaky balls and figurines shaped like your favorite
politician to colorful ropes, stuffed animals, and stuffable hard
rubber balls, there’s a toy for any dog’s taste.
Despite all the choices, you should only offer your Boston toys
that are sized appropriately for him. Imagine your 20-pound Boston
wielding a Great Dane–sized toy or accidentally swallowing a tiny
Yorkshire Terrier–sized bone! An increasing number of companies
manufacture small- to medium-size dog toys, like small tennis balls,
stuffed animals, and rope toys, so ask for them when you visit your
local pet store.
Choose toys that are durable and well-made. When you bring the
toys home, check for potential hazards, such as small pieces that
can fall off and be swallowed. Your Boston won’t destroy toys like
some dogs can, but you still want to ensure your pet’s safety.
If your dog does destroy a squeaky toy and exposes the noise-
maker, replace the toy. Also replace or repair toys whose stuffing is
falling out, or whose rope strands are overly frayed. You don’t
want your Boston eating anything he shouldn’t!
Tug toy throwdown
In years past, tug toys endured their share of criticism. The popular wisdom was
that the tugging action encouraged aggressive behavior in dogs.
The wisdom is changing.
Trainers now say that tugging is a natural behavior that can be used in positive rein-
forcement training. If the human always wins the tug of war, the dog will realize that
his place in the pack is secondary to the human.
Likewise, in multiple-dog settings, such as dog-friendly workplaces or daycare 
facilities, the dogs tug among themselves, determining the pack order. This innate
behavior can be easily translated to a domestic setting.
When you and your Boston play tug of war with one of his new toys, make sure you
win every time. Safely tug back until you are the top dog in the pack, no matter how
long he fights. If you don’t, you may find yourself butting heads with your dog!
A cautionary note: Bostons with dominance issues should steer clear of tug toys.
The play can encourage confrontational behavior regardless of who wins the battle,
so if your dog thinks he’s the king of the castle, play fetch instead.

Bostons are intelligent dogs, and toys that require them to work or
think will keep them busy for hours. Treat-filled hard rubber toys
are perfect for this task. They will also give your Boston an alterna-
tive to chewing your favorite pair of slippers.
Toys are fun, and you’ll be tempted to give your Boston all the toys
at once, but don’t give in! Keep a secret stash of toys and dole
them out as your dog destroys them.
For the fashion-savvy Boston
Your Boston may look like tough little fighter, but he can look stun-
ning in some dandy doggy duds.
In most pet specialty stores today, you can find a range of clothing
designed especially for dogs. From T-shirts and costumes to designer
jackets and booties, your Boston can wear just about any outfit to
fit his mood.
Bostons typically wear a size small or medium, depending on the
dog and the design. When you’re considering a piece of clothing
for your dog, take a look at the cut of the attire. It should look like
it would fit a dog. Clothing for dogs is not miniaturized clothing
for people. Their arm (well, foreleg) holes are in the front, not on
the sides. Also take a look at how it fits. The outfit should be
adjustable and give in areas around the neck and legs.
Some dog clothing is functional. If it’s raining, a slicker keeps your
dog warm and dry. If you’re going boating with your Boston, a
floatation device ensures your dog is both safe and fashionable.
If you’re going to a costume party, that bumble bee outfit will cer-
tainly create a buzz. Some clothing is purely for the dog owner’s
benefit. You can decide whether you’ll dress your Boston in trendy
fashions or functional favorites.
Items for cleanup duty
Cleaning up after your dog is one of the necessary evils of pet 
ownership. When your Boston is a puppy, you’ll need to clean up
indoor potty accidents. When your dog is an adult, you’ll need to
clean up his bathroom area outside.
Luckily, many different products cater specifically to this dirty job.
You can find a variety of cleaners, including those formulated to
neutralize pet odors, in most pet specialty stores.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 71

Eliminating all traces of accidents is critical because if the odor
isn’t removed, your Boston will continue to choose that same
place to relieve himself. So look for a product that not only cleans
up the accident, but neutralizes it as well.
Pooper scoopers, a cleanup necessity for picking up your pup’s
poop, range from gadget-filled devices to the simple shovel and
rake. You can also find cleanup bags in various sizes, shapes, and
materials, including biodegradable varieties. Keep a good supply of
those on hand for long walks in the park or through the neighbor-
hood. (Ready to know more about housetraining your Boston?
Read Chapter 9.)
Canine hygiene products
Your Boston’s coat requires regular washing, brushing, and clip-
ping. Your Boston also needs his toenails trimmed, his ears
cleaned, and his teeth brushed.
Before your Boston comes home, have your primping products
ready. The sooner you can introduce your dog to the grooming 
routine (see Chapter 8), the better.
Store the following items in a tote or container for easy access.
You’ll also want to designate a specific area in your home for
grooming so your Boston will learn what to expect:
 Brush and comb: You need a pin brush and a comb to smooth
your Boston’s smooth coat. A pin brush is a rubber-backed
brush with fine pins that may have small rubber balls on the
ends. Choose a metal or stainless steel comb with narrow
teeth on one end and wider teeth on the other.
 Shampoo and conditioner: You can choose from many sham-
poo and conditioner options. Some contain botanicals and
aroma-therapeutic ingredients, while others have oatmeal,
fruit essences, and aloe vera. Coat conditioning sprays beau-
tify the coat in between washings.
Don’t share your hair products with your Boston; they’re too
harsh for his skin. Instead, use formulas designed especially
for dogs.
 Toenail clippers: You’ll need clippers to keep your Boston’s
nails trim and dull. You can choose from two versions: a 
guillotine style that cuts the nail in one motion, or a scissor
style that snips through the nail. Use the type that you’re
most comfortable with.
Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
72

 Small scissors: A small pair of scissors comes in handy when
you’re trimming the hair inside your Boston’s ears or around
his paw pads. Choose a quality stainless steel pair that feels
comfortable in your hands.
 Blow-dryer: You likely already have one of these for yourself
or someone in your household, but it should be part of your
Boston’s grooming arsenal, too.
 Cotton swabs and cotton balls: You’ll use these items to clean
your Boston’s ears and eyes.
 Toothbrush and toothpaste: As soon as your Boston’s perma-
nent teeth come in (around 4 to 6 months old), you’ll need to
brush his teeth several times a week with a child’s toothbrush
and dog toothpaste — not human toothpaste — to clean bac-
teria, plaque, and tartar from his mouth. Poor dental hygiene
has been linked to heart and kidney disease in Bostons. Get
him used to the ritual early by brushing his baby teeth once a
week so he gets used to you working in his mouth.
The grooming regimen may seem like a lot of work, but with regular
maintenance, you’ll soon look forward to spending some quality
primping time with your pet!
Must-haves for your young pup
Puppy owners have their own shopping list. Besides a crate, toys,
food, and other essential items listed in the previous sections,
puppy owners need some specific items to help them through this
fascinating time of development.
 Housebreaking pads: Housebreaking pads are absorbent
sheets lined with plastic, and they prevent mistakes from soil-
ing your floor. Often used to line the area inside an X-pen, a
package or two of these makes cleanup easy.
 Bumper pad or bed: A bumper pad fits inside the crate, giving
your baby Boston a comfortable place to rest. You may
instead choose a small bed to use inside or outside the crate.
Whichever you purchase, make sure the pad or the bed’s
cover is removable and machine washable because accidents
will inevitably happen.
 Toys: Because adult toys are too big for small pups, you need
small plush or rope toys sized just for them. Pick toys that
don’t have sharp edges or removable parts that can be swal-
lowed. If the stuffing starts falling out of a toy, throw it away
and offer your Boston a new one.
Chapter 5: Preparing for Your Boston's Homecoming 73

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
74
Chew toys, often covered with knobs or bumps, are designed
to soothe sore gums and encourage the pup to cut his teeth.
Some can be frozen, and others are edible.
 Chewing deterrents: Puppies will chew; it’s to be expected.
If your Boston develops a penchant for the corner of your
couch, you can spray chewing deterrents, like Bitter Apple
Spray, on the area to discourage the behavior. Before using
this type of product on furniture or fabric, spot-check it in an
inconspicuous place to make sure it won’t ruin the item.
During your Boston’s chewing stage, keep a constant eye on
him even if you do use a spray deterrent. When you can’t
supervise him, put him in his kennel to keep him out of trouble.
 Gentle shampoo: A puppy’s coat and skin can be sensitive, so
you’ll also want to pick up a shampoo and conditioner formu-
lated just for him. They often contain soothing ingredients,
such as oatmeal or aloe vera.

I
t’s time for your Boston to come home! You’ve shopped for sup-
plies and puppy-proofed the house. You’ve planned for her
every need, from buying the perfect crate to indulging in the
newest leash-collar combo. Now the fun really begins!
When you welcome a puppy — or adult dog — into your home, the
antics never seem to stop. Your intelligent little Boston will entertain
you, challenge you, and push your limits from the moment she walks
through the door. To keep your relationship thriving, you need to
set up some household rules that dictate where she’s allowed to
be, what she’s allowed to do, and how she’s expected to act.
Similarly, you should set up some rules for the humans in the
household. By following regular routines and consistent training
techniques, you and your family can teach your Boston how to
become an integral part of your family.
A new home can be an intimidating scene for your new puppy,
making even the boldest Boston quiver. In this chapter, you dis-
cover some ways to make the environment welcoming for your
new dog, including how to introduce her to her new surroundings,
introduce her to other pets, set up a schedule for eating, relieving,
and sleeping, and establish rules for her and other members of
your household to follow.
If you work Monday through Friday, try to bring your puppy home
on a Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. You’ll have two full
days to spend with your new Boston. You’ll be able to establish a
routine for feeding, going to the bathroom, and playing. You’ll also
be able to take much-needed naps when your puppy does!

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
76
Taking the Home Tour
The first thing to do when you bring your Boston home is show her
around the house, focusing on the places that are going to be most
important to her: her eating and drinking place, her sleeping space,
her play area, and her bathroom spot outside.
While your Boston is a puppy, limit the number of rooms she has
access to. Doing so helps your Boston feel safe and secure, and it
teaches her boundaries. After she matures, you can expand her
universe to include other areas of the home and let her roam
around the house, following you from room to room.
Before entering the home, give your pup a chance to relieve herself
out in the yard. That way, you can have peace of mind that she
won’t have an accident while she sniffs and explores her new digs.
The pup’s eating and drinking area
The area where your Boston chows down and fills her belly will be
one of her favorite spots.
A logical place to put your dog’s food and water bowls is in the
kitchen, but some people prefer to put it in the laundry room,
garage, or other out-of-the-way spot in the house, particularly if
the kitchen is very small.
Wherever you decide to serve your pup’s meals, let everyone in
the family know that the area is your Boston’s designated dining
room. Introduce the area to your dog when she comes home, using
lots of praise and enthusiasm. If she feels like taking a few bites,
let her. If not, that’s fine too. She’s likely too nervous and excited
right now.
The den and sleeping area
A crate acts as your Boston’s den and sleeping area. Typically made
of hard plastic or powder-coated metal, this kennel is like your
dog’s cave: It’s her safe place where she can enjoy some “me” time.
During the day, you will place your Boston in the crate with the
door closed while you train her to hold her bladder. Dogs typically
won’t relieve themselves where they sleep, so this teaches your
dog to wait until you take her outside.
With the door open, the crate serves as your dog’s personal space.
She’ll use it as a hideaway when she feels like a nap and as a safe

place when strangers come over. At night, you will put her to bed
in the crate until she’s old enough to sleep on a traditional dog bed.
If you’re using a different crate than the one you brought her home
in, show her where it’s kept. If you’re using the same crate, set it
up in its spot in the house, and then show her where she can find
it. Toss a treat into the crate to encourage her to go in and take a
look around. (For more on how to introduce your pup to her crate,
flip to Chapter 9.)
Not sure where to keep the crate? Consider these questions:
 Where do you spend the most time? Where will your Boston
get the most opportunities to socialize and get familiar with
new smells, sights, and sounds? Your Boston will want to feel
like she’s part of the pack, and she won’t feel like that if she’s
isolated in a room away from you and your family.
 Will you have another crate in the bedroom? If so, purchase
a second crate and line it with training pads. When she’s older
and can spend all night in her crate without messing it, throw
in a cushy pillow and warm blanket.
 Are there any drafts in the area? Keep the kennel away from
fireplaces, open windows, or heating or air conditioning vents
so your Boston doesn’t become overheated or chilled. Keep
the kennel out of direct sunlight, especially during the
summer and in warmer climates.
 Is the area easy to clean? Will you be able to clean up an acci-
dent quickly? Don’t put the crate on an expensive rug or near
heirloom furniture! Put it on an easy-to-clean surface and, if
necessary, lay down sheets of newspaper just in case.
The play areas
Bostons love to play, so you also need to create an area that is safe
and fun for your pup to play in. When your Boston is a puppy, she
doesn’t need much space: Keeping her in an X-pen or playpen will do.
But as she grows and needs more room to play, expand the area to
one or two rooms, such as the living room and the bedroom.
To help your Boston understand what area is her play area, keep
her toys there, and when you introduce her to that space, take a
few minutes to let her play with some of those toys in that space.
When deciding what areas of the house are suitable for your dog to
freely romp in, make sure the area is easy to clean, doesn’t contain
expensive furniture or harmful plants, and is a place where the
family often gathers. Her crate should also be in or near that area.

Meeting Other Members of the Pack
Part of welcoming your Boston into your home is to introduce her
to other members of the pack — including the children and other
pets. With training and discipline, most Boston Terriers integrate
into a household without a hitch. This section explores how to
bring your new family together.
Kids, puppy. Puppy, kids.
If you have children or if kids frequent your home, they’re proba-
bly more excited about your Boston than you are! Most kids adore
puppies, but a young person’s exuberant behavior can be a bit
much for your new dog. Children who are awkward or inexperi-
enced around animals may hurt the puppy by mistake. To prevent
overstimulation or accidental injury (on the part of the kids or the
dog!), here are two sets of guidelines: one for young children and
one for grade-schoolers.
Children who haven’t been exposed to dogs need some extra hand-
holding during the first few introductions. Instruct them to never
approach a strange dog, especially when adults aren’t present.
If they know the dog, tell them to never put their face close to a
dog’s face or tease the animal. Don’t frighten the child, but let him
know that dogs are animals and can behave unexpectedly.
Teaching the tiny tots
Younger children, including toddlers and preschool-age kids, will
likely see your Boston pup as another one of their fuzzy stuffed
animals! It’s easy to see why: The cuddly dog is a living, interactive
plaything who delivers hours of entertainment. However adorable
they are, Bostons aren’t toys. With improper handling, a pup can
be seriously injured. Her prominent eyes can be damaged, or she
can get overly excited and hurt herself.
When you introduce your children to your Boston, use these steps:
1. Sit on the floor or in a chair and hold the puppy in your
arms. Ask the child to slowly approach, not moving too
quickly.
Make sure that the child understands that he should
not toddle up to or play with the puppy without you
(or another adult) around.
2. Invite the child to pet the puppy. Show him how to handle
a dog carefully and gently, modeling the behavior for the
child and allowing him to mimic you.

Point out the puppy’s eyes, nose, and mouth. Let him know
that these are sensitive off-limit areas on the dog’s body.
3. When the child asks to hold the puppy, have him sit on the
floor and gently place the Boston in his lap. Tell him to
handle and touch the puppy gently, not holding on too
tight.
Stay nearby and supervise the pair.
4. Watch the dog’s — and the child’s — body language.
If either starts to squirm or cry, playtime is over.
Place your puppy back in her kennel or playpen (after you
take her to her bathroom area, just in case!). You want the
experience to be a positive one for everyone involved, and
if one or the other becomes uncomfortable, that can ruin
the fun for everyone.
5. After your child and puppy have met, go over the rules
with your child.
Make sure he understands that the dog is not a toy, that
she requires special handling, and that you (or another
adult) must be present when he wants to play with her.
Advising preadolescents
Little balls of energy, most grade school–age kids will want to
immediately run and play with the puppy. When your Boston is
older, those active games are okay (with supervision, of course!).
But when your child is meeting the puppy for the first time, all that
excitement will be too much for her to handle.
For the first few interactions, ask your older child to follow these
rules with the puppy:
 Sit and wait: Ask the child to sit quietly on the floor and bring
the puppy into the room. The child may be tempted to turn
toward the dog and pick her up, but tell him not to. Have him
wait until the puppy comes to him.
 Explore and sniff: Let the dog approach the child and sniff
him. The pup will run her cold little nose all over the child,
getting to know his scent. The child can have a toy or a treat
in his lap to lure the pup over.
 Doggy handshake: After the pup sniffs the child, have him
extend a hand for the pup to smell. Teach the child that this is
the appropriate way for a person to introduce himself to a dog.
 Supervised play: When the dog is comfortable with the child,
the child can then gently pet and play with the puppy. Don’t let
him pick up the puppy without your permission, and remind
him not to play too rough or exuberantly.
Chapter 6: Welcome Home! 79

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
80
 Use caution: Instruct the child that a Boston’s eyes, nose, and
mouth are off-limit areas that are prone to injury. Teach him to
handle the puppy with extreme care, never poking at her,
pulling her ears or tail, or pinching her.
Training the teens
You can use the techniques in the “Advising preadolescents” section
with adolescents and teenagers, too, modifying them depending on
child’s maturity level. A responsible preteen may be able to handle
holding the puppy and brushing her, whereas an active youth may
need to tone down his excitement before hanging out with the
Boston. You know your child’s limitations, so use common sense
when allowing them to interact.
Introducing felines, canines, 
or small pets
Easygoing, affectionate, and highly adaptable, your pup will, after
some supervised introductions and training, get along well with
other pets in your home. Her size isn’t so large that cats will be
overly intimidated, yet she still commands a presence that the
other animals will respect.
Your pup and the other animals’ temperaments will determine
whether they’ll become best friends or roommates who tolerate
each other. Though she’s not a true terrier, your Boston does
retain her terrier roots, and she may feel the urge to chase or play
tag with your cat, other dog, or small animal. Similarly, some pets
can be aloof and territorial toward new beasts.
Introducing the animals is another part of setting boundaries for
your Boston and teaching her the household rules. If your dog
knows that it’s against the rules to chase the cat, for example,
she’ll be less inclined to do so, especially if she knows that there
are consequences to her actions.
You can make the introductions easier by organizing structured
and controlled visits to let the animals sniff each other and get
used to each other. After the animals are comfortable with each
other, you can let them have supervised visits.
Structured sniffs
Being driven by their noses, animals like to meet each other by
sniffing their unique scents. Before your dog even meets the other
animals in the household, she’ll smell them on your clothes, and
she’ll know that she’ll be among other pack members.

Introducing your pets face to face can be very easy or very difficult.
It all depends on the personalities and temperaments of the animals.
To play it safe, kennel the puppy and bring her to the other pet. Let
them look at each other and sniff each other. Watch their body lan-
guage. Is the cat hissing or curious? Is the dog growling or wagging
her tail? If the pup or other animal shows no interest in the other,
don’t force them together; they’ll interact when they’re ready.
If they seem to get along well, let the animal out of the kennel and
see what both pets do, being very watchful in case a fight breaks
out. The two will sniff each other some more, check each other
out, and nudge each other with their noses. If you’re lucky, they’ll
start playing and become fast friends!
When you bring two dogs together, the current dog may see your
puppy as a threat to his place in the pack, depending on his tem-
perament and personality. Introduce them in a neutral environment,
like a park or someplace other than your house (the current dog’s
“turf”). Watch their behavior, and if the current dog begins to 
display dominant or aggressive behavior, separate them and try
again later. They’ll eventually learn to live with each other.
Don’t worry if your pets don’t get along like loving siblings the first
time they meet. Becoming buddies takes time. Make the introduc-
tion ritual part of your daily routine, and remember to give both
animals all the positive reinforcement you can by praising them
while they bond. You’re sure to see results.
When you’re introducing your Boston to your cat (who will likely
be a little aloof and possibly defensive), be especially cautious of
the cat’s claws and your pup’s eyes. If a fight breaks out, your cat
can scratch your Boston’s delicate eyes, which will require an
emergency call to your veterinarian.
Supervised playtime, protected alone time
After your pets begin to get along, let them play together — always
supervised, of course! Sit back and watch them as they romp on
the floor, play with toys, or just snuggle for a nap. After the animals
recognize that their new roommate isn’t a threat, they’ll share the
same space, becoming part of the pack.
Just because they get along, however, doesn’t mean you can leave
them alone together while you’re gone. It will take a while for them
to grow accustomed to each other, so plan to put them in separate
rooms or leave your puppy in her crate if you run to the market.
If you must leave them alone together, make sure that the cat has
easy access to a high counter, or your pup has access to her
kennel. If you have another dog, let him do as he normally does,
but secure the puppy in her crate until you return.

82
Birds and bunnies and bearded dragons, oh my!
Other pets, including birds, small animals, and reptiles, can coexist
with your Boston, too. Introduce them in the same way you would
cats and other dogs: First, let them smell each other through your
Boston’s crate or the other critter’s cage, and then let them meet
face to face while you carefully hold the critter or bird.
Unlike cats, small animals or reptiles should not, under most cir-
cumstances, be allowed to play with your Boston. No matter how
well-behaved your Boston is, a free-roaming rodent looks too much
like a tempting treat or toy. Some reptiles can pass salmonella
(a bacterium that causes diarrhea) to your dog if she licks him or
ingests his feces. Birds, however, if they’re caged, or allowed to fly
in the home and perch on a play gym, will do just fine with your
Boston, as long as they have a safe spot out of your dog’s reach!
Sectioning off areas of your home
If all else fails and your pets just don’t get along, you may need to
section off areas of your home to keep the household peace. Some
Siamese just don’t want the Boston around. Some Bostons can be
too playful for a 9-year-old Persian. Sometimes, it just doesn’t work
out. So what do you do?
Most homes can be divided to allow the cat to have his space and
the dog to have her space. The easiest way to do this is by putting
up a baby gate between the two areas. The cat can explore the dog’s
space and still escape in case of a squabble. It may inconvenience
you and your family, but if means keeping the peace, it’s worth it!
Surviving the First Night
After a day filled with exploring her new home and meeting her new
family, your pup will be pooped. You’ll be ready for a long night’s
sleep, too, after picking up your new puppy, introducing her to her
new home, and getting used to this new arrival. But the truth is that
the first night with your Boston will be a long one for both of you.
Instead of cuddling with her mama and littermates like she’s
done her entire life, your pup will be bunking in a new bed.
She’ll be confined to an unfamiliar crate, and surrounded by
strange smells and sounds. She’ll be scared, and rightfully so! 
As a brand-new puppy parent, you can expect to be up all night
tending to her needs.
Here’s what you can expect the first night:

 Lots of potty breaks. Your Boston has not yet learned to con-
trol her bladder or bowels, so you’ll take her to the bathroom
area at least every two hours. After she eats her final meal of
the day, take her outside to use the bathroom. If she doesn’t go
right away, take her back inside and try again in 30 minutes or
so. Put her to bed after she eliminates, and then set your alarm
(mental or manual) for two hours. When you take her outside
throughout the night, don’t make a big deal of it and don’t
get the pup excited. Let her know that you mean business —
and that she should do her business!
 Lots of cleanup. Even though you’ll take your pup to the bath-
room every couple of hours, she may accidentally soil her
kennel. Line her crate with absorbent pads to soak up any
messes that may happen, and arm yourself with a pet-safe
cleanser and several rolls of paper towels.
 Lots of whimpering. Your pup will be lonely. All her life, she’s
been surrounded by sights and smells she knows, like her 
littermates and her mama. Now, she’s confined to a strange
kennel with no one around, so of course she’s going to whim-
per! As difficult as it will be, do not take her out of the kennel
to comfort her. If you do, you teach her that she gets her way
when she cries — and that’s a hard habit to break!
 Lots of comforting. Though you should not take the pup out of
her kennel throughout the night (except for bathroom breaks),
you can comfort her by speaking softly to her, consoling her
when she cries. This works particularly well if you kennel
your pup in your bedroom. If you kennel her in the living
room or other area of the house, however, plan to get up to
comfort her when she cries.
By the time the sun rises the next day, you’ll be exhausted, but you
will have survived the first night. This will become a regular rou-
tine for several months until your Boston becomes housetrained
and trustworthy. Don’t worry: It will get easier, especially as your
pup grows accustomed to the routine.
Creating Consistency
Dogs like consistency. From puppyhood to adulthood, dogs like to
follow a regular routine of sleeping, hunting, eating, and playing.
This need for routine reaches back to dogs’ wild days when their
pack leader dictated their schedule of resting, scavenging or hunt-
ing, eating, and socializing with other dogs in their pack.
Chapter 6: Welcome Home! 83

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
84
Modern-day dogs are no different. They prefer a regular schedule
of sleeping, eating, and playing — and sleeping and playing some
more! They don’t need to do it for survival as their ancestors did,
but they still have an innate need for consistency.
Dogs also want to know the rules. They look to the leader for direc-
tion on what to do next. When a pack member falls out of line, the
leader puts her back in her place. This sets up a consistent pattern
of what the leader and other pack members expect.
In your Boston’s life, you are the pack leader, and providing your
Boston with regular schedules and rules sets her up for success.
Instead of letting her do whatever she wants and run the house-
hold, you should establish her routine as soon as she comes home.
It’s all about shaping her behavior so she integrates with her
new pack.
Establishing a schedule
As soon as you carry your puppy across your threshold, you will
set up schedules for her. You will feed her three to four times a day
at regular intervals. You will take her to her bathroom area after
mealtime, playtime, naptime, and every couple of hours in between.
You will also put her to bed at the same time every night. By doing
these things, you create consistency for your Boston, and help her
develop habits that will last her lifetime.
These schedules also help you as you train your Boston. They set
her up to successfully integrate into your household. Housetraining
her, for example, will be much easier if your dog is eating at the
same time every day because you can expect her to use the bath-
room at regular times after she eats.
To help your puppy plan her day, feed her at regular times each
day, take her to her bathroom area on schedule, put her to bed at
the same time each night, and give her plenty of exercise to help
her burn off extra energy.
Regular meals
Your Boston puppy requires at least three to four meals a day. (See
Chapter 7 for details about what to feed your pup.) You need to
feed your puppy right when she wakes up in the morning, late
morning, early afternoon, and dinnertime — about every three to
four hours or so. Whatever times you decide, stick to them.
Adolescent and adult dogs require two meals a day. Feed her in
the morning and in the early evening, at the same times every day.

By doing so, before long you’ll be able to predict when your Boston
needs to take a trip to her bathroom area!
Regular bathroom breaks
Regular trips to the bathroom area are essential in housetraining
your dog. (Skip to Chapter 9 for tips on housetraining.) Your Boston
puppy, while she’s learning to control her bladder, won’t know to
ask to go outside to use the bathroom. It will take her several
months before she learns to hold it until she goes outside.
To help train the puppy, take her on regular bathroom breaks
throughout the day, including when she wakes up in the morning,
after a nap, after she eats, after she plays, and every couple of
hours in between, depending on her age and maturity level.
When your Boston gets older and learns bladder control, you still
want to take her to the bathroom area or let her out to the yard on
a regular basis. Only when your dog knows how to tell you she
needs to go can you let her dictate when to go to the bathroom.
Regular bedtime
Regular bedtime also teaches your dog routine. Your pup’s growing
body requires lots of sleep at night, despite all the naps she takes
during the day! To teach her to crash at the same time every night,
put her to bed at the same time. Say, “Time for bed,” in a positive,
soothing voice, put her in her crate, and turn off the lights. Before
long, she’ll know when it’s time for bed and head to her crate.
An older Boston will fall right into the habit, especially if she’s had
a routine since birth. She may pace and wander occasionally,
trying to get settled, but when you tell her it’s time for bed, she’ll
fall fast asleep in no time.
Regular exercise
Puppies need exercise to burn off excess energy and stretch their
growing muscles. Your Boston puppy will want to play with her
toys and roll around as you tickle her belly. She’ll look forward to
the time spent with you.
Your adult Boston also needs exercise to burn off steam. In an
enclosed yard, she’ll run around and patrol the territory, hunt for
imaginary intruders, and chase them away. She’ll enjoy long walks
with you, too, through your neighborhood, to the park, or on a trail
through the forest.
Get out and move with your Boston at least once a day. The activ-
ity not only helps her sleep at night, but it also helps her focus and
be a well-behaved member of your family.
Chapter 6: Welcome Home! 85

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
86
Setting up house rules
As pack leader, you dictate what rules your Boston should follow.
You tell her where she’s allowed and where she’s not. You tell her
where she sleeps, eats, and plays. Begin teaching your Boston
these rules immediately because it is much easier to teach her the
right way first instead of having to break bad habits later on.
It isn’t just the pup who has to learn the ropes. The other pack
members — the humans — have rules to follow, too. To raise a
happy, healthy Boston, each family member needs to tend to
puppy-related chores, and use consistent training and teaching
methods.
Here are some points to ponder when establishing rules for every-
one in the home.
For the dog . . .
Dogs are creatures of habit. After your Boston figures out the rou-
tine, she’ll do the same thing all the time. When you set up house-
hold rules and enforce them (with love and positive reinforcement,
of course!), your Boston will fall into line.
As you and your family discuss how your Boston will be treated
and cared for, consider the following questions:
 How do you want your Boston to behave? Begin training
your puppy to act the way you want your adult Boston to act.
Though those cute puppy behaviors may be endearing at first,
they can be the beginning of bad habits. Discuss with your
family how they think an ideal Boston should behave, and
work together toward those goals.
 What area will your pup use for housetraining? Select an
outdoor bathroom area and use it consistently with your
Boston. Choose an area that’s easy to access, that doesn’t get
muddy when it rains, and that’s easy to clean. Also decide
whether you will use an indoor bathroom area, such as a dog
litter box, if you live in an apartment or townhouse. (See
Chapter 9 for more hints on housetraining.)
 Which rooms will your Boston have access to? You want to
limit your Boston’s environment to one or two rooms where
the family spends the majority of their time. These rooms
shouldn’t have expensive rugs or heirloom furniture, and they
may need to be blocked off with baby gates. If you can’t watch
the puppy, she needs to be confined to her crate or X-pen.
When your Boston is an adult, she can have access to the rest
of the house.

 Where will your Boston sleep? If your answer is “In bed with
me,” you may want to rethink your strategy. Your puppy can fall
off the bed during the night and injure her leg or back, or you
may inadvertently roll over and crush her. Instead, let her sleep
in a crate in your bedroom so she feels close to you. You’ll be
able to hear her if she cries in the middle of the night. Another
behavior issue to consider is if you and your Boston share a
sleeping area, she will think that you and she are equals —
and you essentially relinquish your post as pack leader.
 Will your pup be allowed on the furniture? That’s up to you
and your family. Because your Boston won’t exceed 25 pounds
or so, she’ll fit quite nicely on the chair next to you or on your
lap while you enjoy some television or a good book. At the
same time, if you allow her access to the couch during her
first days at home, it will be very hard — and confusing for
her — to restrict it later on.
 Where will you feed your Boston? Are you okay with feeding
your dog in the kitchen? That’s the most logical place to set
up your dog’s food and water station. She’ll quickly learn
where her next meal will be served. Keep the water bowl in an
area where you can see when it gets low. You should empty,
clean, and refill her water bowl at least once a day.
 Will you give your Boston table scraps? Besides encouraging
a lifelong habit of begging, feeding your dog table scraps can
cause her to forgo her dog food for people food, or she could
eat both and put on unwanted pounds. People food can also
increase the likelihood of bladder stones, diabetes, and pan-
creatitis. Instead, offer her treats like cheese, cooked chicken
or beef, or crunchy vegetables (in small amounts) in her food
bowl on special occasions. Your Boston will appreciate them a
lot more than food thrown from the table on a daily basis!
 What training method should you use? Many training methods
exist, so do your homework and choose a humane approach
that includes positive reinforcement. Make sure that your
entire family — and friends — follows the same training regime.
 Where will your Boston stay while you’re away? If you’re
running out to the market for a few hours, your puppy will be
content in her crate. But if you’re going to be gone longer, con-
sider a dog daycare (if your pup is old enough), or restrict her
to her X-pen lined with newspaper.
Come up with rules for your Boston before you bring her home,
and begin enforcing the rules right away, being as consistent as
possible. She is an intelligent dog and will pick up on these rules
quickly, but practice patience and diligence in your training. It’ll be
worth it!
Chapter 6: Welcome Home! 87

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
88
For the rest of the pack . . .
You need to set up household rules for the other members of your
family, including the children, adults, and other pets. Consistency
is key to raising a well-trained pup, so all the parties involved have
to follow the same routines and use the same training commands
to ensure that your pup doesn’t get conflicting messages.
The rest of the family will also have some new chores, too, with
regard to routine care of the puppy. Unless you’re a one-person
household, or one (responsible) person chooses to be responsible
for everything, give everyone who is old enough or capable
enough a chore to do to help raise your Boston puppy. Some jobs
aren’t as glamorous as others, but they’re all necessary to raise a
happy, healthy dog. To keep it fun, consider rotating job duties or
encourage various family members to become experts at their spe-
cific chore. (Flip back to Chapter 3 for a refresher of what duties
you can delegate.)
Small children should be supervised by an adult while doing their
puppy-care chores. And you should check on older children to
make sure they’re doing their dog duties. A responsible overseeing
adult can make sure that everything gets done and can be on the
lookout for health problems that may arise.
From the pack to the family
By nature, dogs are highly social. This behavior reflects back on their ancestors —
wolves — who lived in closely knit packs with a social structure built around a dom-
inance hierarchy.
When dogs became part of human families, they viewed people as part of their pack
structure and interacted with us using the same behavioral patterns they would for
canine members of their pack.
Dogs happily accept a subordinate role to people who assume a dominant position
toward them. The degree to which they do depends on the breed, gender, and indi-
vidual differences. Females, for example, more readily accept dominance from
humans than males.
Modern-day dogs love socialization, and they’ll do almost anything for praise and
affection — especially for a dominant member of their family! When you assert your
role as pack leader early, you’ll raise a healthy and well-integrated canine member
of your family.

 Deciphering pet food labels
 Deciding what kind of diet to feed your Boston
 Knowing how much and how often to feed your Boston
 Rewarding — and spoiling — with treats
Your Boston’s diet gives him the gusto he needs to get through
the day. These bully dogs with their hearty appetites require a
healthy diet that gives them the right amount of protein, carbohy-
drates, fats, vitamins, and minerals per serving. With so many
dining choices available from your local pet store, how do you
choose?
This chapter explores generic and premium brands that vary in
price and size, as well as dry kibble formulas and canned concoc-
tions in hearty rich gravy. You can even make your Boston’s diet
from scratch, if you really want to. Besides helping you figure out
what diet is right for your Boston, this chapter can help you estab-
lish an eating schedule based on his age. A proper diet will help
your Boston grow to his full potential.
Feeding a Carnivore: 
Cost versus Quality
Before they became the domesticated pets that we know today,
dogs scavenged and preyed on small animals. They also foraged
for food, eating berries, grains, and other plant matter when neces-
sary. This diet gave them the protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins,
and minerals they needed for a complete, healthy diet.

As a house pet, your Boston still requires these basic nutrients.
Depending on his age, each dog has different requirements. Young
pups need a diet formulated for growth; adults need a diet formu-
lated for maintenance.
Price varies dramatically between brands of dog food. Though all
dog food manufacturers must follow basic guidelines, the more
expensive, or premium, varieties often exceed those specifications
and, therefore, cost more. The ingredients are higher grade, come
from whole-food sources, and contain fewer fillers.
The premium brands frequently contain added nutrients, too, such
as antioxidants and vitamin supplements, which benefit senior
dogs, overweight dogs, or specific breeds like your Boston.
Generally speaking, you get what you pay for when it comes to dog
food — but don’t presume expensive is better. Your veterinarian
can help you choose a diet that’s right for your Boston.
Knowing Your Ingredients
Dogs require certain amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fat, vita-
mins, and minerals to support their normal bodily functions. This
section takes a closer look at each type of required food source
and how it keeps your Boston healthy and happy.
Pump up the protein
Your Boston uses protein for growing and developing hair and skin,
producing hormones, building muscle mass, regulating metabo-
lism, and healing damaged tissue.
In many premium brands of dog food, protein is the first ingredient
listed. Beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, or duck are the proteins most
often used. Other sources include fish, fish meal, liver, eggs, milk,
and milk products.
Some grains and beans, such as rice, wheat, corn, barley, and soy,
also contain protein. They’re not complete sources of protein like
animal protein, but when combined with other types of food, they
can provide many of the amino acids dogs require.
Boston puppies thrive on foods that contain about 28 percent 
protein; adult Bostons typically maintain on foods that contain
22 percent protein.
Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
90

When you choose a diet for your Boston, don’t pick one based on
the formula’s protein percentage alone; the protein source matters,
too. In general, the lower-priced foods use a lesser-grade protein
that’s harder for your dog to digest.
Energize with carbohydrates
Carbohydrates, which are sugars and starches found in plant
foods, provide the quick energy Bostons need to exercise and play.
Making up about 50 percent of your dog’s diet, carbohydrates also
provide fiber, which is essential for proper bowel function. Common
sources of fiber are rice, grains, peas, pasta, and even potatoes.
Carbohydrates, however, are also used as fillers. They’re cheaper
than protein, so manufacturers use corn and rice to bulk up the
foods sold at a lower price. Premium foods often contain high-quality
complex carbohydrates to give the dog fiber and sustained energy.
Too many cereal grains can result in a hyped-up Boston. If your
dog is bouncing off the walls, take a look at how many and what
types of carbohydrates are in his diet, and limit them, if possible.
The fillers also cause your dog to eliminate more often, which
means more trips to the bathroom.
Fats for energy and a shiny coat
Fats and oils do more than make foods taste good. They provide
energy and help your Boston feel satisfied. Fats are needed to
break down certain vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, K, and E.
Unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic and linoleic acids, also sup-
port skin and coat health. They make your Boston’s short coat
shimmer and shine.
Boston diets may contain anywhere from 8 percent to 18 percent
fat, depending on the manufacturer. If your Boston’s coat is looking
dull, consider a food that has a higher percentage of unsaturated
fats. If he’s looking a little overweight, switch to a low-fat diet after
talking with your veterinarian.
Take your vitamins, mind 
your minerals
In addition to proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, Bostons require
vitamins, which help the body fight disease, absorb minerals, regu-
late metabolism, and grow and function normally. Plant and animal
foods naturally contain vitamins.
Chapter 7: Eating Well 91

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
92
The body maintains and stores fat-soluble vitamins in the body’s
liver and fatty tissues, and water-soluble vitamins, such as vita-
mins B and C, are flushed out daily and must be replaced. The right
balance of vitamins is crucial to your Boston’s health.
Minerals, such as calcium, iron, phosphorous, and nitrate, are ele-
ments and inorganic compounds the body needs for proper growth
and function. Dogs require seven major minerals and 15 trace min-
erals, including copper and potassium. Minerals help maintain the
salt levels in the bloodstream, and build bones and teeth. Like vita-
mins, minerals must be balanced for good health.
Most commercial and premium diets already contain all the vitamins
and minerals that your dog needs. Your veterinarian may recom-
mend some supplements for specific needs, such as glucosamine
for a senior dog suffering from arthritis, or vitamins for a dog who’s
eating a homemade diet. (Check the “Supplementing Your Dog’s
Diet” section below for more reasons to add extras to your pup’s
meals.) Always follow your veterinarian’s advice and consult her
before adding supplements.
How to Read Pet Food Labels
No doubt you read the labels on foods you eat. The labels contain
basic information about the item, including its calories, nutrient
content, and ingredients. Dog food labels are no different.
Pet foods are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration’s
Center for Veterinary Medicine and must contain certain informa-
tion on their labels. Following is a breakdown of that info:
 Feeding instructions: The feeding instructions give guidelines
for how much to feed your Boston based on his weight. If the
diet is formulated for puppies, it will give feeding instructions
based on age, too. Sometimes it will include information about
when and how often you should feed your dog.
 Guaranteed analysis: The guaranteed analysis breaks down
by percentage what nutrients are in the food. It lists minimum
levels of crude protein and crude fat, and maximum levels of
crude fiber and moisture. It also includes percentages or
measurements of additives, vitamins, and minerals.
 Ingredients: The ingredients are listed in descending order by
amount. Often, a form of protein appears first in line, followed
by grains, fats, additives, and preservatives.

 Nutritional adequacy statement: The nutritional adequacy
statement says whether the food provides complete balanced
nutrition for a dog based on nutritional levels established
by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO).
The statement also provides a life-stage claim, which states the
life stage (growth/lactation, maintenance, or all life stages) for
which the food is intended.
AAFCO has developed two nutrient profiles for dogs: growth/
lactation and maintenance. All foods must meet at least one
of these profiles. Some labels claim the food is intended for
all life stages. Those foods provide enough nutrients for an
animal’s growth and reproduction, as well as for maintaining a
healthy adult.
 Manufacturer’s contact information: A name and address of
the manufacturer, packer, or distributor are required; some-
times manufacturers include a toll-free phone number or Web
site address, but these aren’t mandatory.
Armed with this information and the nutrient recommendations
from the previous section, you can now examine your Boston’s
food label with confidence. Call the manufacturer or talk to your
vet if you have questions.
Checking Out Your Commercial
Diet Options
After you understand the importance of the ingredients in your
Boston’s food (see the “Knowing Your Ingredients” section), you
can evaluate the different meal options available at the market.
Three commercial types are sold at most grocery and pet stores:
 Dry food
 Semi-moist food
 Canned food
No matter the form, each morsel of food for Bostons should be
packed with nutrients. Because they have smaller mouths and
stomachs, Bostons require smaller pieces of food than larger dogs.
Those smaller pieces must contain all the nutrients and calories
they need to keep them going. Dog food companies know this, so
when they develop diets for smaller dogs, they put as much nutri-
tion as possible in each bite.
Chapter 7: Eating Well 93

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
94
Crunchy kibble
It may not look too appetizing to humans, but kibble (or dry food)
is delicious to dogs. The kibble’s shape, size, texture, smell, and
taste have been researched and tested by scientists and veterinary
nutritionists. These folks develop recipes, conduct feeding trials,
and check for complete nutrition to ensure each kibble meets the
FDA’s standards.
Bostons digest dry food easily. Made by cooking the ingredients
together in big batches, forming it into kibble-size bites, and baking
it, dry food is often the least expensive food on the shelf. Because
it is baked, dry food can be left out in your Boston’s bowl all day
without spoiling. And the kibble’s crunch helps keep your dog’s
teeth tartar-free.
You can add variety to your Boston’s dry food diet by feeding semi-
moist or canned food periodically, or offering a mix of wet and dry
food at mealtime.
Going natural: Is it really better?
In addition to the common commercial brands of foods, most pet specialty stores
also carry dry and canned or jarred foods in “organic” or “natural” varieties, or
those that may be “fit for human consumption.” What does this mean?
The organic and natural trend has moved into the pet market. Popular with human
foods, organically grown meats, produce, and grains are grown without the use of
pesticides, chemicals, or other such means. Many dog owners believe that feeding
their pets a diet free from those additives will benefit and extend their pet’s lives.
As in the human market, organic pet foods need to meet certain criteria to prove
that the ingredients are grown organically before they can bear the label.
Food intended for human consumption meets different standards than food intended
for animal consumption. More and more, pet owners want to know that the quality
of their pet’s food is just as good as their own. They like the fact that they could sit
down and eat the same food their pet eats. Some pet owners go the extra step and
make their own food for their dogs. But these human-quality foods are an easy alter-
native to homemade.
Organic or human-grade foods are generally more expensive. They cost more to
make, and they’re often made by smaller companies that don’t produce the same
quantities as larger manufacturers.
Whether they’re formulating an organic diet or a grocery store brand, manufacturers
are required to follow strict guidelines for making quality pet food. Rest assured that
the majority of over-the-counter diets will meet your pet’s basic dietary requirements.

For Bostons who have dental problems, are recovering from sur-
gery, or are just finicky, however, dry food poses a challenge.
They can’t bite into or digest the hard pieces of food, or the dried
morsels aren’t appealing enough for a picky dog’s discriminating
taste. These dogs may require semi-moist or canned food instead.
Semi-moist morsels
Semi-moist foods are soft to the bite with a texture resembling Play-
Doh. They come in all shapes and sizes, from kibble-size morsels
and patties to whimsical shapes that look more like treats than food.
They often come in resealable bags to keep the moisture locked in.
Like the dry foods, semi-moist foods are formulated to serve the
nutritional needs of the dog. The benefit of semi-moist compared
to kibble is the water content, which makes it easier for elderly
dogs or those with dental problems to chew. The food also smells
more appetizing to finicky dogs.
To give the semi-moist food its look and texture, however, manu-
facturers often add chemicals, artificial sweeteners, and colors.
Be sure to read the label and check the food’s nutritional content
before feeding. A high amount of corn syrup or artificial sweetener
can be harmful to your Boston’s metabolism, causing him to gain
weight. Semi-moist food can also lead to tartar buildup on teeth.
Stew in a can
Big chunks of meat in hearty rich gravy look good not only to dogs,
but to their owners, too, who may want to give their pets something
that resembles “real” food. Available in myriad flavors, combinations,
and recipes, canned foods combine the protein, carbohydrates,
fats, and water in a way that caters to many dogs’ taste buds.
It may not smell good to humans, but many dogs like it.
Canned food is up to 70 percent water by weight, which supplies
the Boston with much-needed water. Its taste attracts finicky
eaters, it’s easier to bite and chew than kibble, and it comes in
small quantities for small diets. Canned food has a long shelf life
and works well for dogs traveling to shows or obedience trials.
Despite its benefits, canned food generally costs more. You can’t
leave it out like dry food because it can spoil, and you have to
refrigerate leftovers. Some Boston owners worry about what
animal parts are used in the canned food, not to mention the addi-
tives and preservatives. Also, it can cause diarrhea in some dogs
and cause tartar to build up on their teeth.

Choosing To Feed a
Noncommercial Diet
Although commercial diets contain everything the dog needs to
thrive, some people prefer to prepare their dogs’ meals them-
selves. Raw diets and homemade diets allow Boston owners to
have more control over what they feed their pets.
 Raw diets: You can think of these meals as dog-style sushi.
Raw diets consist of raw meat and bones that you feed to your
dog. Proponents and opponents each have their varying opin-
ions on this type of diet. Some believe the diet improves their
pets’ skin, coat, and teeth, and increases their stamina and
vitality. Others caution against E. coli, parasites, and other
risks associated with raw meats. These diets are often supple-
mented by some source of fiber and vitamins.
Some manufacturers have begun selling raw diets at pet
stores. Often found in a freezer, these diets are individually
packaged to make feeding simple.
 Homemade diets: Homemade diets are meals made from
scratch, just like Mom used to make. Often fed to finicky dogs
or those with food allergies, these diets incorporate whole
foods, such as potatoes or rice, and protein sources, such as
cooked chicken or beef, that aren’t packed full of preservatives.
Bostons don’t eat a lot, so preparing homemade meals can be
relatively simple as long as you include all the nutrients that
your Boston needs.
Your Boston will tolerate diet changes, but to protect your dog’s
health, consult a veterinarian before introducing him to raw or
homemade meals.
Before feeding your Boston a raw or homemade diet, consider
these factors:
 Do you have the time to prepare the diet? Preparing a home-
made or raw diet is just like cooking for another member of
the family. The food should be prepared every few days to
ensure freshness.
 Do you have the space to store the raw meat or meals?
Because these foods don’t have preservatives, they need to
be stored in the refrigerator or the freezer.
 Do you travel a lot? If so, a diet like this may not be appropri-
ate. Dog sitters or boarding centers may not be able to make

dinner for your dog every night. And if the dog travels with
you, you may not have access to the foods or a kitchen.
 Do you have access to organic meats, or is there a reliable
butcher near you? If not, a homemade diet may require that
you cut your own meat or search out organic meat sources.
 Do you know enough about dog nutrition to ensure your
Boston is getting all the vitamins and minerals he requires?
You can research and learn about dog nutrition, or you can
meet with a veterinary nutritionist to outline meals and sup-
plements for your Boston.
If you’re going to feed your Boston a raw or homemade diet, first
and foremost, visit a veterinarian. You can consult a board-certified
veterinary nutritionist to help you develop a diet for your Boston.
You may even want to talk to a conventional veterinarian and a
holistic vet to hear their opinions.
Special Diets for Bostons 
with Health Issues
Prescription diets are specially formulated meals sold through
your veterinarian. Using different combinations of nutrients, these
diets are designed to address specific health needs, such as bladder
stones, diabetes, obesity, renal disease, or food allergies. The foods
come in dry and canned forms, similar to commercial diets.
Your veterinarian will prescribe a special diet if she believes your
dog requires it. Before you start feeding your Boston the prescrip-
tion diet, ask your vet these questions:
 Why do I need to feed my Boston this diet? Your vet will
explain why this particular diet will benefit your pup’s health,
as well as any other lifestyle changes that you need to make.
 How often and how much do I feed? Feeding instructions
will be listed on the label, but your vet may alter the recom-
mendations depending on your pup’s diagnosis. Follow her
instructions for maximum benefit.
 Will I need to feed this diet to my dog indefinitely? The
answer will depend on the dog’s condition. If your Boston is
obese, for example, you may only have to feed him a “diet”
food until he reaches his goal weight. If he’s diabetic, however,
he may be on the special formula for life.
Chapter 7: Eating Well 97

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
98
Prescription diets cost more than commercial diets, but the health
benefits far outweigh the additional money you’ll spend. Because
these formulas are packed with nutrition, it’s likely that you’ll feed
your Boston less quantity while providing more nutrients. Plus,
you’ll have the peace of mind knowing that you’re offering your
pup the very best.
Come and Get It! Serving Meals
Boston puppies and adults have different feeding requirements.
Puppies eat foods formulated for growth, which means the foods
contain more digestible nutrients, like protein and carbohydrates,
to help them build strong muscles and bones. Adults eat foods for-
mulated for maintenance, which means the foods contain the right
amount of nutrients to maintain their current size and weight.
Puppies and adults also have different eating habits. Puppies eat
up to four meals a day, whereas adults require two.
In the next sections, I outline a feeding schedule and portions for
Boston puppies and adults.
Setting up a meal schedule
Young puppies need to eat up to four meals throughout the day
to stimulate growth, keep their metabolisms fueled, and prevent
hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Some experts recommend free
feeding puppies, which means leaving dry food out all day and
allowing the pup to eat whenever he feels like it. The free feeding is
then supplemented by regularly scheduled mealtimes:
 Puppies up to 12 weeks old: Feed four times a day in addition
to providing dry food.
 From week 13 to week 24: Feed the pup three times a day.
 From six months on: Feed your Boston twice a day.
As the pup’s body figures out how to use the nutrients in his meals
appropriately, you should stop free feeding and stick with the
twice-a-day routine. If the food is out all day, the adult Boston will
eat it, and if he’s not getting enough exercise, the sturdy dog will
quickly pack on the pounds.
Dishing out the right amount
The amount of food you feed your Boston depends on the individ-
ual dog’s growth stage, activity level, and external factors, like 

temperature or stress. At first, offer your puppy small amounts of
food formulated for growth, but gradually increase how much food
you give him as he grows (as you’ll see below). When he becomes
an adult and you switch his diet to food formulated for maintenance,
feed him the same amount each mealtime. Active dogs or those
enduring stress, like moving or welcoming a new addition to the
household, may require more food, depending on the circumstance.
Refer to the feeding instructions printed on the label or consult
your vet for advice. Adjust the amounts by how the dog looks.
If your Boston has a bulging belly, decrease the portion a bit.
Generally, feed the following amounts at each mealtime:
 Puppies up to 12 weeks old (feeding a diet formulated for
growth): 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 cup, four times a day
 From week 13 to week 24 (feeding a diet formulated for
growth): 1⁄2 to 2⁄3 cup, three times a day
 From six months to one year (feeding a diet formulated for
growth): 3⁄4 to 1 1⁄4 cup, two times per day
 Adulthood (feeding a diet formulated for maintenance): 
1⁄3 to 1⁄2 cup, two times per day
If you decide to free-feed your puppy, remember to keep the bowl
of kibble filled all day. Gradually decrease the amount as he ages.
Preventing obesity
More pets than ever are obese, and Bostons are no exception. A
high-calorie intake and a sedentary lifestyle result in an overweight
pup. Adult Bostons who eat too much at mealtime, free feed, or
enjoy too many treats end up consuming too many calories, and
weight gain ensues. And if exercise isn’t a part of their daily
lifestyle, those extra calories never have a chance to be burned off.
If your pet is packing on the pounds, you have two choices:
 Decrease the amount of food you’re feeding your pet. This
means cutting back the size of his regular meals and the
number of treats you give him. This lowers the amount of
calories he is consuming without changing his diet.
 Change the diet to a “light” formula. Some people feel that
this may not be as healthy as simply feeding less. But just as
there are formulas for senior dogs, there are formulas for
overweight dogs. As always, talk to your veterinarian before
changing your Boston’s diet.

Supplementing Your Dog’s Diet
You take your daily vitamins, but does your dog need them, too?
Supplements add nutrition to your Boston Terrier’s diet. They pro-
vide vitamins and minerals that are missing from his daily food
intake. If your Boston is eating a well-balanced commercial diet, he
probably doesn’t need supplements.
Pregnant or lactating bitches, however, require supplements to
provide adequate nutrition. Senior Bostons, too, can benefit from
formulas, such as chondroitin and glucosamine, that address joint
function. And if you’re making your dog’s food from scratch, you’ll
certainly need to supplement his diet with added vitamins and
minerals found in herbs, eggs, and Brewer’s yeast.
If you feed your dog supplements, do so under the watchful eye of
your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist, and never exceed the
recommended dosage or substitute supplements for a well-balanced
diet. Oversupplementing your Boston can make him sick.
Treating Your Boston
Treats come in all sorts of sizes and flavors, from fresh-baked bis-
cuits and human treat-inspired cookies to freeze-dried lamb and
beef jerky. You can find the treats in pet stores and trendy dog bak-
eries throughout the country, or you can give your Boston safe
human foods, such as hot dog pieces, chunks of cheese, or a slice
of raw beef.
You can feed your Boston treats to reward him for good behavior
or simply to spoil him from time to time.
Like regular meals, treats contain calories. They should be calcu-
lated into your pup’s overall intake for the day, accounting for about
10 percent of his calories. If possible, follow the recommended
feeding instructions on the treat package. If you feed your Boston
dog-safe human foods, like small pieces of luncheon meat or cheese,
factor those calories into your pup’s overall intake for the day, too.
As tempting as it may be, don’t feed your pooch too many goodies,
or you’ll wind up with an overweight Boston!

 Dressing your dog in duds designed especially for her
B
eing short-haired and single-coated, your Boston Terrier
doesn’t demand the labor-intensive grooming that some breeds
require. She will, however, require regular washing, brushing, and
nail trimming, in addition to ear cleaning and tooth brushing, to
keep her healthy and smelling fresh.
Keeping that coat — not to mention her nails, eyes, ears, and teeth —
looking its best takes routine maintenance. You can expect daily,
weekly, and semi-monthly grooming rituals to minimize shedding
and keep her coat glossy and clean. After figuring out what tools
you need and what to do with them, grooming time will be a pleas-
urable experience for you and your Boston, resulting in a strong
bond you both will enjoy.
Sometimes, you may require the skills of a professional groomer.
Choosing one who you’re comfortable with requires research,
visits, and recommendations from reliable sources. You can find
out more about how to select a groomer in this chapter.
You can also get tips on how to dress your dog in practical and
fashionable duds, including how to select appropriate clothing for
her and how to fit her. A Boston’s short coat also demands an extra
layer of protection and warmth during the chilly seasons.
Grooming at Home
Just as you bathe, comb your hair, and brush your teeth daily, your
Boston will require routine maintenance to keep her coat clean and
lustrous, her nails trimmed, and her breath fresh. Likewise, just as

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
102
you visit the salon or barber every couple of months, your Boston
Terrier will require visits to the groomer for deep cleans — and
even a little pampering! (The “Visiting the Groomer or Spa” section
later in this chapter has the details you need.) For regular upkeep,
though, you can easily groom your Boston at home with just a few
tools, a little instruction, and a couple of minutes each day.
These grooming rituals also give you the opportunity to handle
and inspect your Boston, checking for abnormalities, such as
bumps or cuts. You can also check the condition of your dog’s
paws, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth.
In this section, you find all the information you need to groom your
Boston at home. You discover how to set up a grooming area. You
can read about all the tools you need and find out how to clean
your pup’s ears, eyes, nose, and teeth. You also develop a routine
for the whole grooming process, scheduling times throughout the
day, week, and month to make your pup clean and cuddly.
Getting ready to groom
Many breeders prepare their pups for grooming when they’re still
very young. They hold them and coddle them, looking at their
mouths, their paws, and their eyes and ears. Most likely, by the
time your Boston met you, she was used to being handled. You can
continue the breeder’s or previous owner’s work by handling your
Boston every day. Your dog needs to feel comfortable with some-
one touching her body, inspecting her eyes and ears, tickling her
toes, and even rubbing her gums.
Before you begin actually grooming your Boston, however, you
need to set up a regular space, gather your tools, and acclimate
your Boston to the grooming ritual.
Choose a location
To begin your home-based, Boston beauty routine, you must first
choose a specific location. Dogs like regular rituals, so choosing
one place teaches your dog what to expect and how to behave
while you’re grooming her.
Some people place their Boston on a countertop when they clean
and brush their dog; others use a grooming table, which allows
them the flexibility to walk around it while leaving their dog in one
place. Whatever surface you choose, always put a nonslip pad on
the surface — and never leave your Boston unattended.
When you think about the best place for your grooming station,
consider an area near a sink or tub that has a hand-held sprayer.
You also want to have access to an electrical outlet.

Gather your tools
Every Boston household should stock the following:
 Shampoo and conditioner: There are many on the market,
but choose one formulated for a small dog with a short coat.
Avoid the shampoo-conditioner combos. They may cut bath
time in half, but the coat won’t be as clean.
You may also consider a shampoo that is designed for dogs
with a white coat. These products do wonders for enhancing
and whitening a dirty white dog!
 Slicker brush: These are rectangular brushes with fine pins
that are designed to reach to your Boston’s skin, massaging it
and pulling away dead hair and skin.
 Bristle brush: Resembling a human hair brush, these tools
whisk away debris and polish your Boston’s coat.
 Shedding blade: These tools have bent wire teeth set close
together that pull off dead hair.
 Soft towel: Because a Boston’s coat is short and smooth, a
quick wipe-down with a damp soft towel in between washes
will restore the coat’s shine and remove any residual dirt.
 Scissors: Small scissors are used for trimming the hair around
your Boston’s ears, the bottom of the feet, and the anus.
Select small-blade scissors that fit your hand comfortably.
 Nail clippers: The two basic types are the scissor cut and the
guillotine cut. Purchase whichever you prefer.
 Styptic powder: Styptic powder, which stops the flow of
blood, is good to have on hand for unexpected nail-trimming
accidents.
 Cotton balls: You’ll use these for cleaning out your Boston’s
ears and around her eyes.
 Ear-cleaning solution: You’ll use this harmless cleaning solu-
tion on a cotton ball to clean around your pup’s ears and
inside the folds.
 Blow-dryer: Though your Boston’s coat is short, you’ll blow-
dry her coat after bath time to prevent her from chilling.
Choose one that has low- and no-heat settings.
 Toothbrush and dog toothpaste: A child’s soft toothbrush
with some dog-specific toothpaste will keep your Boston’s
teeth tartar-free.
You can find all these items at your local pet supply store, online,
through mail order, or through your groomer.

104
Get her used to grooming
You’ll have an easier time grooming your Boston if she’s familiar
with the grooming area and tools you’ll be using. Here’s how to
introduce her to this new routine:
 Let your Boston get used to the countertop or grooming
table you’ll be using. Allow her to sniff and inspect it.
 Run your hands over her entire body. Gently give your dog a
massage, feeling every bone, muscle, and tendon. This action
not only prepares your dog for grooming rituals, but it also
helps you become more aware of how your dog normally
feels. If she develops a lump or injures herself, you’ll know
right away.
 Show your Boston the grooming tools. You don’t need to
use them on the dog just yet; have them out and let her inspect
these new items. Slowly introduce her to the pin brush, comb,
toothbrush, and blow-dryer, rewarding her for good behavior.
As you help your Boston get used to the idea of regular grooming,
encourage good behavior by rewarding her with toys and treats.
Soon, your Boston will jump for joy when you take her to her
grooming area and pull out the grooming toolkit!
Caring for healthy skin and coat
That short and tight Boston coat is beautiful, and to keep it looking
its best, expect to do some daily brushing and monthly washing.
The Boston is a single-coated breed, which means she has no under-
coat to keep her warm. Though she may get chilly during the cold
months (flip to the end of this chapter for details on finding the
right fit for doggy clothing), her single coat means less grooming
for you. You won’t need a de-matting tool, de-shedding comb, or
undercoat rake. You won’t have to tease out mats or knots. You’ll
only need a slicker brush, bristle brush, and a shedding blade to
keep her coat under control — and not all over your couch!
Oils from sebaceous glands under the skin naturally condition the
hair and skin. Too much washing can cause dry, flaky skin and
chapping, but daily brushing releases the oils, keeping the skin and
coat healthy. With regular brushing, you’ll only need to wash your
Boston’s coat once a month or so, unless she meets a skunk or
rolls in a mud puddle!
Daily brushing
When brushing your Boston, follow the same routine each time.
That way, she’ll know what to expect. You can follow these steps:

1. Place your Boston on her designated grooming spot.
Begin by using the bristle brush to smooth out the coat
and remove any dirt or debris.
Always brush in the same direction that the hair is growing,
brushing from the head toward the tail, and down her sides
and legs. And don’t forget her belly!
2. While you’re brushing her, feel her body for cuts,
scrapes, bumps, or irregularities.
This is also the time to check for external parasites, like
fleas or ticks. (See Chapter 14 for more on these critters.)
3. Use the shedding blade to pull off dead hair.
Gently rake across your Boston’s body, being careful not to
scrape her skin.
4. After you’ve released the majority of the dead hair, use
the slicker brush to gather any excess.
If the brush fills with fur, clean it out and keep going. Your
dog will shed heavily during certain times of year, but if she
sheds an excessive amount often, consult your veterinarian
for advice.
Don’t forget to carefully brush your Boston’s face. You can use the
tip of the bristle brush to get around her nose, mouth, and ears.
Use extreme caution around her prominent eyes.
Monthly bathing
Depending on her activity level, your Boston will require semi-
monthly or monthly baths. Any more than that will dry out her
skin and cause dandruff and brittle hair. Shampooing your dog’s
coat not only washes away dirt, but it also washes away the natu-
ral oils that keep her coat shiny and, believe it or not, clean. 
The natural oils form a barrier that repels dirt and odor.
When you bathe your Boston, use a shampoo and conditioner for-
mulated specifically for a dog. If the white in your pup’s coat starts
to loose its snowy sheen, clean it with a shampoo made for white-
coated breeds.
Using a coat conditioner when you bathe your Boston is optional.
The conditioner simply softens your Boston’s coat. It’s not neces-
sary, but it’s a nice way to make your Boston more huggable.
Before bath time, gather all the gear you’ll need to wash, dry, and
brush out your dog: shampoo, conditioner (optional), cotton balls,
your bristle brush, a blow-dryer, and a couple of fluffy towels.
1. Brush out your Boston’s coat thoroughly before bathing it.
Chapter 8: Looking Good 105

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
106
Strip all the dead hair and skin before you soak your pup!
(See the previous section for brushing tips.)
2. Prepare the bathing area. Place a nonslip mat in the sink
and place your shampoo, conditioner, and towels nearby.
Many Boston owners use the kitchen or bathroom sink to
bathe their pets, while others use the bathtub. On warm,
sunny days, you can also bathe her outside using a plastic
tub and the hose with an adjustable nozzle.
3. Gently plug your Boston’s ears with cotton balls and put
her in the sink.
4. With lukewarm water, rinse your dog’s head and body,
being careful not to get water in her ears. After she’s
thoroughly wet, turn off the water.
A pull-out nozzle or hand sprayer attached to the faucet or
hose makes this job easy. You can also use a pitcher or
bowl filled with water to wet down and rinse her coat.
5. Using a silver dollar–size drop of shampoo, wash and
massage your dog’s coat and skin, including her ears,
belly, and rear.
Do not get the shampoo near her eyes. Repeat if necessary.
6. Rinse the soap out completely, working from her head
down her back and underneath her body.
7. Apply the conditioner according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Let it soak in, and then rinse thoroughly.
8. Let her shake off the excess water, and then wrap your
clean dog in a big fluffy towel to soak up the rest.
9. Finish drying her coat with the blow-dryer using a low-
or no-heat setting. Being cautious around her face, start
by drying her neck area and work down toward her tail.
Because your Boston’s coat is so short, blow drying her
isn’t a necessity, particularly during warmer weather. A dry
coat, though, prevents your pup from getting chilled in the
wintertime.
Trimming those nails: A paw-dicure
Nail trimming is a grooming ritual that you should do monthly at
least. You know your Boston’s nails have grown too long if you
hear click-clicking when she walks across the floor! An ideal time
to trim her nails is after her bath when her nails are softened from
the warm water, but anytime will do.

Like all dogs, your Boston’s toenails grow continually and need to
be trimmed to keep them at a healthy length. If they grow too long
past the pads of the feet, they can curve inward and cut into the
pad. Long nails can also cause the dog to lose traction, because
they may prevent her pads from hitting the ground. They can tear
upholstery, snag clothing, and cause scratches, too.
Not only does regular trimming keep the nails at a healthy length,
but it also gives you the opportunity to inspect your dog’s pads for
cracks and her toes for splinters or thorns. Your Boston’s pads
should be soft yet calloused, depending on her age and activity
level. There should be no tender or swollen areas on the paw. If
there is, consult your veterinarian for advice.
Watch the quick
Most Boston toenails are black. This color makes it difficult to see
the quick, which is the vein inside the nail. Clipping the quick is
painful and can cause your Boston’s nail to bleed.
To find the quick, use a flashlight or look at your dog’s nails out-
doors. You should be able to see the opaque portion in the center
base of the nail — that’s the quick.
Whenever you trim your dog’s nails, keep a container of styptic
powder nearby. If you clip the quick, pour or pack a tiny bit of
powder on the nail. It will stop the quick from bleeding.
Cutting and grinding
You can choose from several types of nail trimmers at your local
pet store. Whichever style you choose, select the size that’s most
appropriate for your Boston’s nails.
When you trim your dog’s nails the first few times, enlist the help
of another person to steady your Boston and distract her with a
spoonful of peanut butter or a quick ear massage. Having an extra
set of hands will be very helpful when your dog starts squirming!
To cut your Boston’s nails:
1. Get you and your dog into a position that’s comfortable
for both of you.
You can position your Boston several ways: held against
your chest, standing on a table or other nonskid spot, or
laying on her back.
2. With the dog held securely in place by you or your assis-
tant, hold the trimmers with your dominant hand and the
dog’s paw with the other.
Chapter 8: Looking Good 107

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
108
3. Gently press your index finger and your thumb on one toe,
which extends the nail and prevents it from retracting.
4. Clip off the portion of the nail that’s curving downward
(see Figure 8-1).
5. Repeat with the other 19 toes.
With time, trimming your Boston’s nails will become second nature
to you both.
The first few times you clip your pup’s nails, be extra cautious
about not clipping her quick. Some dogs have very long memories,
and a negative nail-clipping experience may make it very difficult
the next time you try to trim her!
Figure 8-1: When trimming your Boston’s nails, avoid 
the quick.
You can also invest in an electric or battery-operated nail grinder.
Easy to use, these devices help avoid accidentally cutting the
quick and allow you to grind down sharp areas on the nail. If you
purchase a grinder, introduce it to your Boston when she’s a
puppy. The device makes a whining sound and vibrates when
applied to the nail, both of which take some getting used to.
Here’s to clean ears
A Boston’s ears stand erect, which leaves them prone to dirt, grime,
and even ear mites. When Bostons play in the yard or meet friends
at the dog park, their ears are vulnerable to all sorts of debris.
Cleaning your dog’s ears several times a week keeps them healthy.

Pad

Ear care takes some getting used to. She may not like to have her
ears handled at first. Work with your Boston until she is comfortable
with you touching her ears, looking in them, and cleaning them.
Follow these steps to wipe out your Boston’s ears:
1. Inspect your Boston’s ears. Gently hold the edge of her ear
and check for wax, discharge, odor, or signs of ear mites.
A moderate amount of wax is normal, but any discharge or
odor may signal other problems, such as an infection.
Monitor the situation and consult your veterinarian if it
persists.
2. Using a cotton ball moistened with ear-cleaning solution,
wipe the inside of the ear, getting inside all the folds and
creases (see Figure 8-2).
If you see some dark brown or black debris on the cotton
ball, your Boston may have ear mites, which thrive on ear
wax and other debris in the ear canal. Continue to wipe
until the cotton ball comes out clean, and do it daily. (For
more on ear mites and their effects, see Chapter 14.)
3. Use a fresh cotton ball for the other ear.
4. Make sure to thoroughly dry both ears with a clean
cotton ball.
If possible, cotton swabs should be avoided because they can
damage the inner ear if used incorrectly.
Figure 8-2: Use a cotton ball moistened with ear-cleaning solution to 
wipe the inside of your dog’s ear.

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier

Keeping the eyes bright 
and nose wiped
Boston Terriers’ eyes are prominent features on their expressive
faces. Protruding like they do, their eyes are vulnerable to ocular
irritation or injury. You should check your Boston’s eyes daily for
redness or unusual discharge. If you see anything unusual, bring it
to your veterinarian’s attention immediately. He should check out
any eye problems within 24 hours.
Because they have a short coat, you don’t need to worry about
trimming the hair around your Boston’s eyes, but you will need to
make sure you clean them as often as needed with a soft, damp
cloth. Use extreme caution when brushing your dog’s face, paying
special attention to the area around her eyes.
Your Boston’s nose is normally cool and moist. It should not
appear red or irritated; if it does, that could be a result of an injury,
illness, or sensitivity. Any secretions from her nose should be clear
and watery, not cloudy, yellow, or green, which indicates a sinus or
respiratory infection and requires a visit to your veterinarian.
To clean her nose, simply use a damp cloth and wipe off any dirt
that may be present. Your dog’s nose is sensitive, so be extra
gentle with it!
Tending to those pearly whites
Dental hygiene is an extremely important part of your Boston’s
grooming routine. Bacteria buildup from poor oral health has been
linked to infection and disease in dogs’ major organs, including
their hearts, livers, and kidneys.
Oral health is especially important for Bostons. Tartar builds up
quickly, resulting in plaque, gingivitis, and bad breath. The dog’s
gums become swollen and irritated, and in extreme instances,
bleed and fill with pus. If left untreated, periodontal disease can set
in, and the dog may need to have her teeth pulled. All of this can
be prevented by establishing and maintaining good dental habits.
Your Boston’s teeth should be brushed at least once a week
(though once a day would be ideal) with a child’s soft toothbrush
and toothpaste designed especially for dogs, not for humans.
The brushing removes the tartar and breaks up the plaque. If your
Boston doesn’t like the toothbrush, try massaging her teeth and
gums with dog toothpaste on your finger to get her used to the
procedure.

Get your Boston used to the teeth-cleaning routine when she’s a
puppy. With the pup on your lap, gently use your pinky finger to
massage her gums and feel her teeth — including the back ones.
After her adult teeth come in, introduce the toothbrush and 
toothpaste.
Follow these steps when polishing your Boston’s teeth:
1. Put a dime-size dollop of doggy toothpaste on the tooth-
brush, and get your pup into position.
Don’t use human toothpaste when you brush your Boston’s
teeth. It’s not safe for your Boston, and she probably won’t
like the taste.
At first, this tooth-brushing ritual can be done with your
Boston sitting in your lap. When she grows accustomed to
the routine, brush her teeth while she’s on the designated
grooming table.
2. Let your pup sniff and taste the toothpaste.
Doggy toothpaste tastes good to dogs, so as soon as she
tastes it on the toothbrush, she’ll let you lift her lip so you
can start brushing. If your dog resists, consider using a
finger toothbrush. A small, plastic brush that fits on your
finger like a thimble, it lets you get inside your dog’s
mouth, especially if you trained her as a puppy.
3. Use a circular motion when brushing your dog’s teeth,
just as you use on your own teeth (see Figure 8-3).
Clean the outside and the inside of the teeth, and don’t
miss those teeth in the back of the mouth — plaque and
tartar tend to accumulate there the most.
4. Give her some water to wash down the toothpaste.
Dogs don’t need to rinse and spit (so to speak); the dog
toothpaste is okay for them to swallow. But have some
clean, fresh water nearby to allow your pup to take a drink
after you brush her teeth.
In addition to brushing, offer your Boston treats designed to break
down tartar and plaque. Several are available from pet supply
stores; ask your retailer or veterinarian for recommendations.
Feeding your Boston dry food or a special tartar-control diet can
also break down plaque that builds up on the teeth, but there’s no
substitute for actually brushing her pearly whites.
No matter how often you brush your Boston’s teeth, you should
plan to have your dog’s teeth professionally cleaned at your veteri-
narian’s discretion.

112
Figure 8-3: Massage your Boston’s teeth and gums with the toothbrush, 
using a circular motion to break down the plaque and tartar.
Bostons who aren’t eating, drinking, or playing with their favorite
chew toys may be suffering from gum disease. Look at your dog’s
teeth and gums, and if her gums look red and swollen, are sensi-
tive, or are bleeding, call your veterinarian.
Visiting the Groomer or Spa
Some Boston Terrier owners choose to take their pet to the
groomer for regular shampooing, nail trimming, tooth brushing,
and ear cleaning. Others visit the groomer only occasionally for
deep cleanings or if their pooch gets herself into something that
requires a groomer’s expertise.
Groomers specialize in keeping your dog looking and smelling
good. Some take classes to perfect cutting techniques, and some
compete in grooming shows. These “dog hairdressers” can be
found in strip malls, pet stores, boarding facilities, and veterinar-
ian’s offices. Often, you can find a groomer through references
from your breeder, veterinarian, friend, or colleague.

Dog spas are another stylish option that have enjoyed growth in
the past five years. Often doubling as a doggy daycare facility,
dog spas encourage Boston owners to drop their dog off at the
spa for a day of aromatherapy, hair styling, grooming, massage,
and more. Your pup can also play with other dogs in a controlled
and supervised environment or enjoy a day of training and exer-
cise. The spas also allow you to leave your dog in the hands of a
capable guardian while you enjoy a day of shopping or pampering
yourself!
Before you drop off your Boston for her grooming session or spa
day, you should examine the shop and meet the handler who will
be working with your dog. Just as you wouldn’t leave your child
with a stranger at an unfamiliar daycare facility, you shouldn’t
leave your Boston without first doing some homework.
Inspecting the facility
Safety is extremely important in any grooming facility. The life of
your Boston is at stake, so you’ll want to examine everything —
from the washing area, the grooming tables, and dryers to the 
outdoor play area and common areas. Check for the following:
 Ask if the facility requires proof of vaccination and whether
a current bordetella vaccination (a highly contagious respi-
ratory disease commonly known as “kennel cough”) is
required. Dogs with communicable diseases should never be
allowed in the shop.
 Take note of the facility’s atmosphere. Dogs sense and
respond to mood, so the atmosphere should be relaxed
and calm, with groomers showing no signs of stress or
exhaustion.
 Inspect the shop itself. Both the washing and the grooming
areas should be neat and clean. The shop should be relatively
odor-free and a comfortable temperature.
 Assess the space dedicated to grooming. Is there enough
room for multiple grooming tables? Are there enough crates in
all sizes to house clients’ dogs? Is there an area dedicated to
potty breaks, and is that area safe and clean?
 Look closely at the free-standing or cage dryers and how
they’re used. Ask the groomer how she dries the dogs, and
whether the dryers turn off if they get too hot. You don’t want
your Boston getting burned!

Evaluating the staff
When you leave your Boston with a groomer or handler, you want
to feel confident that your dog is in capable and loving hands. The
best groomers and handlers have years of experience managing
many different types dog breeds, personalities, and temperaments.
They continue to learn about their trade, honing their skills
through workshops and competitions.
Keep in mind the following points about groomers and handlers
when you visit the facility:
 Observe how the staff interacts with the animals. Do they
show genuine love and compassion to the dogs? Do they leave
them unattended on the grooming tables? Do they work with
more than one animal at a time?
 Find out how much experience the groomers have. Ask the
shop manager or owner what types of dogs frequent the facility.
Are the groomers adept at handling all types of dogs, includ-
ing Boston Terriers? How long have they been grooming?
 Talk to the groomer herself. Do you feel comfortable with her
and her co-workers? You should be able to bring questions or
concerns to her without hesitation. If you like the groomer,
your dog will like the groomer and enjoy the experience.
If you like the staff and the facility (see the previous section), ask
the groomer for some references of recent clients she’s worked
with. Ask these pet owners for honest reviews and anecdotes.
Considering certification
Whether to use a certified groomer is up for debate. As of press
time, there are no legal requirements that a groomer be certified,
but the ones who are have documented proof that they passed a
practical skills assessment test and a written exam.
These tests require the individuals to demonstrate their grooming
expertise on one breed from each AKC-recognized group. They also
quiz the groomers on subjects like anatomy, breed standards, breed
identification, canine terms, general canine health, and pesticides.
When groomers pass the exams with an 85 percent or above aver-
age, they earn the title of National Certified Master Groomer.
Though no database of certified groomers currently exists, you can
find a certified groomer through referrals from your veterinarian,
pet store, breeder, or breed club.

Even if your groomer is not certified, ask her if she continues to
educate herself with regard to pet hygiene and care. Hands-on 
seminars and competitions keep groomers current on the latest
wisdom in this field, so if she is continually seeking to improve her
skills, she’s a good groomer to have.
Clothes and Accessories 
for Your Boston
The quintessential Boston look doesn’t typically include a bow or
booties, but with your dog’s short coat, she’ll appreciate a jacket
or sweater to keep her warm when the weather turns cold. If your
Boston Terrier spends a lot of time outside during chilly days,
invest in some outerwear to keep her toasty and dry.
In most pet specialty stores today, you can find a range of
clothing designed especially for dogs. From T-shirts and jackets to
booties and hats, you can choose from all sorts of fashionable
accessories.

Handling sticky situations
Because Bostons are curious dogs, it’s inevitable that your pet will get into some-
thing she shouldn’t. Here are some common grooming problems and some ways to
handle them:
 Burrs and stickers: Those little pieces of nature are sure to cause your Boston
some grief. Brush or pick them out as soon as possible. Stubborn pieces can
be coaxed out using some conditioning spray.
 Bubble gum: What a sticky mess! Before pulling out the clippers, rub the gum
with ice cubes and try to break it out. If that doesn’t work, use some conditioner,
vegetable oil, or peanut butter to pull it out. If none of those methods work, turn
to the clippers.
 Skunk spray: Several over-the-counter shampoos are formulated just for this
purpose. Brush your dog thoroughly before bathing her, and wash according to
the package instructions.
 Paint: All paint is toxic, so you’ll need to remove it immediately and not let your
Boston ingest any of it. Latex paint is water soluble, so it will rinse out with water.
Oil-based paint will necessitate a trim. Never use turpentine or any solvent on
your Boston’s coat.

Part II: Caring for Your Boston Terrier 
116
Sizing clothes for your dog
When choosing clothes for your Boston, measure around her
chest, and from the nape of her neck to the base of her tail to
determine the correct size.
Typically, Bostons wear a size small or medium, depending on the
cut of the clothing and the size of your dog. When you’re consider-
ing a piece of clothing for your dog, take a look at its cut. It should
look like it would fit a dog, not like a dog-size human garment.
The arm holes should be in the front for a proper fit.
When you try the outfit on your dog, take a look at how it fits.
It should be adjustable and have some give in areas around the
neck and legs. Make sure there are no tight areas that could cut off
your pup’s circulation. And make sure that the garment isn’t too
big because she could get tangled up in it.
Dressing your Boston
Some dog clothing is functional. These pieces keep your dog warm,
dry, and protected. Here are some garments to consider:
 Sweater or sweat shirt
 Waterproof slicker
 Wool or leather jacket
 Long-sleeve T-shirt
Some clothing, however, is purely for the dog owner’s benefit.
A crystal-encrusted tiara, froufrou dress, and patent-leather Mary
Janes look adorable, but they’re mainly for show. These fashionable
pieces make a statement about you and your Boston’s personali-
ties. Haute couture or trendy outfits are fun to put on your dog, but
don’t make a habit out of it. Your dog is a dog, after all, and you
wouldn’t want her dirtying up her favorite outfit.
Along with the clothing, your Boston may also appreciate some
dog-size shoes. Though your dog shouldn’t wear shoes all the time,
she’ll like them when it’s icy outside or when it’s too hot for bare
pads. Measure one of your dog’s paws (from the tips of her toes to
the back edge of her rear pad) to size the shoe correctly.
Hats are another accessory you can use to keep your Boston warm
and dry or fashionably trendy. Water-repellant rain hats, for instance,
will keep your pup dry, while an adorable dog-size sombrero would
be perfect for that Cinco de Mayo party!

Stepping Out

In this part . . .
S
till having a bit of terrier spunk in his blood, there’s no
doubt that your Boston loves to get out and explore
his world. Before he does, however, he needs to learn how
to behave like his “American Gentleman” nickname.
This section essentially explores dog training and behav-
ior. You get pointers on how to teach your dog to hold his
bladder and use the bathroom area. You discover the
importance of proper socialization at all stages of his life.
And you get an introduction to basic training, including
schooling your Boston on how to sit, stay, and heel.
This section discusses ways to get out with your dog, too.
From competition and trial events, like obedience and
agility, to sporting challenges, like ﬂyball and freestyle
dancing, you have plenty of reasons to head outdoors
with your Boston. And if you have vacation plans on your

Housetraining for Bostons
In This Chapter
 Teaching your puppy about bathroom breaks
 Correcting mistakes
 Introducing alternative potty spots
L
ike an infant child, your Boston Terrier puppy has yet to
develop bladder control or learn what areas in the home he
can hang out in. He relies completely on you for guidance and to
care for his basic needs, from feeding to eliminating and every-
thing in between. Even if you adopt an adult dog, he needs to know
when and where he can eliminate. With your patient leadership
and instruction, however, your Boston will learn his household
manners from day one.
Housetraining instructs your dog when and where he can relieve
himself. Because he typically won’t eliminate in the same space
where he eats and sleeps, keeping your dog in his crate or in a
restricted space trains him to hold his business until it’s time to
visit the designated bathroom area.
This chapter explores methods for housetraining your Boston,
from using crates and X-pens to housetraining pads and litter
boxes.
Each dog is different, but generally, Bostons can be considered
housetrained by 6 to 8 months old, as long as they’re not required
to hold it too long. Because they’re intelligent dogs, Bostons are
relatively easy to housetrain (compared to other dogs, like Yorkshire
Terriers). Keep in mind the process takes time. Be patient, stick
to a schedule, and remember to praise your pup for doing the
right thing!

Setting the Stage for Success:
Housetraining Basics
Housetraining involves training your dog to let you know when he
needs to eliminate, where he should go, and how to do it on com-
mand. At first, he won’t be able to tell you that he needs to use the
bathroom; you’ll tell him when to go. In time, however, he’ll learn
to hold his bladder and bowels, let you know that he needs to go
outside, and go to the bathroom in a designated area.
The best time to start housetraining is when your puppy is
between 7 and 9 weeks old and his physical coordination has been
refined. A reputable breeder will start your Boston’s housetraining
before you bring him home. Plan to continue housetraining until
your dog is 6 months old, and plan to limit his freedom until he’s
1 year old. By the end of this training period, you’ll be confident
that your pup knows when and where to do his business.
In this section, you find out what you can do to help your Boston
succeed at housetraining. You get the lowdown on how to reward
your Boston for going to the bathroom at the right time in the right
place, how to set up and introduce his designated bathroom area,
and how to limit the areas he’s allowed to explore.
Reinforcing positive behavior
One of the best ways to train your Boston is through positive rein-
forcement. Positive reinforcement rewards good behavior with
treats, praise, and lots of love. (You can read about this approach
in detail in Chapter 11.)
When using positive reinforcement to housetrain your Boston,
keep the following points in mind:
 Reward him for doing the right thing: When your Boston
goes potty when you tell him to, reward him immediately with
treats, praise, playtime, and other positive motivators.
 Correct him in the act and redirect him: When your Boston
makes a mistake (and he will!) correct him by saying, “No,” and
then pick him up and take him to the bathroom area, praising
him when he goes in the right spot. (See the “Mistakes Will
Happen” section for tips on correcting behavior.)
 Timing is critical: Dogs have short memories; when you praise
or correct your dog, he associates it with the action he just
performed. Any positive reinforcement or correction needs to
be done during or immediately after he does something.
Part III: Stepping Out 
120

Chapter 9: Housetraining for Bostons 121
Your Boston wants nothing but to please you. When you reward
his correct behavior with praise and love, he knows that he 
did the right thing, and he’ll want to keep doing that to reap the
reward.
Making the trip to the 
bathroom area
Dogs are creatures of habit. Housetraining will be much easier for
you and your Boston if you designate a particular bathroom area
and take your Boston there frequently. Here are some points to
consider when setting up your pup’s potty spot:
 Designate a space: Choose a bathroom area outside and
always take your pup on leash to that area. It could be a
patch of grass or dirt, a curb, or even a litter box on your
patio. When he eliminates, use a voice command, such 
as “Go potty,” to help him associate a command with 
eliminating.
Immediately after your Boston eliminates outdoors in the
bathroom area, praise him lavishly and give him a treat.
Don’t wait until he comes inside — by then it’s too late,
and he won’t associate the reward with relieving himself.
Immediately giving the dog positive reinforcement lets him
know what’s expected.
 Plan frequent visits to the bathroom area: Your pup’s small
bladder doesn’t hold much, so you need to take him outside
frequently: after every meal, after playing, when waking up
from one of his many naps, and about every half-hour to two
hours in between, depending on his development. After sleep-
ing all night, carry your puppy outside because he may need
to relieve himself right away. (See the “Training Your Boston”
section later in this chapter for more about taking him to the
bathroom at regular intervals.)
 Go out with him: You need to accompany your pup outside,
using the “Go potty” command. Going with him is the only
way you know that he’s going to the bathroom and not sniffing
and playing instead. You also need to continue praising and
rewarding him for eliminating outside. Eventually, your Boston
will be able to go on command, which is very useful in the
middle of the night or when you’re traveling.
Your puppy may want to play as soon as he gets outside, but
command him go to the bathroom first. Doing so reinforces
that he should do what you say first — take care of business —
and then enjoy the reward of playing with you.

Part III: Stepping Out 
122
 Show him the other “living areas” in the home: Besides
learning where he can go to the bathroom, your Boston also
needs to learn where he can’t go to the bathroom. Introduce
your dog to other living areas, like the bedrooms, guest room,
dining room, and den, besides the frequented areas of your
home. After he recognizes these rooms as places where the
family lives, he’ll be less likely to use them as alternative bath-
room spots.
 Clean up accidents: When your pup goes potty someplace
he shouldn’t, clean it up with an enzyme-based cleanser
and deodorizer. Dogs have a keen sense of smell: They’ll sniff
out a spot they’ve used before and use it again. Remove all
traces of the accident so he doesn’t think it’s another bath-
room area.
Restricting his freedom
When your Boston comes home, you probably won’t know his
housetraining habits. He may have been living on sheets of news-
paper and allowed to relieve himself anywhere he wanted, or he
may understand the concept of going outside. Until you know his
habits (and he learns how to control his bladder and bowels), you
need to limit his access to a certain area of the house.
You can restrict his freedom in several ways:
 Use his crate: Because your pup’s instincts tell him not to
eliminate where he eats and sleeps, you can use his crate to
teach him bladder and bowel control. Limit his time in the
crate to two hours at a time during the day, letting him 
periodically stretch his legs and play in his X-pen; at night,
he’ll stay in his crate until you let him out to go to the 
bathroom.
Young pups who were kept in kennels and allowed to elimi-
nate where they slept (like at a disreputable breeder facility
or pet store) will be harder to housetrain using a crate.
Because they are already used to eliminating where they eat
and sleep, you’ll have to work diligently to untrain and retrain
these dogs.
 Use an X-pen or playpen: These devices keep your Boston
contained to one area that you can easily monitor. Because X-
pens and playpens give your Boston more space, your pup
may choose a corner for a bathroom area. Line the entire
area with several layers of newspaper or some absorbent
housetraining pads to sop up accidents, and clean the area
thoroughly if (and when) accidents happen.

 Give him supervised “freedom:” Of course you’ll want to let
your pup romp and play while you’re watching television or
hanging out in the living room. It’s perfectly okay to do this —
as long as you (or a responsible family member) are there to
keep a constant eye on him. Take him potty regularly (see the
next section, “Training Your Boston,” for specifics) and lay
down some absorbent pads, just in case.
As your Boston becomes housetrained, you can slowly expand his
area to include part of a room, then an entire room, and eventually
the entire house. But his success in going when and where he’s sup-
posed to hinges on you setting and following a bathroom schedule.
Training Your Boston
Teaching your puppy to go to the bathroom on command and in
the right place will challenge both of you. Don’t worry: It’s not diffi-
cult. But you (and your family) need to be committed to consistent
training, following these same steps every time you take your
Boston to the bathroom. You can tweak the routine as your pup
starts to get the hang of housetraining.
Plan to follow this routine until your pup is at least 6 months old,
depending on the dog’s maturity level. Even then, restrict his free
access to the entire house until he’s 1 year old. You want to be able
to trust your Boston completely, and even though 6 months or a
year sounds like a long time, it’s really not when you compare it to
a lifetime of no accidents!
Assuming that you’ve introduced your pup to the house, all the
rooms, and his bathroom area, use these step-by-step instructions
to guide you through the housetraining process. Remember:
Follow these steps each and every time you (or your family
member) take your pup to the bathroom.
1. When it’s time to go outside, say, “Outside” in a happy,
upbeat tone. Attach your Boston’s leash to his collar and
lead him to the bathroom area.
You need to let him do his business at regular times
throughout the day, including:
• As soon as he wakes up in the morning and after
every nap: Those small Boston bladders don’t hold
much, and after a full night’s sleep or a relaxing nap,
he’ll be ready to relieve himself. When your pup is
very young, carry him to his bathroom area after he
wakes; when he gets older and develops bladder con-
trol, you can walk him outside.
Chapter 9: Housetraining for Bostons 123

Part III: Stepping Out 
124
• Right after he eats: Most dogs need to do their busi-
ness shortly after they eat. Take your puppy outside
no more than 15 minutes after he finishes his meal.
Older dogs can wait a bit longer.
• Right after he plays: When puppies get excited,
sometimes they lose control of their bladders.
(Think of when you were young and somebody tick-
led you until you almost wet your pants.) Right after a
fun play session, take your pup to his bathroom area.
As he gets older and learns to control his bladder, you
can taper off this trip.
• Right after you give him a bath: That warm sudsy
water can trigger the urge to go potty, so take him
outside as soon as he’s bathed — and try to keep him
out of the dirt!
• Every two hours (or so): At first, you’ll take your pup
outside every one to two hours to relieve himself
(which includes the occasions I’ve listed above).
Your Boston will gradually develop bladder and
bowel control as he gets older, so you can adjust this
rule as he matures.
• Right before he goes to bed: To help him have an
accident-free night, take your puppy to the bathroom
right before you put him in his kennel at night.
2. As soon as he starts going to the bathroom, say, “Go potty.”
He knows what he’s doing, and by giving him a verbal com-
mand, he links his action with your cue. Teaching him to
go on command is particularly useful when it’s raining or
snowing outside, when you’re late for work, or when you’re
on a road trip and don’t have a lot of time to spare.
3. Immediately after he’s done, say “Good boy to go potty,”
or whatever phrase or word you choose, and give him a
treat.
He’ll begin to associate three things: the command (“Go
potty”) with the action (going potty), the action with the
reward (treat), and the reward with your praise. You’re
teaching him that by going potty on command, he will earn
a reward. That reward will ultimately be your praise.
Slowly, your Boston will show signs of getting the housetraining con-
cept. He’ll wait by the door when he has to go, or come up with some
other way to say, “I have to go!” He’ll be able to hold his bladder
through the night without whimpering. He’ll head to the bathroom
spot first thing when you let him outside. It will take time — at
least six months — before he gets the hang of it, but he will.

Prevention is key to housetraining. Don’t give your pup the oppor-
tunity to make a mistake. Keep him in your sight at all times by
attaching his leash to your chair or waist, or using a baby gate to
keep him confined. If you see him start to sniff around or walk in
circles, immediately grab the lead and take him outside to his bath-
room spot, saying, “Go potty.” Then praise and give him a treat.
Mistakes Will Happen
You’ve been taking your Boston puppy to his bathroom area regu-
larly, and letting him relieve himself after every meal, playtime, and
nap. Your dog is becoming housetrained. But then, he makes a mis-
take. What do you do?
 Correct him in the act and redirect him: The act of going to
the bathroom isn’t the mistake; it’s going in the wrong place.
So if you catch your pup in the act, say in a corrective tone,
“Pete, no,” and immediately take him to his bathroom area
and let him finish his business there. Then praise your Boston
and celebrate that he’s going outside.
Don’t correct the dog after he makes a mistake — he can’t
understand the connection between the correction and the
mistake he made hours (even minutes) ago. Also, never rub
your dog’s face in the mess. It’s not only an unnecessarily
harsh punishment, but your dog will think that you’re mad
because he defecated, not because he went in the wrong
place. Instead, encourage and praise your dog even more
when he does go in his correct bathroom area. Reinforcing the
positive behavior is the best way to discourage house-soiling.
If your Boston seems to be having more accidents than usual,
it may be a sign of stress or illness. Sometimes dogs react to
pain or discomfort by soiling in areas where they normally
don’t. Talk to your veterinarian if you see any changes in your
Boston’s urinating habits.
 Clean it well: Clean the soiled area with white vinegar or an
enzyme-based pet stain cleaner. Dogs tend to continue soiling
in areas that smell like feces or urine, so removing all traces of
the accident prevents your dog from using that area again.
 Watch him: You also want to keep a close eye on your Boston.
If you know where your dog is, he can’t make a mistake. A cir-
cling and sniffing dog means he’s searching for a bathroom, so
ask him in an upbeat happy voice, “Pete, do you have to go
potty?” When he runs to the door, take him out and praise him
after he goes.

Part III: Stepping Out 
126
Okay Ways to Go Inside
If you live in an urban area or work long hours, you may need to
leave your Boston inside for the majority of the day. That’s a long
time for your Boston to control his bladder and bowels! You can
enlist the help of your local dog sitter or take him to doggy day
care (Chapter 13 has more on these options). Or you can train
your pup to go in certain areas inside your home.
In this section, I offer two additional options to using an outdoor
bathroom area. They’re not meant to replace traditional house-
training methods, because your Boston should learn how to hold
his bladder and go to the bathroom in a designated outdoor spot.
These options are intended to give you more choices for allowing
your pup to relieve himself.
Teaching your Boston both traditional housetraining and an 
alternative method may confuse him at first. Be patient while
he’s learning, and continue to be diligent with his training. If he
just doesn’t seem to get it after a couple of weeks, forgo the 
alternative method and focus on the traditional method. You can
always teach your pup the new bathroom trick after he learns the
first routine.
The scoop on pooper scoopers
Let’s face it: Cleaning up after your pooch is dirty business. He may be the love of your
life, but bagging his little presents can be a smelly job. And if it’s raining or snowing,
that makes the task all the more, err, delightful! (I’m being sarcastic, of course!)
Innovative inventors realize this, so they have designed all sorts of devices to make
this task mess-free. No longer is the old plastic grocery bag the receptacle of choice.
Now you can choose from scoops, claws, and shovels for minimal handling. You
can purchase waste bags in bulk to attach to your lead, toss in your purse, and pack
in your Boston’s carrier. With so many options, cleaning up has never been easier!
For Boston owners who want nothing to do with cleaning up their dog’s droppings,
however, pooper scooper services can do your dirty business. A pet sitter, dog
walker, or someone who is in this line of work (really!) comes to your home a number
of times during the week and cleans up your Boston’s feces for a fee. It’s certainly
a convenience to consider.

Read all about it: Paper training
Typically used during the beginning stages of housetraining, paper
training teaches your Boston to eliminate on sheets of newspaper
rather than wherever he pleases. This method is useful when you
can’t supervise him or take him to his bathroom area during the
day. It’s also useful for pups who have developed a habit of going
in their crates.
1. Before your pup is allowed free reign of the house, erect an
X-pen to confine him to one area.
Choose a place such as the kitchen, living room, or other high-
traffic area where he feels like he’s part of the family pack.
2. Lay down three or four sheets of newspaper inside the
entire pen.
He will develop a habit of eliminating on the newspaper, even-
tually preferring a specific spot to do his business.
3. When you know the spot that your Boston prefers to elimi-
nate in and the rest of the papers remain clean, gradually
reduce the area that is papered.
Remove the sheets that are farthest away from his preferred
spot. Eventually, you’ll only need to leave a few sheets in
that area.
4. After your pup is reliably going on the papers that you’ve
left, slowly start to move the paper to a location that’s more
to your liking (that is to say, not in the middle of the floor or
under the kitchen table).
Don’t move the papers too far too soon: An inch or two a day
is far enough.
Don’t be discouraged if your pup misses the paper or makes
remarkable progress and then regresses. Lay down a larger area of
newspaper and start again. It’s normal to make mistakes. Just stay
determined, and your Boston will eventually get the hang of it.
A litter box of his own
Yes, your Boston can be trained to use the litter box! Just as you’d
train your dog to use newspaper or a bathroom area outside, you
can teach your dog to use a bathroom area inside or on your porch.
Chapter 9: Housetraining for Bostons 127

Litter boxes are well-suited for dogs who live in apartments or
condos, for families who work long hours and can’t let their dogs
outside during the day, or for older invalid or housebound dogs.
Litter boxes for dogs look just like large litter boxes for cats. You can
find them in most pet supply stores or through online vendors, or
you can construct your own using a plastic bin with an entry point
cut into the side and sanded down so there are no sharp edges.
The litter is typically compressed wood, newspaper pellets, or cat
litter, depending on the style of litter box you choose.
When your dog is a puppy, take him by his lead to the bathroom
area just as you would take him outside. Reward and praise the
pup when he goes in the right spot. As always with housetraining,
keep a vigilant eye on your Boston, and if he shows any signs of
sniffing and circling, take him to the bathroom area immediately.
If your Boston is already paper trained (see the previous section),
transitioning to a litter box can be relatively easy. Gradually move
the newspaper to the area where the litter box is. Instead of filling
the box with litter, line it with newspaper. Replace the paper with
litter as your pup gets used to the box.
As with any housetraining method, mistakes will happen, and
you’ll need to clean any messes. While your Boston is learning how
to use his litter box, lay newspaper or absorbent pads on the floor
around the box. Clean up mistakes with a commercial cleaner that
removes all traces of odor. And be patient and diligent with your
training! Bostons are intelligent dogs, and before long, your dog
will be doing his business in his box!

Socializing for Life
In This Chapter
 Identifying key developmental phases in your Boston’s life
 Looking at strategies for socializing your pup
 Interpreting canine body language
 Calming your dog’s fears
A
well-socialized Boston delights all who cross her path. She
plays well with other dogs. She welcomes new faces, smells,
sights, and sounds instead of cowering in fear. She enjoys meeting
people and exploring unknown territory. In essence, she fits well in
any social situation.
A Boston who is protected from the world, however, learns to fear
what she doesn’t know. Everything becomes frightening, and as
a result, the dog will be timid and fearful, cowering from noises,
sights, people, and other dogs. A fearful dog also may begin to bite
out of fear, a habit that can be difficult to correct.
During the first year of your dog’s life — particularly the first four
months — she experiences developmental milestones that will
warrant your special attention, especially as they pertain to your
pup’s personality and social behavior. In this chapter, I explore
those key phases in your Boston’s development and how you can
help her through them. I also include tips for introducing your
puppy to different people and objects. Finally, I provide you with
some guidance on how dogs communicate their feelings and how
you can prevent fear in your Boston. Though each dog differs, you
can use these pages as a guideline for what to expect as your pup
grows into an adult.

Understanding Your Boston’s
Developmental Timeline
Before delving into ways to socialize your Boston, you need to
understand the developmental phases your dog will experience as
she grows from puppyhood through adolescence and into adult-
hood. Each phase contains its own milestones, like bonding with
humans or learning social hierarchies, and as a dog owner, you
want to foster those behaviors so the pup grows to be a well-
adjusted adult.
If you adopt a puppy from a disreputable pet store or backyard
breeder, or if you adopt an adult from a rescue organization or
shelter, your Boston may have missed some of these developmen-
tal milestones. Healthy development requires human and canine
contact, and some of these puppies may not have received what
they required to socialize properly. They’re not hopeless cases, but
these puppies require extra-special care and nurturing.
A brand-new world: The first 6 weeks
There’s nothing like a brand-new puppy. Still wriggling and yearn-
ing for her mother, she’s completely dependent on her canine care-
taker for nourishment and development. She’s also dependent on
her littermates for social stimulation.
From about 3 to 6 weeks old, a puppy gets her social stimuli from
other dogs, like her mother and siblings. She learns how to act
around other dogs, begins to understand social hierarchies (who
ranks higher than whom in the pack), and shows the first hints of
personality.
Dogs at this age should not be away from their mothers. Because
reputable breeders don’t adopt out dogs at this age, it’s unlikely
that you’ll see this stage of your Boston’s development, though
you may have some exposure to it when you visit the breeder to
pick out your puppy.
Getting to know people: 
5 to 12 weeks
When a puppy reaches 5 to 12 weeks of age, she turns her atten-
tion to people. She begins to look to her human caretakers for
Part III: Stepping Out 
130

social stimuli and interaction. At this time in her life, positive
human bonding is critical for proper socialization.
Most breeders will let you take your pup home at around 10 to
12 weeks old. While the young Boston lives with the breeder, her
socialization with humans begins. The breeder will hold the puppy
and invite friends and neighbors over to handle her. When you take
her home, you’ll continue to do the same.
Puppies experience their first fear phase when they’re around 8
weeks old. At this age, she has become very aware of the world
around her, and sometimes it can be very scary. If she’s frightened
by something at this age, it’s likely that she won’t get over it.
Breeders know this, and they typically won’t adopt out a pup who
has yet to experience this fear phase.
During these second and third months of life, your Boston should
meet people of both genders and as many ages, ethnicities, and
backgrounds as possible. They should hold her, talk to her, coddle
her, and interact with her so that later in life, she’s already familiar
with those types of people. The key is to make all of these experi-
ences as positive as possible.
A challenge will surface, however, when your veterinarian recom-
mends that you not take the pup to pet stores, dog parks, or places
where other dogs or strays have been until after she’s had all of
her vaccinations (about 16 weeks old). So what do you do? Invite
friends over for a cookout. Have an intimate get-together with
neighbors. Think of ways to welcome as many individuals as possi-
ble to your home. Some trainers recommend that your pup meet
100 or more people during these first months of her life! You’ll have
to get creative.
Though your puppy has already endured her first fear phase, ask
your friends not to move too quickly or wear distracting items, like
a big floppy hat or dark sunglasses, when they come to visit. Quick
movements or colorful disguises can frighten a young Boston!
Interacting with her environment:
12 to 20 weeks
After getting used to all sorts of people, your pup will begin getting
used to different surroundings. From 12 weeks to 20 weeks old, a
puppy is the most receptive to learning how to handle new sights,
sounds, and smells. This is the best time to begin to socialize her
to different environments.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 131

Puppy kindergarten offers an excellent opportunity to get your pup
out of the house and into new environments. Often held at training
centers, pet stores, and dog parks, puppy kindergarten introduces
a dog to a new place, new people, and new dogs — a perfect social
situation for a developing dog! See Chapter 11 for more information
about the benefits of puppy kindergarten.
At 16 weeks old, some dogs experience another fear phase. As with
her first fear phase (see the “Getting to know people: 5 to 12 weeks”
section), if a dog is frightened by something, it’s likely that she’ll
carry that fear with her for her entire life. Use caution when expos-
ing your Boston to scary things at this age. I discuss handling fear
in the “Preventing Fear” section later in this chapter. Just remem-
ber to stay upbeat, and avoid reinforcing the fear by coddling her
when something scares her.
Fourteen weeks marks an important milestone in a pup’s develop-
ment: If she is kenneled and not handled before this period, she
will develop some serious social problems, often acting out toward
things she doesn’t understand. It’s absolutely critical that the dog
is handled as much as possible during these first few months.
Approaching adulthood: 
4 months to 3 years
After a puppy makes it through her first four months of life — her
puppyhood — she enters her teenage years. She continues to
explore her surroundings, sniffing things, tasting things, and get-
ting to know the world around her. She also experiences three
major milestones in her life:
 Another fear period: As with the fear periods at 8 and 16 weeks
old, some dogs may go through another one at 14 months old
that’s not as critical as the first two. During this fear period, you
may notice your pup being apprehensive toward things she
already knows. Help her through this by encouraging her and
reassuring her, revisiting some training techniques, if necessary.
 Sexual maturity: This inevitable teenage experience occurs in
both male and female dogs between 6 months and 1 year of
age. Female dogs should be spayed before their first heat
cycle, reducing their chances of developing reproductive
system cancers and unwanted pregnancies. Male dogs should
also be neutered around this same time. Doing so reduces
unwanted behaviors such as aggression, urine marking,
mounting, and wandering in search of a mate. (Chapter 14
has more specifics on spaying and neutering your Boston.)
Part III: Stepping Out 
132

 Social maturity: From 1 year to 3 years old, a dog continues to
mature socially. She’s still considered a puppy during this
time, despite her adult appearance! She continues to develop
her personality, she refines her behavior, and she experiences
more new sights, sounds, people, and places as her world
continues to expand.
Though the dog has passed her prime for growing accustomed to
various environmental stimuli, you should still expose your Boston
to as many social situations as possible. By the time she reaches
her third birthday, she’s ready for just about anything.
Socializing Your Puppy
You know you need to introduce your pup to as many social situa-
tions as possible. So how do you do it? The process begins as soon
as your puppy is born. When a Boston first enters the world, she
begins to develop her senses of smell and taste. She learns to inter-
act with her mother and littermates. Then she begins to explore
the human world, bonding with people and expanding the world
around her.
You can help her through these phases so she becomes a dog who
adores — and depends upon — people. The key is to introduce
your Boston to the world without frightening her. That means your
tone of voice should be happy and upbeat. It takes some work and
a lot of patience, but when your adorable puppy develops into a
well-adjusted and demonstrative adult, all your efforts will be
worth it.
Keeping her safe, yet social
After your puppy comes home, you’ll want to introduce her to as
many people as possible. You’re a proud new puppy parent, after
all, and you want to show her off! Exposure to people helps your
dog learn who belongs to the pack and who doesn’t.
Trainers recommend that your pup meet and be handled by at
least 100 people of all different ages, sizes, and ethnicities during
the first few months of life! She should meet people who wear
glasses or hats. She should also be exposed to people who use a
wheelchair or cane. She should meet the children down the street,
the teenagers next door, and the retired seniors across the way.
The more variety she experiences, the better.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 133

Your veterinarian will probably tell you not to take your dog out
until she has been fully vaccinated. That’s easier said than done!
You know you need to expose her to a variety of people, but you
also want to keep her healthy.
Here are some ways to both keep her safe and allow her to meet a
variety of people. Start slowly; stick to your house the first week or
two and expand from there.
 Take her with you wherever you go. Dress her in a fancy
pup-size collar with an ID tag, attach a matching leash, put her
in colorful carrier, and let her shadow you as you go to the
market, the coffee shop, or a friend’s house.
 Expose her to as many different people as possible. Let her
meet your neighbors, the postal carrier, and the pet store
cashier. Wherever you go, you and your adorable Boston will
create a stir. Let people pet and fawn over your pup. The more
people she meets, the better she’ll adjust.
 Invite friends and relatives to your house and ask each
person to hold your pup. By meeting people on her own turf,
your Boston develops confidence as well as social skills. And
as each person handles your Boston, she gets used to being
touched by different humans — all with different smells and
appearances.
 Host play dates with other dog owners and their dogs who
have already had their vaccinations. If you know that they’re
up to date on their shots, you can have other dogs over to
meet your puppy. Always supervise them, of course, espe-
cially if the dogs are older or larger than your pup.
 Avoid places where strange dogs have been. Let your Boston
explore as much as she can, but steer clear of areas with
potentially parasite-ridden animal feces, like public parks,
beaches, or unfamiliar neighborhoods.
Introducing children — slowly
Puppies and children — responsible children, that is — go
together like cookies and milk. When the two pair up, they often
develop an uncanny bond, much to the chagrin of adults! They’ll
play together, the dog will obey the child’s commands, and the two
will become inseparable (and mischievous!) in no time at all.
The key to a successful child-pup relationship, however, is the
child’s maturity level. A child who is too young may play too rough
with a puppy, or a child who is too immature or inexperienced with
dogs may become frightened by a pup’s playful postures. Without
Part III: Stepping Out 
134

parental supervision and ground rules, the experience can be a
negative one for both the dog and the child.
Before you let any child play with your Boston puppy, first deter-
mine how comfortable the child is with dogs. If he’s your child,
you’ll know his comfort level. If he’s your child’s friend or a neigh-
bor, ask his parents how much experience he has had with puppies.
If they give you a green light, let them play together — always
supervised, of course.
You can set up some ground rules to make playtime a positive one
for everyone. Here are some suggestions:
 Sniff first, play later. Ask the child to approach the pup
slowly and offer an outstretched hand for her to smell. If your
Boston sniffs and wags her little tail, the child can pet and
play with her.
 Move slowly. Don’t allow children to run or move erratically
around the puppy. Doing so can be frightening or overwhelm-
ing, or the pup may accidentally be trampled. Instead, require
deliberate, cautious movements, especially when the pup is
very young.
 Use an inside voice. Don’t let kids scream or yell while play-
ing with the puppy. Again, this can be overstimulating or
scary to a young dog.
 Give the puppy some space. Though a Boston pup may look
like an adorable stuffed animal, don’t let kids grab the pup
and hug her. Instead, allow the child to pet the puppy while
she’s on the ground, in her bed, or in an adult’s lap. Watch the
dog’s body language. If she looks frightened, ask the child to
back off a little.
 No wrestling! Part of that child-dog bond includes wrestling
and playing with the pup. Some physical play is fine, but don’t
let kids throw themselves on the puppy. Not only can that
endanger the dog, but it can also endanger the child if the pup
gets scared and nips at him.
 Limit face time. Don’t allow kids to grab your Boston’s face,
put their face to hers, blow in her face, or stare at her. Those
are all intimidating postures that can lead to nipping and
biting later on. Let the kids pet the pup’s head, neck, back,
and belly, but keep her face off-limits.
After the puppy has grown, you can relax some of these house
rules. You’ll know instinctively when it’s okay for your child to play
more exuberantly with your Boston. Use common sense and good
judgment, always supervising the new best friends.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 135

Interacting with four-legged friends
Dogs bond with other dogs when they’re first born. Right out of the
womb, they learn to share — or battle for — their mother’s milk.
When playing and wrestling, they learn how rough is too rough.
Natural leaders and followers emerge. They develop the canine
social skills required to live and interact in a dog pack.
When a puppy leaves the litter and moves into her new home,
she’ll use her learned pack behavior to interact with her new
family — which may contain dogs, cats, hamsters, reptiles, or even
a goat. Similarly, when a puppy comes across new four-legged
friends at dog parks or puppy kindergarten, she uses those same
learned behaviors to meet and greet her new friends.
Just as your dog needs to be exposed to different types of adults
and children, your dog should also be exposed to other animals and
learn how to interact with them appropriately. Below, I’ve listed
some strategies to make those introductions a little easier.
At home
Whether you have a tank full of bearded dragons, a pair of finicky
felines, or a cow and a couple of goats, you need to introduce your
Boston puppy to each one. Flip to Chapter 6 for more tips on intro-
ductions, but here are some things to keep in mind:
 Talk to your veterinarian. Because your vet likely cares for
the other critters in your menagerie, ask him if there are any
dangers to watch for, especially when your puppy is young. A
grumpy 12-year-old cat may bear his claws and take a swipe at
the new pup. Reptile feces can contain salmonella. Give your
vet a call, just to be safe.
 Introduce them slowly. For most animals, you can create a
safe environment in your kitchen or living room. Place your
Boston in her carrier or kennel and allow the other animal to
sniff and inspect the new puppy. After the two learn to recog-
nize each other, give them more freedom. But don’t rush the
introductions. You’ll have plenty of time!
 Always supervise. Keep an eye on your pets, especially in the
beginning when they’re getting to know each other. Cats may
be territorial, while other dogs may play too rough.
 Guard smaller pets. Keep pets such as reptiles and small
mammals caged or in your care. Those little critters may look
like prey to your puppy! Rather than risk losing a hamster or
gecko, keep them locked up and safe, just in case.
Part III: Stepping Out 
136

Out and about
A few weeks after you bring your puppy home, when she’s 14
weeks old or so, you’ll begin to expose her to new environments.
She’ll see new sights, smell new smells, and meet new people.
She’ll also come across other dogs. Make it a positive experience
by taking the following actions:
 Verify vaccinations. If you meet a fellow dog owner walking
his dog, for example, ask whether the other dog is up to date
on his vaccinations. Most responsible dog owners will be cur-
rent with their pup’s inoculations, and they won’t be offended
if you ask.
 Encourage encounters with friendly dogs. When a familiar
dog approaches your Boston and you know that he is current
on his shots, let them sniff each other and get to know one
another. Dog parks, puppy kindergarten and other organized
socialization classes, and planned play dates are great oppor-
tunities for dog-dog bonding and socializing.
 Be wary of unknown dogs. They may harbor disease or be
aggressive, so steer clear of strange animals, especially those
that aren’t leashed. If you see one in the distance, turn around
and walk away.
 Stay away from animal feces. Parasites and diseases hide in
animal excrement (see Chapter 14 for details), so keep your
Boston far from dog, cat, and other animal feces. She’ll likely
want to investigate little piles left behind, but pull her away
and redirect her.
 Get involved in dog social activities. Puppy kindergarten
offers a safe place for your Boston to meet other dogs and
interact with other humans. Dog owners must show proof of
their dog’s vaccinations before they can register, so you can
be assured that your pup won’t be exposed to any disease.
And you’ll meet other dog owners with pups the same age as
yours, so you can talk about your pup-raising experiences —
the good and bad!
Socializing Your Adult Dog
If you raise your Boston from puppyhood and socialize her prop-
erly, she already knows how to act around other animals, dogs, and
humans, and she’s been exposed to a variety of environmental situ-
ations. Essentially, her brain has been programmed for how to
properly behave in many different scenarios.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 137

But what if you adopt an older dog who hasn’t been socialized?
Is all hope lost? Not necessarily. It will take a lot of patience and
training, but she can be socialized.
Here are some ways to teach your older dog new socialization tricks:
 Enroll in a dog obedience class. Besides learning how to
obey your commands, your Boston will meet many different
people and dogs, and be exposed to a new environment. By
introducing her to so many new things at once, you’ll kick-
start her socialization process.
 Progress to agility or other competitive sport. As soon as
your dog learns some basic obedience and social skills,
try her paw (or your hand) at agility or tracking (jump to
Chapter 12 to learn more about these sports). These are 
challenging and energy-expending competitions that give
your dog the opportunity to interact with many different
people, dogs, and situations.
 Introduce her to new environments. As you would with a
puppy, take your adult Boston with you wherever you go.
Let her meet your friends and neighbors. Ask your child to
invite his friends over to meet your dog. Go to a dog park.
Do everything you can to expose your Boston to as many 
situations as possible.
 Reward her for a job well done. Positive reinforcement, or
rewarding your dog for good behavior, teaches your Boston
that she’ll be praised when she greets new people with a lick
and a wag, or meets new dogs with a friendly sniff and play bow
(see more about this posture in the “Reading Your Boston’s
Body Language” section).
 Keep working at it. Dogs who have not been socialized as
puppies require continuous training about how to behave
among other dogs and humans. Luckily, Bostons are intelli-
gent, and a little reminding goes a long way.
Reading Your Boston’s 
Body Language
Dogs don’t use words to communicate with humans, but they do
use postures and body language to convey their mood. Canine
body postures refer to the way a dog positions her body when she
comes into contact with another dog or animal (including humans).
It signals to the other animal whether she is fearful, playful, sub-
missive, or aggressive.
Part III: Stepping Out 
138

When you can identify these various postures, you can better
understand your Boston’s behavior and mood, taking appropriate
action when needed. If your dog displays an aggressive posture, for
example, you can take hold of her leash, walk away calmly, and
redirect her attention so she doesn’t attack. Likewise, if another
dog strikes an aggressive posture, you and your dog can walk away
to prevent problems. In the following sections, I list the most
common postures and their telltale signs.
Neutral relaxed
When your Boston is neutral relaxed (see Figure 10-1), she’s simply
hanging out, enjoying the day. Her head is erect, her ears are up,
her tail is relaxed and wagging, her mouth is slightly open, and her
weight is evenly distributed over all four of her feet.
Figure 10-1: A neutral relaxed posture means your Boston is content.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 139

Greeting
Dogs who are saying hello to other dogs (shown in Figure 10-2)
approach each other cautiously. The more dominant dog has her
ears and tail up. The submissive dog has her ears back and her tail
down, and her eyes are semi-closed.
The two sniff each other’s genital region. This may seem rather
strange to humans, but to dogs, it’s completely natural. Dogs have
scent glands on either side of their anus. These anal glands contain
a scent that’s unique to each dog. When they greet each other, dogs
sniff at these glands. Talk about getting up close and personal!
Figure 10-2: When dogs meet, they’ll slowly approach and sniff each other.
Play bow
When your Boston wants to play, you’ll know immediately when
she strikes a play bow (see Figure 10-3). She lowers her front end,
including her head and shoulders, and leaves her hips high. She
happily wags her tail, her ears are up, her eyes are soft, she relaxes
her mouth, and her tongue is out. This posture lets everyone know
that she’s ready to have some fun.
If you want to play with your Boston, you can strike the same pose.
Lift your hands high, and then bring them down in front of you,
mimicking her bowing motion. Use an upbeat, positive voice, and
get ready to toss the ball!
Part III: Stepping Out 
140

Figure 10-3: A play bow means one thing: Let’s play!
Arousal
A Boston who has been stimulated by something (shown in
Figure 10-4) — whether it be a sound, a sight, or a smell — will
hold the arousal posture. Her ears are up and forward, her eyes
are wide open, her tail is up, and her weight is over her front legs.
Her muzzle may appear tense, with her lips lifted to expose her
teeth, and her hackles (the hairs on her neck and back that
stand up) may be raised, especially if she’s responding to an 
unfamiliar stimulus.
If she’s responding to something pleasurable, however, like when
her best dog friend comes to the door, she wags her tail loosely
and relaxes her muzzle, and her hackles are down. She knows
something fun is about to happen, and she’s ready for it.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 141

Figure 10-4: An arousal pose means that something has piqued your 
Boston’s interest.
Defensive aggression
If a dog feels threatened, she strikes a defensive aggression posture
(see Figure 10-5), warning the other dog (or animal) that she doesn’t
want to be approached.
Her hackles may be up. Her tail is down and tensed, and her ears are
back. Her weight falls over her rear legs. Her muzzle is tense, and
she may snarl and expose her teeth. A Boston in this type of pos-
ture may attack or bite if the offending animal doesn’t back down.
Aggressive attack
A posture that no one likes to see, an aggressive attack pose (see
Figure 10-6) means your Boston is in fight mode. It’s a threatening
posture intended to frighten, chase away, or attack intruders. Poorly
socialized or highly protective Bostons may take this pose when
they feel their home is being invaded or their human is threatened.
When she’s in this posture, you see a raised tail and hackles. Her
ears are erect, tilting forward, and her eyes seem to shoot darts at
her adversary. She curls her lips, revealing her teeth. Her weight is
on her front paws, and she’ll likely be charging and barking.
Part III: Stepping Out 
142

Figure 10-5: A threatened Boston will strike a defensive aggressive pose.
Figure 10-6: When a Boston takes the aggressive attack pose, she’s 
defending her territory, chasing away any threatening intruders.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 143

Submission
The opposite of aggression, submission (shown in Figure 10-7) is
when a dog acknowledges the dominant animal by surrendering.
Behaviorists identify two types of submission:
 Active submission: The dog tilts her head down, lowers her
tail, cocks her ears back, and half-closes her eyes. She may
raise her paw, and her mouth may be partly closed with her
tongue tip darting in and out.
 Passive submission: The dog lies on her back, exposing her
belly. She’s essentially surrendering to the other animal.
She cocks her ears back, turns her head away, and tucks
her tail. This is the position your pup should take when you
tell her to settle. (See Chapter 11 for more about training
your pup.)
Figure 10-7: Your Boston will strike a submissive pose when she 
acknowledges a dominant animal or person.
Preventing Fear
During your Boston’s 8th week, 16th week, and 14th month of life,
she’ll go through fear periods when she’s more apt to view things
around her as frightening. It’s important at this age that you try to
prevent scary things from happening, but if your Boston does
experience something scary, don’t reinforce that fear by coddling
and comforting her. If you do, the puppy will remember that acting
fearful yields a reward — your attention — and that fear response
will stay with her.
Part III: Stepping Out 
144

Fear periods last anywhere from several weeks to several months,
depending on the puppy’s temperament and ability to cope with
frightening situations. If your Boston shows excessive fear or 
doesn’t seem to be coming out of a fear phase, talk to your 
veterinarian for advice.
Being proactive
Part of preventing fear is to expose your Boston to as many people
and situations as possible. As I explain in the “Socializing Your
Puppy” section earlier in this chapter, dogs need to meet people of
different races, ethnicities, ages, and appearances. They should also
experience a range of different activities and scenarios. By helping
them become familiar with these things, they will be less likely to
fear them later on.
Coping with fear
Boston puppies show they are in a fear period in many different
ways. Some become cautious about everything, approaching objects
and situations — even familiar ones — tentatively. Other pups are
more selective, being bold about some things and timid with others.
When you think your puppy is in a fear phase, you can do several
things to handle her fear:
 Watch your tone of voice. When your Boston seems fearful
of something, speak to her in a calm, matter-of-fact tone, or
speak to her in a higher-pitched, fun tone. Tell her that it’s
okay, that there’s nothing to fear. Resist the urge to use a
soothing tone that she could mistake as sympathy. That only
reinforces her fears.
 Distract her. Another approach is to distract your Boston by
turning her away from what scared her. When you redirect her
attention, give her a treat or a toy, saying, “What’s this? Here’s
your ball!” The key is to make her think about something else.
 Investigate the fearful item. If the scary item is accessible,
walk up to, touch it, and show her that it’s not as frightening
as she thought. Approach the item and hold it, pat it, and tell
her, “Look! It’s not scary.” If a cookie sheet falls to the floor, for
example, walk up to it, pick it up, investigate it, and show it to
your Boston. When she starts to approach and sniff it, praise
her and tell her how brave she is.
 Don’t force her. Sometimes your Boston may just want to
hang back and look at the scary item. That’s okay. When she’s
ready, then let her approach it on her own. If you force her,
you may just make the fear that much worse.
Chapter 10: Socializing for Life 145

If your pup still is afraid or starts to show signs of aggression at
things she fears, you may want to talk to your vet or enlist the help
of a trainer who can help you through the phase.

Training and Behavior
In This Chapter
 Taking your Boston to school
 Mastering basic obedience commands
 Using humane methods to correct problem behavior
 Deciding when to call a behavior expert
E
very year, pet owners relinquish millions of dogs to shelters
because of their pets’ bad behavior. Well-meaning families 
purchase puppies with every intention of training them to be 
well-behaved adults. They take them to puppy kindergarten and
practice their lessons at home with hopes that the adorable pup-
pies will obey their commands and behave as good dogs should.
Unfortunately, many times those good intentions fall by the way-
side. Puppy kindergarten, for example, may meet the same day as
their child’s soccer team plays its matches. It becomes hard to find
time to practice the Sit, Stay, and Leave It commands at home.
Before too long, the dog has asserted his dominance over the home,
greeting houseguests with a bark, jumping up for attention, and
digging dozens of holes in the perfectly manicured lawn. The owner
throws up her hands in frustration and sequesters her beloved
Boston to the basement or patio, then banishes him to the back-
yard, and eventually drops him off at the pound or humane society.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. You can raise a well-behaved
Boston who obeys commands. Behavior training is about teaching
your Boston what actions are allowed and which ones are forbid-
den. It also means that you, the owner, have to be decisive about
what you permit and prohibit.
School Days
Puppy kindergarten and obedience classes teach you how to handle
your dog, and they teach your dog how to listen to you. Often

Part III: Stepping Out 
148
organized through humane societies, veterinary offices, and pet
stores, these courses are led by trained instructors who have par-
ticular expertise in teaching dog owners how to handle their pets.
Although you can skip puppy kindergarten and train your Boston
at home, you and your dog achieve much greater success when
you’re taught by a dog trainer. In the structured environment, the
trainer lays down fundamentals that you build upon throughout
your Boston’s life. It may seem like a hassle to take your pup to
these classes, but they pay off later on.
Why classes are a good idea
Unless you’re a dog trainer or an experienced dog owner, you prob-
ably don’t know too much about training a dog. A dog isn’t a little
human; you can’t reason with him, you can’t talk him into behaving
a certain way, and you can’t ground him for bad behavior. The only
thing he understands is how to act like a dog, so as his owner, you
need to communicate with him in a way that he understands.
You can learn these communication skills in a puppy kindergarten
or obedience class.
Here are some more reasons to enroll your dog in classes:
 Safety: One of the most important reasons to train your
Boston to obey your commands is to keep him safe. If you’re
outside and he starts to chase a bird, a trained dog will stay
and come at your command. The untrained Boston will keep
running and can hurt himself, lose his way home, or worse.
 Manners: You also want to train your Boston so you can take
him on outings. A well-behaved Boston will sit and lay down
at your side without barking, nipping, or trying to run away.
 Harmony: A well-behaved dog will be a pleasure to be around.
If he starts to act rambunctious, he’ll settle when told, or he’ll
lie down in his bed when the family wants to enjoy a movie.
Though more and more people think of their dogs as their “children,”
it’s important to remember that dogs are dogs, and they need to
be treated as such. Treating your pet like a miniature human only
confuses him. He wants to be part of the pack, not your daughter’s
younger brother.
Your Boston wants nothing more than to find his place in the pack.
If you don’t assert yourself as leader, he’ll assume that role — which
is not what you want. You are the pack leader, and your job is to
communicate clearly and firmly what you want him to do through
humane training techniques, such as positive reinforcement.

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 149
Obedience classes can help you master these training skills and
show your dog that you are the leader of the household. The end
result will be a happy dog and a happy owner.
The right ages to learn new lessons
Though the old adage “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks” may
be true in some cases, dogs of any age can learn how to obey basic
commands. Puppies pick up commands much more quickly than
adult dogs, but both puppies and adults benefit from organized
classes that instruct the dog and the owner.
Puppy kindergarten
The place to start with a puppy is puppy kindergarten. Intended to
be an opportunity for your puppy to socialize with other dogs and
humans, this course introduces you and your Boston to behavior
basics, such as having the dog settle on command and look to you
for guidance. It also teaches you how to be pack leader by assert-
ing your dominance in a humane, loving way.
You can enroll your Boston in puppy kindergarten when he’s
between 10 and 12 weeks old. In most cases, your Boston will have
to complete at least two rounds of vaccinations to participate.
Basic training courses
After your Boston graduates from kindergarten, you can take his
training a step further by participating in basic and intermediate
obedience training. You can also enroll your adult dog in basic and
intermediate obedience training.
Your Boston will learn more specific commands, like Sit, Stay,
Leave It, Take It, Come, and Heel. You’ll get advice on how to
handle problem behaviors, such as digging, barking, and chewing.
These courses are for dogs who are 4 months of age or older.
You can also hire a private trainer to come to your home. Normally
reserved for dogs with severe behavior problems, private training
is done one on one to fit you and your Boston’s needs.
Advanced obedience challenges
For Bostons and their owners who excel at obedience training,
kennel clubs like the American Kennel Club (AKC) offer obedience
competitions that require your Boston to perform specific exer-
cises that illustrate how well he obeys his handler’s commands.
You can also enroll him in the Canine Good Citizen program, which
awards certification for passing a ten-step test. Turn to Chapter 12
for more information about these advanced courses.

Finding the right trainer
Taking your Boston to a puppy kindergarten or dog obedience
class should be a fun and educational experience for both of you.
It gives your pet a chance to socialize with other dogs and learn
how to behave. You can usually find trainers who run these classes
through your veterinarian’s office, through your local pet supply
store, online, or in the phone book.
Before you settle on one trainer, however, you’ll want to visit her
class to observe her in action and make sure you’re comfortable
with the training methods. Here are some things you should look
for when you’re choosing a trainer and class for your Boston:
 An interesting, enjoyable atmosphere: The participants
should be enjoying themselves and having a successful learn-
ing experience. The instructor should be approachable and
encouraging, showing courtesy to the humans and the dogs.
 Informative lessons: A skilled instructor should explain the
day’s lesson and provide clear instructions through written
handouts or demonstrations, give the students plenty of class
time to practice the day’s lesson, and assist the students indi-
vidually with proper techniques.
 Proper training methods: You should be comfortable with the
instructor’s training tools and methods. They should always
be humane and not harmful to your dog or you. Hitting, kick-
ing, electronic devices, or any other training device that
causes harm should not be used.
 Ongoing education: The trainer should be well-informed
about new innovations in dog training and behavior tools and
techniques. Ask if the trainer is a member of any educational
organizations or associations.
 Vaccination requirements: Vaccinations should be required
before any puppy or dog attends the trainer’s class. It pro-
tects you and your dog’s health.
 Positive references: Chat with some current clients, if possi-
ble, after the class. Find out if they’re learning from the
instructor and how their dogs are progressing.
 Satisfaction guarantee: Ask the trainer if she offers some kind
of client satisfaction guarantee with the services. Because of
variables in dog breeding and temperament, and owner com-
mitment and experience, a trainer cannot and should not
guarantee the results of her training, but she should ensure
some type of client satisfaction.

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 151
Establishing a Commanding
Presence
Many different training theories and practices exist today. Trainers
use different approaches to teach dogs how to behave. Some use a
balanced method that incorporates positive reinforcement and
correction. Others use a behavior-driven approach. Successful and
humane methods have positive reinforcement in common.
Positive reinforcement rewards good behavior with treats, praise,
and lots of love. Timing is critical when using this approach.
For example, if you’re teaching your dog the basic Sit command,
you reward him immediately with a treat when he sits correctly.
If he doesn’t sit correctly, you don’t say, “Bad dog,” and smack him
with a newspaper. Instead, you correct the behavior, gently show-
ing him how to sit correctly, and then ask him to sit again. When he
does sit, you reward him with a treat and lots of praise.
You can start boning up on behavior training before your Boston
comes home. Educate yourself by reading books dedicated to posi-
tive training and dog behavior (check out Dog Training For Dummies,
2nd Edition, by Jack and Wendy Volhard [Wiley]). Or if you’re a
more visual learner, you can choose from all sorts of DVDs and
videos to help you with step-by-step training.
When you have your dog at home, you can prepare for puppy
kindergarten by familiarizing yourself and your Boston with the
elementary commands discussed in this section.
Getting started
Before you begin your training session, gather some treats, such as
small chunks of dehydrated meat or cheese. Attach your Boston’s
collar or harness to a 4-foot leash and lead him to an area where
you’ll have plenty of room to work. Plan to dedicate about 20 min-
utes a day to these training sessions, but practice the commands
constantly in your day-to-day activities, and encourage your family
members to do the same.
Begin by teaching your Boston to respond to his name.
1. Standing in front of him, say his name in a fun, upbeat
voice.

Part III: Stepping Out 
152
2. When he looks at you, reward him with lots of praise,
toys, and a small piece of cheese or meat.
If he becomes distracted by a butterfly or a child, repeat
his name and use a gentle nudge with your hand to remind
him to look at you. His eyes should be on you whenever
you say his name.
Practice the name game with your Boston for a few days before
you begin training, and before long, when your Boston hears his
name, he’ll look at you and wait for something to happen.
Settle
The Settle command (see Figure 11-1) shows your Boston that you
are the alpha dog. It teaches him that when you say, “Pete, settle,”
he should calm down and submit to you.
Figure 11-1: Commanding your Boston to settle lets him know that you 
are the alpha dog in the pack.
Here’s an easy way to teach your Boston to settle:
1. Sit in a chair or on the floor, and flip your dog over in
your lap so his belly is up, putting him in a submissive
position.
2. Calmly say, “Pete, settle.”
3. When he relaxes in your arms, say, “Good boy to settle,”
and give him a treat.

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 153
If your dog refuses to settle, use a more direct voice while
gently touching his throat area, similar to the behavior a
mama dog would do to a misbehaving puppy. Because the
throat is a dog’s most vulnerable area, he’ll instinctively
respond.
This command is very useful when your Boston decides to tear
around the house or uncontrollably misbehave. Simply pick up
your dog and issue the command. When he calms down, reward
him with praise and set him free again.
Sit
The Sit command (see Figure 11-2) teaches your dog to hold still
in a sitting position. A very important lesson in self-control, this
command is likely the first one your Boston will learn, and it’s
the cornerstone of many to come.
Figure 11-2: The Sit command requires your dog to hold in a seated 
position. Most other commands begin with your Boston in the sit posture.

The easiest way to teach this command is to use a treat as a lure —
especially because Bostons are motivated by food! Follow these
steps:
1. Stand in front of your dog. Bend down and hold a treat
over his nose.
2. Say in a firm voice, “Pete, sit.” As you say those words,
move the treat up over his head toward his tail.
The dog will follow the treat with his eyes and head, which
will cause his rear to lower to a seated position.
If he doesn’t sit, show him what you want by gently push-
ing his rump down and saying, “Pete, sit.”
3. Praise him when he does as he’s asked (whether on his
own or with a little help from you), saying “Good dog,”
and reward him immediately with a treat.
Do this repeatedly until your Boston understands that
obeying brings a reward — your praise!
Down
The Down command teaches your Boston to lie down and remain
in place. You can use this command when you want your Boston to
lie down on his bed and play with a toy or to stay away from the
table when you and your family are eating.
1. Begin by telling your dog to sit.
2. Holding a treat in front of his nose, say, “Pete, down,”
and move the treat down to the floor in front of his paws.
As his nose follows the treat, he will lie down.
3. Praise him and give him the treat.
Repeat this process until he’s got Down down.
Stay
The Stay command (see Figure 11-3), used with both the Sit and
the Down commands, trains your Boston to stay in place until you
release him. The Sit-Stay command is for shorter periods of time;
the Down-Stay command is for longer periods. Here’s how to teach
your Boston the Stay command:
Part III: Stepping Out 
154

Figure 11-3: The Stay command trains your Boston to remain in place 
until you release him.
1. Start by facing your dog and telling him to sit.
2. Hold an open palm facing his nose, and say, “Pete, stay.”
3. Slowly take one step backward, and stay there.
4. If your Boston stays in place, go back to him after a few
seconds and reward him with treats and praise.
If your Boston fidgets and comes toward you, enlist the
help of a friend or relative. Have her hold your Boston’s
leash gently but firmly after you give the command. Repeat
the process until your Boston is trained and stays in place
for longer periods of time. Be sure to heap plenty of praise
on him through these lessons.
5. Gradually increase the time your Boston must stay put
and your distance from him as your Boston gets the hang
of this command.
Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 155

Part III: Stepping Out 
156
Come
Teach the Come command after the Stay command — it’s one of
the most important commands to master. Your Boston should
learn to come to you immediately the first time you call him.
Learning to obey this command will keep your dog out of danger.
Luckily, this command is easy to teach. Here’s how:
1. Start with your Boston on a fairly short leash. Ask him to
sit and stay.
2. Using a treat as a lure, say, “Pete, come,” and walk 
backward.
This will cause your dog to follow you.
3. Reward and praise him when he reaches you.
Continue doing this with a longer and longer leash, even one up to
20 feet long. Before long, your dog will run right to you every time
you call him to come, which is exactly what you want.
Leave It and Take It
The Leave It and Take It commands (see Figure 11-4) teach your
Boston that you’re the boss. You tell him what to play with and
what to leave alone. This exercise is particularly useful if he
decides to chew your favorite shoes. To teach this command:
Figure 11-4: Leave It (a) and Take It (b) are commands that show your 
Boston that you’re in charge.
1. Tell your dog to sit and stay.
b
a

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 157
2. Put a treat in your hand and show it to him, saying,
“Pete, leave it.” Make him wait for a few seconds.
3. Say, “OK, take it,” letting your dog have the treat.
When he has mastered Leave It and Take It with you holding the
treats, try the same exercise, but this time place the treat on the
ground. Challenge him even more by using a toy instead of a treat.
Heel
Teaching your dog to heel (walk nicely by your side; see Figure 11-5)
will make walking on a leash a fun and enjoyable experience for
both of you.
Figure 11-5: A Boston who can heel is a pleasure to walk with.

Part III: Stepping Out 
158
Here’s how to teach your dog the Heel command:
1. Connect the leash to your Boston’s collar or harness. Put
your right hand through the loop and hold the leash with
your left hand.
2. Bend down and show the dog the treats with your
right hand.
3. Move the treat slowly in front of him as if you’re leading
him by the nose, backing up.
4. Continue walking backward, all the while holding the
treat where your dog can see it. As he follows you, praise
and reward him.
5. When your dog follows you nicely, turn so that you and
your dog are walking side by side, with your dog on your
left side.
Dogs walk on the left side in shows and other competitions.
Correcting Behavior Gone Bad
Part of being a well-mannered and obedient dog includes following
the rules of the household, set down by you. You are your dog’s
pack leader, so it’s up to you to teach your Boston the correct way
to act in the house and with other people. Occasionally, though,
problems can occur.
Some of the behaviors that we perceive as “problems” are natural
to dogs. For example, Bostons are terriers, and terriers love to dig.
Dogs communicate by barking. When their baby teeth fall out, they
want to chew to relieve the discomfort. These are all normal dog
behaviors. But when temporary behaviors become habits, or when
they’re done inappropriately, the action needs to be corrected.
In the previous section, you discovered how to use positive rein-
forcement to teach your Boston basic commands, such as Sit and
Stay. In correction training, you use positive reinforcement, but
you also correct your dog when he does something he shouldn’t.
You’ll need to correct the bad behavior and reinforce the good
behavior. You can do this in several ways, depending on the partic-
ular action that you’re trying to correct.
Correction should never include physical punishment. Harming
your Boston in any way is inhumane, and it can create an animal
that fears people. Correction, instead, involves getting your
Boston’s attention and stopping the behavior at that moment.

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 159
One tool that you’ll use is your voice. The tone of your voice com-
municates emotion or feeling to your dog. An upbeat higher-pitched
tone communicates happiness or excitement. A lower-pitched gut-
tural tone communicates anger or sternness. Your Boston will
respond to these sounds as he would to his mother or pack leader.
When you’re praising your dog for obeying the Sit command, for
example, you use an upbeat happy tone. Conversely, when you’re
correcting your dog for barking inappropriately, you use the gut-
tural warning tone. You’re not speaking more loudly to the dog,
you’re using different tones. This means even a soft-spoken person
can correct his dog.
Another tool you’ll need to master is consistency. When everyone
who comes into contact with your Boston requires the same
behavior from him, he won’t get confused.
Before you begin corrective training, however, check with your vet-
erinarian. Some bad behavior, such as chronic house-soiling or
chewing, can be caused by medical conditions. Other troublesome
behaviors can be exacerbated by your Boston’s diet or lack of
exercise. Get a clean bill of health, and then begin training.
Barking
Dogs bark to communicate. From protecting their homes from
strangers to trying to get your attention, barking is a natural dog
behavior. Guarding the home can be a positive reason to bark, and
it’s likely that your Boston will vocalize only when he needs to.
Before you begin corrective training, you’ll want to determine why
your dog is barking:
 Do you pick him up every time he barks? Then your Boston
has trained you! If he barks, he’ll get your attention.
 Does he bark when someone comes to the door? If so, he’s
protecting his territory.
 Does he bark when nobody’s home? He may be suffering
from separation anxiety.
After you’ve narrowed down some reasons why your dog barks,
you can start correcting his behavior.
When your dog barks, don’t yell at him. To your Boston, yelling
sounds like barking, and he’ll think that you’re telling him some-
thing! Instead, ignore the barking. This may sound difficult, but if
your dog realizes that he won’t get any attention when he barks,
he’s more likely to stop the behavior. Reward him for not barking
by saying, “Pete, good dog for being quiet.”

Part III: Stepping Out 
160
Enlist a friend to come to your door and ring the doorbell. Wait
until your Boston stops barking, say, “Good quiet,” and reinforce
the quiet behavior by praising and treating your dog. Your Boston
will soon learn that staying quiet will earn him praise.
You also want to practice this nonbarking behavior in public. Grab
a bag of treats and put your Boston on his leash. Walk to the park
or someplace where he barks at people or other dogs. Use the
“Pete, quiet” command, and if he obeys, lavish him with praise and
treats.
Biting
Many horrifying dog attacks have been reported in the media.
Although these reports tend to revolve around bigger dogs, even a
small dog needs be trained to never bear his teeth, touch teeth to
skin or clothing, or bite. This is one of the most important lessons
you can teach your Boston.
Mouthing is normal behavior in puppies. Between 4 to 12 weeks old,
your dog learns bite inhibition from his mother and littermates.
He learns the amount of mouth pressure he can use without causing
pain or harm by playing with his brothers and sisters, skirmishing,
and testing how hard he can bite without causing a squeal. If he is
removed from his littermates before learning this inhibition, it is
up to you to teach him. Start your “no bite” training as soon as
possible to ensure your dog doesn’t develop his mouthing habit
into something dangerous. Your Boston should know not to bite by
the time he is 18 weeks old.
When your puppy nips or bites you, or even just mouths you, say,
“Pete, no bite.” Stop playing with him and walk away. Do not allow
your dog to nip at your heels or chase your feet. This will teach
him that biting and nipping result in withdrawal of your attention.
If your Boston continues to use his mouth and bite, even after your
consistent training, discuss the situation with your veterinarian.
He may be able to recommend a professional trainer or animal
behaviorist to help you deal with the problem.
Chewing
Chewing, like digging or barking, is something dogs do. When they’re
between 3 and 6 months old, puppies begin teething, and with
teething comes chewing. They will chew everything and anything.
As their baby teeth fall out and their adult teeth erupt, chewing

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 161
relieves the discomfort. Puppies go through a second chewing
phase when they’re between 7 and 9 months old as a part of
exploring their territory.
Unfortunately, puppies develop a fondness for chewing during
these phases. They find out how much fun chewing can be!
It relieves tension and anxiety, and it makes their sore gums feel
better. For adult dogs, chewing massages their gums, removes
plaque (clear buildup on the teeth), and occupies their time.
Chewing the wrong things, however, can be destructive and 
dangerous. Your Boston can swallow something poisonous, or
something small can get lodged in his throat.
Because chewing is just part of being a dog, your Boston should
have his own things to chew from the very beginning. Instead of
giving your dog old slippers or waiting until the improper behavior
starts, give him his own size-appropriate chew toys, such as hard
rubber balls stuffed with treats, nylon bones, or a rope tug toy.
Limit his toys to a few; you don’t want your Boston to think every-
thing is for his chewing pleasure!
To help him resist temptation, put away items you don’t want
chewed, especially ones that can be harmful to your Boston.
Those include children’s toys with small removable pieces that
can be ingested, household cleaners and personal hygiene items,
insect and rodent traps, electrical cords, and hobby supplies.
Praise your Boston often when he chews the right objects. If your
dog finds something else to gnaw on, take the object away and give
the dog one of his toys, saying, “Pete, good toy.”
Digging
Bostons are terriers, and terriers dig. They’re bred to hunt vermin,
and often those vermin live in holes in the ground. Some dogs dig
to create a cool and cozy place to relax, and some dig to get out of
a confined area. Instead of trying to teach your Boston not to dig,
give him a specific place to dig. It will appease those digging ten-
dencies and burn off some excess energy.
Choose a section of your yard and designate it his digging area.
Loosen the dirt, making sure it has no pesticides, pieces of glass, or
other dangers hidden within. Introduce your Boston to the digging
area by bringing him over and placing a toy or a treat on the dirt.
You can even bury a biscuit or two after he gets used to the area.

Part III: Stepping Out 
162
When you see your Boston digging in the right area, praise him,
saying, “Pete, good dog for digging here.” If he digs in other places
and you catch him in the act, move him to the right area and praise
him when he digs there. Bury the other holes and, if you have to,
lay some wire mesh over them to discourage further digging.
Jumping up
In Boston language, jumping up means, “I’m a happy dog,” and
“Pay attention to me!” Jumping up means your dog wants to be
picked up and made the center of attention. Thankfully, Bostons
aren’t giant beasts who can knock houseguests over, but this
behavior should still be prohibited.
It’s imperative not to acknowledge your dog when he jumps up.
Do not pet him or pick him up, as tempting as it may be! Instead,
tell your Boston to sit. Only after he obeys should you pet him.
Eventually he’ll learn that to receive the attention he wants, he’ll
have to sit, not jump up.
Your Boston also needs to learn to sit for other people. Use the
leash if you must, and when your guests come to the door and
your Boston jumps up, say, “Pete, no jumping,” followed by, “Pete,
sit.” When the dog sits for a period of time, allow your guests to
praise him and give him the attention he wants.
This correction must be done consistently by your family and
friends. Your Boston must learn that the only way he’ll get atten-
tion is if he sits first. Praise the dog lavishly every time he does it
correctly. Soon, your pup will sit before every greeting.
House-soiling
You’ve been taking your Boston puppy to his bathroom area regu-
larly and letting him relieve himself after every meal, playtime, and
nap. Your dog is becoming housetrained (see Chapter 9). But then
he makes a mistake. What do you do?
The act of going to the bathroom isn’t the mistake; going in the
wrong place is the problem. So if you catch your pup in the act, say
in a corrective tone, “Pete, no,” and immediately take him to his
bathroom area and let him finish his business there. Then praise
your Boston and celebrate that he is going outside.
Clean the soiled area with white vinegar or an over-the-counter pet
stain cleaner. Dogs tend to continue soiling in areas that smell like
feces or urine, so removing all traces of the accident will prevent
your dog from using that area again.

Chapter 11: Training and Behavior 163
Don’t correct the dog after he makes a mistake — he can’t under-
stand the connection between the correction and the mistake. Also,
don’t rub your dog’s face in the mess. It’s a needless punishment,
and your dog will think that you’re mad because he eliminated,
not because he relieved himself somewhere he shouldn’t. Instead,
encourage and praise your Boston even more when he goes where
he’s supposed to.
You’ll also want to keep a close eye on your Boston. If you know
where your dog is, he can’t make a mistake. A circling and sniffing
dog means he’s searching for a bathroom, so ask him in an upbeat
happy voice, “Pete, do you have to go potty?” When he runs to the
door, take him out and praise him after he goes.
You can also use your dog’s kennel to teach him to hold his blad-
der. Because dogs won’t soil the area where they sleep, keep your
pup in his kennel (no more than two hours at a time) and let him
out to use the bathroom. Flip to Chapter 9 for crate-training tips.
Calling in the Professional
Sometimes your Boston’s bad habits are just too much for you to
handle. You’ve tried positive reinforcement. You’ve tried corrective
approaches. But your Boston still won’t stop barking or jumping
up on your houseguests.
When is it time to seek professional help?
 If your dog is exhibiting aggressive behavior, such as biting or
showing teeth
 If his destructive chewing is out of control
 If the dog cannot be housetrained
 If he will not obey basic commands, even after puppy kinder-
garten and obedience training
 If, for any reason, you feel like you can’t control your Boston,
and his safety or the safety of others is at risk
The most effective way to get your misbehaving Boston back on
track is to enlist the help of a professional dog trainer.
Professional dog trainers can be found through referrals from your
veterinarian, breeder, or Boston Terrier club. You can also find
them through organizations, such as the Association of Pet Dog
Trainers (www.apdt.com) or the Certification Council for
Professional Dog Trainers (www.ccpdt.org), that allow you to
search for trainers by area.

To ensure that you and your dog will get the best possible training,
select a trainer who has been certified by the CCPDT. To earn the
certification, trainers must demonstrate their dog-training knowl-
edge and experience, and they must continue to educate them-
selves about the latest in training techniques and equipment.
Here’s how a trainer can help:
 House calls: A trainer can come to your home and evaluate
your dog, watch your interactions, and develop a strategy to
correct problem behavior. She can meet with you regularly
and offer guidance and assistance when needed.
 Training facility: You can also take your dog to the trainer’s
facility. Your Boston may respond better to training when he’s
away from his territory.
 Group dynamics: A trainer will also encourage you to partici-
pate in group training exercises, which allows you and your
pup to interact with other dogs and their owners.
 Skilled experience: Because a trainer has seen such a range of
problem behaviors, she knows how to correct your dog’s bad
habits. She also knows when to enlist the help of a veterinar-
ian or veterinary specialist who can prescribe helpful drugs.

Taking Training to 
the Next Level
In This Chapter
 Training your Boston for sport and obedience
 Joining a flyball or freestyle club
 Becoming a therapy dog
 Introducing dog shows and conformation trials
T
raining your Boston to sit and stay is one thing, but teaching
your pup to strut in a show ring, deliver a smile to hospital-
bound seniors, or weave in and out of challenging obstacles in an
agility course takes her training to the next level.
Being as high-energy as any terrier, Bostons enjoy healthy doses of
organized fun and frolic. Participating in one of the many events
available to canines and their caretakers keeps her challenged and
sharp — and her exuberance in check.
This chapter explores obedience, sport, and agility trials that will
challenge you and your pup. You can also find out how your
Boston can become a therapy dog and bring her gentlemanly joy to
those who need it most. Finally, you discover the ins and outs of
conformation trials (also known as dog shows). Chances are, your
dog won’t be able to compete in a conformation trial because com-
petitors can’t be spayed or neutered, but you can still gain lots of
insight and information by attending the show as a spectator.
Training for Sport
Bostons love to compete in challenges that test their instincts and
trained skills. The American Kennel Club offers all sorts of different
activities for dogs of all breeds and groups, but the Boston quali-
fies for five: obedience, Canine Good Citizen, tracking, agility, and

AKC Rally. These competitions center on how well your dog per-
forms based on her natural abilities and your (or your handler’s)
instruction.
For the well-behaved Boston: 
Canine Good Citizen program
Begun in 1989, the AKC’s Canine Good Citizen (CGC) program is
designed to recognize dogs who demonstrate excellent manners
at home and in the community. Often held in conjunction with
or after puppy kindergarten and basic obedience training (see
Chapter 11), the CGC program tests a dog’s ability to pass a series
of obedience tests (listed below). Dogs who pass earn a certificate
from the AKC and a dog tag inscribed with “Canine Good Citizen.”
The CGC program forms the foundation for many other kennel club
and service dog activities and programs, including obedience
trials, agility, tracking, and serving as a therapy dog. As you and
your dog work through the tests and training, you solidify your
bond with your Boston. Plus, the satisfaction of achieving a goal
like this will likely lead you to continue training your Boston for
other sporting events.
Part III: Stepping Out 
166
Unregistered? No problem!
To participate in obedience, tracking, or agility trials, or to become a Canine Good
Citizen, your Boston must be registered with the American Kennel Club. What if you
want to compete, but your dog isn’t registered?
Sometimes, people adopt purebred dogs who can’t be registered with the AKC. The
dogs may have unregistered parents, their papers may have been lost, or they may
have been abandoned and adopted by new owners from an animal shelter. They’re
still purebred dogs, but they aren’t eligible for registration.
In cases like these, the dog owner can apply for the Indefinite Listing Privilege pro-
gram. It allows purebred dogs to participate in almost all AKC events, including agility,
obedience, tracking, rally, and other group-specific trials. After she is enrolled in
the ILP program, the dog is given an ILP number, which can be used in place of an
AKC number on entry forms.
Conformation trials, however, are one event in which an unregistered dog can’t par-
ticipate. To compete in a dog show, the dog must be intact (not spayed or neutered);
to enroll in the ILP program, the applicant must show proof from a veterinarian that
the dog has been spayed or neutered.
For more information about the Indefinite Listing Privilege program, go to www.
akc.org/reg/ilpex.cfm.

Any dog is eligible to participate in the CGC program, so even
mixed breeds can earn their CGC certificate. All ages are welcome
to join in the fun, too, though puppies who pass the test are
encouraged to take the test again when they’re adults.
To qualify to take the test, you must first sign the AKC’s Responsible
Dog Owners Pledge, which affirms that you agree to care for the
dog’s health needs, safety, exercise, training, and quality of life.
It also affirms that you agree to be responsible to the community
by cleaning up after your dog and never letting her infringe on the
rights of others.
After you sign the pledge, you’re ready to take the test. You’ll need
to outfit your dog with a well-fitting buckle or slip collar made of
leather, fabric, or chain. The test facilitator will provide a 20-foot
leash for the test.
To earn her CGC certificate, your Boston has to successfully
demonstrate the following ten test items:
 Accepting a friendly stranger: Allows a friendly stranger to
approach you and talk to you.
 Sitting politely for petting: Allows a friendly stranger to pet
her while she’s out with you.
 Appearance and grooming: Allows a stranger, such as a vet-
erinarian or groomer, to examine and handle her. This test
also demonstrates your dedication to your dog’s care.
 Out for a walk: Showing that you are in control, she walks
attentively beside you while you hold a loose leash and make
right, left, and about turns.
 Walking through a crowd: Demonstrates her ability to walk
through a crowd of pedestrians.
 Staying in place: Shows that she obeys your Sit and Stay 
commands.
 Coming when called: Shows that she obeys your Come 
command.
 Reacting to another dog: Demonstrates that she behaves
appropriately around other dogs.
 Reaction to distraction: Shows that she reacts confidently to
distracting situations.
 Supervised separation: Demonstrates that she can be left
alone with another person and maintain good manners.
You can find CGC training and testing programs through your
kennel club, trainer, or some pet specialty stores.

Do as I say: Obedience trials
If your Boston excelled in her puppy kindergarten class, basic obe-
dience training course, and Canine Good Citizen test, consider
enrolling her in obedience competitions. Obedience trials, which
were acknowledged by the AKC around 1935, require your Boston
to perform specific exercises that show how well she obeys your
commands.
AKC-registered dogs who are at least 6 months old can participate.
To enter an obedience trial, you must submit an official AKC entry
form to the trial secretary. After the entry period closes, you’ll
receive a judging schedule for each class.
Obedience trials are broken into two categories:
 All-breed obedience trials, the most common trials, are open
to all breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
 Specialty trials are limited to specific breeds or varieties of
one breed.
Both types of trials have three graduating levels of competition:
novice, open, and utility. Each level requires the dogs to complete
a series of exercises, which become more challenging as they
progress. By level, the exercises include:
 Novice: For dogs new to obedience trials, the exercises include
heel on leash and figure eight, heel free, stand for examina-
tion, recall, long sit (1 minute), and long down (3 minutes).
 Open: This level is comprised of more-complicated exercises
that prove the dog can obey verbal and signal commands,
including heel free and figure eight, drop on recall, retrieve on
flat, retrieve over high jump, broad jump, long sit (3 minutes),
and long down (5 minutes).
 Utility: The highest level of competition, these exercises
demonstrate obedience at its best, including signal exercise,
scent discrimination, directed retrieve, moving stand and
examination, and directed jumping.
In each level, the dog earns points when she successfully com-
pletes an exercise. She must earn at least half of the possible
points in each exercise, earning a total score of at least 170 out of a
possible 200. Each time your dog achieves this goal, she earns one
leg toward her title in that particular level. After completing three
legs in one level, your dog earns an obedience title.
Your Boston can progress through six different obedience titles:
Part III: Stepping Out 
168

 Companion Dog (CD): Earned when your dog has received
three qualifying scores, or legs, in the Novice class.
 Companion Dog Excellent (CDX): Earned when your dog has
earned three qualifying scores in the Open class.
 Utility Dog (UD): Earned when your dog has earned three
qualifying scores in the Utility class.
 Utility Dog Excellent (UDX): Earned when dogs with UD titles
earn qualifying scores at ten trials in Open B and Utility B.
 Obedience Trial Champion (OTCH): Earned when dogs with
UD titles win 100 points and a first place in Utility B and
Open B, plus a third first-place win in either class.
 National Obedience Champion (NOC): Awarded annually by
the AKC to a dog who wins the AKC National Obedience
Invitational.
As with the other training competitions, you can learn more
through your local Boston Terrier or kennel club.
Follow that scent: Tracking
Tracking, a type of obedience trial, tests the dog’s ability to recognize
and trace a human’s scent, much like dogs do during search-and-
rescue operations. Just because your Boston has a short snout
doesn’t mean she can’t track a scent!
The sport, originally called Obedience Test Field Trials, began in
1936 as part of the Obedience Trial’s Utility class. Since then, the
sport’s tests have been refined to include more specific tracking
exercises and adjusted to account for the ever-diminishing fields
and open spaces.
Tracking tests are typically held in an open field, with the excep-
tion of the Variable Surface Tracking exercise that requires dogs to
follow a scent through urban and wilderness environments.
Today, three tracking titles are available:
 Tracking Dog (TD): Dogs earn their TD title by following a
440- to 500-yard track with three to five changes in direction.
The track is aged 30 minutes to two hours before the dog
begins scenting. The goal is to locate the object that the track-
layer left behind.
 Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX): Upon earning their TD title,
dogs earn their TDX title by following a longer (800 to 1,000
yards), older (three to five hours old) track that has five to
seven directional changes and human cross tracks.
Chapter 12: Taking Training to the Next Level 169

 Variable Surface Tracking (VST): A dog who earns her VST
title has proved that she can follow a three- to five-hour-old
track through an urban or wilderness setting.
 Champion Tracker (CT): The dog who earns TD, TDX, and
VST titles bears the CT title.
Your kennel club can provide more information about training for
and participating in these challenging competitions.
Boston be nimble, Boston 
be quick: Agility trials
What better way for a Boston to expend some energy than to par-
ticipate in agility trials! This fast-growing canine sport challenges
your dog’s nimble feet as she runs through a series of timed obsta-
cle courses. Your dog responds to your cues as she races through
jumps, tunnels, weave poles, and other obstacles.
The sport began in England in 1978. It made its official appearance
in the United States when the AKC held its first agility trial in 1994.
Part of the lure of this fun sport is that dogs of all sizes can com-
pete. The judges adjust the obstacles’ heights and vary the time
allowance depending on the breed. People of all ages can compete,
too, making it a sport for just about any fancier.
Part III: Stepping Out 
170
Rally together
Are you ready for some fun?
If you and your Boston think you want to try your hand — or paw — at agility or
obedience trials but you’re not sure if you’re ready yet, AKC Rally is for you.
Providing a link between the Canine Good Citizen program and agility or obedience trials,
rally challenges you and your dog to race through a series of obstacles and exercises.
Rally allows you and your Boston to move at your own pace through the course,
which typically includes 10 to 20 stations with signs that tell you what to do. Scoring
is not as rigorous as in traditional obedience, but communication and teamwork
between you and your dog are highly encouraged.
To be eligible to participate in rally, your Boston needs to be registered with the AKC
and at least 6 months old. For more information, visit the AKC Web site (www.akc.org)
or talk to your Boston club representative.

You and your Boston can compete in two agility classes:
 Standard Class: The Standard class features contact objects,
such as an A-frame and a seesaw. Each obstacle has an area
painted on the object, and the dog must place at least one
paw in the area to complete the obstacle.
 Jumpers with Weaves: The Jumpers with Weaves class has
only jumps, tunnels, and weave poles.
Both the Standard and Jumpers with Weaves classes have four
increasing levels of difficulty: novice, open, excellent, and master.
After a dog achieves Standard Master and Jumper Master, she can
compete for the Master Agility Championship title.
Practicing for this event can be a challenge because the obstacles
take up considerable space. But clubs across the country conduct
practice matches, so if this competition interests you, talk to your
local kennel club for more information.
Becoming a Therapy Dog
For those Bostons (and their owners) who enjoy giving back to
their community, becoming a therapy dog is an opportunity to
bring joy to hospital- or nursing home–bound children and seniors.
Well-behaved Bostons who have their Canine Good Citizen certifi-
cate are on their way to becoming therapy dogs. Different from
service dogs that assist blind or otherwise disabled owners, some
therapy dogs make informal visits to people in nursing homes and
hospitals, while others participate in more structured sessions with
people who are receiving physical therapy or coordination lessons.
Organizations such as Therapy Dogs International and the Delta
Society evaluate potential therapy dogs and train those who show
promise. Therapy dogs must
 Display sound temperament
 Be patient, confident, and at ease in a variety of situations,
from busy hospital wards to sedate retirement homes
 Thrive on human contact, because one of their main purposes
is to allow people to pet and dote on them
The organizations have different requirements for screening, 
testing, and certifying dogs to be therapy dogs. If you and your
Boston are interested in pursuing this altruistic endeavor, talk to
representatives from your local kennel club for details.
Chapter 12: Taking Training to the Next Level 171

Anecdotal and clinical evidence has shown that when people hold
or pet an animal, their blood pressure drops, and their stress
decreases. Pets can also pull people out of depression. Your
Boston brings you joy at home, so why not share that joy with
others in need?
Having Some Organized Fun
Outside the AKC or other kennel club circuit, you can engage your
dog in organized and spontaneous sporting events. You can bring
your Boston along to just about any activity you can imagine.
Consider playing a fun game of Frisbee or fetch in the local dog
park, hiking some scenic trails, or trolling the beach for shells with
your best canine companion. It doesn’t get much better!
Two organized sports that you and your Boston may find fun and
challenging are flyball, a timed relay race, and freestyle, a dance
competition.

172
Making a difference
As Jasmine, a Boston Terrier therapy dog from New Jersey, approached the myriad
firefighters, counselors, Red Cross volunteers, and other relief workers after the
World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001, she knew what she needed to
do: offer them comfort, compassion, and a furry shoulder to cry on.
Her owner, Nicole Hanson, recalls the therapy dogs’ impact: “Workers, military per-
sonnel, Red Cross and Salvation Army volunteers, American Airlines staff, and mil-
itary chaplains alike seemed to ‘recharge’ with the dogs.”
Bacon, another Boston Terrier therapy dog from Florida, provided the same loving sup-
port to Hurricane Katrina survivors in New Orleans in 2005. While children, still in shock
from the traumatic events, mourned the loss of their homes and loved ones, Bacon
brought a smile to their faces as they poured out their hearts to the canine counselor.
“The way the children were responding to the dogs was so positive. Talking to and
touching the dogs was a tremendous help,” says Bacon’s owner, Janet Morgan.
“Bacon was just delighted with all the children.”
Jasmine and Bacon approached these disasters with a wag of their short little tails,
eager to help in any way possible. If your Boston shows a spark of compassion,
behaves well with strangers, and possesses a true gentleman’s demeanor, consider
applying for a therapy dog program in your area.

Why not try flyball?
Flyball is a timed relay race that pits two teams of four dogs against
each other. In this game, at the signal, the first dog must run over
a series of hurdles to a box of tennis balls and jump on a lever to
send a ball flying. The dog then catches the ball and runs it to her
owner. Then the next dog goes. This fun activity can burn a lot of
Boston energy!
Your dog can earn ten titles in this fast-action sport, including
Flyball Dog (FD), Flyball Dog Excellent (FDX), Flyball Dog Champion
(FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), Flyball Master Excellent (FMX), Flyball
Master Champion (FMCh), ONYX (named after the first dog to
reach 20,000 points), and Flyball Grand Champion (FGDCh-30).
A group of trainers in Southern California invented Flyball in the late
1960s and 1970s. By the 1980s, the sport enjoyed huge popularity,
thanks in part to a spot on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
The first flyball organization, the North American Flyball Association
(NAFA), formed in 1984 to design uniform competition rules and
tout the sport as one that could be enjoyed by virtually every dog.
The sport currently enjoys international representation, with clubs in
the United States, South Africa, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
If your Boston loves to catch tennis balls, seek out a flyball club
in your area. You can find a list of clubs on the NAFA Web site
(www.flyball.org) or on the United Flyball League International
Web site (www.u-fli.com).
Dancing with the dogs: 
Canine freestyle
Canine freestyle is a human-dog choreographed dance that incorpo-
rates obedience commands like Sit and Stay. The object of the
sport is for you and your dog to display innovative and original
dance using movements to showcase teamwork, creativity, cos-
tumes, and style while interpreting the theme of the music.
Begun in the late 1980s in Canada, freestyle made its way to the
United States in the 1990s, appearing at various demonstrations
across the country. By the mid ’90s, competitive teams developed,
and major sponsors joined in the fun. Two approaches to the
sport — and two organizations — began to diverge: the Canine
Freestyle Federation (CFF), which emphasized the dogs and their
movement; and the Musical Canine Sports International (MCSI),
which emphasized the handler’s costuming and movement.
Chapter 12: Taking Training to the Next Level 173

Today, several organizations regulate competitive canine freestyle,
including the CFF, MCSI, World Canine Freestyle Organization, and
Musical Dog Sport Association. Competitions differ from group to
group, but generally, titles are awarded to high scores in technical
merit and artistic impression.
Attending a Conformation Trial
If you’re like most Boston owners, you probably think that your
dog looks perfect — or very close to perfect! Her markings make
her unique, her temperament is top-notch, and her conformation is
in a class by itself.
Conformation trials, or dog shows, give you the opportunity to see
and interact firsthand with other beautiful purebred dogs. Because
you’ve most likely had your Boston spayed (or neutered), she is
ineligible to compete against the other four-legged beauties. But
you can attend dog shows to appreciate the sport and learn more
about the various breeds.
One of the most well-known conformation dog shows, the
Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, held annually at Madison
Square Garden in New York, has been showcasing the best of the
best since 1877. The show, which was initiated by a group of hunters
who frequently met at the Westminster Hotel in Manhattan, origi-
nated as a sport for hunting dogs. The men formed the Westminster
Kennel Club, one of the first kennel clubs in the United States with
the purpose of showing dogs.
Bostons who compete in dog shows are judged based on how
well they meet the breed standard, which is the ideal physical rep-
resentation of the breed as described by the American Kennel
Club-sanctioned Boston Terrier Club of America. You can read
more about the Boston breed standard in Chapter 2.
Conformation dog shows are organized three ways:
 All-breed shows: The type most often televised, these shows
offer competitions for more than 150 breeds and varieties of
dogs recognized by one of the major dog registries, such as
the AKC.
 Specialty shows: These shows, often hosted by breed clubs,
highlight one specific breed or varieties of a breed. For exam-
ple, Bostons can complete in the Boston Terrier Club of
America Specialty.
Part III: Stepping Out 
174

 Group shows: These shows are limited to dogs within a partic-
ular group, such as the Non-sporting, Hound, or Herding
Group. Bostons fall within the Non-sporting Group, so they
would compete with the Bichon Frise, Lhasa Apso, and Poodle.
The judges who critique the dogs must be experts in the breeds in
which they are judging. During conformation, judges
 Examine the dogs from head to toe
 Feel their bones, muscles, and coat texture
 Examine the dog’s teeth, eyes, and ears
 View each dog’s profile for overall balance
 Watch the dogs strut their stuff to check their gait
After the judges have evaluated the dogs, they present awards to
the best examples of the breed based on the breed standard. The
dogs don’t don a tiara and cape, but they do take home points
toward their titles and colorful ribbons to decorate their walls.
Being an informed spectator
Usually publicized in the local media and hosted by an area all-
breed or breed-specific club, dog shows can introduce you to the
world of showing, give you an opportunity to meet with other 
purebred-dog owners, and allow you to talk to the club’s represen-
tatives about how you can join.
As a spectator, make the most of attending a show by remembering
these tips:
 Go to learn. Observe the participants’ etiquette. Marvel at
the different dog varieties. Talk to as many breeders and han-
dlers as possible. Speak with other spectators and swap fun
stories about your Boston. Take the opportunity to learn as
much as you can about the dog fancy.
 Visit the grooming area. For grooming suggestions, talk to
the professional groomers about how to keep your Boston
looking her best.
 Do not touch a dog before speaking with her owner or 
handler first. No matter how tempting it may be to wish 
a pup good luck and stroke her coat, ask for permission.
You wouldn’t want to muss a dog’s coat right before she hits
the show floor!
Chapter 12: Taking Training to the Next Level 175

 Wear comfortable clothing and shoes. You’ll be doing a lot of
walking and standing while watching the various matches,
and seating may be limited, depending on the venue.
 If you take your child to the show, keep a constant eye on
him. Do not allow him to grab a dog’s tail, reach his hand into
a kennel, or approach a dog on her way to the show floor.
Instruct him to respect the dogs and their handlers at all times.
 Chat with vendors. Dog shows typically host a number of
vendors who sell all sorts of merchandise, from Boston-
specific gifts, food, and treats to toys, beds, and dog houses.
You’ll also find representatives from area kennel clubs and
sporting clubs. Talk to them about how to get involved.
After attending several dog shows, you’ll want to join your local
Boston Terrier club (if you haven’t already!). Not only is the group
an excellent resource for health and care information, but it also
provides a wealth of information about other competitions in
which you and your spayed Boston can participate.
Understanding the points
In dog shows, a competitor’s goal is to rack up points toward his
dog’s AKC championship or Champion of Record title. After the
dog earns her Champion of Record title, she can compete for the
Best of Breed title, in the group competition and, ultimately, for the
Best in Show award.
To earn a Champion of Record title, a dog must earn 15 points,
including two majors (wins of 3, 4, or 5 points) awarded by at least
three different judges. The number of points awarded in any match
depends on the number of dogs in the competition. The maximum
number that can be earned is 5; the minimum is 1.
Here’s how a dog show works:
Dogs earning points toward their championships are first sepa-
rated by breed, and then by gender. For example, Bostons are 
separated from the other breeds and then divided into male and
female groups. The males and females are broken down further
into six classes:
 Puppy: Dogs between 6 and 12 months old who are not yet
champions
 12 to 18 months: Dogs between 12 and 18 months old who are
not yet champions
Part III: Stepping Out 
176

 Novice: Dogs 6 months of age and older who have not won the
Novice, Bred by Exhibitor, American Bred, or Open class, and
have not earned points toward their championship
 Bred by Exhibitor: Dogs who are shown by their owner and
breeder who are not yet champions
 American Bred: Dogs who are mated and born in the United
States who are not yet champions
 Open: For any dog at least 6 months old
The first-place winners of the classes then compete against each
other to determine which is the best of the winning dogs. The
judges award championship points (from 1 to 5, depending on the
number of dogs in the competition) to the best male (Winners Dog)
and the best female (Winners Bitch).
The Winners Dog and the Winners Bitch then compete with the
dogs who have already earned their Champion of Record title.
This competition is called Best of the Breed Competition.
Typically, three awards are during the Best of Breed Competition:
 Best of Breed: The dog deemed best in its breed category
 Best of Winners: The dog judged better between the Winners
Dog and the Winners Bitch
 Best of Opposite Sex: The best dog who is the opposite sex of
the Best of Breed
Only the Best of Breed advances to compete in the Group competi-
tions. Group winners then compete against each other for the ulti-
mate prize: Best in Show.
Competition for children and dogs
Junior Showmanship classes, which are open to children ages 9 to
18 years old, offer the opportunity for budding fanciers to develop
their handling skills, learn about good sportsmanship, and learn
about dogs and dog shows.
Leonard Brumby Sr. and a group of dog handlers conceived
Children’s Handling in the late 1920s. Today the competition is
known as Junior Showmanship, and it allows children to be judged
on how well they present their dogs.
Chapter 12: Taking Training to the Next Level 177

The competitions include handling and performance events, 
similar to those offered for adults. Judges evaluate the children’s
handling methods, not the animals, though the dogs do need to be
registered with the AKC.
As with adult shows, several classes and subclasses divide the
competitors. The children are broken into Novice and Open
classes. Novice classes, which offer the youngsters an opportunity
to gain experience in the trials, are for those who have not yet won
three first-place awards. Open classes are for those who have three
or more first-place wins.
The classes break down further into age groups. Juniors are 9 years
old but under 12, Intermediate competitors are children 12 years old
but under 15, and Seniors are children 15 years old but under 18.
If your child shows interest in Junior Showmanship, encourage it!
Many junior handlers continue with their love of dogs to become
professional handlers, veterinarians, breeders, and trainers.
Take your child to the Junior Showmanship classes at a regional
dog show and talk with him about the different levels of competi-
tion. Check with your Boston Terrier club about handling classes
designed especially for young people.

178
Dressing the part
“Coordinating outfits” take on a whole new meaning when it comes to dog shows.
At point shows, the dog handlers — whether it’s the dog owner or someone he hires —
typically dress to enhance the dog’s appearance. They choose solid colors, like black,
blue, or brown, which draw attention to the dog’s coat.
Careful not to wear something that draws attention away from the dog’s beauty,
they often don modest outfits, such as a shirt, tie, and sports coat for the men and
a dress or two-piece suit for the women. The outfits always have plenty of pockets
for treats and brushes, and they are cut for free movement — which is essential
when running in the ring or kneeling on the floor.

Traveling with (Or without)
Your Boston
In This Chapter
 Packing necessary supplies for the journey
 Keeping your dog safe while traveling
 Choosing a long- or short-term boarding facility
 Knowing what to look for in a pet sitter
W
ith his relatively small size and gentlemanly demeanor, your
Boston Terrier makes an ideal travel companion. He’ll hap-
pily sit shotgun (safely restrained by a seat belt, of course!) as you
motor to the store. He’ll be your companion during spontaneous
weekend getaways. He’ll even fly the skies with you, too, content in
his travel carrier.
When it comes to traveling with your Boston, you can liken it to
traveling with a 3-year-old child: Pack a bag of essentials, bring
plenty of distractions, and prepare for just about anything!
Planning ahead before any trip — be it a 10-minute car ride or a
cross-country vacation — will make the adventure enjoyable for
everyone.
Sometimes, though, you can’t take your Boston along, so you may
want to enlist the help of a dog sitter, doggy day care, or boarding
facility. In this chapter, you find out what to bring on the trip, how
to get your Boston comfortable with car rides, and what to do if
you have to leave your Boston behind.

Preparing for the Journey
Before you hit the road with your Boston, you need to gather a few
essentials to keep your dog safe and his needs fulfilled. They include
identification, a travel carrier, and day or overnight bag.
Identification, please
Whether you’re traveling a block to the pet store or cross-country
to a relative’s home, identification tags virtually guarantee that
someone will return your Boston to you if he goes missing. With
your name and home and cellphone numbers inscribed on that
little disk, the person who finds your Boston has an immediate and
direct line to you.
To ensure that your dog is returned to you, always keep an updated,
legible ID tag on your Boston’s collar. If you have multiple collars,
purchase multiple ID tags and hang one on each collar. The tags are
inexpensive and easy to obtain, and they can save you heartache —
and expense — if your dog escapes while you’re on the road.
If you’re traveling far from home and staying in a hotel or at a rela-
tive’s house, purchase some inexpensive disposable tags and list
the hotel or relative’s phone number, as well as your cellphone
number. It’s good insurance, just in case.
A microchip is an excellent backup to an ID tag, especially if your
Boston’s collar slips off. A veterinarian or shelter employee can use
a scanner to read the code that is unique to your pup’s microchip.
That code tells the vet which registry has your contact information.
The vet or the person who found your dog can call the registry to
get your information so she can reconnect you with your dog.
(For more about microchips, see Chapter 5.)
Keep in mind that it can take some time for the person who recov-
ered your dog to find a veterinarian or shelter with a microchip
scanner, contact the registry to get your phone number, and call
you. And those hours and days when your Boston is missing can
seem like a lifetime!
The right carrier for the trip
A carrier protects your Boston while he’s traveling. Depending on
your mode of transportation — be it car or airplane — you’ll need
a different carrier to keep him safe and secure.
Part III: Stepping Out 
180

By car
You may be tempted to let your Boston sit shotgun or even ride on
your lap while you’re driving, but doing so is extremely dangerous
for you, your dog, and other drivers. An unrestrained dog in your
car can be more distracting than using a cellphone or eating lunch
while driving. Even if he’s well-behaved, your Boston may see a
dog walking down the street and lunge toward it, jumping in your
lap, blocking your view, and potentially causing an accident.
The safest way to travel in a car is with your Boston secured in a
crate, carrier, car seat, or seatbelt harness. Because of the public’s
growing concern about keeping their traveling pets safe, manufac-
turers have created a wide range of options to restrain dogs in the
car. Most of them include seatbelt loops so you can buckle your
Boston in. Your options include:
 Crates: Like the hard-sided plastic kennel that you used to
housetrain your Boston, a crate keeps your dog safe and con-
fined in case of an accident. With its solid sides, the crate 
prevents your dog from flying out a window or being crushed.
Soft-sided crates often feature steel or aluminum frames that
offer some protection, but their greatest asset is that you can
fold them down for easy storage.
 Travel carriers: Made rigid with plastic frames, soft-sided 
carriers make traveling with your Boston relatively easy.
They resemble gym bags with ventilated sides, but they are
designed to carry your 20-pound pup safely on short journeys
to the pet store, veterinarian, or Grandma’s house. Some include
built-in removable casters for easy wheeling and pockets for
storing pickup bags and treats.
 Car seats: Framed with rigid plastic or metal and lined with
fleece, faux sheepskin, or canvas, canine car seats keep your
pup secure while allowing him to look out the window. Most
resemble a miniature dog bed with upright sides that keep
your pup both contained and comfortable on the road. If
you’re thinking about buying one of these, make sure that it
has a seatbelt slot and a place to connect a harness or other
restraint.
You may have seen dog beds and booster seats designed for
use in cars. They look stylish and comfy for your Boston, but
avoid them. Many don’t restrain your dog in any way, and if
you have to stop or turn your car quickly, your pup can be
sent flying and possibly get hurt. Instead, invest in a quality
travel carrier with a cushy liner or a dog car seat with harness
attachment, and buckle him in.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 181

 Seatbelt harness: Your Boston wears a harness around his
torso (see Figure 13-1; check out Chapter 5 for more details
about harnesses). You can restrain your Boston in the car by
connecting the harness to a seat belt. Some harnesses come
with a seatbelt latch built in.
Figure 13-1: Restraining your Boston in your car keeps him, you, and 
other drivers safe.
By airplane
Airline requirements stipulate what types of carriers you can use to
safely transport your Boston. The requirements vary among airlines,
so check with the one you’re flying well before you get to the airport.
Generally, however, because your Boston will likely be traveling in
the cargo area of the plane, you need a hard-plastic crate with
absorbent bedding, and food and water dishes secured to the
inside of the kennel door. Add your Boston’s favorite toy, and he’s
ready to fly!
Pack your Boston’s bags
Any responsible parent keeps a bag of her child’s belongings ready
to go. Likewise, as a pet parent, you should keep a bag of dog
necessities handy when you travel with your Boston. You never
know when you’ll need a bowl for some water, the first-aid kit in
case of a bee sting, or a treat for a well-behaved pup!
Part III: Stepping Out 
182

For short jaunts to the market, you don’t need too many supplies:
A leash, pickup bags, a bottle of water, a portable bowl, treats, and
a favorite toy, all stashed in a handy tote bag, will do.
For longer journeys, however, you need a lot more. Pack the follow-
ing items in your Boston’s suitcase:
 Extra leash and collar with ID tags already attached
 Enough food to last for the journey
 Bottled water
 Treats
 Two portable bowls (one for water, one for food)
 Grooming supplies, including toothbrush and toothpaste,
brush, shampoo, and nail clippers
 Extra crate pads
 Pickup bags
 Medications
 Portable first-aid kit
 Some favorite chew toys
 His favorite bedding
 A jacket or sweater if it will be cold
 Important veterinary files, including health and vaccination
records
Hitting the Road
Before you and your Boston head out on a road trip, you must
teach your puppy all about riding in the car. Most dogs are natural-
born copilots; a few are more the homebody types. But whether
he’s an eager passenger or a nervous one, you can teach your
Boston to be a well-behaved traveler. And I include some safety
pointers so you can keep your pup safe on your journeys.
Introducing the car
Before you even think about taking your Boston on the road, you
need to introduce him to the idea of riding in a car. That big metal-
lic beast with the growling motor may intimidate your Boston
puppy, and if he’s not slowly familiarized with it, he can develop a
fear that’s hard to shake.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 183

Teaching your Boston about traveling begins with his crate or car-
rier. If you’re crate training him, he already knows that his crate is
his den: It’s his safe place where he can play with his toys, take a
nap, and enjoy some “me” time. (Check out Chapter 9 for more
details about crate training.) You can easily carry over that
feeling of safety when you put him in his crate to travel in the car.
He’ll instinctually feel confident in his den, whether it’s in your
home or in the vehicle.
The first car “ride” should be a brief introduction to the vehicle.
By following these steps, you can make your Boston a confident
traveling companion:
1. Place the crate in a secure place in your car, like the
back seat, and buckle it in.
Make sure the spot has plenty of air circulation.
2. Load the crate with toys, his blanket, and a crate pad (just
in case) — things that will help him feel comfortable.
3. Put your Boston on his leash, and walk him to the car.
Let him sniff the metallic beast, walk around it, and
inspect it.
Use positive reinforcement to encourage him and build his
confidence.
4. When you’re ready to leave, say “Let’s go,” and help him
into his crate.
5. Turn the car on and watch his reaction.
If he settles down right away and seems ready for an adven-
ture, take a drive around the block and praise him for a job
well done. But if he whines and shakes, calm him down and
call it a day. You don’t want to overdo it and cause him to
fear the car. Next time, however, take his training a step 
further.
6. Have him sit in the car while the motor is running, and
then back the car out of the garage or driveway and return.
As he becomes more comfortable with the car and its
sounds and movements, continue to broaden his experi-
ence by driving around the block to a dog-friendly park or
taking a short trip to Grandma’s house.
In time, your Boston will associate driving with a positive experi-
ence, and he’ll be ready to hit the open road without a backward
glance!
Part III: Stepping Out 
184

Your Boston is an intelligent dog. If you just drive him to the 
veterinarian for checkups and shots, he’ll connect the car with a
negative experience. Take your Boston on pleasant trips as often
as possible so he associates driving with fun. Excursions to dog
parks, lakes, shopping centers, and friends’ houses not only give
your dog reasons to love to travel, but they also help to socialize
him (read more about socializing your pup in Chapter 10).
Driving in style
With his adventurous spirit, there’s no doubt that your Boston will
love to accompany you everywhere. You’ll go to the dog park
together, out for coffee with friends, and to doggy play dates.
When you arrive at your destination, don’t leave your dog unat-
tended in a closed vehicle, no matter what the weather is. In as
little as 15 minutes, the temperature in an automobile can rise to
scorching levels, and your dog can suffer a heat stroke that can lead
to brain damage or death. If you must leave your pup in the car,
designate a responsible family member to stay with your Boston.
Regardless of where you go, your primary goal is to keep your dog
safe and secure. Short trips are pretty easy to manage; long trips
require a bit more organization.
Short trips
When your Boston feels comfortable riding in the car, you can take
him on short car rides around town.
If you’re visiting a friend’s house or apartment, make sure before
you leave that it’s okay to bring your dog along. Most likely, your
host will welcome your Boston with open arms! Grab your pup’s
day bag with his toys, water and water bowl, treats, pickup bags,
and portable first-aid kit. If you’ll be staying longer than a few
hours, bring some food along, too. Load him in his carrier and be
on your way.
Keeping your dog safe during these short rides is easy: Make sure
that he wears his collar and leash inside the car and that he stays
in his seatbelt harness or in the carrier while you’re driving.
If you use a seatbelt harness and your dog has access to an open
window, do not let him stick his head out. His large prominent eyes
can be easily scratched or otherwise damaged by dust, rocks,
sand, or salt pieces whizzing by.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 185

If possible, don’t let your dog ride in a seat with an airbag. The force
with which the airbag deploys can injure your dog, just as it would
injure a child.
Long trips
Long road trips with overnight stays take a little more planning.
Besides grabbing your dog’s suitcase and favorite bedding, you
also need to check with your veterinarian, find dog-friendly hotels,
and map out a course to your destination.
 Vet check: Before you leave, schedule an appointment with
your veterinarian to be sure that your dog is healthy and ready
for travel. Tell your vet where you’re going, and ask him if your
pooch will need additional vaccinations or preventive medica-
tion before you leave. If you live in a colder climate and you’re
driving to Florida during the winter, for example, you may
need to apply some flea-and-tick repellant to your Boston.
 Find dog-friendly lodging: As you’re planning your itinerary,
you need to find hotels that accept dogs. Because of the rise
in pet popularity, more hotels than ever welcome dogs, but
they typically require an additional deposit to cover the cost
of cleaning.
When you’re at the hotel, treat it as if it were your home: Pick
up messes your dog leaves behind, clean up any accidents,
and don’t let him bark. Keep him off the bed or bring a sheet
to put down before he lays on the bed. Many dog-friendly
hotels don’t allow you to leave the dog unattended in the
room, but you can put him in his crate if you go out to dinner
or take a shower. Respect the rules so other dog-owning
patrons can enjoy bunking with their pets, too.
At campgrounds, follow the same manners with your dog. Just
because you’re out in the wilderness doesn’t mean your dog
can run loose! Keep him on his leash at all times and don’t let
him bark.
 Identify appropriate rest areas: Map out your journey to
make sure you can stop at places where your Boston can get
out and stretch his legs. As you travel, stop every few hours
to let your dog exercise and relieve himself. Though many rest
stops have designated pet areas, these patches may be flea
infested and frequented by unvaccinated dogs. Old, spoiled
food may be laying around, and stagnant water may be disease-
ridden. Instead, choose clean areas and pick up your Boston’s
messes. Offer your Boston water from a portable dish when-
ever you stop.
Part III: Stepping Out 
186

If your Boston tends to get motion sickness, avoid feeding him just
before and during the car ride. Long trips may require that you
feed him, but plan the meals so he has adequate time to digest the
food before you hit the road again.
Flying the Skies
Airplane trips with your Boston Terrier require even more prepara-
tion than traveling by car (see the “Hitting the Road” section). Use
the following tips and begin planning at least 30 days in advance to
ensure a turbulence-free journey:
 Government agency and vet check: First, check with the 
necessary government agency (usually the Department of
Agriculture) for specifics about what documentation your
Boston will need at your destination location. Fill out any
paperwork and turn it in well before the deadline.
A veterinarian will need to examine your Boston and give you
a signed health certificate no more than 10 days before your
departure. That appointment gives you the opportunity to tell
your veterinarian where you’re going and ask about any spe-
cial vaccinations your Boston may require.
 Talk to an airline representative: When you make your flight
reservation, notify the airline representative that you’ll be
bringing a live animal onboard. She will ask the dog’s size and
weight, and tell you what size carrier your Boston will need.
If you already have a carrier, have the brand and dimensions
available so you can check them with the representative.
She will also tell you what documentation you’ll need to 
present to the ticketing agent at the airport. Be prepared and
gather these papers well in advance. Ask her, too, where you
can pick up your pup at your destination.
Airlines typically charge for transporting pets; the price varies
between companies. When you make your reservations, ask
the representative how much they charge and when you will
be required to pay. Many times, they collect the fee when you
check in your pup at the ticket counter.
 Prepare your dog’s travel crate: Federal law requires absorbent
bedding on the bottom of the crate. You must also provide
food and water dishes that are attached to the inside of the
crate’s wire door.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 187

Fill one of the dishes with water and pop it in the freezer the
night before you leave. Just before you head out, place the
frozen dish inside the crate. The ice will melt slowly, providing
water for your pup and preventing spillage during flight. Tape
a small bag of food to the top of the crate with feeding instruc-
tions in case of delays.
Also tape all of your contact information on the crate, including
your dog’s name, your name, cellphone number, destination
phone number and address, and flight number.
 Gather your Boston’s belongings: Just as you pack your own
bag, pack your Boston’s bag, too (see the “Pack your Boston’s
bags” section earlier in this chapter). Remember any medica-
tion, toys, plenty of food, treats, an extra leash, and favorite
bedding. Put all your contact info on this bag, too, just as
you do for your own suitcase. Make sure that your Boston is
wearing a collar with an updated ID tag listing your cellphone
number and destination telephone number.
 Before-flight fasting and relieving: Before you leave for the
airport, exercise your Boston as much as possible so he can
relieve himself completely before the flight. Do not feed him
for six hours before the plane departs; most airlines give spe-
cific recommendations for fasting before the flight.
 Arrive early: Get to the airport at least two hours before your
plane is scheduled to leave. At the ticket counter, present the
agent with the necessary paperwork and payment for trans-
porting your Boston. She will process the paperwork, put a
“live animal” sticker on the crate, sneak a peak at your dog, and
check him in. Double-check with her where you’ll pick up your
Boston when you arrive. After you land at your destination,
gather your bags, and then pick up your pup. Have the required
documentation handy to show the airline representative.
Airline regulations change constantly, so speak with an airline rep-
resentative before you leave to be sure you’ve dotted your i’s and
crossed your t’s. You wouldn’t want to have to cancel your flight
because of forgotten paperwork!
Leaving Your Boston Behind
You won’t always be able to travel with your Boston, no matter
how fun it is. Long meetings, business trips, sick relatives, or a
range of other circumstances may require you to leave your dog
behind for the day, a few days, or longer. In these situations, you’ll
need to drop your Boston off at doggy day care, board him in a
kennel, or hire a dog sitter.
Part III: Stepping Out 
188

Short- and long-term boarding
Short- and long-term boarding facilities keep your Boston safe and
secure when you can’t be with him. You can use a doggy daycare
facility or a boarding kennel to make sure your dog stays happy
and healthy when you can’t tend him.
Besides asking your veterinarian, breeder, or dog-owning friends
for boarding recommendations, you can visit the American
Boarding Kennels Association’s Web site (www.abka.com) and
search its database for an ABKA-accredited facility.
Doggy day care
Dog daycare centers, which are cropping up in major metropolitan
cities and suburbs across the United States, are generally intended
for daylong stays. The staff supervises the dogs, feeds them, and
plays with them. They lead them through activities, such as fetch,
water play, and playground time — yes, playground time! Many
dog daycare centers are inspired by children’s playgrounds. They
often include an outdoor play area that has playground equipment
designed for children. Some even have swimming pools for those
dog days of summer!
The daily rates for these facilities run from $20 and up, depending
on the location and the services provided. For an extra fee, many
of these dog daycare facilities offer grooming and training services.
Ask your dog-owning friends and family members, your vet, and
members of your local Boston club if they can recommend a doggy
daycare center. When you’ve got a list of places, check out the
“Screening the facilities” section later in this chapter to help you
make sure you’re leaving your Boston in good hands.
The first time you drop off your Boston, you’ll need to provide
proof of vaccinations, including rabies, distemper, parvo, and bor-
detella. Different daycare centers have varying rules with regard to
bringing your dog’s own toys, food, and treats, so talk to the day-
care owner or manager before you drop your pup off.
Dog daycare centers provide many benefits to your Boston, 
including
 Focused attention by experienced staff members: Many 
daycare employees are skilled in handling and training dogs.
Ask the facility manager if you’re curious about the employees’
credentials.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 189

 Socialization with other humans and dogs: Meeting and play-
ing with other dogs and humans is essential in your dog’s
mental and physical development. Daycare facilities provide a
fantastic opportunity to interact with a range of personalities
and breeds.
 Plenty of free time to run around outside and expend pent-
up energy: After enjoying the playground equipment, open
fields, and other canine carousers, your Boston will sleep like
a baby when he comes home from doggy day care!
 Opportunities to swim and try agility or other games to
keep his curious mind stimulated: You may not have room in
your backyard for playground or agility equipment, so visiting
a doggy day care is a great way to introduce your Boston to
these fun activities. Some day cares host agility and behavior
training classes; talk to the facility manger for details.
 Quiet time in a kennel for napping or playing with his
favorite toy: Most dog daycare facilities have individual ken-
nels or runs for dogs who want to have some space. They’re
perfect for naptime or if your Boston needs a timeout.
Long-term kennels
Similar to dog daycare facilities, boarding kennels provide your
Boston a home away from home while you’re on longer trips.
Your Boston will be kept in a run or a large kennel, and the facility’s
staff will feed your pup, clean up after him, take him for walks, and
give him lots of attention while you’re away. Some kennels even
have volunteers who will exercise and play fetch with your dog.
You can find kennels through your veterinarian, your local Boston
club, dog-owning friends, and family members. The best kennels fill
up quickly, especially during holidays and peak vacation weeks
during the summertime, so reserve your space as soon as you
know you’re going on vacation.
The facility will require you to provide proof of vaccinations,
including rabies, distemper, parvo, and bordetella. Have your
paperwork handy when you check your pup in. The rates vary,
depending on the facility, the services provided, and your location,
but you can expect to pay a minimum of $25 per day.
It may not be like keeping your Boston at home, but boarding ken-
nels do have their benefits, including
 Assurance that your Boston will be cared for while you’re
away: Knowing that your dog will be fed, cleaned up after,
played with, and safeguarded while you’re away assures that
you’ll have a pleasant trip — and a happy, healthy dog when
you come home.
Part III: Stepping Out 
190

 Socialization with other humans and dogs: Though your pup
may not interact with other people or canines as much as he
would at a dog daycare facility, he’ll be exposed to other dogs
during playtime and walks.
 Attention from skilled kennel staff: Because many kennels
are affiliated with a veterinary clinic or hospital, your Boston
will get quality care while in the facility. If he falls ill or injures
himself, he’ll have fast access to veterinary care.
 Access to grooming services: Many kennels offer grooming
services while the dogs are being boarded. Schedule a bath,
toenail trim, tooth brushing, and flea bath while he’s there,
and you’ll bring home a dog who smells and looks great —
and is delighted to see you!
Screening the facilities
Whether you use a doggy day care or a boarding kennel, you’ll want
to screen the facility before you drop off your beloved Boston.
After getting recommendations from veterinarians, your groomer,
Boston club members, and friends, compile your list and schedule
meetings with the facility owners or managers. Request a tour of
the facility and ask them a few questions about the services they
provide. If they’re a reputable operation, they won’t mind at all.
Prepare a list of expectations and questions in advance, including
 What hours are you open? When can my dog be dropped
off and picked up? Some daycare facilities are open during
normal business hours, so you’ll have to pick up your pooch
at a reasonable hour after work. Likewise, some kennels close at
the end of the day and may restrict when you can drop off and
pick up your dog.
 Is the kennel supervised 24 hours in case of emergency? Even
if you can’t drop off and pick up your dog at just any time of day,
you should choose a kennel that has supervision 24 hours a
day, seven days a week in case of fire or some other emergency.
 What vaccinations do you require the dogs to have? Most
kennels and daycare facilities require you to provide up-to-
date vaccination records to prove that your Boston has been
vaccinated against rabies, distemper, and parvo in the past
12 months. Other kennels require a bordetella vaccine within
six months of boarding.
 Are incoming dogs screened for fleas, ticks, and other para-
sites? Some kennels require that your dog be on a flea-and-tick
preventive. If he’s not, they may be able to apply one for you.
 Is a veterinarian on call in case of emergency? Reputable
facilities will have a veterinarian on call or even on site. If they
don’t, ask about their protocol if a medical emergency occurs.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 191

 What experience do you require your staff to have? Do they
know dog first aid? CPR? At least one staff member who has
experience administering canine first aid should be on the
clock. You want to make sure your Boston is in capable hands
if something happens.
 How large are the kennels? Are they cleaned several times
a day? When you tour the facility, make note of the cleanliness
of the kennels, the common areas, and the overall grounds.
You should see little or no fecal waste and detect very little
smell. The kennels should be large enough for your dog to feel
comfortable.
 How often are the dogs fed? Watered? Again, take note of the
water bowls in the kennels and common areas as you tour the
facility. The dogs should have access to clean, fresh water at
all times.
 Can I bring my own food, treats, and toys? Is bedding pro-
vided, or can I bring my own? A change in diet can cause
diarrhea in some dogs, so being able to keep your pup on his
regular diet is a must. Bringing your dog’s favorite toys and
bedding will help him feel comfortable in the unfamiliar set-
ting. Some dog daycare facilities, however, do not allow toys
from home to avoid dominance conflicts.
 Will someone walk my dog every day? Is there a fee for this
service? Getting out of the kennel will brighten your Boston’s
day and burn up some extra energy.
 Do you offer any grooming services? If so, take advantage of
them! There’s nothing better than picking up a clean dog
who’s absolutely delighted to see you!
The daycare or kennel representative should take as much time as
necessary to answer these questions and give you a thorough tour
of the facility. If she is curt or hurried in any way, move on. You don’t
want to leave your Boston in the care of someone whom you don’t
trust 100 percent.
After you choose a kennel or dog daycare facility, provide a list of
your dog’s needs, including any medication he is taking or allergies
he may have.
Hiring a pet sitter
Finding someone reliable who is willing to stay with your dog or
drop in on him several times during the day while you’re away can
be a better alternative than boarding your Boston in a kennel.
He’ll get to stay home with familiar smells and sounds. He’ll have
Part III: Stepping Out 
192

access to all his favorite toys and bedding. He won’t be exposed to
kennel cough or fleas. Plus, he may get some extra attention — and
treats — from his favorite auntie or Grandma!
Your neighbor or friend makes an excellent dog sitter during short
trips, but if you’re going to be away for an extended period of time,
you can hire a professional dog sitter to care for your pet. They
typically charge between $10 and $30 per day, depending on the
services they provide and how many pets you have.
Ask your veterinarian or fellow dog club members for pet sitter
recommendations. Often, word of mouth is a good reference. You can
also visit the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters Web
site (www.petsitters.org) or the Pet Sitters International Web site
(www.petsit.com) to search for a pet sitter in your area.
Chapter 13: Traveling with (Or without) Your Boston 193
Leaving information behind
Even though the daycare facility, boarding kennel, or dog sitter may have plenty of
experience with dogs, the caregiver doesn’t know your dog and his idiosyncrasies.
A detailed list of instructions gives your dog sitter or care provider a guide to feed-
ing, exercising, and caring for your Boston while you’re away. If your dog requires
any special needs, jot those down, too, so the person can refer to it if necessary.
As you compose your list, use these suggestions to get started:
 Phone number, address, and location of where you can be reached
 Your veterinarian’s name, address, and office and emergency phone numbers
 Written permission for your caregiver to obtain veterinary treatment in your absence
 A short list of your pup’s medical history, vaccinations, and allergies, if any
 Whether your dog is microchipped
 Your dog’s age and birth date
 Feeding amounts and times to feed
 Any medication or supplements your dog needs, and instructions on how to
administer them
 A backup dog sitter or kennel in case of emergency
 Your dog’s favorite toys, games, and treats
By writing down this information and these instructions, you provide your caregiver
with everything she needs to tend to your Boston’s every want. It will help you and
your dog better deal with the time that you are away.

When you have a list of potential dog sitters, schedule an appoint-
ment with each one to visit your home and meet your Boston.
You’ll know right away if you — and your dog — like her! A good
dog sitter will develop a rapport with your pup right away.
Use this list of questions to interview potential dog sitters.
 Do you belong to a professional pet-sitting organization,
such as the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters?
Your candidate doesn’t necessarily have to belong, but mem-
bers of groups like these have met basic handling standards
set by the organization.
 Do you have references? Confident pet sitters will happily
provide you a list of satisfied clients. Call the references and
ask if they would hire the pet sitter again.
 Are you insured and bonded? Ask to see proof of commercial
liability insurance and ask exactly what coverage it provides.
 How long have you been working as a pet sitter? Have you
ever dog-sat a Boston? A top candidate should have some
experience caring for small dogs, ideally a Boston.
 What experience do you have with medical care? Do you
know canine CPR? First aid? If your dog has an emergency,
this person should be able to provide or obtain emergency
care and treatment.
 When will you come to my home? How long will you stay?
Your candidate should come at least twice a day to feed and
check on your dog. She should also spend some time with him
playing fetch, taking a walk, or just hanging out and watching
television.
When you find a quality pet sitter, hold on to her! Notify her well in
advance of trips so she can block off the time. Invite her to your
home while you’re there so she can bond with your Boston before
you leave. She will be caring for your baby during your trip, so pre-
pare everything she’ll need to make her job easy — and fun!

In This Chapter
 Choosing a veterinarian
 Knowing what to expect during your Boston’s veterinary visits
 Looking at vaccinations for common diseases
 Identifying internal and external parasites
 Getting your Boston spayed or neutered
A
s dapper and determined as they are, Bostons can’t take care of
themselves, particularly when it comes to their health. One of
the first things you need to do as a responsible dog owner is estab-
lish a relationship with a veterinarian you trust — someone with
whom you feel comfortable asking questions, sharing concerns, and
calling if the unthinkable happens. You and your Boston’s doctor will
work together to ensure a long and healthy life for your beloved dog.
In this chapter, you figure out how to identify a qualified veterinarian.
You find out what to expect during your Boston’s first veterinary
visit, including the host of vaccinations your puppy will need.
You also get the lowdown about those unpleasant internal and
external parasites, like heartworm and fleas.
Finding a Vet for Your Pet
Your veterinarian’s job is to keep your Boston healthy and protected
against disease. He will conduct annual screenings and suggest
preventive care to ensure your Boston will live a long life. He will
also vaccinate your Boston against common diseases, perform
treatments as needed, prescribe remedies, and address any ques-
tions or concerns you may have. Next to you, the veterinarian will
become your dog’s best friend.
Start looking for a veterinarian before your Boston becomes a part
of your family. You should establish a doctor–patient–pet owner
relationship as soon as possible, and that starts with identifying a
veterinarian who’s right for you.

Getting referrals from 
trustworthy sources
You can begin your search for a veterinarian by contacting your
local Boston Terrier club and asking for a recommendation (search
www.bostonterrierclubofamerica.org for the club nearest you).
Chances are good that veterinarians suggested by club members
have cared for many Boston Terriers. They understand the intrica-
cies of the breed and can recommend specific treatments for your
dog. Other than your local breed club, you can also get vet refer-
rals from the following sources:
 Your breeder: If she lives in your area, she may be able to rec-
ommend a veterinarian; if she lives out of the area, she may
know someone who lives in your city.
 Family, friends, and other dog owners: They can give firsthand
reports of the vet’s bedside manner and expertise — and
whether their pets approved of him!
 Veterinary associations: Groups such as the American Animal
Hospital Association (AAHA) compile a list of member veteri-
narians whom they can recommend to you. The medical and
management criteria for becoming an AAHA-approved clinic
are strict, and a facility that meets these guidelines is often a
cut above those that aren’t members.
 The phonebook and newspaper advertisements: These
resources are helpful if you’re new to the area and don’t yet
know your way around. Focus on those clinics that are near
your home.
No matter where you find veterinary recommendations, always
check them out before you decide who the best vet for your
Boston is. If you find that you don’t like the veterinarian or the
office staff, or you can’t communicate well with them, find another
veterinarian. It’s okay to try out different doctors until you find one
with whom you’re comfortable.
Figuring out who’s who 
in the vet world
Like medical doctors for people, veterinarians earn their doctorate
degrees and go on to practice as a general practitioner. General
practitioners maintain your Boston’s medical history, perform rou-
tine examinations and minor surgeries, and handle emergencies.
A general practitioner is your Boston’s primary doctor.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
198

Veterinarians can also practice in 1 of 20 American Veterinary
Medical Association–recognized specialties, such as dermatology,
ophthalmology, and internal medicine. These veterinary specialists,
to whom your general practitioner will refer you if necessary, have
focused their practice on specific areas of medicine.
Here, you can find out the differences between the general practi-
tioners and veterinary specialists.
General practitioners
Veterinarians are licensed through the American Veterinary
Medical Association (AVMA). After completing four years in an
AVMA–accredited veterinary school with one year dedicated to
clinical rotations, they must pass rigorous federal and state board
exams to earn their licenses — and the DVM (doctor of veterinary
medicine) or VMD (veterinary medical doctor) after their names,
depending on the traditions of the veterinary school that they
attended.
General practitioners can perform many of the services your Boston
will need, including annual checkups, vaccinations, minor surgeries,
diagnostics, and prevention. If your Boston is sick, you will first
take her to your general practitioner. But if she needs specialized
care, your general practitioner will refer you to a specialist.
Veterinarians practice medicine in a variety of settings, from large
veterinary hospitals that staff a number of doctors to privately
owned clinics that have one or two doctors available. Some doc-
tors work in franchise-like settings, while others practice medicine
in teaching hospitals at veterinary schools.
Specialists
Veterinary specialists, such as veterinary behaviorists, surgeons,
or dentists, undergo even more training than general practitioners
do and choose to focus on a particular area of expertise.
To earn the title of veterinary specialist, the person must complete
a standard veterinary school program and earn her DVM. Then, she
must continue her education by completing a one-year internship
and a two- to five-year residency program in her chosen discipline.
After her educational requirements are complete, she must pass
additional examinations to merit certification by a specialty board.
The certification requirements vary, but they are governed by the
American Board of Veterinary Specialists, which has established
guidelines on how veterinary specialists list their credentials.
Veterinarians may not imply that they are specialists when they
aren’t. If you’re seeking a veterinary specialist, look for terms
like board certified and diplomate (often abbreviated as dipl.).
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 199

For example, this doctor specializes in veterinary nutrition: Sara
Veterinarian, DVM, dipl. ACVN (American College of Veterinary
Nutrition), board certified in clinical nutrition.
If your Boston requires the services of a veterinary specialist, your
veterinarian will usually give you a referral.
Knowing what you’re looking for
Choosing the right veterinarian and clinic or hospital for your Boston
depends on many criteria. Just as you would research your own
physician, you’ll want to do the same with your dog’s veterinarian
and animal hospital. To get started, ask yourself these questions:
 Is it important to find a veterinarian near my home?
 What services do I require from the clinic?
 What level of doctor–patient–pet owner familiarity do I want?
 Is a helpful office staff important to me?
The following sections can help you come up with answers that
best suit you and your Boston.
Quality over convenience
Choosing a clinic near your home is certainly convenient. It will be
much easier for you to show up for routine exams, grooming visits,
and booster shots if your vet’s office is right down the road.
The clinic’s office hours should also be compatible with your
schedule. Ask if the doctors have early or late appointments and if
they see patients on the weekend.
Don’t base your decision solely on convenience, however, because
the nearest veterinarian may not be a good fit. You and your dog
should feel comfortable with the doctor and his skills, and if you
feel hesitant at all, find someone else. (See the upcoming section,
“Interviewing your veterinarian,” for a list of questions to ask the
potential veterinarian.)
Full range of services
Veterinary clinics offer a wide range of services, from grooming
and boarding to ultrasounds and cancer treatment. Some practices
even stock their shelves with retail products. Talk about one-stop
shopping!
Before you select a clinic, jot down what services are important to
you. If you plan to groom your own dog, for example, you may not
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
200

need grooming services. Likewise, if you have a reliable dog sitter,
you may not need boarding services.
You should definitely find out how the clinic handles emergencies.
Some clinics have a staff veterinarian on call 24 hours a day, while
others partner with nearby clinics or animal hospitals for after-
hours emergencies.
You may also want to ask whether the clinic has a laboratory in the
office or if it sends its lab work out. Talk to the vet or office man-
ager about the length of time it takes to get lab results. You don’t
want to be waiting for days to find out what exactly is wrong with
your beloved Boston.
Also consider whether the clinic has access to specialty practition-
ers and services, like oncologists (vets who treat dogs suffering
from cancer), dentists, or behaviorists. Most doctors can refer their
clients to specialists, but you may want to have the services on-site.
One doctor versus whoever is available
In some clinics, you can see the same veterinarian each time you
visit; in others, you may not have a choice. Practices maintain a
history of your dog’s visits, including her immunizations, reactions
to medications, and behavior traits, so from a treatment stand-
point, you don’t have to see the same doctor each time.
But a strong doctor–patient–pet owner relationship plays a role in
your dog’s overall health. By seeing the same vet every time, your
Boston will become more comfortable with him, and the vet will
really get to know your dog. Plus, seeing the same doctor each time
may be important if your Boston has a recurrent or chronic problem.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 201
Alternative treatments
In addition to traditional veterinary care, you can consider complementary and alter-
native health care for your Boston. Some of these alternatives include acupuncture,
acupressure, massage, and chiropractic care.
Acupuncture and acupressure are ancient Eastern therapies that consist of stimulat-
ing precise points on your dog’s body by inserting fine needles or applying pressure.
Some veterinarians are specially trained in practicing this type of therapy. Massage
and chiropractic therapy work the animal’s muscles and skeletal system to ease
pain and speed healing.
Before visiting any of these therapists, consult your traditional veterinarian for rec-
ommendations, advice, or further information.

If you choose a sole practitioner for your Boston, be sure that
another veterinarian can step in if your vet goes on vacation or is
otherwise unavailable.
Helpful office staff
From the receptionist to the veterinary technician, the office staff’s
attentiveness and quality affects the quality of your Boston’s care.
The front office staff should be considerate and helpful. They greet
you when you arrive and schedule follow-up appointments when
you’re done. In smaller practices, they may assist the doctor in the
exam room.
Veterinary technicians or veterinary assistants typically take your
Boston’s temperature, weigh her, and take her vital signs before
the vet comes into the exam room. Many times, they will explain
the doctor’s diagnosis in terms that make sense to you.
Interviewing your veterinarian
After you’ve narrowed down your selections, you’ll want to find
out more about the veterinarian. You may need to schedule a con-
sultation or appointment to fit into the doctor’s schedule and pay a
fee for the visit — but it will give you the opportunity to meet the
office staff and talk to the veterinarian.
Ask the veterinarian candidate the following questions:
 How long have you been in practice?
 Have you cared for many Boston Terriers?
 What do you know about the Boston’s unique medical needs,
temperament, and personality?
 What is your area of expertise? Do you specialize?
 Whom do you consult when presented with a medical prob-
lem that you’re not familiar with?
 Do you perform your own surgical procedures?
 Who monitors the dogs after surgery? Where are they cared for?
 How much veterinary education do you require your staff to
have? Do they attend continuing education courses?
 How often do you attend veterinary conventions to learn
about new medical procedures?
 Do you offer any alternative therapies?
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
202

Visit several clinics, if possible, and weigh the pros and cons of
each. Remove from your list veterinarians who appear rude or use
too much medical jargon when you ask questions. If a clinic
appears dirty or smells offensive, or if the office staff is inattentive,
take it off your list.
Instead, choose a veterinarian with whom you feel comfortable
and who has a helpful office staff and top-notch service. When you
find someone you think you can work with, schedule a routine
physical for your dog as a first visit.
Your Boston’s First Vet Visit
Your veterinarian will want to see your Boston within 48 to 72
hours of arriving at her new home. Most breeders and rescue
organizations require that you have your dog checked by a veteri-
narian soon after purchase or adoption to be sure she doesn’t have
any health problems.
Arrive early to your appointment and bring the documents that
came with your Boston. They contain important information the
doctor needs, such as any vaccinations and tests already per-
formed on your pet. Plan to fill out some preliminary paperwork
that lists your dog’s vital statistics, activity level, previous health
problems (if any), and other pets you may have. Also plan to bring
a fresh stool sample so your veterinarian can check it for internal
parasites.
You’ll likely be escorted to the exam room by a veterinary techni-
cian. These trained professionals will weigh your Boston, take her
temperature, and ask questions about the reason for your visit.
During the physical exam, the veterinarian will conduct an overall
health screening to look for potential health problems. She will
listen to your pup’s heart and lungs; feel her abdomen, muscles,
and joints; inspect her mouth, teeth, and gums; look into her eyes,
ears, and nose; and look at your Boston’s coat. The veterinarian
will look for anything out of the ordinary and watch the dog’s reac-
tion when handled. The vet will also look for congenital problems,
which are health problems an animal is born with.
After examining your dog and reviewing her medical records, your
veterinarian may decide to vaccinate your Boston against a range
of viruses and bacteria to which dogs are susceptible (see the next
section). If your Boston already started her vaccinations, she may
need booster shots.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 203

The veterinarian will ask you questions about the dog’s behavior.
She will want to know your Boston’s eating and defecating habits
and activity level. If you have witnessed anything out of the ordi-
nary, be sure to tell the veterinarian.
Now is the time to ask any questions you may have, such as what
and how much your Boston should be eating, any special health
problems Bostons could have, and when your dog should be
spayed or neutered. This is the time to establish a comfortable 
dialogue with your veterinarian.
Vaccinations: Protecting Your 
Dog from Deadly Diseases
Dogs face a range of communicable diseases today, but they can be
prevented with vaccinations. Vaccines are essentially weakened or
dead forms of a disease that are given to your Boston to stimulate
her immune system, causing her to produce antibodies against
that disease. When she’s exposed to the real disease, her body rec-
ognizes the invader, and her defenses fight it off.
When your Boston is a puppy, she gets antibodies from her mama’s
milk. But starting at 6 weeks old and continuing every three to four
weeks until your pup reaches 16 weeks old, your veterinarian will
vaccinate your puppy against a range of diseases, which are
detailed in the following section.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
204
Dirty business
During your Boston’s vet exam, you may need to bring a fresh stool sample so it can
be examined for things like internal parasites.
Collecting the sample isn’t as difficult — or disgusting — as it sounds. It needs to be
fresh, so a few hours before your appointment, follow your dog outside with a sealable
sandwich bag and a leftover food container with a tight-fitting lid. Turn the plastic
bag inside out over your hand and pick up the fresh feces. The sample doesn’t need
to be too large: A quarter-size amount of stool will do. Turn the plastic bag back
around the sample, seal it, place it in the container, and close the lid.
Label the container with your name, your dog’s name, and the date the sample was
taken. And try not to get too grossed out!

Knowing the diseases
Dogs are usually vaccinated against eight diseases. Whether your
veterinarian inoculates against all of them depends on where you
live and what viruses are prevalent. The rabies vaccine, for example,
is mandated by state law, but if coronavirus isn’t a problem in your
region, your vet won’t give your Boston that vaccine. Also, if you
travel or are planning to travel with your dog, be sure to let your
vet know so he can vaccinate appropriately.
Here are the eight diseases your pup will be vaccinated for, and
how they can affect your pup:
 Distemper: Distemper is a contagious viral disease that causes
symptoms resembling a bad cold with a fever. It can include
runny nose and eyes, and an upset stomach that can lead to
vomiting and diarrhea. Many infected animals exhibit neuro-
logical symptoms, which may include involuntary twitching,
paralysis, and convulsions. An incurable and deadly disease,
distemper is passed through exposure to the saliva, urine, and
feces of raccoons, foxes, wolves, mink, and other dogs already
infected with the virus. Unvaccinated young pups and senior
dogs are most vulnerable to distemper. Any pup or dog who
has received a distemper vaccination prior to exposure to the
virus is unlikely to become infected.
 Hepatitis: Spread through contact with other dogs’ saliva,
mucus, urine, or feces, hepatitis affects the liver. It causes
apathy, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. The
mortality rate is high, but vaccination prevents the disease.
 Leptospirosis: A highly contagious bacteria that is passed
through the urine of infected dogs, rats, farm animals, and
wildlife, leptospirosis attacks the dog’s kidneys, causing
kidney failure. Symptoms include fever, appetite loss, possible
diarrhea, and jaundice. Vaccinations usually prevent the dis-
ease, though the bacteria does appear in different forms, and
the vaccine may not protect against all of them. Lepto is a
zoonotic disease, which means that it can spread to humans.
 Parvovirus: Another deadly virus, parvo is transmitted by
direct contact with infected dogs and their feces. The virus
attacks the inner lining of a dog’s intestines and causes bloody
diarrhea. Symptoms also include fever, lethargy, appetite loss,
vomiting, and collapse. Because this virus replicates very
quickly, your Boston needs prompt medical attention if she
exhibits any of these signs. The vaccination is usually effec-
tive at preventing the virus if given at proper intervals during
the first 6 to 16 weeks of life.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 205

 Kennel cough: Adenovirus, parainfluenza, and bordetella all
refer to a condition known as infectious tracheobronchitis, or
kennel cough. They are rarely deadly, but they do cause signif-
icant coughing, sneezing, and hacking, sometimes with nasal
discharge and fever. Severe cases may progress to pneumonia.
Symptoms may last from several days to several weeks. This
very contagious virus spreads when the sick dog coughs and
expels airborne mucous. Some forms of the virus cannot be
vaccinated against. Dogs who frequent kennels, training
classes, groomers, dog parks, or other public facilities should
be vaccinated routinely.
 Rabies: Carried in the saliva of infected wildlife and transmit-
ted through bites or cuts, rabies attacks the nerve tissue and
causes paralysis and death. It’s always fatal to unvaccinated
animals and people. In most areas, proof of rabies vaccination is
required when you apply for a dog license. Some states require
yearly rabies vaccinations, while others allow vaccinations
every three years. Rabies is a zoonotic disease, which means
people can become infected by the saliva of a rabid animal.
 Coronavirus: Rarely fatal for puppies and adult dogs, coron-
avirus causes a loose, watery stool and vomiting. Dehydration
from the diarrhea and vomiting endangers puppies. The virus
is spread through the stool.
 Lyme disease: Lyme borreliosis, or Lyme disease, is caused
by a bacterium that can make animals and humans sick.
Spread by hard-bodied ticks that bite an infected animal and
then bite another animal, the disease causes a range of symp-
toms, including lameness, swollen joints, fever, appetite loss,
and lethargy. In the United States, it is most common around
the Atlantic seaboard, upper Midwest, and Pacific coast,
though it does occur throughout the country.
Following the vaccination schedule
If you’re intimidated by the diseases that can affect your Boston and
the number of vaccines needed to prevent them, rest easy. Your vet-
erinarian can help you schedule all the shots your puppy needs.
Typically, at 6 to 8 weeks old, your vet will vaccinate your puppy
for the most common diseases — distemper, hepatitis, leptospiro-
sis, parvovirus, and parainfluenza — in one combined injection,
called DHLPP. Your Boston will get another shot at 10 to 12 weeks
old, and a third at 14 to 16 weeks old.
Your puppy receives her first rabies vaccine at 12 weeks old and
her second vaccine a year later. Depending on the laws in your
state, your dog may also require a vaccination later on.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
206

Coronavirus and Lyme disease vaccinations are given only if there
is a problem in your area. Your vet will administer these vaccines
at the same time as her first two DHLPP injections, at 6 to 8 weeks
old, and again at 10 to 12 weeks old.
Depending on the vaccine, your vet will give the injection into a
muscle or under the skin. Some vaccines for kennel cough are given
through the nose. Most times, your puppy won’t be fazed by the
vaccinations, and she’ll be bounding around your home in no time.
After your puppy has completed her vaccinations, you’ll need to
take her to the veterinarian for booster shots once a year.
Based on recent research that suggests yearly booster shots may be
damaging to dogs’ immune systems, booster protocols are changing.
Some veterinarians give boosters every 18 months, while some vet-
erinary schools recommend that they can be given every 36 months.
Talk to your veterinarian about his suggested booster schedule and
whether he is concerned about the frequency of booster shots.
Patrolling for Parasites
Vaccinations prevent certain viruses and bacteria from afflicting
your Boston, but she is still susceptible to other medical problems,
including internal and external parasites.
Parasites are tiny organisms that live off of another living organism.
These little thieves come in all shapes and sizes, from single-celled
protozoa and small fleas to long intestinal tapeworms. There are
two types of parasites: internal and external. They latch onto the
host animal and draw nourishment from her without providing
any benefit in return. Sometimes, the parasites weaken the host
(your dog) so severely that they can cause death.
In most cases, your Boston will pick up parasites from exposure to
contaminated environments. For example, your dog may romp
through a grassy field and bring home some fleas or ticks, or she
may ingest a strange dog’s feces and develop an internal parasite.
Generally, you can prevent parasites by limiting your dog’s expo-
sure to other animals’ urine and feces, giving her a heartworm 
preventive every month (as prescribed by your veterinarian),
and applying a flea-and-tick repellant to her coat (also available
through your veterinarian).
In the sections below, I detail the most common internal and exter-
nal parasites, and how you can prevent your Boston from bringing
home these troublesome hitchhikers.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 207

Internal parasites: The worms
Internal parasites are a part of pet ownership. They aren’t pleas-
ant, but you need to address them to keep your pet healthy.
Because these pests live inside your Boston, you can’t see the
damage they’re causing! It can take quite some time before your
dog exhibits external signs of an internal parasite problem.
Your veterinarian can detect most internal parasites through test-
ing and microscopic examinations. A stool sample often contains
the eggs, dead remains of the parasite, or even the larvae. Your vet
will prescribe a treatment, and after it runs its course, you will need
to bring in another stool sample to be sure the treatment worked.
Several types of internal parasites affect dogs. Some are more
destructive than others. The following are the most common.
Hookworm
Hookworms, which can cause fatal anemia in puppies, attach 
themselves to the small intestine and suck the dog’s blood. After
detaching and moving to a new location, the wound continues to
bleed, causing bloody diarrhea — often a sign of a hookworm infes-
tation. Like other internal parasites, hookworm eggs are passed
through the stool, so good sanitation prevents their spread.
Humans can also suffer from hookworms.
Hookworm treatment involves feeding the dog an oral deworming
tablet or liquid and giving her another dose one month later.
The first treatment destroys the adult worms living in dog, and the
second treatment destroys the next generation. After the second
treatment, your vet will do another fecal exam to be sure the para-
sites are gone.
Roundworm
Roundworms, which are long white worms that live in the dog’s
intestines, are fairly common in puppies. They can be seen in feces
and vomit, and the eggs are transmitted through the stool. A dog
infested with roundworms is thin and may have a dull coat and
potbelly. A stool analysis will confirm diagnosis. Good sanitation
will prevent the spread of roundworm.
As with hookworm infestations, treatment involves feeding the dog
an oral deworming medication and repeating it several times to
ensure subsequent generations of the parasite are destroyed.
Roundworms are also a zoonotic disease that can cause neurologi-
cal damage and blindness in humans. Small children are at high
risk for becoming infected.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
208

Whipworm
This internal parasite lives in the large intestine where it feeds on
blood. A heavy infestation of whipworms can be fatal to adults and
puppies because it can cause severe diarrhea. Dogs infested with
whipworm look lethargic and thin. Whipworm eggs are passed in
the feces and can live in the soil for years, so dogs who dig or eat
grass can pick up eggs.
If caught early, whipworm can be treated with deworming medica-
tions that must be administered over extended periods of time.
Because of the long maturation cycle of young worms, a second
deworming is needed 75 days after the first one. Additional doses
may be necessary, as well.
Heartworm
A dangerous yet preventable parasite, heartworms live in an
infected dog’s upper heart and arteries, damaging its blood vessel
walls. Poor circulation ultimately causes heart failure. The parasite
is spread by mosquitoes. Adult heartworms produce tiny worms,
which circulate throughout the dog’s bloodstream. When a mos-
quito bites a dog, the mosquito picks up the worms and transmits
them to another dog.
The first signs of heartworm include breathing difficulty, coughing,
and lack of energy, though some dogs show no signs until it’s too
late. To confirm a diagnosis, your vet will take a blood test to look
for worms. He may also do an X-ray. If the test results are positive,
your vet will give your dog medication to kill the worms.
Preventive medications, however, are the best remedy. They are
easily available, and they’re very effective. If heartworm is preva-
lent in your area, your veterinarian will first do a blood test to
determine whether your dog is infected if your dog is over 6 months
old. Puppies under 6 months can be started on prevention without
testing. After a clean bill of health, your veterinarian will prescribe
preventive heartworm medication. Many of these medications also
provide a monthly deworming for roundworms, hookworms, and
whipworms.
Giardiasis
Commonly passed through wild animals, giardia, an intestinal para-
sitic protozoon, affects humans and animals and causes diarrhea
and lethargy. It’s often found in mountain streams, but it can also
be found in puddles or stagnant water. Your veterinarian will test
for giardiasis and can prescribe treatment, which consists of giving
your pet an oral antibiotic.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 209

Tapeworms
Spread by infected fleas or from eating rabbit entrails, tapeworms
live in an animal’s intestine, attach to the wall, and absorb nutrients.
They grow by creating new segments, which can often be seen
around the dog’s rectum or in her stool as small rice-like pieces.
Your veterinarian can treat the tapeworm by prescribing tablets
or giving your dog a series of injections, but a good flea-control
program is the best prevention against tapeworm infestation.
External parasites: Pesky critters
Fleas and ticks (and other bothersome bugs) are not fun on your
dog — or in your house! These parasites live off your pet’s blood.
They spread disease, including tapeworms (an internal parasite)
and Lyme disease.
Fleas are small, but they’re not invisible. If you see just one flea
crawling on your Boston or hopping in your carpet, for example,
chances are very high that there are many more. You may see your
pup scratching and biting to rid herself of the parasites, or you may
see her rolling on the floor to ease the discomfort. When combing
through your dog’s coat, you may also see white flea eggs or their
“dirt,” which can resemble specks of pepper.
Ticks look like brown or black sesame seeds with eight legs. They
won’t overrun your home like fleas can, but they will cause misery
as they suck your pup’s blood. Ticks prefer the area around your
dog’s head, neck, ears, and feet, and in the warm areas between
her legs and body.
If your pup is scratching but you’ve found no signs of fleas, she
may have mange mites. These microscopic marauders like the
areas around the elbows, hocks, ears, and face. They will need to
be identified by your veterinarian, who will scrape your pup’s skin
and inspect it under the microscope.
Thankfully, these pests can be controlled so you and your Boston
can enjoy the great outdoors together, where these critters are
commonly found.
Fleas
Fleas are small, crescent-shaped insects that suck the blood from
your Boston (see Figure 14-1). With their six legs and huge
abdomen, they can jump surprisingly far in proportion to their
size. Their bite causes allergic reactions in dogs and their humans,
causing itching, discomfort, and misery!
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
210

In large numbers — especially on a little dog like your Boston —
fleas can cause anemia and severe allergic reactions that can lead
to open sores and possibly a secondary infection.
Figure 14-1: Fleas pass through four phases, shown above, as they 
complete their life cycle. One female flea lays about 20 eggs per day 
and up to 600 in her lifetime.
Fleas also spread internal parasites, such as tapeworms. When a
dog swallows a tapeworm-infected flea, she then becomes infested
with tapeworm. In the past, fleas carried bubonic plague. These
parasites are a more than a nuisance — they are a real threat.
Luckily for your Boston, more flea-control options exist now than
ever before.
 Topical treatments: These treatments are applied to the pup’s
skin between the shoulder blades. The product is absorbed
through the dog’s skin into her system. The flea is killed when
it bites the animal or when its reproduction cycle is altered.
Different topical flea-control formulas have different active
ingredients, and the directions for one may differ from another.
Ask your veterinarian which product is right for your dog and
how the product should be applied.
 Systemic treatments: These treatments include pills that the
dog swallows. When the flea bites the dog, the chemical in the
pill is transmitted to the flea, which (depending on the product)
either prevents the flea’s eggs from developing or kills the
adult fleas, so the population dies off.
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 211

 Insect growth regulators (IGRs): IGRs stop immature fleas
from maturing and prevent them from reproducing, so the
population ceases to exist. Dispensed as foggers, sprays, and
in discs, IGRs can be used in the environment to stop bug
populations from thriving.
In addition to treating your Boston, you also need to treat your
house and the shady areas of your yard for complete flea eradica-
tion. The fleas will return if any one of the three is neglected. Treat
both the yard and the house with a spray that contains an IGR.
If you prefer a natural external parasite control, several plant-
based flea-control products are available over the counter. Some of
the more popular ones include pyrethrins, which are derived from
chrysanthemums, and citrus-based derivatives. They both work to
knock down the flea population, but they do little to eradicate an
infestation.
Ticks
Ticks are eight-legged bloodsuckers that latch on, embed their
head into your pet’s skin, and suck until they become engorged
with blood.
Like fleas, ticks carry blood-transmitted diseases, including Lyme
disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Lyme disease is charac-
terized by a lingering fever, joint pain, and neurological problems.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is characterized by muscle pain,
high fever, and skin sores.
Some flea-control products also deter ticks, but the best thing to
do is check your Boston after romps in tick-infested areas. During
the spring and summer, inspect your dog daily, paying close atten-
tion to the areas behind her ears, in the armpit area under her
front legs, and around her neck.
If you find a tick on your pet, you should remove it. Here’s how:
1. Use tweezers to grab hold of the tick as close to the skin
as possible.
2. Pull gently but firmly with a twisting motion. Dip the critter
in alcohol or flush it down the toilet so it can’t crawl back.
3. Put a little antibiotic ointment on the wound where the
tick was embedded.
Mange mites
Mange, or microscopic skin mites, causes your dog’s skin to swell
and form itchy, pus-filled scabs. The disease comes in two varieties:
sarcoptic mange, which is contagious to people and other pets, and
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
212

demodectic mange, which is not contagious. Your veterinarian will
do a skin scraping to determine which variety is plaguing your dog.
Dogs suffering from mange mites may scratch themselves fiercely.
Patches of skin look red and scaly, and they may have areas of thin-
ning hair around their eyes, mouth, and the fronts of their legs. In
more advanced infestations, crusty sores form and ooze, which
may lead to secondary infections. Treatment involves bathing in
medicated shampoos, and possibly antibiotics or steroids to
relieve the itching symptoms, and ivermectin injections or oral
solution. The heartworm prevention Revolution can also be used
to treat sarcoptic mange.
Ringworm
Ringworm isn’t a parasite at all. It’s a contagious fungus that infects
the skin and causes a red, ring-shaped, itchy rash. It spreads by
contact from other animals. Ringworm responds well to treatment,
but because it’s so contagious to people and other animals, the
plan must be followed diligently to eradicate the fungus.
Treatment for ringworm involves a three-pronged approach:
 Giving your Boston a pill that stops the fungus from growing
 Cleaning the affected area thoroughly and frequently with
iodine to kill the fungus on your pet
 Keeping your environment clean using antifungal solutions,
such as a 1-to-20 bleach-to-water ratio
To Spay or Neuter
Having your Boston fixed means having her spayed (or him
neutered), or rendering the dog unable to produce baby Bostons.
It may seem cruel and unusual, but the routine procedure is one of
the best things you can do for your dog’s health and happiness.
The surgery prevents certain diseases, like uterine and testicular
cancer, and it mellows out your Boston’s mood.
Spaying or neutering your Boston doesn’t cause personality
changes, but it does result in some positive behavioral changes.
Dogs who are spayed or neutered
 Exhibit less aggressive behavior than those who don’t have
surgery
 Are less likely to roam in search for a mate
 Are less likely to mark with urine or soil rugs and furniture
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 213

Most importantly, spaying or neutering your pet helps control the
pet overpopulation problem plaguing our country today. Countless
puppies find themselves relinquished to shelters because their
owners couldn’t find homes for them.
Growing up fast: Your Boston’s
sexual maturity
Dogs reach sexual maturity between the ages of 6 to 9 months old,
at which time they are capable of reproducing. Their voices don’t
start to crack, but their hormones begin to activate, and their
behavior starts to change.
Most females have their first estrus, or heat, cycle when they reach
6 months of age. The cycle, or season, begins with proestrus, which
is when she bleeds. It can last up to 15 days, and it marks the
beginning of the estrus cycle.
During the estrus cycle, the female is the most fertile and will emit
a pheromone that makes her more attractive to males. She may
even flirt and lift her rear in the air while wagging her tail back and
forth! Her behavior may also change. She may seem hyperactive or
stressed. The cycle typically lasts 21 to 30 days, though each dog’s
cycle differs. Female dogs are in season two times per year.
After a male dog reaches maturity, he can breed with a female in
heat at any time. If he’s not neutered, he’ll constantly sniff the air
in search of a female in season. He’ll also mark his territory by lift-
ing his leg and leaving behind his scent. Male dogs may also grasp
pillows or unsuspecting human legs and hump them!
Understanding the surgical 
procedures
Living with an unspayed female or intact male can certainly be a
challenge for you (for specifics, see the previous section). It’s no
fun for the dogs, either, unless they’re allowed to breed freely. But
that’s where spay or neuter surgery can make life with your Boston
pleasurable again.
Your veterinarian can perform a routine operation on your dog
under general anesthesia when he or she is about 6 months old,
or just before sexual maturity. Your Boston will feel no pain at all
during the surgery and a minimal amount after the surgery while
he or she recovers:
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
214

 Females are spayed. This process involves an ovariohysterec-
tomy, where the ovaries and uterus are removed surgically.
Your Boston will be out of sorts for a few days, but she’ll be
back to her old self in no time. Not only does this procedure
prevent unwanted puppies, but it also protects her from uter-
ine infection, ovarian cancer, and mammary gland cancer, and
prevents heat cycles.
 Males are neutered. Their testicles are removed through a
small incision just in front of the scrotum. Like the female, the
male will be less social for a few days, but he’ll quickly be back
to normal. An added benefit of neutering includes protection
from testicular cancer and reduced risk of prostate infections.
In some cases, you can take your pup home after he or she has
recovered from the surgery. In most cases, however, be prepared
to leave your Boston overnight so the staff can make sure that
everything went okay.
Making Annual Visits
The first visit to the veterinarian is just the beginning of many reg-
ular appointments to come for your Boston. Annual visits, just like
annual checkups for you, are a preventive step that ensures your
Boston’s continued good health. These appointments allow the
veterinarian to catch problems early before they turn into life-
threatening situations.
During an annual exam, your veterinarian will conduct an exam
similar to your Boston’s first visit. He will examine your dog’s over-
all health, check for any changes, and ask you questions about her
behavior. Your vet will check your dog’s vital organs and look at
her eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, as well as feeling her body for
tumors or sore spots (see Figure 14-2).
Your veterinarian may also ask you questions like these:
 How long have you had your Boston Terrier?
 When was the last time you took her to the veterinarian?
 Are you having any problems with her training?
 Do you plan to neuter (or spay) your dog (if it hasn’t already
been done)?
 How many hours a day do you spend with your Boston?
 What types of activities do you enjoy doing with your dog?
Chapter 14: Your Visit to the Veterinarian 215

 Do you notice any problems with her eating or eliminating?
 Is she drinking more than usual?
 Do you use a crate? How is her housetraining coming along?
 Have you noticed any signs of illness, such as lethargy, loose
stools, poor appetite, excessive sneezing or coughing, or any
discharge from her eyes, nose, or ears?
 What are you feeding your dog? How much?
 Does your dog display any troublesome behavior?
If everything checks out, you won’t need to visit the veterinarian
again for another year. But if something looks amiss, your vet may
recommend laboratory work or X-rays. The office will call with test
results as soon as they’re available.
With your veterinarian’s help, you can keep your Boston Terrier
healthy and strong for her lifetime. Disease prevention, annual vet-
erinary exams, and regular checks of your dog for physiological or
neurological changes will hopefully catch problems before they
become serious.

Breed-Specific Ailments
In This Chapter
 Understanding brachycephalic syndrome
 Recognizing respiratory difficulties
 Protecting your Boston’s ears and eyes
 Handling orthopedic problems
A
s a whole, Boston Terriers are healthy dogs with relatively
few breed-specific medical ailments. Their strong constitu-
tions are part of what makes them such long-lived companions,
often reaching their 11th or 12th birthdays without a hitch.
Your Boston’s unique look, however, predisposes him to certain
conditions, many of which can be attributed to his adorable flat
face and diminutive stature. In this chapter, you can get the 
lowdown about several breed-specific ailments that Bostons 
commonly face and discover how you can make your pup’s life
easier.
With a Snort and Wheeze
When you meet a Boston for the first time, his grunts and snuffles
may surprise you. But they’re normal. Those sounds characterize the
breed and, in time, you’ll grow to adore his little vocal oddities —
even if his snoring wakes you up every night!
Your Boston, like French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other dogs with flat-
tened faces, are referred to as being brachycephalic, which literally
means having a short, broad, almost spherical head. The word is
derived from Greek roots brachy meaning “short” and cephalic
meaning “head.”

Because your Boston has a shortened head, his mouth, nose, wind-
pipe, and larynx are shaped differently than other dogs’. This can
cause those quirky noises, but his head shape can also cause high
risk for heat stroke and breathing difficulties that can increase
stress on the heart. Most brachycephalic symptoms, however, are
not life threatening, but you need to make yourself aware of the
challenges your pup may face.
Challenged chompers
With their flat faces, brachycephalic dogs don’t have a lot of space
for their jaws and teeth. As a result, their jaws may develop abnor-
mally, and their mouths tend to be crowded, causing misaligned
teeth and bite problems.
The technical terms for these conditions are prognathia and teeth
crowding:
 Prognathia: Common among brachycephalic breeds, prog-
nathism is when the dog’s mandible, or lower part of the jaw,
is longer than his maxilla, or the upper jaw. This malocclusion,
or abnormal bite, is considered normal in dogs like your
Boston.
 Teeth crowding: Crowding occurs when there is inadequate
space for the teeth in the lower or upper jaw, resulting in
tooth contact or overlap. Because your Boston must fit
42 teeth in his shortened mouth, it’s likely that his teeth will
be misaligned.
A Boston with prognathia or crowded teeth requires you to be dili-
gent about his oral hygiene. A secondary effect of teeth crowding
is increased plaque with resulting gingivitis, or inflammation of the
gums, and a predisposition to periodontal disease, the most
common cause of tooth loss in dogs (and humans).
Brush your Boston’s teeth regularly to rid his mouth of plaque
buildup and bacteria that can lead to halitosis (bad breath), behav-
ior changes linked to oral pain, and gum infection. (Flip to Chapter
8 for details about how to brush your Boston’s teeth.)
If your Boston develops halitosis, chews his toys less frequently,
paws at his mouth, changes his eating habits, stops grooming him-
self, or shows any other signs of oral pain, contact your veterinarian.
She won’t recommend braces to straighten his teeth, but she may
inspect his mouth, give it a thorough cleaning, and treat any local-
ized infections.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
218

Upper-airway syndrome
Brachycephalic breeds can be born with abnormally small open-
ings to the nose or nasal cavity and relatively long soft palates
(the roof of the mouth). Dogs generally breathe through their
noses, so those affected by this upper-airway syndrome find it 
difficult to inhale through the narrow openings. As a result, they
must work harder to breathe, even at rest, and doing so results in
exaggerated breathing efforts.
Dogs who still can’t get enough oxygen often resort to breathing
out of their mouth, resulting in that wheezing and snorting so char-
acteristic of Bostons. In time, a lack of pressure within the airway
causes swelling of the soft palate — which is already long — further
obstructing airflow.
Telltale signs of upper-airway syndrome include
 Avoiding exercise
 Becoming short of breath after any mild exertion or stress
 Abnormal or noisy breathing when the dog becomes excited,
such as when you return home from work
 Refusing to walk in hot weather because of the dog’s inability
to release body heat through panting
 Cyanotic (blue) gums from lack of oxygen
 Snoring loudly while asleep
This condition can be quite debilitating. Upper-airway syndrome
may be life-threatening if your dog plays too exuberantly in hot
weather. If your pup shows strained breathing after excitement or
overexertion, and his breathing doesn’t return to normal within
5 to 10 minutes, call your veterinarian immediately and transport
your Boston to the nearest hospital for treatment.
You can, however, minimize difficulties for your Boston by
 Keeping his weight down. Obesity can further complicate
breathing problems.
 Exercising before the sun rises or after it sets during warm
weather, and keeping him inside on hot, humid days.
 Never leaving your Boston outside or alone on a hot day with
no shade or protection.
 Using a harness rather than a collar when going on walks.
 Closely monitoring your pup’s breathing.
Chapter 15: Breed-Specific Ailments 219

Some Bostons benefit from surgical procedures that enlarge the
nostril openings and shorten the long and swollen soft palate.
This operation should be performed while the pup is under a year
of age.
Tracheal hypoplasia
Brachycephalic breeds can be born with tracheal hypoplasia, or
an underdeveloped or narrow trachea. Dogs with this anatomical
disorder experience insufficient airflow through their trachea, or
windpipe, even during normal breathing at rest.
No treatments exist to correct this problem, but you can help your
Boston live with the condition. As with upper-airway syndrome
(see the previous section), make it a habit not to exercise your
Boston too forcibly or allow him to get overexcited. Doing so can
lead to increased fatigue or even collapse after strenuous tasks
or excitement. Clinical signs of respiratory difficulty, including
cyanotic gums or collapse, warrant an emergency call to your 
veterinarian.
As a preventive measure, outfit your Boston in a harness rather
than a collar for long treks. Pulling on the leash while walking can
aggravate his breathing difficulties. You should also avoid using
Martingale-style or choke collars if possible.
Dystocia: Birthing difficulties
Flat-faced breeds like your Boston typically have a narrow or small
pelvis. This anatomical feature causes dystocia, or difficult birth or
the inability to pass the fetus from the uterus through the birth
canal. To further complicate matters, brachycephalic fetuses also
have unusually large heads and wide shoulders, which further
hinder normal birthing activities.
It’s not uncommon for a pregnant Boston to have a Caesarian sec-
tion rather than a vaginal birth, especially if other females in the
family have required one.
Because you’ve likely had your female Boston spayed (or you’re
planning to do so!), this breed-specific challenge won’t affect your
dog. If you plan to breed your Boston, however, consult your vet-
erinarian for advice.

What Big Eyes You Have!
Boston Terriers’ eyes are set wide apart, square in the skull, with
the outside corners in line with the dog’s cheeks as viewed from
the front. It’s an endearing look, but because those eyes are so
prominent, they can be prone to external injury, cataracts, and
congenital defects.
If your Boston injures his eye or develops an eye problem, contact
your veterinarian immediately for an examination. Because eye
problems can worsen quickly, have them checked within 24 hours.
This section covers a few of the more common ocular problems.
Corneal ulcers
One of the most common ocular problems Boston Terriers experi-
ence is corneal ulcers, which are typically caused by trauma to the
eye. Because those Boston eyes protrude from their skulls, they
are more prone to scratches, scrapes, and pokes than other
breeds’ eyes. Superficial injuries to the cornea, or the transparent
outer tissue of the eye, can lead to infections or other more serious
problems.
Some common causes of corneal ulcers include
 Allergies to dander, dust, or dirt, which can cause your
Boston to paw at his eyes, scratching them.
 Foreign objects, such as sand, plant material, thorns, eye-
lashes, or flying debris, hitting the eye and scratching it.
 Getting too close to objects at eye level. Bostons who have
had their whiskers removed (typically for conformation trials)
lack sensory feelers and can misjudge the distance between
their face and an external object, like a plant, causing them to
rub against it.
 Other dogs accidentally scraping or bumping into your
Boston’s eyes.
If your Boston’s eyes appear red or irritated, if he keeps the eyelid
partially closed to avoid light, or if you see an abnormal discharge
coming from his eye, contact your veterinarian immediately.
Chapter 15: Breed-Specific Ailments 221

Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
222
Here are some things you can do to protect your Boston’s orbs:
 Avoid prolonged sun exposure. Invest in a dog-size sun visor
or some Doggles, which are available at most pet supply stores.
 Do not allow your Boston to ride in a car with his head out the
window. Even when you take your Boston on a bike ride and
let him sit in the basket or in a carrier, guard his eyes by
making him wear eye protection of some kind.
 Avoid long hikes on dusty trails. If at all possible, limit your
treks to grassy areas or paved roads. When you do hit the
trail, protect his eyes and carry dog eye wash with you so you
can rinse his eyes before he starts to scratch them.
 Keep dog eye wash in your travel and home first-aid kits.
 Landscape your yard with plants with minimal thorns,
branches, or other growths at your Boston’s eye height. If you
do have rose bushes, cacti, or bougainvillea, section those
areas off with fencing so your dog steers clear of them.
Cataracts
Another very common problem in Boston Terriers is cataracts,
both adult and juvenile varieties. A cataract is a spot, or opacity, of
any size in the lens of the eye. The opacity is usually white, creating
a milky appearance over the lens. The degree of vision impairment
depends on the size of the cataract and its location within the lens.
Cataracts can be inherited, caused by trauma to the eye, or the
result of other diseases, such as diabetes, or nutritional disorders
during puppyhood. In adults, they can appear at any age. In juve-
niles, they begin to show between 8 weeks and 12 months of age.
Most times, congenital cataracts don’t cause blindness, but they
can be a handicap, especially to young dogs.
Watch for these signs that may indicate your Boston is developing
cataracts:
 A bluish, white, or milky substance on his eye
 Acting surprised when you approach him from the side with
the cataract
 Tendency to bump into things, to hesitate before jumping up
or down, or to avoid unfamiliar environments
 Redness, inflammation, or drainage around the eye

If your Boston develops cataracts, here are some ways to make his
life a little easier:
 Keep objects in the house in consistent places.
 When outside, confine your dog to a fenced yard and always
walk your pup on a leash.
 If he shows signs of discomfort, this can indicate an underly-
ing cause. Talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s symp-
toms and ask about ways to ease his suffering.
Though you can’t stop cataracts from growing or reverse their
damage, they can be surgically corrected. Talk to your veterinarian
for more information about treating cataracts and getting a referral
to a veterinary ophthalmologist.
Bulging eyeballs
Normally, the eyelids cover and protect the eyeball so only a small
portion of the sclera, or white portion of the eye, is visible. With
Boston Terriers and other brachycephalic breeds, however, the
shortened facial bones and shallow bony orbit cause the eyeballs
to protrude, exposing more of the sclera — and the eyeball — to
the environment.
This abnormality, known as macroblepharon, or excessively long
eyelids around their bulging eyeballs, can lead to a macropalpebral
fissure, or an enlarged eyelid opening.
This condition is not life threatening, but it can look strange, espe-
cially to people who aren’t familiar with brachycephalic breeds.
Dogs with macroblepharon and macropalpebral fissures can have
red eyes due to excessive exposure to the environment. Other
complications include chronic tears or mucus, corneal melanosis
(black or brown pigmentation of the cornea), and defective eyelid
position or movement.
In severe cases of macroblepharon, the eyeball is susceptible to
proptosis, or forward protrusion of the eye, where the eyeball can
roll forward and pop out of the orbital socket. This trauma most
commonly occurs after a blunt blow to the head, pressure to the
neck, or a bite wound to the eye area. If this happens, it’s a medical
emergency and requires immediate medical care to save the eye-
ball and the dog’s vision.

224
Other eye problems
Those big, beautiful eyes are prone to a host of other ocular disor-
ders, too. Here are some of them:
Cherry eye
This ailment involves the tear gland that normally sits at the base
of the dog’s third eyelid. It can enlarge and protrude beyond the
leading edge of the displaced third eyelid, appearing as a round,
red mass (cherry eye).
Under veterinary supervision, the disorder can be treated with
topical anti-inflammatory medication to return the tear gland to its
normal size and prevent further irritation, but cherry eye almost
always requires surgical intervention to return the eye to its
normal appearance.
Abnormally growing eyelashes
Some Bostons suffer from distichiasis, a condition in which eye-
lashes grow from abnormal locations along the eyelid, damaging
the cornea and conjunctiva. The irritation can cause excessive
tearing with inflammation.
This conformation defect can be corrected by a veterinary oph-
thalmologist, who can remove the stray hairs by surgical excision
or by cryosurgery, a procedure that uses extreme cold (freezing) to
destroy unwanted tissue.
Glaucoma
Typically occurring in older dogs, glaucoma is a buildup of fluid,
causing pressure inside the eye. The pressure causes pain and
eventually destroys the retina (the light-sensitive layer of cells at
the back of the eye), which can lead to blindness.
An eye affected by glaucoma often appears bloodshot, or the
cornea may look cloudy. By the time the eye begins to enlarge or
swell, it’s likely that the dog is experiencing vision loss. If glaucoma
occurs in one eye, it’s likely that the other eye will develop it, too.
After glaucoma is diagnosed by your veterinarian, the disorder can
be treated through medical therapy, such as eye drops or pills that
decrease fluid production in the eye, or surgical procedures that
involve draining the excess fluid. Talk to your veterinarian about
the different options that are available.
If you suspect that your Boston has glaucoma, consider it an emer-
gency and contact your veterinarian immediately for an examination.

Rolled eyelids
Some Bostons experience entropion, where their eyelid rolls
inward so that the eyelashes and eyelid hairs rub against the
cornea, resulting in eyeball irritation or injury. Severe cases
require surgical correction.
Dry-eye syndrome
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), or dry-eye syndrome, is when a
Boston’s tear glands don’t produce enough tears. This results in
irritated eyes, corneal ulceration, and possible scarring. With vet-
erinary supervision, KCS can be treated with various topical 
therapies, including artificial tear solutions and ointments.
In chronic cases, surgery may be required.
Say What?
Boston Terriers exhibit a relatively high incidence of both unilateral
(one ear) and bilateral (both ears) deafness, especially among those
who have blue eyes or a high percentage of white in their coats.
Some geneticists link this congenital deafness to the piebald gene,
the gene for a white color, which can cause deafness in animals
with blue eyes and white coats.
Some breeders perform a hearing test on their puppies, called a
brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test, which detects elec-
trical activity in the cochlea (an area of the inner ear) and auditory
pathways in the brain. Bostons who test positive for deafness are
usually not bred, but they still make wonderful pets.
In unilaterally deaf dogs, most owners won’t even notice a prob-
lem. But with dogs who are deaf in both ears, the defect poses a
challenge because it eliminates the major line of communication
between you and the Boston. Most owners resort to training their
deaf dog with hand signals and other specialized techniques.
Here are some other ear problems that your Boston may develop:
 Outer-ear infection: Otitis externa, an infection of the outer
ear, occurs when wax, dirt, debris, and infectious material
falls down into the dog’s ear canal, or the outer ear. The mate-
rial collects and causes the canal to swell, trapping moisture
and creating an ideal environment for infection.
 External parasites: Ear mites, which are tiny arachnids related
to ticks and spiders, infest the ear canal of dogs and cats.
They cause a dry, reddish-brown wax that can block the ear
canal in some cases, which sets up an environment for infection.
Chapter 15: Breed-Specific Ailments 225

You can recognize signs of ear disease before they develop into
more serious problems, which could result in permanent damage.
Watch for these signs, and contact your veterinarian immediately if
you suspect your Boston is suffering.
 Shaking his head and ears
 Scratching at one or both ears
 A foul odor from one ear
 A yellow, brown, or black discharge from an ear
 Inflammation, redness, or swelling of the ear flap or opening
to his ear canal
 Pain when you touch on or around his ears
 Tilting his head to one side, or stumbling or circling to one side
 Tiredness or obvious loss of hearing
Trick Knees
In some Bostons, the bones, muscles, and ligaments surrounding
the kneecaps of their hind legs, or patellas, are too narrow, weak,
or shallow to keep the kneecaps in place. When a dog has a luxated
patella, the kneecaps slip in and out of position when the dog exer-
cises or jumps off the furniture. The dog hops and skips around
until his kneecap pops back into place. The knee can slip inward
toward the body or outward. Though this problem can be caused
by trauma, often it’s a genetic disorder.
You can provide ramps or steps down from high places to prevent
your Boston from leaping off the furniture and dislocating his
patella. Surgery can help correct the problem in chronic cases, but
your veterinarian can also prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to
help with the pain.

First Aid
In This Chapter
 Collecting items to include in your canine first-aid kit
 Handling common first-aid emergencies
 Deciding when to call for help
You can handle some of your Boston Terrier’s medical emergen-
cies; for more serious matters, you’ll need to seek immediate
veterinary attention. Used appropriately, first aid can spare your
Boston further injury and pain as you transport her to a medical
facility. Most importantly, first aid can save your dog’s life.
Your home should have a first-aid kit that contains a variety of
commonly used tools and supplies. You should also know how to
perform some basic tasks that allow you to stabilize your dog until
you can get her to the veterinarian. You can find out more about
these essentials in this chapter.
In addition to having the tools and the knowledge to care for your
Boston during her time of need, you also need to have ready access
to your vet’s office and after-hours emergency numbers. Having
these numbers handy will save you time when you need it most.
First-Aid Kit Essentials
Just as you have a human first-aid kit ready for handling common
emergencies, you should also have a canine first-aid kit available
for when your Boston cuts herself, gets into a skirmish, or heaven
forbid, breaks a bone or goes into shock.
You can find prepackaged first-aid kits at your pet specialty store,
or you can gather these items yourself and keep them in a promi-
nently labeled, water-tight container in an accessible spot or 
alongside your human first-aid kit. Let your family — and your
pet sitter — know where it is and what it contains, and make sure
everyone knows how to use each item.

Your first-aid kit should include:
 Tweezers
 Scissors
 Small nail clippers for small dogs or cats
 Rectal thermometer
 Tape
 Bandages (butterfly and standard)
 Elastic bandages
 Rolls of gauze
 Gauze pads of varying sizes, including eye pads
 Cotton balls or cotton swabs
 Instant cold compress or plastic bag for ice pack
 Antiseptic cleansing wipes
 Alcohol pads
 Saline eye wash
 Hydrogen peroxide, 3 percent (to disinfect wounds)
 Styptic powder (to stop bleeding)
 Benadryl tablets (to stop an allergic reaction)
 Syrup of ipecac (to induce vomiting)
 Kaopectate tablets or liquid (to treat diarrhea)
 Iodine (to sterilize wounds)
 Antibiotic ointment
 Bottle of water
 Pen and paper
 Old blanket or sheet
 An extra leash and collar
 Pen light
 Pet first-aid book, such as the American Red Cross’s Pet
First Aid: Cats and Dogs, by Bobbie Mammato, DVM, MPH 
(C.V. Mosby)
Check this kit often and replace supplies that have been used or
medications that have expired. If you don’t know how to use these
items, enroll in a basic first-aid course. The Red Cross offers a first-
aid course for dog owners. If that’s not available in your area, ask
your veterinarian for advice.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
228

If you travel with your dog, carry a portable first-aid kit with you
in your car or suitcase, as well. Find out more about traveling with
your dog in Chapter 13.
Knowing Normal Vitals
In emergencies, you’ll need to check your Boston’s vital signs,
which include her pulse, temperature, mucous membrane color,
and breathing rate. In the upcoming sections, I outline how to check
these vital signs and what your dog’s normal ranges should be.
Take time while your Boston is healthy to familiarize yourself with
her typical vital signs. Then if an emergency arises, you’ll know
how to take her vital signs and how far from the norm they are.
Pulse
A dog’s normal heart rate can range from 60 to 140 beats per
minute. The pulse, or heart beat, should be strong and robust.
An abnormally low heart rate, which can cause the dog to faint or
lose consciousness, should always be evaluated by a veterinarian.
An abnormally high heart rate may indicate that your dog is sick,
in pain, or under stress, and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.
Your Boston’s heart rate can be determined by palpating (feeling
with your hands and fingers) the lower chest wall behind the
shoulder or by feeling the pulse in the femoral artery, which is
located high on the inside of each thigh.
Temperature
Normal body temperature for dogs ranges from 100 degrees
Fahrenheit to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. It doesn’t begin to reach
dangerous levels until it exceeds 106 degrees Fahrenheit. Your dog’s
temperature will rise when she has a fever (an increase in body
temperature due to disease) or if she is hyperthermic (unable to
release heat as fast as she gains it).
Dogs with a fever will try to conserve heat by seeking a warm 
environment or by sleeping in a curled-up position; dogs who are
hyperthermic will pant excessively and seek a cool environment.
You can check your Boston’s temperature by using a small ther-
mometer well lubricated with petroleum jelly and inserted into
the rectum for about one minute.
Chapter 16: First Aid 229

Mucous membrane color
Mucous membranes line the surface of internal body cavities, such
as the gums in the mouth. Blood vessels in the mucous membranes
give them a pink hue (for resting dogs) or red hue (for active dogs).
When a dog experiences shock, blood loss, or anemia (low red blood
cell count), the gums appear pale or white. Gray or blue gums can
indicate low blood oxygen levels or other respiratory problems.
Check your dog’s gums periodically to see what her normal color-
ing is. When you exercise your dog or spend time outdoors, keep
an eye on her mucous membrane color to be sure she isn’t over-
heating or experiencing breathing difficulties.
Breathing rate
The normal breathing rate for a dog at rest can range from 12 breaths
per minute up to about 20 breaths per minute. Your dog’s breath-
ing rate indicates how well her respiratory system is functioning.
Pain, fever, fear, excitement, or respiratory disease will cause an
increase in her breathing rate. A dog with difficult breathing may
refuse to lie down and will often look anxious. If you notice a change
in your dog’s normal breathing pattern, consult your veterinarian
immediately.
Managing First-Aid Emergencies
If your Boston is in trouble, you’ll need to think and act quickly.
A Boston who is bleeding, going into shock, or overheating will
rely on you for emergency care. Your prompt, decisive reactions
can make the difference between life and death.
You should seek professional help in life-threatening situations like
severe injury or trauma. Do everything you can to stabilize the dog
by getting her out of danger, and then contact your veterinarian for
advice. You could save your Boston’s life.
In an emergency, always call ahead to describe the nature of
the problem and to let the staff know that you’re on your way.
You should keep the telephone numbers of your veterinarian,
emergency clinic, and poison control center accessible at all times.
The emergency guidelines in this section should not replace emer-
gency veterinary care. They are intended to assist you in caring for
your Boston until you can get her to appropriate emergency care.

230

Restraining your Boston
An injured Boston is not a happy dog. She’ll often panic, thrash,
fight restraints, bite, and claw anyone who touches her. Your loving
dog will turn into a frightened beast who isn’t thinking clearly. She
only wants to get away from the pain. In an emergency situation,
you’ll need to know how to restrain her so you can prevent her
from hurting herself further, and so you can protect yourself.
A muzzle can help in these situations.
You can make a muzzle out of pantyhose, a cotton bandage, a neck-
tie, or any 2-foot-long piece of fabric. Here’s what to do:
1. Tie a loose knot in the middle of the fabric, leaving a
large loop.
2. Pass the loop over the dog’s muzzle and cinch it tight
over the bridge of the dog’s nose.
3. Bring the ends of the fabric under the chin, tie a knot,
and draw the ends behind the ears, and tie again.
4. Take one of the ends of the fabric from behind the ears,
pass it over the dog’s forehead, and slip it under the loop
around the nose. Bring it back over the forehead.
This step ensures that the restraint won’t slip off your
Boston’s short snout.
5. Tie the two ends together firmly behind the ears but
not so tight that the muzzle interferes with your dog’s
breathing.
If possible, practice muzzling your dog in nonemergency situations
so you know what to do if the time comes. She won’t like it, but
you don’t want to be fumbling with the fabric during a critical time!
Transporting an injured dog
Your Boston is a small dog, so you’ll likely be able to transport her
in your arms, in her kennel, or in a sturdy container, like a laundry
basket or a cardboard box.
Practice by picking her up and rolling her onto her back so her
belly is up and her face is looking at yours. Cradle her in your
arms, supporting her hips with your hand and her head in your
forearm. Wrap her gently in a towel or blanket. If you need to put
her in a box, pick her up and carefully place her in a sturdy box
lined with an old blanket or towel.
Chapter 16: First Aid 231

Administering artificial respiration
If your dog isn’t breathing, you must perform mouth-to-nose artifi-
cial respiration. Take a deep breath and follow these steps:
1. Lay your Boston on her right side and clear any obstruc-
tions from her mouth. Gently pull her tongue out to the
side of her mouth so her airway isn’t blocked.
2. Clasp both hands around the dog’s muzzle, leaving her
mouth closed yet allowing access to her nostrils.
3. Extend the dog’s head (stretch her head and neck for-
ward from the body), inhale, and exhale gently into your
Boston’s nostrils, making an airtight seal between your
lips and your hands.
Make sure that the air doesn’t leak out and that her chest
rises and falls as you exhale.
4. Repeat every five to six seconds. Continue this process
until the dog breathes on her own or you can get her to
a clinic.
Performing heart massage (CPR)
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be performed if your
dog’s heart has stopped beating. The signs of cardiac arrest include
 Unconsciousness
 Stopped breathing
 Stopped heartbeat
 White or blue gums
 Wide dilation of her pupils
When performed properly, CPR can help restore breathing and car-
diac function in an emergency situation. Here’s what to do:
1. Lay your dog down on a flat, hard surface that won’t
bend when the chest is compressed.
2. Apply pressure with the flat part of your hand directly
over the heart area (just behind the front legs in the
lower half of the chest) with a force that’s appropriate for
your dog, and press firmly at a rate of about 70 times per
minute, being careful not to break her ribs.
The compression force should be enough to cause the
dog’s chest wall to compress about 50 percent.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
232

3. Release the compression completely for a brief period
each time to allow the blood to flow back into the chest.
4. Check the color of the dog’s gums.
If the procedure is producing blood flow, you should see
her mucus membrane color turn from white or gray to pink
or red. Also check for your dog’s femoral arterial pulse,
which is located high on the inside of each thigh.
5. Enlist the help of a second person to perform artificial
respiration after every three chest compressions.
6. If the heart hasn’t begun to beat after 5 to 10 minutes, it’s
probably not helpful to continue.
In the hospital setting, CPR is rarely performed after
30 minutes.
Common canine emergencies
Not all injuries require veterinary treatment. You can often handle
scrapes, superficial wounds, insect bites, and bruises at home.
You can observe your dog if she is experiencing mild vomiting
and diarrhea, monitoring the situation if it worsens.
Some medical emergencies, however, will require veterinary care.
Here, I list common medical emergencies that you can stabilize at
home before taking your pet to the emergency veterinary clinic.
Bleeding
Bleeding can occur from just about any injury. How you treat it
depends on the wound and its severity.
 A bruise: Apply an ice pack to the area in 15-minute intervals
(15 minutes on, 15 minutes off) until the swelling subsides.
 Minor cuts and scrapes: Wipe the wound clean with an alcohol
pad and apply pressure with a gauze pad until the bleeding
stops. Cover the cut with a bandage to keep it clean, changing
it as needed.
 Severe wounds: Apply several layers of gauze and bandage
snugly, being careful not to secure it too tight. If direct pressure
fails to slow the rate of bleeding, you may need to apply a
tourniquet. Using a length of gauze or cloth, tie the tourniquet
on the limb between the injury and the heart. The tourniquet
must be loosened for several minutes approximately every
10 minutes to allow blood flow to the tissue.
Severe wounds should be evaluated by a veterinarian, so as
soon as you control the bleeding, call your vet and take your
dog to the closest emergency veterinary clinic.
Chapter 16: First Aid 233

Shock
Shock occurs after a traumatic injury or during a serious, sudden
illness like heat stroke or accidental poisoning. It’s characterized
by the collapse of the cardiovascular system. Dogs in shock show
the following signs:
 They appear weak and listless.
 Their pupils may be dilated.
 Their pulse is weak and rapid.
 Their gums are pale.
 Their skin color is slow to return when pressed with a finger.
If you suspect your Boston is in shock, treat any visible injuries.
Keep her still, bundled in a blanket, and get her to a veterinarian
immediately. Shock is life-threatening, and when combined with a
traumatic injury, your dog could be in serious danger of dying.
Fractures
Fractures require immediate attention. A dog with a fractured or
broken bone will hold its limb in an unnatural position. Sometimes
a broken bone is visible through the skin. Muzzle your dog (see the
“Restraining your Boston” section earlier in the chapter for the
how-to), moving her as little as possible, and place her in a stable
box to transport her to the veterinarian. Try to support the broken
limb with a rolled-up magazine or cushion, if possible.
Heat stroke
Common in warm climates, dehydration or heat stroke can occur
when dogs are overexercised during hot temperatures. It can also
occur when dogs are left in cars on warm days or when kennel
areas aren’t ventilated properly.
A dog with heat stroke breathes rapidly, has a rapid heartbeat, and
has a high body temperature (104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher).
Depending on the severity, she may also be in shock. A danger-
ously overheated dog will likely die without proper veterinary
treatment.
Immediately spray your Boston with cool water, and pack ice in the
groin and around her head and neck. Wrap the dog in cold, wet
towels, and seek professional care immediately.
To prevent heat stroke, never leave your Boston alone inside a
closed car or in a poorly ventilated kennel on a hot day. Instead,
be sure she has fresh air, fresh water, and sufficient shade.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
234

Vomiting and diarrhea
An indicator of problems with your dog’s digestive system, vomit-
ing and diarrhea can be caused by anything from spicy food to
poison. Mild cases can be watched; contact a veterinarian if the 
situation worsens.
Excessive vomiting or diarrhea can cause dehydration, and that
can happen quickly in a small dog like your Boston, so make sure
she drinks plenty of water. If the condition doesn’t seem severe,
feed your dog a bland diet of plain cooked chicken and rice for the
first 12 hours. If her condition doesn’t improve, contact your vet.
Insect stings
If you suspect that your Boston has been stung by a bee or a wasp,
first determine where the sting happened and remove the stinger
by scraping it out or removing it with tweezers. Shave the area if
you need to so you can see the sting. Wash the area thoroughly,
bathe it with hydrogen peroxide, and watch for swelling.
Animal bites
Play fighting and wrestling with other dogs can sometimes get out
of hand, resulting in a small puncture wound or superficial injury.
If this happens, simply clean the wound and keep an eye on it.
Check with the owner of the other dog to be sure that the dog is
vaccinated. Any signs of infection warrant a call to the veterinarian.
If your Boston is attacked by a larger dog or an unknown dog, how-
ever, call your veterinarian right away. Some bites may require 
special treatment, like antibiotics. The attack may have caused
internal injuries or bleeding that needs to be treated immediately.
Attacks by cats or wild animals also necessitate a call to the vet.
Cat bites frequently cause infections, and bites from raccoons or
other wild creatures can put your Boston at risk for rabies.
Poisoning
Dogs love to explore and taste just about everything they come
across, but sometimes their curiosity gets them into trouble.
They may ingest something poisonous that they find in the garage,
in the yard, or in the house.
Symptoms of poisoning vary and depend on what substance your
Boston ate. Common signs include extreme salivation and drooling,
vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle tremors. The dog’s eyes may be
dilated, or she may suffer seizures. Rat poisons and other oral
rodenticides can produce internal bleeding, convulsions, and
death if not treated immediately.
Chapter 16: First Aid 235

If you suspect that your dog has ingested a poisonous substance,
call the ASPCA’s Animal Poison Control Center hotline at 888-426-4435
(you may be charged a $55 consultation fee) and contact your vet-
erinarian immediately. The longer the poison is in her system, the
more extensive the damage may be.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
236
Common household poisons
Store these and other common household poisons well out of your Boston’s reach:
 Antifreeze and other car fluids
 Bleach and other cleaning fluids
 Chocolate
 Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or prescription medications
 Insecticides and herbicides
 Rat, roach, or snail poison

Caring for the Senior Dog
In This Chapter
 Understanding what it means to own a senior dog
 Identifying age-related health changes
 Keeping your Boston comfortable as he ages
 Coping with the loss of your dog
You and your Boston Terrier have enjoyed a long and fun-filled
life together. You watched him mature from puppyhood to
adulthood, loving him and training him to be a well-mannered dog.
You cared for his every need, from filling his belly to taking him to
the veterinarian for regular checkups. In return, he looked up to
you as his leader. He has been your best friend.
The time will come when you realize that your Boston isn’t as spry
as he once was. He doesn’t dash to the door when visitors come to
visit or leap from his bed when you pull out his favorite toy. He’s
slowing down and losing the spring in his step. He’s getting old.
As he ages, your Boston will require some special treatment.
Though you can’t stop the aging process, you can do some things
that make him comfortable through his senior years. The remain-
ing days with your dog can then be filled with fun, love, and caring
until the time comes to say goodbye.
For more information about the topics covered in this chapter, pick
up Senior Dogs For Dummies by Susan McCullough (Wiley). The
book is chockfull of advice to help you care for your aging pet.
Knowing the Signs of Aging
Generally, small dogs live longer than big dogs, and your Boston
Terrier is no exception. By the age of 8 years old, your pup has
reached his senior years. Though he will likely live until he’s 11 or
12 years old, he will begin to show some signs of aging, including

 A loss of strength and flexibility
 An intolerance of cold and heat
 An increased susceptibility to certain diseases
 A gradual deterioration of organ functions
 A little gray around the edges — just like his pet parents!
Because of his increasing frailty, you need to protect him from envi-
ronmental stressors, such as allergies and temperature fluctuations.
You need to pay greater attention to his health problems, like cough-
ing and weight gain, and take him to the veterinarian more frequently
to screen for abnormal body functions. As he ages, you also need
to slowly change his diet, provide a comfortable living environ-
ment for him, and give him adequate and appropriate exercise.
Keep a closer eye on your Boston as the years pass. Watch for
signs of disease acquired in old age, including sudden weight loss,
appetite loss, diarrhea or vomiting, increased thirst without a
change in activity or urination level, excessive fatigue, limited
mobility, or coughing or excessive panting. If your Boston exhibits
any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately.
Age-Related Disorders
As your Boston’s body ages, it begins to break down and show signs
of wear and tear. His movements may become more deliberate, he
may gain weight, or he may become hard of hearing. You’ll notice
subtle changes in your pup’s personality and behavior as his birth-
days pass.
Following are some common age-related afflictions that you can
look out for as your Boston ages.
Arthritis
Arthritis is a degenerative joint disease that causes stiffness in the
joints, just as it does in humans. Age and wear cause the joints to
break down, which can be quite painful when your Boston tries to
get up from a nap or walk across the room. As he ages, you may
see him walk more slowly or hesitate before he moves. If you sus-
pect arthritis, consult with your veterinarian.
An X-ray of the affected joints will confirm an arthritis diagnosis.
Your vet will likely prescribe an anti-inflammatory or pain-relieving
medication to ease your dog’s stiffness and discomfort. She may
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
238

also recommend alternative treatments, such as massage,
acupuncture, or chiropractic work, to relieve pain or stress. Ask
her, too, if dietary supplements will help slow the degenerative
process.
Be aware that your Boston may be sore when you pick him up. If he
yelps, make note of the painful area and select a different area to
hold the next time you lift him. Make sure your vet is aware of any
yelping because that can signal more serious problems than arthri-
tis or simple aches and pains.
You can change your Boston’s environment to make it more 
comfortable for him and to ease the pain that arthritis can bring.
Buy him a cushy bed that’s soft and supportive, keeping it away
from cold drafts to keep his joints elastic. Move his food and
water bowls closer to his bed so he doesn’t have to walk as far
for food and drink. If you let him on the bed or couch, help him
up by providing a ramp or stairs. Do whatever you can to make his
life easier.
Just because he’s aging, however, doesn’t mean you should stop
exercising him. Continue to take your Boston on walks and let him
play in the warm sunshine. He may not walk three miles, but
moving his body will help him feel better.
Cancer
Just as treatments for human cancer continue to improve, scientists
are making advances in treating canine cancer, too. Chemotherapy,
radiation, and oncology care can be expensive, but cancer no
longer means a death sentence like it once did! Lives are being
saved every day, thanks to early detection and therapy.
Cancer can occur at any age, but it frequently presents at an older
age. It is one of the most common health problems senior dogs
may have. Abnormal cells grow out of control and damage healthy
tissue, affecting normal body function. Common canine cancers
include tumors of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, mammary
glands, bone, lymphoid tissues, blood-forming organs, and mouth,
though virtually any site may give rise to tumors.
Every lump and bump does not mean cancer, but it should be 
evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis. She will either
remove some tissue from the lump with a needle or perform a
biopsy to determine whether it is benign (not cancerous) or 
malignant (cancerous). If it is malignant, you and your veterinarian
can discuss the pros and cons of treating your dog.
Chapter 17: Caring for the Senior Dog 239

Deafness
Older dogs frequently suffer from impaired hearing. As they get
older, the sound receptors in their ears degenerate, causing grad-
ual hearing loss. It may seem like your Boston is ignoring you, but
he’s not! It’s likely that he’s a little hard of hearing.
If you suspect that your Boston is losing his hearing, take him
to your veterinarian to rule out an ear infection or generalized 
neurological disease. If he’s otherwise healthy, you can manage his
disability by using signal commands instead of verbal commands.
You’ll also want to watch him carefully when he’s outside because
he won’t be able to hear approaching cars or other dangers.
Dogs who are going deaf may be easily startled. Depending on your
Boston’s temperament, he may respond aggressively to surprises.
Diabetes
Diabetes mellitus is an abnormal increase in blood sugar levels that
is usually caused by an insulin deficiency. Though it is treatable,
diabetes can affect your Boston’s health and cause long-term com-
plications if left untreated, including blindness, infections, weight
loss, pancreatitis, and death.
The cause of insulin-dependant diabetes is unknown, but many fac-
tors contribute to its appearance in dogs. Genes, obesity, infection,
and inflammation of the pancreas may all play a role in developing
the disease.
Watch your Boston’s food and water intake. Clinical signs of dia-
betes mellitus include increased appetite and water consumption,
increased frequency and volume of urination, and weight loss.
If these signs go unnoticed, sudden blindness may occur because
of cataract formation, or diabetic ketoacidosis (ketone buildup in
the blood) may develop, resulting in lethargy and vomiting.
If your Boston develops insulin-dependant diabetes, your veteri-
narian will recommend that you adjust his diet to include food that
keeps his blood sugar level constant. You may also need to inject
insulin under your dog’s skin twice a day. Your veterinarian will
develop an individualized plan for you and your dog.
Eye disorders
Older dogs frequently suffer from cataracts, a cloudy white spot,
or opacity, on the lens of the eye that interferes with vision. As a
cataract forms, it causes lens protein to leak into the eye, which
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
240

triggers an immune response and inflammation. A veterinary 
ophthalmologist (eye doctor) can remove the cataract, but most
dogs handle gradual vision loss quite well, provided home furnish-
ings are kept stable so they learn how to weave through the room
and avoid obstacles.
Nuclear sclerosis, an age-related change in the structure of the lens,
also causes a cloudiness of the lens, but it doesn’t affect the vision
or produce any inflammation. Your veterinarian can determine
whether a cloudy eye is from a cataract or nuclear sclerosis.
Glaucoma, a buildup of pressure inside the eye, also comes with age.
An eye with glaucoma is often swollen and enlarged, and looks red
and weepy. If left untreated, it can cause blindness by destroying
the retina. Several medical treatment options are available. Your
veterinarian can recommend the right one for your Boston Terrier.
If your dog starts to lose his vision, make his treks though your
house easier by getting on your knees and making any necessary
accommodations. Avoid moving furniture, placing new objects in
his path, and leaving doors open. Remove sharp objects or other
dangers that can injure him, and put up a baby gate at the top of
the stairs to prevent falls.
Dogs who are going blind may not appreciate surprises, and as a
result, they may respond fearfully or aggressively, depending on
their temperament.
Heart problems
Your Boston’s heart pumps blood through four different chambers.
It uses valves that open and close to control blood flow through
the heart. All these movements create normal heart sounds.
As your dog ages, his heart valves become so worn that they fail to
close completely with the beating of the heart. Blood flows backward
through the partially closed valve, creating an abnormal heart
sound called a heart murmur. Small dogs, like Bostons, frequently
suffer from heart murmurs. It doesn’t cause death, but it should be
closely monitored by your veterinarian.
Poor dental care can cause some heart murmurs. When a dog’s teeth
aren’t brushed and cleaned properly, tartar builds up. Bacteria from
the tartar sheds into the bloodstream, and it can attach to the heart
valves and cause leaks or murmurs. Good oral hygiene — brushing
your dog’s teeth daily, and having a veterinarian check and clean
his pearly whites regularly — prevents tartar buildup, which
lessens the chances of your senior dog developing a heart murmur.
(Jump to Chapter 8 for details on how to brush your dog’s teeth.)
Chapter 17: Caring for the Senior Dog 241

Kidney disease
Though the kidneys can be injured at any time in the dog’s life
from infection, injury, shock, or an attack of the immune system,
geriatric dogs can suffer from chronic kidney disease, which is the
gradual deterioration of the kidney function. It is often incurable,
but you can manage the disease through veterinary care and diet.
Kidneys eliminate waste products from the dog’s blood stream and
regulate the body’s water content. When the kidneys fail, the entire
body shuts down, leading to serious illness and death.
If your senior Boston has unusually bad breath, becomes dehy-
drated, drinks a lot of water, and urinates frequently, he may have
kidney disease. Call your veterinarian, who will examine your
Boston and perform blood tests to determine whether your dog’s
kidneys are functioning properly.
Prescription diets available from your vet will help your dog’s kid-
neys to perform at their best. Monitor the amount of water your
Boston drinks, too. Depending on his activity level, 15-pound dogs
require 20 ounces (2 1⁄2 cups) of water per day; 20-pound dogs require
24 ounces (3 cups) of water per day. Call your veterinarian if your
Boston is drinking a lot more than that.
Obesity
As dogs age, they become less active and generally require fewer
calories than they did as puppies. Their metabolic rate (the speed
at which the body burns calories) slows, and if they continue to
eat the same amount, they will gain weight.
Weight gain can lead to a host of adverse health effects, including
diabetes, susceptibility to infection, shortened life, increased pres-
sure on vital organs and joints, and decreased energy. Obesity also
exacerbates problems brought on by arthritis. As your dog ages,
you need to keep his weight in check.
To keep off unwanted pounds, follow the same weight-control princi-
ples as for all other animals (including humans): Decrease his food
intake and increase his exercise. Talk to your veterinarian before
changing his diet or taking him for a run. She may recommend a
senior diet for your dog that has fewer calories or encourage you
to reduce the amount you feed your dog. She will also recommend
an appropriate exercise routine.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
242

Urinary incontinence
Older female dogs often develop a loss of voluntary bladder con-
trol, or urinary incontinence. As she ages, she loses the ability to
hold her urine, so you’ll find puddles in her bed, or you’ll see urine
drip from the vulva with her unaware.
Take your Boston to your veterinarian for a complete examination
and diagnosis. In some cases, you can manage your dog’s urinary
incontinence with oral medication; in others, you’ll need to put
some doggy diapers on your Boston to keep the mess under control.
Handling Your Senior Boston 
with Kid Gloves
When your Boston reaches his golden years, you’ll want to do
whatever you can to keep him comfortable. He may not eat as
much or play as much as he did when he was a pup, but he still
has a lot of love to give. Keeping him comfortable on a cushy bed,
taking him for short walks, and visiting your veterinarian will
ensure that he’ll be happy and healthy during the sunset of his life.
Veterinary visits
As with elderly people, some senior dogs require more frequent
visits to the doctor. New health issues crop up more often, and
it’s always better to get a professional opinion, even if it seems
like a minor ailment. It could be the beginning of a more serious
problem.
When you take your Boston to the veterinarian, load him gently
into the car, hooking his harness into the carrier or car seat, and
making sure that he’s safe and comfortable. At the office, remem-
ber that his hearing and sight won’t be as keen as it once was. Be
aware of intimidating dogs who may frighten him.
When your Boston reaches his eighth birthday or so, schedule a
veterinary visit for your geriatric dog. Your dog’s doctor will per-
form some screening exams to check your dog’s bodily functions,
to look for signs of disease, and to establish a baseline to measure
against as he ages. Tests may include a urinalysis, blood work, and
chest X-rays.
Chapter 17: Caring for the Senior Dog 243

If the doctor gives your elderly Boston a clean bill of health, you
won’t have to return until the following year (unless you notice
something out of the ordinary, of course). But if the veterinarian
sees signs of health problems or diagnoses your dog with a partic-
ular disease, plan to bring him in more often.
Nutrition
Throughout your Boston’s life, nutrition is a key component in his
overall health and vitality. Food provides the carbohydrates, fats,
protein, vitamins, and minerals that help your dog create enough
energy to tackle the world. When your Boston gets older, he doesn’t
need as much energy anymore. He’ll require fewer calories to keep
him going. Feeding him the same amount of food you did when he
was a teenager or adult will cause him to put on unwanted pounds,
which could lead to a variety of health issues.
Talk to your veterinarian about what type of diet your Boston
should be eating. She’ll most likely recommend one formulated for
senior dogs, or one that is lower in calories than an adult diet.
Forgo the treats, too, for more healthy alternatives. Instead of
giving her biscuits and goodies from the dog bakery all the time,
do so sparingly and intersperse crunchy vegetables among the
high-calorie choices. Don’t forget: Treats have calories, too, and
they pack on the pounds just like his regular diet!
Make sure that your Boston drinks plenty of water. If you notice
that he’s not drinking enough, add some water to his food bowl, or
mix his dry kibble with some canned food. Sometimes older dogs
can be fussy about their water bowls, so make sure that your
Boston’s bowl is clean and full of fresh water at all times. If you see
that your dog isn’t eating or drinking enough, contact your vet.
Exercise
All physically able dogs need exercise, even the older ones. Getting
up and moving helps him strengthen and tone his muscles and ten-
dons. It improves cardiac condition and it keeps his digestive tract
functioning as it should. It also keeps his weight in check.
Your Boston may not be able to hike five miles like he once did, but
he will enjoy a leisurely saunter around the block once a day to
keep his mind and body stimulated. Strap on his harness, attach
the lead, grab some pickup bags, and stroll to the park, letting him
sniff and investigate all along the way. Even on short walks, bring
along some water in case he gets thirsty or needs a break.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
244

As your dog ages, follow his lead when it comes to physical activ-
ity. If he wants to lounge around all day, that’s okay! If he wants to
play fetch for only 20 minutes, that’s okay! The point is to keep him
moving, even if it’s less frequently than before.
Bedding and sleeping area
There’s nothing like a cushy bed, especially if you have stiff joints
or aching bones. As your Boston ages, he’ll enjoy a big, comfort-
able dog bed with a soft blanket and his favorite plush toy. If you
can, place a cushion or bed in all the rooms where your Boston
relaxes. Make sure that it’s washable, just in case of an accident.
Because dogs with arthritis may not be able to jump on or off beds
and couches like they once did, purchase some soft dog stairs or
stack pillows from the floor to the bed or a chair for easy access.
Sometimes your Boston would rather cuddle with you than curl up
in his own bed!
Grooming
In general, Bostons don’t require too much grooming, and seniors
are no exception. With his short coat, he needs daily brushing with
a slicker brush to pull away the dead hair and with a bristle brush
to make the coat shine. He needs monthly nail trims and baths to
make his coat smell fresh. And he needs regular eye and ear checks
to inspect for any infections. Maintain a regular dental-cleaning
schedule, too, because you want those pearly whites to stay
healthy so he can eat!
Grooming time offers a perfect opportunity to look over your
Boston’s body for abnormal lumps, growths, or sore spots. As
you’re brushing him, feel all over his body and watch how he
reacts. You’ll know if something doesn’t seem right.
Bidding Adieu to Your Boston
You’ve raised your Boston since he was a puppy. You housetrained
him, cared for him, taught him how to sit, and saw him through
good times and bad. You shared adventures and built wonderful
memories together. When he was a puppy, you never imagined the
time would come to say goodbye. Suddenly, it’s right before you.
One of the hardest things to do is say goodbye to a beloved pet.
The thought of losing a companion is very painful, and as your
Boston reaches the end of his life, you will have to decide when it’s
time to let him to go.
Chapter 17: Caring for the Senior Dog 245

How to know when it’s time
In some cases, it’s easy to know when to let your pet go. If he has a
serious medical condition that takes him to emergency room, the
decision might be made for you, or if his kidneys fail or he has
heart failure, you know it’s time to say goodbye.
Other times, the decision isn’t so easy. It’s really up to you to
determine what you can watch your dog endure. Some people
can’t stand to see their dog lose his eyesight or his ability to climb
a flight of stairs. Others don’t want to see their pet in pain or suffer
through a terminal illness, like cancer. At the same time, some pet
owners don’t want to let their pet go. They’d rather wait until the
dog dies from natural causes. As in life, your Boston will rely on
you to make the best choice for him.
If your Boston has lost control of his urinary and bowel functions,
refuses to eat, can’t walk, or just seems completely disinterested
in his surroundings, think about putting him down. Why let him
struggle to cope with everyday life? Discuss the situation with your
family, and then consult with your veterinarian for advice. She will
evaluate your Boston’s condition and help you make the ultimate
decision: whether to euthanize him.
What to expect
Although the decision to put your dog to sleep can take days or
months, the act of euthanizing him takes only minutes.
Part IV: Health and Well-Being 
246
Leaving your pet in your will
If you die before your Boston, who will care for him?
Believe it or not, many people neglect this detail when they’re preparing their wills,
and their beloved pet winds up in an animal shelter.
Talk with your family and friends, and decide who will be a suitable caretaker if you
pass away before your dog. Perhaps your sister or son is willing to adopt your
Boston. Maybe you have a friend who already has a brood of Bostons, and she
would be happy to welcome another.
After you decide on a person, talk to your lawyer and include your pet in your will.
You may also decide to specify that a certain amount of money go to the person
caring for your Boston to cover the costs of food, veterinary care, and other pet-
related expenses.

At the clinic, you will be shown into an exam room or office-like
setting. After you say goodbye and give your Boston one last hug,
your veterinarian will inject a large dose of barbiturates into his
bloodstream, which causes his brain to stop functioning. He will
lose consciousness, his heart will stop beating, and he will stop
breathing. Some veterinarians administer a sedative before inject-
ing the barbiturates to calm the dog and reassure the owner that
the dog won’t suffer or feel afraid.
Euthanasia is a completely painless procedure. Your pup will drift
off into a deep, peaceful sleep before his bodily functions cease.
One minute, he’s looking up at you or the vet, and the next minute,
he’s gone. He experiences no fear at all.
Talk to your vet about whether she can come to your home to
euthanize your Boston. If not, schedule an office appointment early
or late in the day to avoid having to face a waiting room full of pets
and their parents. Let your vet know your feelings and trepidations
about putting your pet to sleep, and she’s likely to make the
process as easy as possible for you.
Some pet owners want to be with their pet during the procedure,
and some don’t. No matter what you decide, that choice is yours,
and it will be the right one for you. Either way, your veterinarian
will handle your dog humanely and with care.
You will feel the loss of your beloved pet, but he will be set free
from any suffering that he may be enduring. Sometimes, euthanasia
is the only thing you can do to alleviate the pain from a major ill-
nesses or trauma. If your veterinarian’s prognosis is that your dog
will continue to deteriorate, you have little choice.
Remembering your beloved Boston
Before your dog is put to sleep, talk to your veterinarian about
what you can do with his remains. Most clinics cremate deceased
animals there or at a remote facility. If you want to keep your
Boston’s ashes in an urn, or if you’d like to bury him in a pet-
sized coffin, let your vet know. She can make arrangements to
accommodate your request.
You’ve likely taken lots of photographs of your Boston throughout
his lifetime. As you’re grieving, take them out and look at them. Put
them in a photo album, jotting down significant memories or funny
stories that pop into your mind. Gathering the keepsakes together
helps perpetuate your pup’s memory.
Chapter 17: Caring for the Senior Dog 247

Talk about your pet with family and loved ones while you’re griev-
ing. Share memories and celebrate the time you all had together.
Let the tears flow; don’t be ashamed of your pain. Just because
your Boston was a dog doesn’t mean he didn’t significantly affect
your life! He was a part of your family, and you have every right to
mourn his passing.
Some people advocate rushing out and replacing your pup right
away. This may or may not be the best decision; only you know
whether you’re ready or if you need more time. No matter how
many pets you have in your life, each one occupies a special place
in your heart.

A tribute to cherished pets
This lovely poem offers hope for pet lovers who lose their furry friends. Grab a tissue
before you read it because this one’s a tear-jerker!
Rainbow Bridge
Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that
pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our 
special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food,
water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.
All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor.
Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we
remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are
happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very
special to them, who had to be left behind.
They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops
and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers.
Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his
legs carrying him faster and faster.
You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet,
you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy
kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and
you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your
life but never absent from your heart.
Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.

about Bostons

 Bostons making their mark
P
art of the fun of owning a Boston Terrier — or any purebred
dog, for that matter — is to acquaint yourself with fascinating
facts about the breed.
In this chapter, I list ten little-known bits of trivia about Boston
Terriers that you can use to impress friends and family members.
The Dogfather
J.P. Barnard, known as the father of the Boston Terrier, used his
dogs Tom and Mike at stud more than any other dogs at that time
through his kennels on Myrtle Street in Boston. Many consider
Mike to be the first to portray the 20th-century Boston Terrier look.
He was the sire (father) of Punch, one of the first Bostons registered
by the American Kennel Club.
An American Original
Boston Terriers join the American Water Spaniel, Toy Fox Terrier,
and Chesapeake Bay Retriever as one of the few dog breeds native
to the United States. Hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, Bostons
are such relative newcomers, in fact, that their ancestry can be
traced back to the beginning of the breed.
It all started with Hooper’s Judge, a bulldog-terrier blend, imported
from England in 1865 by Robert C. Hooper. Judge, with his dark

Part V: The Part of Tens 
252
brindle-and-white coat, was bred to Burnett’s Gyp, a stockier, block-
ier dog. They produced Well’s Eph, who was bred to Tobin’s Kate
and resulted in Barnard’s Tom, owned by J.P. Barnard. That dog
was considered to be the first true representative of the Boston
Terrier breed.
What’s in a Name?
On February 27, 1893, the Boston Terrier was recognized by the
AKC. But the breed wasn’t always known by that name. Before
1889, fanciers and breeders of this bulldog-terrier blend referred
to their dogs as the “round-headed bulldog,” “Boston bulldog,”
“toy bulldog,” and “bullet head.” Fitting names, indeed!
In 1889, a group of 40 breeders led by Charles F. Leland gathered
and began to keep breeding records of these bulldog-terrier blends.
They called themselves the American Bull Terrier Club and actively
sought AKC approval of the breed.
In 1891, the group applied for admission into the AKC stud book.
Bulldog and Bull Terrier fanciers, however, lobbied against accept-
ance of the breed, citing concerns about the inconsistent breeding
program and the confusing name “American Bull Terrier.”
After two years of discussions between the AKC committee and the
Boston breeders, they decided that only one cross to a Bulldog or
a Bull Terrier would be allowed, and that it could only be in the third
generation. They also decided that because the dog originated in
Boston, he should be called the Boston Terrier.
Manly Moniker
As dapper and well-mannered as any four-legged companion,
Boston Terriers have earned the nickname “American Gentleman”
for their polite and amiable personalities. With a subdued terrier
temperament, most Bostons are alert, loving, intelligent, and
devoted: traits embodied by any true “gentleman.”
Top Billing
At the beginning of the 20th century, Boston Terriers’ popularity
soared. The Boston Terrier Club of America’s records show that
between 1905 and 1935, Bostons held one of the top two spots
among the AKC’s registered breeds. Between 1921 and 1934,
90,000 Bostons were listed with the registry.

Chapter 18: Ten Trivia Tidbits about Bostons 253
From 1920 through 1964, Bostons remained among the top-ten
most popular dogs registered with the AKC. Today, Bostons still
rank relatively high, typically falling within the top-20 registered
breeds. They ranked the 15th most popular breed in 2006.
Little Men on Campus
Boston University’s Rhett became the college’s official mascot on
November 15, 1922. Named after a character from Gone with the
Wind, Rhett attends soccer, basketball, and lacrosse games. 
He performs on the ice during hockey game intermissions. He even
makes special appearances on the BU campus, at area hospitals,
and at local schools for holiday events. Rhett has become a
national celebrity, being named an All-American mascot in 1996
and placing fourth in the National Mascot Championships in 2002.
Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina, boasts three
Boston Terrier mascots in its athletic program. Boss the Terrier
has entertained Wofford fans since 2001 at football, basketball, and
baseball games. Lil’ Ruff, a pint-size version of Boss, entertains kids
at sporting events and graces the cover of “Terrier Tales,” a read-
ing program started in 2006 at the Spartanburg County Library.
Blitz, a real-live Boston Terrier, was named the official mascot of
the Wofford Athletic Department in 2003. Owned by Chris and Jean
Williams, Blitz patrols the sidelines at every home football game.
Popular beyond Boston
Understandably, Boston Terriers enjoy a huge popularity in Boston,
but not as much as they once did. AKC statistics show a steady
decline in Boston registration in the city, from ranking 8th in 2004
to 10th in 2005, and slipping to 11th in 2006.
Other cities, however, have embraced the Boston. Portland, Oregon;
Sacramento, California; and Seattle, Washington, for example, 
welcomed the Boston on their lists of top-ten registered dog
breeds in 2006.
The Incredible Shrinking Dog
The Boston Terrier’s breed standard states that the dog should
weigh between 10 and 25 pounds. In the early days, however,
Bostons weighed anywhere from a petite 7 pounds to a hefty
35 pounds.

After the AKC acknowledged Bostons as an official breed in 1893,
breeders and fanciers began to standardize the dog. Its color mark-
ings became symmetrical, its “American Gentleman” demeanor
was developed, and its body shape evolved from that of a blocky
bulldog to a wiry terrier.
State of the Boston
As a testament to the Boston’s popularity in its home state,
Massachusetts Boston fanciers started a movement to have the
Boston Terrier named the state dog. In 1979, Gov. Edward Joseph
King made it official. Boston Terriers now join wild turkeys, the
Morgan horse, and the tabby cat as the official dog, bird, horse,
and cat of Massachusetts.
Odds ’n’ Ends
Boston Terriers have enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame. Here are
some celebrity Bostons and their owners:
 In the original book version of L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful
Wizard of Oz, Toto is believed to be a Yorkshire Terrier, being
described as a “little black dog with long silky hair.” Most people
recognize Toto as a Cairn Terrier from the 1939 film version.
But in later books in the Oz series, Toto transforms into a
Boston Terrier.
 Helen Keller’s classmates from Radcliffe College gave her a
Boston Terrier named Sir Thomas Belvedere. He became one
of her canine companions during her life.
 Badger the Boston Terrier starred in a trilogy of MasterCard
commercials in 2004. In the ads, his family accidentally leaves
him behind in the Redwoods, but Badger makes it home,
encountering various acts of kindness from strangers along
the way.
 Hollywood celebrity Joan Rivers shares her life with Lulu, a
Boston Terrier. Denise Richards, former Bond girl, also owns
two Bostons: Lucy and Stella.

Chapter 19
Ten Ways to Make 
Your Boston’s Day
In This Chapter
 Giving your Boston treats and toys
 Organizing get-togethers for your dog and his canine friends
 Getting out and exploring with your Boston
W
hat you wouldn’t do for your Boston! Being your best
friend, a source of entertainment, and all-around great pet,
there’s no doubt that you want to give him the best things in life.
In this chapter, I’ve listed some ways to truly bring a smile to your
Boston’s adorable face. Not only are these activities healthy and
fun, but they also strengthen the bond between you and your pet.
Get the Day Off to a Good Start
A healthy breakfast fuels your Boston’s fun. What better way to make
his day than to give him a bowl full of nutritious kibble or wet food?
The protein, carbohydrates, and fats give him the energy to patrol
the yard, play fetch, and be your little shadow for the whole day.
He also needs a cool drink to wash his kibble down, so provide a
clean bowl of chilled water alongside his food bowl. Keep an eye on
it all day, too, to be sure that he has fresh water available whenever
he wants it. (Chapter 7 gives you the scoop on feeding your pup.)
Take a Walk
With his adorable snub-nose mug, your Boston is likely to be the
most popular pup in the neighborhood. Another way to make your
Boston’s day is to take him on a stroll to visit his human and
canine friends around the block.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
256
Get his gear together and prepare to hit the road. Put on a colorful
collar with an ID tag, attach a matching leash, and grab some
pickup bags and treats for on-the-road cleanup and rewards. Then
it’s time to head out!
Stroll to the Park
If you’re lucky enough to have a dog park in your neighborhood,
it’s a perfect destination when walking your Boston. Dog parks are
generally fenced-in play areas where dog owners let their pets
stretch their legs, run free, and romp with their canine friends.
Before you take your pup to a dog park, make sure he’s up to
date on all his vaccinations, including rabies and bordetella
(kennel cough). Check his ID tag, too, and purchase a new one if
any of the information is outdated or unreadable.
Throw a Party
You host parties for yourself or your child, so why not throw a
bash for your Boston, too! Consider birthday parties, play dates,
holiday parties, and so on as fun excuses for bringing together
your friends and their pets.
Give Your Boston a Bone
Most dogs love chew toys like bones, knuckles, Kongs, and
other hard-plastic toys. These items, which keep tartar and
plaque from forming on his teeth, can be found at your local pet-
specialty store, and they come in a range of flavors, styles, and
sizes. Choose one that’s sized appropriately for your pup — and
one that he likes!
Take a Spa Day
Though a deep doggy massage should only be done by a trained
professional, you can give your Boston a light rubdown during his
bath, while you’re grooming him, or while you’re watching televi-
sion. Follow these simple steps:

1. Have your dog lay on a soft, firm surface, like a carpeted
floor or rug. Starting from his head, gently stroke your
fingers down his body to his tail.
2. When your pup begins to relax, rub his cheeks, under his
chin, and behind his ears.
3. Move down his neck and shoulders in circular patterns,
feeling for any burrs or lumps.
4. Massage his legs and feet, taking a look at his toes
and pads.
Bake Your Boston Some Cookies
You can make your Boston’s day by whipping up some homemade
treats from scratch. This peanut butter cookie recipe given to me
by a friend makes the kitchen smell like you’re baking tempting
goodies for humans!
Puppy Peanut-Buttery Cookies
1 to 1 1⁄2 cups flour
3⁄4 cup oatmeal
1⁄4 cup wheat germ
1⁄4 cup crunchy peanut butter
1⁄4 cup vegetable oil
1⁄4 cup honey
1 tsp baking powder
1⁄2 cup water
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Combine all ingredients and mix on low until blended.
The batter should be the consistency of human cookie
dough.
3. Form into tablespoon-sized balls and place on an
ungreased cookie sheet 3–4 inches apart.
4. Flatten balls to a 1⁄4-inch thickness using the tines of a fork.
5. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden brown.
Yield: About 20 cookies
Chapter 19: Ten Ways to Make Your Boston's Day 257

Toss a Ball
Most Bostons love to play fetch with a flying disc, tennis ball, or
squeaky toy. It’s great exercise for him and quality bonding time
for both of you.
When choosing a toy to toss, make sure that it doesn’t have little
parts that your Boston may chew off and accidentally swallow.
Also make sure the toy is sized appropriately for your dog. A ball
that’s too small can be a choking hazard, while a ball that’s too
large can be unwieldy for your small dog.
Do Some Homework
If you and your dog are enrolled in puppy kindergarten or basic
obedience class, take some time out of your day to practice his
commands with him.
Puppy kindergarten, which introduces you to dog-behavior funda-
mentals, will require you to practice Settle, Sit, and Stay, three
basic commands that teach your dog that you are the pack leader.
Basic obedience builds on those commands and adds several
others, including Leave It and Heel. (Chapter 11 covers all of
these commands.)
Grab some small pieces of cheese or chunks of turkey and go 
outside on the lawn or driveway to practice what you’ve learned.
After 20 minutes a day of practice, you and your Boston will be
earning A’s in no time!
Enjoy Each Other’s Company
There’s no better way to make your dog’s day than to spend some
quality time together sitting on the porch, under the stars, or in
front of a warm fire. It’s good for him — and it’s good for you, too!

Though Bostons’ ancestors were once fighters, the dog’s “American Gentleman” nickname
tells a different tale,as you can read about in Chapter 1.The Boston Terrier is an intelligent,
playful,affectionate breed that thrives on companionship.
©JEAN FOGLE

When you look at a Boston
Terrier,the first thing you’ll
notice is his square,compact
build and tough-guy stance.His
square-looking head,shortened
snout,and erect ears give him an 
alert and kind expression.
Through years of careful breeding,
the Boston Terrier’s tuxedo-like coat
pattern — a white muzzle band,
white blaze between his large eyes,
white chest,and white boots on a
black or brindle body — has
become a hallmark of the breed.
You can read about the Boston’s
breed standards in Chapter 2.
Boston Terriers are a healthy breed,but they
are susceptible to several medical conditions
related to their conformation.Your Boston
may snort and wheeze because of a narrow
trachea and elongated soft palate.To learn
more about breed-specific ailments,skip to
Chapter 15.

When you know a Boston
is the breed for you,you
have several other deci-
sions to make,including:
Do you want a male or a
female? Do you want a
puppy or an adult? Turn
to Chapter 4 for more
information about how
to choose the right
Boston for you.
Who can resist that face?
Boston Terriers are known for
their amiable personalities
and adorable expressions.
You and your pup can expect
attention wherever you go —
whether it’s to the pet store,
the local bistro,or even at
home watching the world
pass by.
As ever-attentive compan-
ions,Bostons make ideal
indoor dogs in virtually any
household — from small
apartments with one or
two people to large homes
filled with family mem-
bers.Chapter 6 describes
how you can help your new
pup fit into your life.

Boston Terriers get
along well with 
children,particularly
those who understand
how to act around
dogs.When you begin
to socialize your
Boston (check out
Chapter 10),include
children in the mix —
supervised by you,of
course — and make
sure that the child
understands
the ground rules.
Your Boston and your cat
(or other family pet) can
become friends,but it
takes time and planning
on your part.Introduce
the two slowly and
always keep your dog
controlled.Find out
more about managing
multiple-pet households
in Chapter 6.
As an ever-eager travel
companion,your Boston
will need his own 
suitcase when you take
him on a road trip.Make
sure to pack portable
water and food dishes,
a travel first-aid kit,a
leash and collar with
updated ID tags,and a
favorite squeaky toy.
Trek to Chapter 13 for
more travel tips.

A crate or kennel serves as
your Boston’s safe and cozy
den,his travel carrier in the
car or airplane,and his home
away from home.As you
read in Chapter 9,it also
serves as a training tool
while you’re teaching him
bladder control.
To ensure your Boston stays healthy
and happy,he’ll need regular visits to
the veterinarian.Your dog’s doctor
will give him vaccinations,make
sure he’s growing up strong,and
answer any questions you may have.
Chapter 14 describes how to find a
veterinarian and what you can expect
during your pup’s annual visits.
Bostons don’t tolerate
extreme cold very well,
so your pup will need
some dandy duds to keep
him warm.Choose a coat
that is designed for a
small dog,is easy to put
on and take off,and can
be cleaned.Flip to
Chapter 5 for more 
fashion tips for your pup.

Chewing is a normal puppy
behavior,but that doesn’t
mean you have to sacrifice
your favorite slippers! Offer
your Boston puppy a chew
toy designed especially for
growing dogs.For more
puppy-product know-how,
turn to Chapter 5.
Though you’ll train your
Boston to be a well-
behaved gentleman,
he’ll still get into trouble.
Correct him by 
redirecting his action,
and always use positive
reinforcement to shape
your Boston’s behavior.
Chapter 11 describes
ways to encourage your
pup to be a good boy.
To give your Boston
gusto,he needs a 
quality diet packed
with digestible 
protein,carbohydrates,
fats,minerals,and 
vitamins.He also 
needs access to clean,
fresh water all the
time.Chapter 7
describes the dietary
delights that your 
pup will savor.

Tapping into their terrier
roots,Boston Terriers
enjoy active play,whether
it be agility challenges,
obedience trials,or a fun
game of fetch.Here,Kazoo
darts through a tunnel
during an agility trial,
which also includes
jumps,weave poles,and
maneuvering through
obstacles.Chapter 12 has
more information about
these sports.
It takes practice for a
Boston to fly
through the air and
leap over an 
obstacle! Boston
Terrier clubs can 
provide information
about practice 
courses and local
and regional 
competitions.
Weaving through poles and
leaping over hurdles expends
a lot of Boston energy.If it’s
hot and your dog shows signs
of respiratory distress,such as
labored breathing or pale
gums,calm him down.Wait 5
to 10 minutes,and if your
pup’s breathing doesn’t return
to normal,call your veterinari-
an immediately.

Because your Boston wears a short coat,grooming him is a relatively simple task,as you find
out in Chapter 8.Plan to brush him daily,brush his teeth and check his body once a week,and
bathe him once a month — unless he decides to roll in the mud,of course!
