Top-10 Dealer” award eight times since then and has received numerous
other awards for GoldMine training and best practices.

Author’s Acknowledgments
This is my sixth For Dummies book. Wiley, the publisher, may contend it’s the
fifth. Opinions vary on this issue. In any event, it’s been great fun, a great
challenge, and a great learning experience. Each time it’s been different
because the editors change, the rules change, and the software changes. 
I had two editors this time, and, to be honest, they were two of the best. Gary
Klingler was, without a doubt, the best technical editor I have ever worked
with. It makes a big difference working with someone who not only knows the
product but also can make congenial and constructive suggestions rather
than just saying “that’s stupid!”
Susan Christophersen had the unenviable task of turning my English into For
Dummies English. Those are apparently two separate dialects of the English
language. I have to thank her for her patience and grace under pressure. But
I still think “select” and “choose” are pretty much the same thing.
I also want to be sure I acknowledge the one and only FrontRange employee
who understood that having another GoldMine For Dummies book could only
be a good thing for everyone. The only person who made sure I had early
copies of the software so that I could start writing. Politics at FrontRange
being what it is these days, I think I will have to keep that name a secret so
that I don’t get anyone in trouble. But, I do thank you.
In Memoriam:
GoldMine Standard has met its demise — a victim of negligent homicide. It
didn’t need to be discontinued and surely not the way it was.
So many of my good friends from the glory days of GoldMine have moved on.
It was so much fun. Now it’s time for me to do something else, too.

GoldMine 8 For Dummies 
xx

Introduction
You finally decided to get your professional life organized! Great. You
bought and installed a copy of GoldMine 8 (also known as GoldMine
Premium), or your boss decided to buy it, had it installed on your computer,
and then told you to figure out how to use it. If either of these situations
applies, then GoldMine 8 For Dummies is for you.
GoldMine 8 is part of a larger family of GoldMine products. And GoldMine
itself belongs to a larger family of CRM software. Most people believe that
“CRM” stands for “Customer Relationship Management.” A better way to
think of CRM is as “Client Relationship Management.” Clients are customers
about whom you actually know something, and GoldMine will definitely help
you keep track of what your clients are all about.
Reading this book and, more important, using this software will dramatically
improve your life. You will soon be taller and thinner. Smarter and faster. Rich
and famous (or richer and more famous), too. Anyway, it has worked for me.
The Various Flavors of GoldMine
Back in the day, that is, back in the late 1980s when GoldMine first appeared,
it had just one flavor. It was based on an old, venerable file structure called
“dBase.” Then, GoldMine was just called “GoldMine.” There was no need for
any further distinctions.
As we speak (it’s the summer of 2007 as I finish this), GoldMine comes in sev-
eral varieties. It depends on how you count. FrontRange, the manufacturer,
calls them “editions.” Before you get any further into this book, it’s important
to understand just a little of the history as well as the differences between
the several editions.
GoldMine Standard 
GoldMine Standard (a.k.a. “GoldMine,” “GoldMine BCM,” or “GoldMine
dBase”) was where it all started. The latest version within this edition is 6.7.
FrontRange has announced that it has “sunsetted” this edition. Sunsetting
means that no further development will occur. Support from FrontRange will
be discontinued, and eventually you will not even be able to purchase this
edition. The same scenario applies to GoldSync.

2
GoldMine 8 For Dummies 
As Microsoft continues to develop new operating systems and as you
inevitably convert your computers to these operating systems (for example,
Vista), eventually your GoldMine Standard Edition may no longer even work.
Perhaps a groundswell of public opinion could convince management at
FrontRange to rethink its position.
GoldMine Corporate 
GoldMine Standard’s big brother is the Corporate Edition, which is powered
by Microsoft SQL. It made its first fledgling appearance back in the days of
GoldMine 4 when it was originally called “Front Office” or “Service and
Support.”
The SQL engine makes the Corporate Edition of GoldMine capable of handling
more users and more records, and it has much more capacity for integrating
with other applications. 
On the surface, GoldMine Corporate and GoldMine Standard look and func-
tion in very much the same way.
GoldMine Corporate has not been scheduled for sunsetting. In fact, there is a
continuing development and support plan at least through 2009. The current
version of GoldMine Corporate is 7.0.
GoldMine Premium
GoldMine Premium, also known as GoldMine 8, is the topic of this book. From
this point on, I refer to GoldMine 8 simply as “GoldMine.”
If you are running any edition prior to GoldMine 8 or GoldMine Enterprise, you
are about to begin reading the wrong book. GoldMine 8’s user interface is so
dramatically different from its predecessors’ interface that you will find this
book to be nearly useless as a navigational aid for any prior edition. Of
course, if your intent is to learn the new features in case you might want to
upgrade, just keep reading.
FrontRange has almost completely overhauled the user interface, bringing it
into the twenty-first century. Also, FrontRange has added a customer-support
module. This is the area in which to track and manage customer or product
issues and is the long-awaited answer to the many competitive systems out
there with such capabilities. 

GoldMine Enterprise
GoldMine Enterprise is definitely not your mother’s GoldMine. In fact, it has
very little to do with any other edition of GoldMine. It is a much higher pow-
ered, more expensive, .NET product with more capability than any other edi-
tion of GoldMine. Its table structure, its screens, its potential for
customization, and its price tag far exceed those of all its relatives.
How to Use This Book
GoldMine 8 For Dummies is divided into eight parts. You should be able to
comfortably read the book from start to finish, if you want, with one or two
breaks. Well, maybe a few more than that. On the other hand, this book is
designed as a reference book, with each chapter standing on its own. 
You’ll get the most benefit from this book by sitting in front of your computer
with GoldMine on the screen. It’s easy to convince yourself that you’ve got it
by just reading, but you’ll find no substitute for trying the steps yourself.
Experimenting with sample data is sometimes just the ticket to an epiphany.
I try to provide the easiest method to accomplish any particular task. If you
find another way, by all means use it.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you have some basic computer and Windows skills and that
you’ve used some sort of e-mail before. Regarding CRM, however, I assume
that you’ve just returned from a long mission to Mars and need to start using
CRM by tomorrow.
I also assume that you have a basic understanding of database concepts. If
you’re comfortable with fields, records, files, folders, and how they relate to
each other, you’ll be fine. If this is already sounding bad, you can seek help at
most community colleges or local computer-training facilities. Or just ask any
12-year-old.
If you intend to be your own CRM administrator (backing up files and assign-
ing user names, passwords, and access rights), you need to understand
records, files, folders, and networks. If you just want to be a good day-to-day
user of CRM, make sure that you understand what a file is and how to locate
one using Windows Explorer.

Introduction

How This Book Is Organized
This book has too many parts. Each part stands on its own, but you’re best
off if you at least skim through the basics before diving into the more com-
plex material.
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics
This part gives you an overview of what GoldMine is all about and provides a
tour of the main GoldMine screen. I discuss navigating within the new user
interface in detail. I explain how to set up all your custom preferences and
your options for accessing your GoldMine data remotely.
Part II: Managing Contacts
This part shows you how to enter new records and find the ones that are
already in the system. Additional contacts, a concept unique to GoldMine, is
the next topic. You learn how to make use of the one-to-many Details and
Referrals. And, to gather together similar kinds of records, I review filters,
groups, and SQL Queries.
Part III: Managing Activities
In this part, you learn how to schedule activities for yourself and others and
how to make sure that nothing ever falls through the cracks. All scheduled
activities need to eventually be completed in some fashion, and I show you
how to do this — five different ways. If you’re in sales, you will also want to
visit the chapter on sales forecasting. If you’re in support, you’ll benefit from
the special activities called “cases” that I discuss in Part IV.
Part IV: Marketing and Support
In this part, I discuss how to manage all your leads and how to monitor the
marketing you do through GoldMine. The new Customer Support section is
discussed in detail because it is one of the most important new features in
GoldMine 8.

GoldMine 8 For Dummies 

Part V: Managing Documents
GoldMine has long had its own e-mail client; it can also integrate with
Outlook. I discuss the pros and cons of each and show you how to use both.
Linking to Microsoft Word and using template documents is a very powerful
feature of GoldMine; I discuss that here in Part V. Last, I show you how to
handle documents that need to be linked to individual records in GoldMine.
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing
Information
The InfoCenter is a poor man’s intranet, and Part VI starts with this topic.
The Opportunity Manager is essentially Sales Forecasting’s bigger brother,
and that is the next topic along with the Project Manager. The Organizational
Chart allows you to relate separate records to each other and is yet another
organizational tool for you. Everyone likes graphics. Some people even like
statistics. GoldMine has both, and I discuss them next. Everyone needs
reports, and I discuss the many options you have to run and even develop
reports.
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine
If you’re a bit of a do-it-yourselfer, you can use this part to get started on
modifying GoldMine to precisely fit your organization. You learn how to
create new fields and field labels and how to manage lookup lists. These are
the most basic and common of customizations. Automated processes are my
favorite part of GoldMine; these give GoldMine the power to do all the mun-
dane tasks that we are supposed to do but rarely get around to. GM+Browser
is a great place to attach a GoldMine record to the Internet or to some out-
side data files. If you’d like to automate some of your lead collection by inte-
grating GoldMine with your organization’s Web site, the last chapter in this
part is for you.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Many programs work with GoldMine; some are from FrontRange and others
from dealers or development shops. Chapter 30 discusses the top ten add-on
products. Chapter 31 summarizes the most important changes in GoldMine
since the last GoldMine For Dummies book, which covers version 6.0.

Introduction

Conventions Used in This Book
We use some conventions throughout this book that merit a little explana-
tion. When you see a phrase such as “choose File➪Edit My Profile,” it means
to click through a given sequence of menu commands. In this example, those
commands are File followed by Edit My Profile.
Whenever I tell you to click something (most likely it’s a button or an icon),
you use the left mouse button and click just once. On those rare occasions
when clicking twice is required to get the job done, I tell you to double-click. 
To select an item, you either highlight it or click in a check box or radio
button, depending on the item. Text that I tell you to enter (that is, type) into
the program, such as in a text box, appears in boldface type. Web site
addresses and on-screen messages show up in monofont type. To signify
hyperlinks, otherwise known as just plain links, I underline the text of the
link. On your computer, clicking such links transports you to another loca-
tion altogether, such as a Web page.
Finally, to avoid confusion (and to follow For Dummies rules), I use title-style
capitalization for option names and links, even when the program doesn’t. 
Icons Used in This Book
You don’t want to skip the helpful reminders noted by this icon.
This icon lets you know that some particularly geeky, technical information is
coming up. You can look past this if you want.
This icon points you to a trick that will save you time and effort.
Look to this icon to find out what to avoid if you don’t want your database to
blow up or cause you other types of anguish.

GoldMine 8 For Dummies 

Where to Go from Here
If you’re new to GoldMine and to CRM, in general, reading and planning will
work a lot better right now than will just jumping in and implementing in haste.
Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.
Any but the most trivial of implementations deserves some level of needs
analysis. You can approach this by downloading a planning guide from one of
several Web sites. 
As your implementation grows beyond the “seat of the pants” level, paying a
professional to do a formal needs analysis is usually worthwhile. I know one
whom I respect, but most of the more experienced GoldMine dealers can help
with this as well. 
But if it’s reading this book that’s really on your mind right now, and you’re
somewhat new to GoldMine 8, I recommend that you pay particular attention
to Chapters 1–5 before jumping into the software. After you properly digest
that material, you can pick and choose your chapters at will. They each stand
on their own and are waiting for you.

In this part . . .
A
little planning goes a long way toward the success
of any project. This part provides you with some of
the basic building blocks needed to set yourself up for
a successful implementation. In addition to a general
overview of what GoldMine can do for you and how
to navigate the main screen, this part also contains a
discussion of user preferences.
You can probably ignore the user preferences if you just
want to play a little at the beginning. But, if you’re really
serious about getting the most out of your investment, put
some time into Chapter 3 and use the Preference settings
to fine-tune GoldMine to your own best advantage.
Whether you intend to work from home, while on the
road, or at the beach, Chapter 4 provides a great overview
of the best choices for remotely accessing GoldMine.

 Preparing for a successful project

G
oldMine 8 (also called GoldMine Premium) is a tool for sales, marketing,
and customer support and is one of many CRM (Customer Relationship
Management) systems available today. GoldMine is for you if you ever have
contact with customers or with business prospects. Right out of the box,
GoldMine lets you track all the basic information to manage your client rela-
tionships. And with a little effort or money, you can customize it to your 
specific needs.
In the late 1980s, my company was growing a bit too fast and was getting a
little out of control. I began searching for some kind of tool that could help us
sustain our growth without causing additional pain. I chose GoldMine
because it
 Won’t let us forget to return a phone call
 Ensures that we remember all our appointments and we never double-
or triple-book ourselves
 Provides a central place to store all client information
 Links all our documents to clients’ records so that we can’t lose proposals
 Makes sure that we all get home for dinner on time every night
The developers at FrontRange Solutions, Inc (formerly GoldMine Software
Corporation) don’t really know the special needs of your organization; your
work may require some fields or functions that just don’t come in the box
with GoldMine. For example, you may want to track each client’s anniversary
so that GoldMine can automatically send flowers to your client’s wife. The
bad news is that GoldMine doesn’t come out of the box knowing how to do
this. The goods news is that you can easily add an anniversary field and a
process to completely automate this activity.

12
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 
One of the advantages of joining the GoldMine community is the widespread
level of expertise available to you from experienced GoldMine dealers all
over the world. These dealers are trained professionals who have focused on
CRM and GoldMine in particular. Admittedly, FrontRange has thinned the
ranks of dealers and consultants today, but if you are looking for good and
experienced dealers, they can still be found. Feel free to contact me for a
local referral.
Discovering Everything 
that GoldMine Can Do
GoldMine tracks all the names, addresses, phone numbers, and basic contact
information you will ever need. If you never use GoldMine as anything more
than an electronic Rolodex, you will have gotten your money’s worth. But if
you use GoldMine in such a limited way, you will be missing out on most of
the power for which your company paid good money. 
Consolidating all your prospect 
and customer information
You will reap tremendous benefits from consistently entering every lead and
every account into GoldMine. And if you can convince everyone in your orga-
nization to do the same, you have not only one organized location for all your
data but also the following advantages:
 Everyone with authorization in your organization can share data and
schedules.
 You can link e-mail and other documents to appropriate records,
enabling you to maintain a complete audit trail.
 When a salesperson leaves your company, you can easily transfer her
accounts to her replacement without missing a beat.
 You can set up all sorts of imaginative Automated Processes to help you
with sales, marketing, and support.
Keeping track of your life
You can use GoldMine to track your business schedule and, in fact, your
entire life. Just as important, GoldMine can keep schedules for all users and
can help you coordinate your activities with theirs. This capability is one of
the compelling reasons to use a CRM system such as GoldMine.

GoldMine lets you see what everyone else on your team is doing (although it
also offers many provisions for privacy); at the same time, it lets everyone
else track what you are doing. Or, at least what you claim you’re doing.
GoldMine can even coordinate the data for remote salespeople who rarely
venture into the office.
If your entire team uses GoldMine consistently to schedule both professional
time and personal appointments, here are some results you may see:
 You can eliminate most instances of overbooked or double-booked staff.
 You can feel reasonably safe in scheduling appointments for others in
your organization.
 You can let GoldMine automatically find a time when everyone on your
team is available to meet.
 You have a complete audit trail of team members’ activities.
Communicating with your 
team and the world
You can use GoldMine to send a single letter to a customer or to send
batches of letters or e-mail messages. Twenty years ago, sending notices to
your thousand best customers telling them about tomorrow’s price increase
would have been an almost impossible task. Now you can name that tune in
three notes.
To do all this, you can use GoldMine’s built-in e-mail client or you can use
Outlook, which can be tightly integrated with GoldMine. I am stubbornly
sticking with GoldMine’s e-mail client because I see no advantage to compli-
cating my life with Outlook.
Keeping tabs on opportunities and projects
GoldMine has a simple sales forecasting system built-in, but that may not be
enough to track your more complex sales. To meet that need, GoldMine has a
much more sophisticated Opportunity Manager, designed to manage deals
that may take months or even years to close and to involve multiple people
in your organization — and possibly multiple people at your prospect’s orga-
nization. The Opportunity Manager is also ideal when you want to link activi-
ties and documents to one of these larger pending deals.
When you succeed at landing that behemoth deal, GoldMine can turn your
opportunity into a project so that you can just as easily keep track of all the
work that is being done. I like to refer to this as Microsoft Project “light.”
13
Chapter 1: GoldMine: An Overview 

Setting up Automated Processes
My favorite feature of GoldMine is its Automated Processes, with which you
can automate almost any business process you can design. With Automated
Processes, you can have GoldMine send out follow-ups to sales calls or
remind you to call a client or escalate an issue to your boss when you ignore
GoldMine’s first or second notices.
There is a great example of a series of Automated Processes within the
AdvisorsGold add-on for the financial services industry. You can read more
on that in Chapter 30.
Doing some great marketing
GoldMine can gather leads from your Web site (see Chapter 29) and automati-
cally turn them into records in your database. Then, with a little planning,
you can set up marketing campaigns to clients and to prospects directly from
your GoldMine database. GoldMine is just great at scheduling calls and send-
ing batches of e-mails, faxes, and snail-mail letters. The best campaigns use
combinations of several strategies. E-mails and faxes will both benefit from
some add-on products discussed in Chapter 30.
Organizing your customer support
Along with a completely reworked user interface, GoldMine Premium now
boasts a customer service module that allows GoldMine to manage service
issues by associating each issue with an account. It also assigns issues to a
queue until someone deals with it and maintains a library of service-related
documents. 
Investigating a Few of the Things
GoldMine Isn’t Designed to Do
There’s no point in reinventing the wheel and, for the most part, GoldMine
hasn’t. Rather than build a word processor, a quotation system, or an
expense reporting system, FrontRange has relied on other developers to
build great products. Many of these products are now tightly integrated with
GoldMine.
14
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

Integrating word processing 
and spreadsheets
GoldMine has no built-in word processor, so you can’t really use GoldMine to
write a letter. The designers long ago decided not to reinvent this wheel and
have long relied on what has become the de facto word processor —
Microsoft Word. Just as GoldMine tightly integrates with Word, so it also inte-
grates with Excel, just in case you need to output some data in that direction.
Chapter 16 provides details on connecting GoldMine and Word.
Faxing
Faxing comes and goes. It was the hot technology before e-mail became so
prevalent. Now that marketers are having more and more trouble penetrating
everyone’s spam filters, faxing is hot again. GoldMine, however, relies on one
or two well-established faxing programs to carry the load here. Chapter 30
discusses these.
Quoting and accounting
Don’t rely on GoldMine alone for help with accounting or with quotations. You
can, and should, buy separate programs for these tasks. And again, you can
refer to Chapter 30 for details about each of my favorites in these categories.
Planning a Successful Project
If you have five people in your office using GoldMine and your goal is to just
consolidate your data and use GoldMine as an expensive Rolodex, you might
be able to get away without too much planning. Plenty of people use this
approach. Of course, that may be part of the reason that so many studies
have cited CRM’s rather shocking failure rate.
Any but the simplest of systems must have a real, professional planning
phase. My own rule is that any CRM implementation that might involve ten or
more days of work should have a formal Needs Analysis done first. A good
Needs Analysis is done by an experienced dealer and is almost always a bill-
able event. But it’s money well spent to document goals, develop specifica-
tions, and assign tasks and timetables. 
15
Chapter 1: GoldMine: An Overview 

Perhaps you don’t want to spend the money. Maybe you’re a Type A and just
want to get on with it. Resist the urge. Invest 10 percent of the total project
budget in the analysis phase, even if you do the analysis yourself.
Planning and analysis is one thing. Installation is another. Back in the day of
GoldMine Standard Edition, it was relatively easy to install GoldMine. Now
that GoldMine Premium runs on MS-SQL, installation is a lot more involved.
Definitely not something you want to do by yourself at home. Call an experi-
enced professional if the thought of doing it yourself makes you at all queasy. 
Providing Training: The Key to Success
Don’t shortchange yourself or your company when it comes to training. At
least 80 percent of my clients use less than 10 percent of GoldMine’s power.
That’s usually because they just never made the effort to find out what else
GoldMine could do after they solved their initial crisis.
You can get GoldMine training in several ways, and any one of them is cer-
tainly better than expecting someone to just figure it out. The following list
shows some effective training methods, starting with the most effective and
ending with the least effective.
 Send every user to an authorized GoldMine Dealer for training. 
In the old days, the manufacturer used to certify select dealers as
Authorized Training Centers or Authorized Trainers. I am one. They
don’t do this any more, so any dealers with that designation is telling
you that they have been around a long time and may or may not be up-
to-date. You will need to do your own investigation to find a good
trainer, or, again, contact me for a referral.
 Bring an experienced trainer to one of your regular company meetings
and allocate a half day or a full day to GoldMine training.
 Bring an experienced trainer to your facility for training (make sure to
temporarily confiscate all cell phones and pagers).
 Sign up for some Web-based training that several dealers offer. Some
dealers actually specialize in Web-based training, and this is especially
cost-effective if you have users in many locations or you want to sched-
ule the training in bite-sized chunks.
 Buy some computer-based training CD-ROMs and set aside time for each
person to work through them. Note: It’s difficult to ask a CD a question if
you’re confused about something.
16
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

 Buy each staff member a copy of GoldMine 8 for Dummies. Tell each
person that she will get a one-week paid vacation upon finishing the book.
 Tell your staff to just figure it out. I’ve never seen this actually work very
well, but it might for you. 
GoldMine manuals are available electronically — either on the initial CD or as
a download. Printing hundreds of pages may not be practical, but the option
is there. One advantage is that you can print just the chapter related to the
subject you are trying to master.

Chapter 2
Getting Around in GoldMine
In This Chapter
 Understanding the GoldMine interface
 Getting help
F
or almost fifteen years, even as features were added, the GoldMine
screens always looked the same. No more. The most obvious enhance-
ment in GoldMine 8 is the complete overhaul of the user interface. 
If you are a GoldMine veteran upgrading to the latest version, you will imme-
diately be trying to figure out how to do all the things you used to do. In case
these new screens are already making you nervous, be assured that every
function you are used to is still there. You may have to press a different
button or maneuver to a different area of the screen, but all the good stuff is
still there. It took me about 15 minutes to accommodate myself to all this new
navigation. It probably won’t take you any longer, except that you are
required to read this chapter first.
In this chapter I discuss and you discover how to navigate the corridors of
GoldMine in the most efficient ways possible.
Understanding the GoldMine Interface
If you are sitting in front of GoldMine for the first time, you will quickly
become comfortable with the navigation because it’s very much like many
other twenty-first–century applications. 
In addition to looking different, GoldMine now has some new terminology for
you to get used to. GoldMine 8 has a Global Toolbar, a Navigation Pane, and a
Taskbar. On top of that, some of the functions are in different places now.
Figure 2-1 shows as many of GoldMine’s work areas as possible, and I refer to
this figure throughout this chapter.

20
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 
The Main Menu
The Main menu bar appears at the top of the screen just below the title bar. It
contains all the general categories of functions, each of which displays a pull-
down menu when you click the mouse over it.
Those of you coming from an older version of GoldMine can have your “old
timers” menu structure back by choosing Tools➪Options➪System and select-
ing the Use Classic GoldMine Menu option. Of course, doing so will delay your
effort to get used to the new screens.

ment, and launching the Database Alias Manager and QuickStart Wizard.
 Actions: Access GoldMine communication tools and timer commands,
and manage mail merge functions.
 Schedule: Access scheduling options for the contact record, including
scheduling a call or an appointment, scheduling literature to be sent out,
scheduling forecasted sales, follow-up actions, and GoldMine e-mails.
 Complete: Access completed action options for scheduled and unsched-
uled calls, appointments, sales, other actions, correspondence, and
other pending activities.
 Web: Access GM+Browser, Web publishing, and other online options.
 Window: Window display and status bar display options. Also open new
Contact Record windows.
 Help: Online Help, the GoldMine Web site, NetUpdate, and important
system information in About GoldMine.
The Global Toolbar
The Global Toolbar, shown in Figure 2-2, is located directly beneath the Main
menu. It is completely customizable. It has two sections — the Standard Toolbar
and the Taskbar. The buttons displayed throughout the Global Toolbar provide
shortcuts to specific functions that you regularly perform. 
21
Chapter 2: Getting Around in GoldMine

The Standard Toolbar
The Standard Toolbar contains a customizable selection of functions, some
or many of which you probably want to use regularly. You can customize the
Standard Toolbar by clicking the drop-down button at the far right of the 
toolbar. Select Add or Remove Buttons➪Standard. The Standard Toolbar list
appears, as you can see in Figure 2-3. Using the checkboxes, select or deselect
the elements you want to use.
The Taskbar
The Taskbar is comprised of the Getting Started and Customize tabs on the
Global Toolbar. You control what options appear, the same way you cus-
tomize the Standard Toolbar.

The Navigation Pane
The Navigation Pane, shown in Figure 2-4, is a new feature in GoldMine
Premium Edition. It essentially mirrors the Go To option from the Main menu.
The Navigation Pane also offers additional viewing and navigation options,
depending on the module selected. The Navigation Pane contains the follow-
ing four sections:
 Search field: The Search field enables you to search for one or more
records in your database. Enter a contact name and click the Go button
or just click the Go button. The Contact Search Center appears in the
work area with the search criteria you just entered already filled in.
Clicking the Go button here, or the Search button in the Standard
Toolbar, you get to the same place: the Search Center. From here, you
can do simple or complex searches for individual records or for sets of
records that match your criteria.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in GoldMine

 Title bar: The Title bar displays the title for the currently selected
module. Click the Title Bar or the double arrows to the right to minimize
or maximize the Navigation Pane. 
 View window: The View window displays the most recent records
you’ve accessed. The records you see here are context sensitive, chang-
ing as you change categories from the section just below it. Selecting a
record from this list is usually the most efficient way to return to a
record you have recently been working with. 
 Module menu: If you reduce the size of the Navigation Pane by dragging
down the dotted line that appears just above the Contacts list, the
system replaces the menu options from the Navigation Pane with icons
in the Module menu. If you are comfortable with using these icons, you
can increase the real estate available in the View window. 
The Work Area
The screen’s center is the official Work Area. The GoldMine Work Area dis-
plays active windows, including the open contact records, Calendar, Activity
List, and Contact Search Center. The Work Area also displays the scheduling
dialog boxes, tools, and wizards. In short, this is where you do all your work.
Each time you select a contact record or an activity, or have the Work Area
display anything, GoldMine builds a screen for display in the Work Area. That
is, if you elect the tabbing option by maximizing your Work Area. GoldMine
tiles these screens, in effect putting the most current screen on top of all the
previous screens and displaying a series of tabs, with each tab linking to a
recent screen you’ve been to. 
Over the course of a day, you could build up a very large number of screens
on top of each other, taking up a lot of memory space and potentially causing
yourself to get pretty navigationally confused. That’s why, when I finish with
a screen in the Work Area, I usually close that screen. Just below the Global
Toolbar, GoldMine displays the most recently accessed records or activities.
You can close any of these screens by clicking the X on the right side of the
tab. You can see these tabs in Figure 2-5.
24
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

The status bar
The bottom line of the window is called the status bar and contains the following
information: 
 The name of the open Contact Set on the left side. 
 Whether the Caps Lock and Num Lock keys are activated.
 When active, the timer, showing hours, minutes, and seconds.
 The username for the logged-in user.
 The date and time on the local computer.
Getting Help
GoldMine 8 includes a searchable Help Center. You can enter a keyword or a
phrase and GoldMine displays all the relevant (and sometimes irrelevant)
topics. For many topics, you get to see step-by-steps instructions, tips, and
other miscellaneous reference materials. GoldMine’s Help Center should be
the first place to go when you’re confused, frustrated, or just feel like reading.

Chapter 2: Getting Around in GoldMine

One way to navigate to the Help Center is to click Help➪GoldMine Help from
the Main menu. However, the Help Center is designed to be context sensitive,
meaning that you simply click F1 from whatever window or dialog box you’re
in to go directly to the Help Center. GoldMine then highlights the topic most
likely to help you.
Figure 2-6 shows the Help screen you encounter if you click F1 while trying to
schedule an appointment.
In the Navigation Pane of the Help screen you encounter the following tabs
(as you can see in Figure 2-6):
 Contents Tab: Displays a table of contents for Help. Topics are organized
in “books.” Expand books to display topics. To view a topic, highlight it
and see it displayed in the right pane of the HTML Help viewer.
 Index Tab: Displays an index of Help topics. To locate a topic, scroll
through the list or type a keyword or phrase for which to search. To
view a topic, double-click the topic or highlight it and select Display. The
topic displays in the right pane of the HTML Help viewer.

 Search Tab: Search for words in topics. Once the word is located, the
topics containing that word display in a list. To view a topic, select it and
click Display. The topic displays in the right pane of the HTML Help
viewer.
 Glossary Tab: Displays a glossary of GoldMine terms. To display a defin-
ition, select a term from the list; its definition displays in the lower pane.
Getting help online
The second choice you encounter when you select Help from GoldMine’s
Main menu is GoldMine Online. Choosing this option takes you to the sup-
port center at www.goldmine.com. From this area of the FrontRange Web
site, you can select several options for getting additional help. Most of the
choices here require you to have your credit card handy if you don’t have a
current Maintenance and Support Plan in place. 
Although you can eventually get to the GoldMine Support Center with a lot of
clicking on the GoldMine Web site, a more efficient way is to go directly to
www.goldmine.com/micro.aspx?id=4403 or call FrontRange at
800-755-2100. My clients report an average of about a 20-minute wait on hold
when calling.
The GoldMine forum
The third choice on the GoldMine Help menu is the GoldMine forum, which
you can also access at www.goldmine.com.. In this forum, dealers, consul-
tants and other users share their insights, assistance, and complaints for
free. Some of the advice here is quite good and usually very technical. Steel
yourself for insults, however. Some of the more technical consultants have
difficulty with social graces.

Setting Up Your Preferences
In This Chapter
 Customizing your Tabs
 Exploring the various preferences tabs
T
he preference settings in GoldMine enable you to put your own stamp on
your copy of the software. If you’re one of those eager beavers who just
has to get right at it, you can probably skip this chapter. Read it later, or
maybe never. Most of GoldMine works fine without your ever touching the
settings. If you intend to use GoldMine’s e-mail, you definitely need to estab-
lish your Preference settings.
On the other hand, if you’re serious about making GoldMine work for you
rather than the other way around, this is the chapter for you. In this chapter,
you discover many interesting and powerful parameters you can set, and you
don’t need any programming knowledge to do so.
You can control hundreds of settings and options in GoldMine. Many of them
deal with pretty technical stuff, however, so I skip over some of those in favor
of the most commonly used and important settings.
You can access all user preferences through the Toolbar by choosing Tools➪
Options, which gives you access to 12 separate areas. You can also get to
your Option dialog box via Getting Started on the Taskbar. Behind each door
of the Options settings are some of the secret tricks that GoldMine dealers
use to set things up.
One of the most often requested changes is to the order of those tabs two-
thirds of the way down the main GoldMine screen. In this chapter I also show
you how to get the less valuable ones out of your way and promote the
important ones to the front. 

30
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 
Customizing Your Tabs
Out of the box, GoldMine comes with 18 defined tabs, such as Fields,
GM+View, Notes, and others. You can’t see all of them simultaneously unless
you click the down arrow to the left of the tabs being displayed. You then see
a drop-down list of all available tabs, and you can even navigate to each of
these areas by clicking any item in the drop-down list.
Early versions of GoldMine had just one row of nine tabs. Over the years, as
the number of features expanded, so did the number of tabs. Now there are
just too many to see all at one time in a horizontal display.
The Links tab helps you keep track of all the documents and files associated
with each record. I discuss the Links tab in detail in Chapter 19, but it is far
too important to live in relative obscurity. In fact, the Links tab is generally
more important and more often used than several of the original tabs that are
displayed by default.
There are several candidates for demotion from the first tier to the second.
My recommendation is to demote the Summary tab to the second tier and
replace it with the Links tab. I’ve used GoldMine since the early 1990s and
have never once felt a need for the Summary tab. My second choice for
demotion is the Referrals tab. Although I do use the Referrals tab, I don’t use
it all that often, and most of our clients don’t use it at all. The Notes tab is
another candidate for demotion. You probably shouldn’t be using it, but as
with most GoldMine users, you probably do.
Follow these steps to demote a tab and promote another tab at the same time.
1. Click the down arrow to the left of the tabs.
A drop-down list appears. 
2. Click Customize at the bottom of the list.
The Display Tabs screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-1.
3. Highlight the tab you want to promote or demote.
You do not need to touch the checkbox to the left of the tab description.
Just highlight the name of the tab and then click the Move Up or the
Move Down button as many times as you want. You can see the selected
tab moving up or down as you click. 
4. When you’re done rearranging all your tabs, click OK.
GoldMine returns you to the main work area. Your changes have taken
effect.

These changes apply only to the current logged-in user and do not affect
anyone else. There is no global or company-wide setting for this.
If any of the tabs annoy you so much that you just want to eliminate them,
you can do so from your Options screen by deselecting the box next to what-
ever tab you want to remove. Click the Reset button to restore all the origi-
nal, default settings in case you change your mind. You could use this feature
to eliminate certain tabs from the reach of certain users. For example, you
could remove the History tab from the office snoop’s system so that she can’t
see any e-mails. 
Customizing All Your Preferences
You can do a lot of customizing of GoldMine without knowing how to pro-
gram at all. In addition to adding custom fields, reports, and automated
processes, you can tell GoldMine exactly how you expect to work and make
sure that GoldMine conforms to that. In the following sections, I discuss the
12 tabs for setting preferences.
Personal Preferences
From the Preferences dialog box, click the Personal tab to see a dialog box
like the one shown in Figure 3-2. The Personal tab is one of the simplest of
the Preferences tabs and enables you to see your user name and full name,
and to change your title, department, phone number, and fax number. In addi-
tion, by clicking the Change Password button, you can create a new password
for yourself, thus preventing the resident office snoop from checking out too
much of your stuff.
Figure 3-1:
Use the
Display Tabs
dialog box
to rearrange
your tabs.
31
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

Be sure to use upper- and lowercase letters when entering your title and
department, because you may want to use these later as part of your e-mail
signature file.
You can move to another level of personal preferences and change your pass-
word by clicking the Change Password button from the Personal Preferences
dialog box. In the dialog box that appears, type your current password in the
Current Password text box. (Presumably, you know this password or you
wouldn’t have been able to log on to GoldMine in the first place.) Then press
the Tab key and type a new password in the New Password text box.
GoldMine asks you to confirm your new password by retyping it in the New
Password Again text box.
Keep your GoldMine password cryptic and short, or you may become
annoyed if you have to enter something long and complicated every time you
start GoldMine.
The whole point to password protecting GoldMine is that your data is safe
because the password is secret, which means that no one else can access
your data. The downside to passwords is that if you forget yours, you’re
going to be doing some reinstalling to get back to your data. You may want to
write down your password and keep it in a safe place, such as in a locked
cabinet in your office, or, like most people, on a sticky note stuck to your
monitor.
Record preferences
You can click the Record tab to customize the appearance of the main screen
(see Figure 3-3). Two radio buttons enable you to set the shading of the
screen background. You have two choices, either dark or bright background,
and the one you choose is purely a matter of taste. Give each a try.
Figure 3-2:

personal

Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

GoldMine also gives you a choice on the font size. Selecting the Use Large
Font check box makes the characters larger on-screen. If your eyesight isn’t
quite what it used to be, using large fonts may be the best choice for you. You
do pay a small price for this choice, however, because you can’t see quite as
many lines in your browse windows as you can see with small fonts.
You can also change the colors that labels and data appear in by clicking the
Label Colors or Data Colors buttons on the Record preferences dialog box. Be
sure to use contrasting colors to distinguish the labels and data from the
background. You can have some real fun by setting the labels and data to the
exact same color as the background. (Please don’t actually do this, because it
renders everything invisible!)
Following the Label Colors and Data Colors buttons, you see five check boxes
that you can check to specify how data is entered or displayed:
 Select Contents of Fields: If this box is checked when you enter a data
field, the existing data is highlighted, and whatever you type immedi-
ately overwrites the existing data. If this box is not checked, your new
data is appended automatically to the existing data. Generally, you
should leave this box checked.
 Use a Word Format for User-Defined Dates: This option applies only to
user-defined fields, not to standard date fields such as those that appear
on your Pending or History tabs. If you select this box, a typical date
appears as Apr 1, 03. If this box is not selected, the same date appears
as 4/1/03. Take your pick.
 Show Numerics Aligned to the Right: If you have a bunch of fields with
numeric entries, sometimes the numbers are easier to read right-justified.
Checking this box does just that for you.
Figure 3-3:

main
screen’s

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

 Show Sort-by Field on Status Bar: If you check this box, the currently
active index appears on the status bar.
 Show Contact Name on Activity Tabs: Don’t select this option unless
you plan to make major and frequent use of the Relationships feature.
Relationships connect or relate separate records in GoldMine to one
another. For example, if you have separate records for each location of
Burger King, you might use the Relationships feature to show how they
are each related. See Chapter 24 for more about relationships.
The next section of the Record preferences dialog box enables you to deter-
mine how the system deals with entering ZIP codes. If you select the No
Validation radio button, you then have to type the city, state, and ZIP code.
Don’t do this.
Behind the scenes, GoldMine builds a ZIP code database for you as you enter
records. GoldMine builds on its ZIP code file and continues figuring out what
city goes with what ZIP code. This is a great feature: The second time you
enter a record from the same ZIP code, GoldMine automatically fills in the
city and state for you.
You can buy several ready-made ZIP code files that will save you consider-
able effort. Check the Web site at www.ccc24k.com for a utility called
ZipCodes+ And, a word of caution: In the mid-90s, the then-GoldMine
Software Corporation pulled a ZIP code utility off the market. The company
had been selling it for less than $20, but it had become so obsolete at that
point that it was no longer of much value. There is now a dealer selling this
same database or giving it away and claiming that it’s worth $120. Let the
buyer beware!
Make sure you select the Show Window of Cities radio button. With this
option selected, you can
 Enter the ZIP code and then enter the city and state. GoldMine auto-
matically fills in the city and state if the city and state are unique.
 Select the correct city and state. If multiple choices are possible,
GoldMine displays a browse window that enables you to do this.
Calendar preferences
When you click the Calendar tab to display the Calendar preferences dialog
box, most of the choices are pretty self-explanatory. You can set up GoldMine
to reflect your normal working hours and the days of the week you usually
work. These choices affect how your calendar is displayed, as shown in
Figure 3-4.
34
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

Click the Holidays button, and on the dialog box that appears, enter company
holidays so that GoldMine won’t schedule activities on those days. If you
don’t have Master access rights, ask your system administrator to take care
of this task. The holidays are entered only once and are then in place in the
schedule for everyone in the company.
You can actually schedule holidays based on the country in which you operate,
as well as schedule personal holidays, such as your birthday or anniversary.
If you’re like me, you may find that the Auto Roll-Over options are some of
the most significant ones available in the Calendar preferences dialog box.
Many are the days when I come into the office and have an overwhelming
number of phone calls scheduled for me. Try as I might, I never seem to be
able to make them all. If I do manage to make most of them, I want the
remaining ones to be on my schedule for the next day. That’s exactly what
Auto Roll-Over does. It takes activities that you have not completed by the
end of a particular day and moves them to the next day’s schedule. It works
very well. Maybe too well — at this writing, I now have 1,712 items on my
activity list for tomorrow. I will be more diligent tomorrow, and I’m sure I’ll
get them finished.
You should select all the Auto Roll-Over options except auto-forwarding of
appointments. Just because you didn’t make it to that appointment with the
IRS yesterday at 2:00 p.m. doesn’t mean that you should show up there today
at 2:00 p.m. (Well, maybe you should, but then again, I’m not a qualified tax
adviser.)
If you are part of a corporate GoldMine installation and you use GoldSync,
then the Sync Rollover option needs to be checked. It never hurts to check it,
anyway.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

Schedule preferences
When you click the Schedule tab, the Schedule preferences dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 3-5. This dialog box is fairly simple and offers
you the following eight check boxes:
 Check for Timing Conflicts While Scheduling: As long as you have this
check box selected, GoldMine warns you if you schedule yourself for
two activities at the same time. Scheduling conflicts usually aren’t an
issue if you regularly schedule directly from the Calendar as I recom-
mend, but selecting this option can’t hurt.
 Carry-Over Completion Notes When Scheduling Follow-Up Calls: When
you complete an activity and schedule a follow-up activity from the com-
pletion window, your notes are carried over to the follow-up activity if
you have this option selected. I recommend that you select this one.
 Start Timer When Completing Activities: This option may be useful if
you’re tracking a telemarketing effort. In most cases, however, you don’t
need to select it.
 Show the Details Section in the Activity Listing Window: If you select
this option, additional data fields appear at the bottom of the Activity
Listing window. I recommend that you select this option.
 Sync the Contact Window with the Activity Listing Window: If you
select this option and your monitor has an adequate resolution (greater
than 640 x 480), you can see the related contact record when you high-
light an item from the Activity List. I use this option also.
Figure 3-5:

preferences

Schedule
tab.
36
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

 Show Alert when Completing an Activity with Others Associated: If the
activity you are completing has other users also assigned to it, GoldMine
will alert you to this and allows you to complete the activity for every-
one. For example, if you are all on a scheduled conference call, you may
just want to complete the call for everyone.
 Show Alert when Editing an Activity with Others Associated: Same
concept as the previous option, except this refers to editing. An example
might be if you are rescheduling a conference call that has multiple
users assigned to it.
 Show Alert when Deleting an Activity with Others Associated: Similar
to the previous two options, you can delete that conference call for
everyone.
Alarms preferences
When you click the Alarms tab, you see the Alarms preferences dialog box, as
shown in Figure 3-6. This dialog box contains the following options (as well as
a few more esoteric ones that I intentionally leave out):
 Disable Alarms: Selecting this option turns off your alarms so that
GoldMine doesn’t remind you to keep your dentist appointment.
Assuming that you use GoldMine to help keep you organized, selecting
this option is counterproductive. My advice: Do not disable your alarms.
 Pop-Up Alarms: By default, GoldMine displays alarms in a pop-up
window on the right side of the screen. You can’t miss one when it’s trig-
gered, and sometimes it becomes annoying when you get a barrage of
alarms. You may want to consider a compromise solution, which is to
have the alarm appear in the Taskbar.
Figure 3-6:
Set up how
GoldMine

on the
Alarms tab.
37
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

 Alarms Default Lead Time: The amount of time (in minutes) before a
scheduled activity that the alarm window appears on-screen. To set the
alarm to appear 15 minutes before each activity, type 15 in this field. Of
course, 15 minutes is not always appropriate, so you can adjust this set-
ting manually for every activity. Mine is set to 10 minutes, which usually
works for me.
GoldMine includes the GoldAlarm program to remind you of scheduled
activities even if GoldMine is not running. GoldAlarm is a separate pro-
gram that runs alarms for you when you select the Run GoldAlarm When
Windows Starts option.
 When I Ignore Alarms, Snooze the Ignored Alarms for X Minutes: This
option works like the Snooze button on an alarm clock. If you ignore the
alarms, they stop for a little while and then alert you again in a desig-
nated amount of time. The default snooze value is three minutes, but
you can set it for whatever amount seems right to you.
 Page Me with the Alarm When Not Acknowledged within X Minutes:
This option sets GoldMine to call your pager if you do not respond to an
alarm within the specified number of minutes. Obviously, this option is
valuable only if you have an alphanumeric pager set to work with
GoldMine. The default waiting time is 10 minutes. To disable this option,
just leave the check box blank. By default, it’s blank anyway.
 Play Alarm Sound File: This option sets GoldMine to play the WAV
sound file entered in the field to the right of the option. Windows comes
with a number of WAV files that you can use if you want your alarm to
play something other than the standard alarm sound.
Lookup preferences
If you click the Lookup tab, the Lookup preferences dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 3-7. This dialog box deals with some of the parameters
involved in helping you locate a particular record in GoldMine. Figure 3-7
shows the selections I prefer.
E-mail preferences
GoldMine plays very nicely with the Internet. In fact, working with the
Internet is one of the most important aspects of using GoldMine.
If you click the E-Mail tab, you can access all your options for setting up your
e-mail.
38
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

Before you can use GoldMine with the Internet, you must sign up with an
Internet service provider (ISP); you can choose a regional, national, or inter-
national provider. One important consideration when deciding on an ISP is
how much, and where, you travel. If you want to avoid long-distance charges
when you travel, hook up with a provider that has local coverage in the
places you travel to most often.
Your ISP can provide you with most of the information you need to fill out your
Internet preferences. Figure 3-8 shows some sample entries for these fields.
Note that GoldMine’s e-mail client requires POP3 and SMTP for its e-mail client.
For instance, if your company uses Microsoft Exchange and does not have POP
and SMTP enabled, you will not be able to use GoldMine’s e-mail client.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

The Network Connection section determines how GoldMine connects to the
Internet. If you use another program, such as Internet Explorer or Netscape
Navigator for your Internet connection, you don’t have to select the Use Dial-
up Networking option; if you want GoldMine to dial in and make the connec-
tion, however, select this option.
Login preferences
If you click the Login tab, the Login preferences dialog box appears (see
Figure 3-9).
The settings on the Login preferences dialog box apply to everyone on your
network, and your GoldMine administrator should establish the login set-
tings. You probably shouldn’t change any of the other Login preferences
options. The other parameters are meant to be used in a network environ-
ment and are set by the GoldMine administrator. (But if you’re working alone
with a single user license, you are the GoldMine administrator!)
You can elect to bypass the login banner only if you’re not using a password.
I always recommend using a password, even if you’re a single user sitting at
home. If you do select this option, GoldMine doesn’t pause at the initial logon
dialog box but goes directly to the main data screen. This is a small time-
saver if you’re not worried about security issues.
Speller preferences
Finally, back in version 6.0, GoldMine gave in to all those users who just can’t
spell or aren’t the greatest typists. (Sorry, but GoldMine can’t help you yet if
Figure 3-9:

Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

you’re grammatically challenged.) Preference settings now include a series of
settings for controlling how you want GoldMine to spell check your various
notepads and e-mails. Specifically, GoldMine now enables you to check the
spelling in all the activity-related notepads.
Figure 3-10 illustrates the settings that I use and that I recommend for most
users. The following list describes what the options do when the spell check
runs:
 Ignore Capitalized Words: Skips any words that begin with a capital
letter. Use this option if your text typically contains many proper names.
 Ignore All-Caps Words: Ignores words containing all capital letters.
Particularly in the high-tech and medical fields, it might be worthwhile
to ignore things such as HTML and EKG because roughly half the words
people in these fields use are acronyms.
 Ignore Words with Numbers: Skips over words containing embedded
numbers, such as Win98. Mixing numbers in with words is also a popular
specialty of the high-tech industry.
 Ignore Words with Mixed Case: Skips any words containing an unusual
mixture of upper- and lowercase letters, such as GoldMine.
 Ignore Domain Names: Ignores any words that appear to be Internet
domain names (such as www.ccc24k.com).
Generally, I have the spell checker ignore all kinds of words that have
unusual capitalization or punctuation. There are just too many different
kinds of words like this, particularly for those of us in the high-tech field.
Simple capitalized words aren’t so strange, so I allow the spell checker
to do its thing on those words.
You can build your own dictionary of strange words you commonly use.
If you do this religiously, it might then make sense to deselect some of
the ignoring options.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

 Report Doubled Words: Reports any word appearing twice in a row. I
have a habit of typing “the the” often, so I select this option.
 Case Sensitive: Makes a distinction between capitalized and noncapital-
ized words. For example, “france” is considered different from “France,”
so “france” would be reported as a misspelling. When the option is dis-
abled, “france” and “France” are considered identical. Selecting this
option noticeably slows the spell checker.
 Phonetic Suggestions: Suggests alternative spellings based on phonetic
(sounds-like) similarity to the misspelled word. This option tends to
improve suggestions for badly misspelled words. Enabling this option
increases the time required to locate suggestions.
Note that either Phonetic Suggestions or the Typographical Suggestions
option must be selected or GoldMine offers no spelling suggestions.
 Typographical Suggestions: Makes suggestions based on typographical
(looks-like) similarity to the misspelled word. This option is appropriate
for people who are generally good spellers — like me, of coarse.
 Suggest Split Words: Suggests two separate words as replacements for a
misspelling containing two joined words. For example, the spell checker
suggests “are you” to replace “areyou.”
 Auto Correct: Changes words marked with “Auto Change” actions auto-
matically are changed to their specified replacements. When this option
is deselected, GoldMine prompts you before it changes the words.
 Main Dictionary Language: Allows you to set the language of the main
dictionary used to check spelling. The list shows only languages for dic-
tionaries installed on your system. To check spelling in a language other
than English, select the language from the list.
 Suggestions: Determines the speed and accuracy of the initial search for
suggested replacements for misspelled words. When a misspelled word
is found, a search is automatically made for suggestions. Clicking the
Suggest button in the Check Spelling dialog box causes an increasingly
more accurate (but slower) search for suggestions. My preference is
faster and more accurate, but that one isn’t offered yet.
System preferences
In the System tab you deal with a few menu and date settings. You can cling
to the old-timers’ GoldMine menu system, and you can specify how you want
dates displayed. 
The Epoch setting refers to how you want GoldMine to handle dates from
other centuries. This was actually important back in 1999 when users were
42
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

possibly scheduling activities for 2000 and GoldMine was sometimes con-
fused. The Epoch setting isn’t really critical now unless you are scheduling
into the twenty-second century.
You can see the recommended settings in Figure 3-11.
Pager preferences
You can have GoldMine automatically track you down via Pager. The Pager fea-
ture is useful and is connected to alarms in GoldMine. When an alarm is trig-
gered, it can automatically send a message to a pager if the Pager preferences
are filled out. I don’t have too many clients who use this feature (none?), but I
am displaying the screen in Figure 3-12 for the sake of completeness.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Preferences

Telephony preferences
The Telephony tab combines the old Modem preferences with the newer
SoftPhone options. The Telephony tab is shown in Figure 3-13.
The options for the Modem preferences are most significant for those users
who want GoldMine to actually dial the telephone based on a phone number
in a contact record. If you’re sitting at home with a simple telephone and tele-
phone line, or if you’re in an office in which you have your own line, this fea-
ture is simple and useful.
If your office has a central telephone system with multiple lines, however,
you may need some technical help, along with additional hardware and soft-
ware, to make GoldMine handle the dialing for you. That’s what the
SoftPhone options are about.
Unless you have some in-house telephony expertise, I do not recommend
going down the SoftPhone route without a GoldMine consultant. And even
then, you may want to investigate very thoroughly.

Accessing GoldMine Remotely
In This Chapter
 Securing your data
 Accessing GoldMine using GoldSync
 Adding iGoldMinePlus
 Working with GoldMine through Remote Desktop
 Using handheld devices to work with your data
O
ne of the great strengths of GoldMine is its ability to provide you with
important client data, whether you are sitting in the main office or
you’re in a submarine under the Arctic icepack. This strength is also a poten-
tial liability because the more available you make GoldMine to your staff, the
more available you may inadvertently make the same critical data to people
who shouldn’t see it at all.
I find it amazing how many of my clients insist that they must have all their
GoldMine data available while they are on airplanes. It’s more realistic to
think about bringing one or two documents associated with client accounts,
but really, who actually works for hours on an airplane reviewing calendars
and forecasts? As I write this, several U.S.-based airlines just announced
plans to provide wireless Internet service to passengers in their main cabins.
I’m sure there will be a fee for this, but it should minimize the requirement for
having GoldMine data always loaded on everyone’s laptop.
In this chapter I discuss most of the common ways you can work with your
GoldMine system when you’re at home, at a client-site, at a hotel, in an air-
plane, or at the beach. I’ve never actually used GoldMine while at the beach,
but I have sent e-mails and even written a chapter or two while sitting outside
at the pool. And you thought this writing stuff was hard.
GoldSync and CompanionLink are the two utilities most often used by people
who can never be without their data. With each of these utilities, the data is
loaded (synchronized) into your laptop or your handheld device respectively.

For those who are content to use GoldMine and its data while connected to
the Internet, iGoldMinePlus and Remote Desktop are good solutions for
laptop users. wMobile is a similar solution for handheld devices like
BlackBerries and Treos.
Securing Your Data
For most of my clients, GoldMine contains their organization’s most critical
information the entire list of prospects and clients. Of course, any salesperson
would feel crippled if he didn’t have access to a phone number for a client who
was about to place an order or who was on the verge of cancelling one.
The very requirement that you always have your data with you leads directly
to a serious security issue. When your laptop is lost or stolen, some unknown
person, and very possibly a bad one, may have your data. Wouldn’t it be nice
if that person worked for your fiercest competitor? Or, just as bad, what if the
thief were clever enough to figure out who that competitor is and then real-
ized that the data he now has might be worth something?
That probably won’t happen, right? In the past few years at my company, we
have had two cars broken into and laptops stolen. We had an employee leave
a laptop at a girlfriend’s house (in another state). And, one of us, in a rush to
get on a plane, left a laptop in the trunk of a rental car. That last one was me.
None of those incidents ever made headlines. But all too often, we have seen
headlines made by organizations (particularly in health care, financial ser-
vices, and government) that have allowed employees to run around with sen-
sitive data that should never have gotten out of the office. Social Security
numbers and financial and medical information all demand that you take great
care. People lose jobs and occasionally go to jail when they let data leak out.
So, here are my rules for remotely accessing data:
 If you don’t need it, don’t take it. You’re not going to call any clients
while you’re flying to Paris. At most, you’re probably going to edit a doc-
ument or two. Just bring the documents.
 If you do need GoldMine data with you, take only the records you really
need.
 The more people there are from your organization running around with
the database, the greater the likelihood that a breach of security will
occur.
46
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

Syncing Up with GoldSync
If you need to run GoldMine even when disconnected from the Internet, your
only choice is to use the GoldSync utility that comes with GoldMine 8. GoldSync
has been available for many years, first appearing in the mid-1990s as an add-on
to GoldMine Standard Edition. Now GoldSync is actually included with every
license of GoldMine Corporate and GoldMine Premium (a.k.a. GoldMine 8).
The basic principles behind GoldSync are as follows:
 It requires licenses. Each user who needs to run GoldMine remotely has
to have a license broken off from the main group of GoldMine licenses
and installed on a laptop. These licenses are called “undocked licenses.”
If licenses are scarce, an undocked license can be put back into the main
group when not needed by a remote user.
 It updates field by field. GoldSync keeps each remote user up-to-date by
sending all the data that has been changed since the last time GoldSync
was run. This updating is done on a field-by-field basis, not record by
record. This means that if the phone number in a particular record is
changed, only the new phone number is actually sent back and forth. By
crunching the data and sending only what has changed (not the entire
record), GoldSync is very quick and efficient.
 The last user to change a field wins. Every time you change any data in
a field, GoldMine saves a record of that change in its transaction log. If
someone using GoldMine on the server changes a phone number and a
remote user also changes that phone number, the transaction log makes
sure that the most recent change is the one that sticks.
 It runs automatically. You can set GoldSync up to run automatically at reg-
ular intervals — typically once a day. You can initiate this process by either
the remote laptop or by the GoldMine server, but the best approach is to
have the remote user initiate each synchronization session. Otherwise, the
server might be trying to communicate with a laptop that’s stowed in the
trunk of a rental car.
GoldSync has so many nooks, crannies, and gotchas that I have to recom-
mend that you find an experienced GoldMine consultant if you insist on using
it. Nevertheless, a wizard is embedded in GoldMine that you can use to set up
GoldSync. You get to this wizard from the main menu by choosing Tools➪
Synchronize➪Synchronization Wizard.
47
Chapter 4: Accessing GoldMine Remotely 

Three main steps are involved in each synchronization session:
1. A transfer set is created based on changes to the data since the speci-
fied “cutoff” date.
2. The GoldMine data server and the remote computer connect via the
Internet and exchange data.
3. The retrieving computer incorporates the updates into its database.
FrontRange has published three detailed documents that include information
on GoldSync as well as on many other technical aspects of GoldMine. You can
download each of these documents for free from www.ccc24k.com. The doc-
uments are as follows:
 GMPE 8 User Guide
 GMPE 8 Install Guide
 GMPE 8 Administrator Guide
Adding iGoldMine Plus
iGoldMinePlus is an add-on product that you can buy from your GoldMine
dealer. With iGoldMinePlus, you can run the copy of GoldMine that is installed
on your office server. In fact, you can run up to 35 different applications if
you have an iGoldMinePlus license. These 35 applications can be almost any-
thing (except HEAT). For example, your remote users might use iGoldMinePlus
for access to accounting, inventory, or quotation systems. Each user may be
restricted to just those applications that he is authorized to use.
You need to have one iGoldMinePlus license for each user — these licenses
are “named,” not concurrent. GoldMine licenses are concurrent, meaning that
if you have a ten-user license for GoldMine, any ten people can use GoldMine
simultaneously although you may have 20 or more total users. Named
licenses require that anyone who might ever use the system has her own
license. So if you have 20 total users, each of whom might at some point use
iGoldMinePlus, you need to have 20 iGoldMinePlus licenses.
Due to some interesting and creative licensing from FrontRange, you can
access GoldMine and up to 34 other applications with iGoldMinePlus, but if
you want to access GoldMine and HEAT, you need two iGoldMinePlus
licenses. HEAT, by the way, is a customer support system developed and sup-
ported by FrontRange. It integrates to a small degree with GoldMine.
48
Part I: GoldMine Premium Basics 

FrontRange didn’t actually develop iGoldMinePlus. It licensed a product
called GoGlobal, which is available from a small group of GoldMine dealers.
By purchasing GoGlobal instead of iGoldMinePlus, you might benefit from
less restrictive licensing and, perhaps, more favorable pricing. Of course, you
will then have to get your support for GoGlobal from your dealer.
Accessing GoldMine with 
Remote Desktop
Remote Desktop (formerly known as Terminal Services) is an alternative to
both iGoldMinePlus and GoGlobal. It’s an add-on to your Windows operating
system and comes from Microsoft. Frankly, this is what I use when I need to
get into GoldMine if I’m not in the office. Depending on what operating system
you use, some number of Remote Desktop licenses may even be included. 
Remote Desktop, which is included with Windows XP Professional, enables
you to connect your computer via the Internet from almost any computer or
Smartphone. After you are connected, Remote Desktop gives you mouse and
keyboard control over the server to which you have just connected. In other
words, you are dialing into your company’s GoldMine server and using that
computer as though you were sitting right in front of it. As long as you have a
decent broadband connection, the speed is almost as good as it is when you
are sitting in the office. 
Using Handheld Devices
A handheld device, for this discussion, is any phone such as a BlackBerry or a
Treo that can connect to the Internet and has a graphic display. These devices
are inherently different from a laptop because they can’t actually load and run
GoldMine. Nor can they display GoldMine as you’re used to seeing it. You just
can’t fit the entire GoldMine screen on a 2" by 2" display. And you can’t expect
to download your entire GoldMine database into one of these devices.
Depending upon how much memory is in your handheld and how many
records are in your database, you can expect to keep your basic contact
information (names, addresses, phone numbers, and so on) in your hand-
held. You can also expect to coordinate your GoldMine calendar with the cal-
endar in your handheld. Many of my clients also send e-mails directly from
their handhelds and then store those e-mails in their GoldMine database.
49
Chapter 4: Accessing GoldMine Remotely 

CompanionLink
CompanionLink has been around for a long time and is sold by most of the
GoldMine dealers. You can check with your own dealer or log on to www.
ccc24k.com for product details and to purchase CompanionLink. It allows
you to plug your handheld into a cradle and download the static information
(names, addresses, phone numbers, for example) for many, perhaps thou-
sands, of records. Don’t expect your BlackBerry to store all your history and
linked documents, though. That’s really asking too much.
You can edit the GoldMine data on your handheld and then sync it back into
your main GoldMine database when you return to the office.
wMobile
wMobile is an add-on product produced by W-Systems and distributed by
several of the more experienced GoldMine dealers. With wMobile, you can
use almost any handheld device (for example, BlackBerry and Treo) that
allows access to the Internet to actually run GoldMine. Well, not exactly
GoldMine. As mentioned previously, the display on a handheld device is too
small for the entire GoldMine screen. wMobile provides virtually all the
essential GoldMine information in a condensed and simple format. You can
customize the fields that you see, thereby turning your handheld into a very
powerful remote access device. For example, if you have added some custom
fields (perhaps a priority field or a credit limit field) to your GoldMine,
wMobile comes with tools allowing you to add those same custom fields to
the display you see on your handheld.
With wMobile, you don’t store any of your GoldMine data in your handheld
device. This is the main difference between CompanionLink and wMobile. You
have access to your data only if you have an active Internet connection. 
You almost always have connectivity to the Internet with these devices, 
but you could be in trouble while on an airplane or if you’re deep in a 
subway tunnel.
Additional information about each of these add-on products (and any good
new ones that become available) is available at my company’s Web site
(www.ccc24k.com/add-ons.htm). Some of these products, at least at the
time of this writing, offer free trials. Additional information about these prod-
ucts and possible trials is also available by writing to me at
dummies@ccc24k.com.

Managing
Contacts

In this part . . .
T
he real point of GoldMine is the management of all
your accounts. Assuming that you have customers,
clients, or accounts, all of which are basically the same
thing, this part of the book gives you a solid feel for
entering and managing all the basic contact information
in GoldMine.
How and when to enter free-form notes is an art form that
may help keep you out of trouble later. Additional contacts
that seem important enough to keep track of can be kept
within the secondary contact system or managed within
the newly enhanced Relationships tab. Random tidbits
can be housed in the Details section. The Referral section
allows you to relate one account to one or to many others.
Filters, Groups, SQL Queries, and the SQL Query Building
Wizard are all tools you need to focus on specific types
of accounts or activities. With these, you can tailor
reports and marketing campaigns and truly automate
your business.

Creating and Viewing 
Client Records
In This Chapter
 Creating new records
 Locating records

 Grouping custom fields into views
I
f you actively use GoldMine in your business, you probably need to create
new records just about every day. And you may need to quickly locate
existing records in the database many times each day. In this chapter, you
find out how to do these tasks efficiently.
Out of the box, GoldMine is a terrific general contact-management system.
But the developers don’t know the details of your business, so they can’t
think of every field you may require. They’re smart enough, however, to give
you the ability to create these fields yourself. After you create fields, you can
use your custom fields the same way you use all other fields. In this chapter, I
show you how to enter a new record manually.
Creating New Records
A sure sign of a growing, healthy business is a steady increase in the number
of records in its database. You can add new company records or new individ-
ual contact records that belong to company records.
Adding a new company
To add a new company, click the New Company button in the upper-left corner
of the main work area. This brings you to a short drop-down list allowing you

54
Part II: Managing Contacts 
to decide to enter either a new company and primary contact or just a new sec-
ondary contact that relates to an existing company. Figure 5-1 shows the dialog
box for entering a new company.
The first two fields that you see in Figure 5-1 are the Company name and main
contact person’s full name (Contact). When you enter information into these
fields, type them in upper- and lowercase letters. You may eventually want to
merge the data in these fields into a Word template. Then your word proces-
sor will display them exactly as you typed them into the database. I discuss
this topic in Chapter 16. Most people use a combination of capital letters and
lowercase letters for contact and address information in a letter, so type your
field names in GoldMine that way.
If you forget to use standard, consistent capitalization when you enter data,
don’t panic. The software police will not come looking for you, and you won’t
suddenly be assaulted by horrendous error messages. However, your letter
will surely look less personal. Your client may recognize that the letter was
computer-generated and figure that no human being even touched it. So
spend a little time properly capitalizing your entries, and you may benefit
from some warm, fuzzy feelings from your clients.
Entering additional contacts
GoldMine 8 features a streamlined method for adding additional contact
records for an existing company. This does not create secondary contacts, but
rather a completely separate record for the new contact — with a relationship
automatically formed. When you initially enter a new company, you also enter
that company’s primary contact person. Chances are, for many of your
accounts, there are additional people also associated with the account. More
details on handling additional contacts are in Chapter 6.
Figure 5-1:
Create a
record for a
new
company.

To add more contacts to GoldMine, follow these steps:
1. Click the down arrow to the right of the New Company button to enter
a New Contact.
The screen shown in Figure 5-2 appears. It’s important that the primary
contact’s record is the active one as you are adding additional contacts
to that same company.
2. Select Auto-fill with Primary Address if the additional contact person
is at the same physical address.
This grabs the address information from the primary record and copies
it to the record you are creating. It does not copy phone information.
3. Select the Create Duplicate Record option in the lower-left corner if
you want to copy more than just the physical address.
This copies virtually all the fields from the upper portion of the screen
and allows you to edit whatever you need to change in the newly created
record.
Dealing with Jr., Sr., and III
GoldMine tries to determine automatically the last name of a contact by look-
ing at the name you enter in the Contact field. It takes the last full word you
type, assumes that this is the last name, and places it in the Last field on the
main screen. This works fine if you type a simple name, such as Jim Smith.
But if you type Jim Smith, Jr., GoldMine mistakes Jr. for the last name and puts
it in the Last field.
I often use the Last field to look up records in the database, and it’s not helpful
to have this field cluttered with hundreds of Jr.s rather than actual last names.
The solution to this dilemma is to type the full name in the Contact field,
including Jr. or Sr.; then, when you return to the main screen, manually correct
the Last field by changing Jr. or Sr. to the actual last name of the contact.

Chapter 5: Creating and Viewing Client Records

Entering U.S. telephone numbers
The Phone number field holds the primary telephone number for the client.
Every telephone number can also include an associated extension of up to six
characters. Six digits is the limit, even though it looks as though more space
is available.
Type the 10 digits of the area code and telephone number without parenthe-
ses, dashes, or any other punctuation. GoldMine automatically applies the
format (909)792-8636 to a U.S. telephone number.
You don’t do any harm if you go ahead and type the punctuation; you’re just
working harder than you have to.
Entering telephone numbers 
for the rest of the world
Other countries use a variety of telephone number formats, so things get a
little trickier when you’re entering telephone numbers for clients outside the
United States.
To enter a telephone number in a format other than the standard U.S. format,
select the International Format check box on this dialog box. After selecting
International Format, you can type the phone number any way you want, and
GoldMine applies no additional formatting. The field can hold up to 20 char-
acters, not including the extension field.
The extension field has one of those right-arrow buttons next to it, indicating
that it has a lookup list. The list is taken from the Extension field associated
with Phone1 on the main screen. If you modify that lookup list on the main
screen, those changes also appear on the Add a New Record dialog box.
E-mail addresses — you’ve 
got to collect ’em
As with the fax machine, e-mail is here to stay. In fact, it’s not hard to argue
that, for many businesses, e-mail is rapidly overtaking the fax machine as the
communication device of choice. Your clients likely have an e-mail address
(or two or three). Making use of this technology is not just important, it’s
essential. Fortunately, GoldMine enables you to collect, store, and use e-mail
addresses easily. E-mailing is discussed in Chapters 17 and 18.
56
Part II: Managing Contacts 

If you religiously gather e-mail addresses for every new and existing account,
you can send individual e-mails, broadcast e-mails, attached documents,
photos, and almost anything else that is critical to business communication.
But first you have to obtain the addresses and put them in the database.
The primary e-mail address is a piece of information you normally enter
while you’re creating a new record. There is no limit to the number of e-mail
addresses a contact could have, so you can always go back to that contact’s
record and add more e-mail addresses. These are displayed in the Details tab,
and you can get more information about this in Chapter 7.
Entering Web site addresses
You can also add a Web address for this new company. This address is clearly
different from the client’s e-mail address. The Web site defines the URL or
address of the company’s Web page.
If you enter the Web site address, GoldMine can easily direct you or any of
your co-workers to this client’s Web site. That is, you can pull up the client’s
Web page right from GoldMine.
You can enter only one Web site address on this dialog box. If a client has mul-
tiple Web sites, you can enter additional sites later within the Details tab of
the main screen. See Chapter 7 for more information on using the Details tab.
Checking for duplicate records
As you enter new records into GoldMine, asking it to search for duplicate
records is useful. GoldMine checks the following for you, based on up to
three fields:
 Company and Contact name
 Phone number
I suggest that you select both the Phone number and the Company/Contact
name. If you enter a phone number that exactly matches one already existing
in your database, GoldMine notifies you before it adds your new record (but
annoyingly, it does so only after you enter all the information into the Add a
New Company and Contact dialog box), and then you have an opportunity to
decide whether to proceed.
Contact name and Company name work a little differently. GoldMine checks to
see whether what you just entered matches the beginning of any existing contact
or company name. For example, if you enter Computer, the system warns you if
57
Chapter 5: Creating and Viewing Client Records

it finds an existing record with Computer Control Corporation in the Company
name field. This result may be desirable, or may not be. The Contact name field
works the same way. Try it; you can always turn off this feature if it aggravates
you when you’re really doing what you intended to do in the first place.
If you do create some duplicate records, you can combine them by using the
merge/purge utility. You can find that utility on the Tools main menu. Selecting
Merge/Purge Records brings you to the wizard that walks you through the
entire procedure. The merge/purge utility has the capacity to merge all your
individual records into one record — probably not what you want! As always,
make sure you have a recent backup before doing this or any procedure that
affects multiple records. Just as “brush only the teeth you want to keep” makes
sense, so does “back up all the data that matters to you.” As soon as you click
OK, you return to the GoldMine main screen. Your new record has now been
created, and you can continue with all the additional fields on the main screen.
Finding a Record in Your Database
As you use GoldMine, the task you will probably find yourself doing most fre-
quently is finding a record. Scheduling activities, writing notes, or checking a
client’s history requires you to look up the correct record. And every time
the phone rings, you may want to quickly check the caller’s record.
If you’re like me, you get lots of calls every day. Some of these calls come from a
person who clearly knows who I am, but for the life of me, I can’t recall who he
or she is. The last thing I want the mystery caller to know is that I don’t remem-
ber him or her. So I sometimes need to quickly and quietly find a client’s record
while I’m saying hello and making small talk. With a little practice, you can find
any record, no matter how many are in your database, in just a few seconds.
The semi-secret and fast 
way to find a record
Most of the fields on the main screen allow you to point your mouse at a label
and double-click, which opens a browse window. For example, if you double-
click the Last label, a browse window, like the one shown in Figure 5-3,
appears. This browse window is actually called the Search Center, which was
brand new in version 6.0. In Figure 5-3, I have already entered the letter “g” in
the search field, so GoldMine is listing all my accounts that have a primary
contact whose last name begins with that letter.
To make the browse window (Search Center) appear, be sure to double-click
the field label — not the text box in which you enter data.
58
Part II: Managing Contacts 

More sophisticated searches
The Search Center has gradually been getting more sophisticated and now
allows you to do much more complex searches. In GoldMine 8, you can now
search on multiple fields at the same time. For example, you could find all the
accounts in California that have fax numbers. You expand your search from
the simple kind of single field search described in the previous section to
multiple fields by clicking the Search button in the upper-left corner of the
GoldMine screen.
When the Search Center window appears, you can select which fields to dis-
play by clicking the Columns button in the upper-right corner of the Search
Center. Doing so displays the screen shown in Figure 5-4.
You can add or delete fields (columns) from the Search Center display by
highlighting the particular field and selecting the left or right arrows in the
middle of the screen to add or delete the column.
If you click the small down arrow just below the Columns in the upper-right
corner of the Search Center GoldMine immediately expands your search to
multiple fields. This is a very powerful feature. You can see the example of
California accounts that have fax numbers in Figure 5-5. You can use a series
of AND or OR operators to separate each specification.

Part II: Managing Contacts 

In Boolean logic, ANDs take priority over ORs. Also, you can’t use parenthe-
ses to control the precedence as well as you can when building filters.
Using a Custom Field
Custom fields are fields that you, someone in your company, or your
GoldMine dealer set up to meet your organization’s specific needs. They
don’t come as part of the standard package; they are developed because you
need to track some particular data.
If you have more than a few custom fields, you can group them into custom
field views. Each view is set up with a separate file folder tab and may have
its own access rights. Consequently, certain people or groups of people may
not be able to see or edit the data in a particular field view.
Who needs custom fields, anyway?
Almost every business needs to track some unique information. GoldMine
has all the common fields that almost every business needs to use. Your busi-
ness is probably a little different from mine, so you may need some fields that
I don’t need.
Each department in your organization probably tracks different information.
The following lists show some examples of information that particular
departments may track.
 Accounting department
• Credit limit
• Credit terms
 Marketing department
• Related interests
• Will be a reference (Y/N)
• Wants newsletter (Y/N)
 Sales department
• Competition
• Purchases YTD
• Budget cycle

Chapter 5: Creating and Viewing Client Records

How custom fields get on-screen
Placing custom fields on-screen takes some design effort. Usually, an experi-
enced GoldMine dealer handles this process, but nothing prevents you from
doing it yourself.
Interview some people from the departments that use GoldMine to determine
which custom fields you may need to add to your program. Review all the
reports they currently use and any reports they plan to implement in the
future. Reports always provide good clues as to what fields need to be avail-
able in the database. Ask as many questions as you can.
GoldMine provides three field types: numbers, text, and date. Yes, it would be
nice if there were more field types and more formatting capability. When you
create a custom field, you must define the field type, field length, F2 lookup
list, and access rights for the field.
Accessing field views
GoldMine is capable of holding hundreds of custom fields. More than ten or
so, however, becomes unmanageable if they aren’t segregated into logical
groups. These groups are called views, and each view is associated with its
own tab. 
Particular access rights are often assigned to an entire view. For example, the
Accounting view may have data that the marketing department doesn’t need
to see or change.
If your system has any custom field views, you access them by following
these steps:
1. Click the Fields tab.
2. Position the cursor anywhere in the area below the tab and right-
click.
A selection window appears, listing all the additional field views.
3. Select the appropriate field view from the first section of the selection
window, as shown in Figure 5-6.
62
Part II: Managing Contacts 

Adding the same field to two different views is just fine, but they are only one
field in the database. The information entered in one view will show up in the
other. Just because they are placed on two views doesn’t make them two dif-
ferent fields. This is good for something such as an account number that
needs to be in the Accounting view along with all the items you don’t want
salespeople to see, but it may also be in the Sales view so that salespeople
can know the correct account number for taking orders.

Handling Notes and 
Secondary Contacts
In This Chapter
 Using the Main Notepad
 Entering secondary contacts
 Editing secondary contacts
You can use GoldMine to maintain a complete audit trail of everything that
has ever happened with each of your accounts. You use various notepads
to record your notes about each of your accounts. Sometimes, this audit trail
can get you out of trouble. Better yet, if you use it consistently, it can keep you
from getting into trouble in the first place. The stark reality, however, is that
you have to make it a habit to type in notes if you are to reap the benefits. That
means that you actually have to enter your notes every time you complete an
activity. And remembering to enter your notes may be the hardest part.
In this chapter, you find a discussion of the main Notes and Contacts tabs.
Every contact record in GoldMine contains a series of file folder tabs in the
lower third of the work area. In “The Main Notepad” section of this chapter,
you discover how to view existing notes, how to enter new notes, and, most
important, what notes you should actually put there.
Additionally, you discover how to find additional people listed in the
Contacts tab and how to enter new or edit existing information in this chap-
ter. You also discover how to determine when to use the Contacts section
and when to create a separate record.
The Main Notepad
One of the standard tabs on the main menu is labeled Notes. When you click
this tab for the first time in a particular record, the main notepad appears

66
Part II: Managing Contacts 
and is completely blank except for the Add note button in the upper-left
corner. The main notepad, shown in Figure 6-1, is sitting there waiting for you
to start typing.
If you type lots of notes for a particular record, you won’t be able to see them
all on-screen at the same time. Use the scroll arrows on the right to scroll
through the notepad.
What to put in the main notepad
So what notes go in the main notepad? GoldMine contains many different
notepads. In fact, a similar notepad is associated with every activity that you
schedule or complete. You should particularly understand the distinction
between the main notepad and those in the scheduled and completed activi-
ties sections. See Chapters 9 through 11 for more details.
You should put general comments concerning the account into the main
notepad. If you hear a rumor about a pending IPO, make a note of it here. Any
concerns you might have about your client’s credit rating should go in the
main notepad as well. If you had a problem with someone at the client site,
put it here rather than in the Completed Activities notepad.

Starting a new note
Starting with version 6.0, GoldMine made starting a new note and date and
time stamping the note completely idiot proof. To start a new note, simply
follow these steps:
1. Click the Notes tab and then the Add Note button in the upper-left corner.
A blank space appears and you can just start typing.
2. To have GoldMine check your spelling when you’re done typing (but
before you save the note), right-click within the text area and, in the
drop-down list that appears, select Spell Check.
GoldMine goes through your entire note, letting you and your third grade
teacher know which words were misspelled and suggesting corrections.
3. Select the yellow Save icon to save your note.
GoldMine automatically date and time stamps the note and records your
username on the note (see Figure 6-2). If you forget to save your note,
GoldMine does it for you anyway.

Chapter 6: Handling Notes and Secondary Contacts
Take notes — stay out of court
Several years ago, a local attorney called our
office and asked us to send a computer techni-
cian to his office to repair a computer. The same
request was made twice more in the following
months. All three times, the technician was dis-
patched, the computer was repaired, and the
attorney was billed. By this time, the attorney
had run up bills totaling $830.
On December 31st, this client sat down to pay
his bills, apparently for the whole year. We
received a check from him for $380. You might
think that he mistakenly transposed the digits.
But in two places on the check he had written,
“Paid in Full.” I knew that meant that if I cashed
the check, I was accepting it as payment in full,
and I would have no legal recourse toward col-
lecting the money he owed us.
I called this client and convinced him to come
over to our office. He initially refused to rewrite
the check. In fact, he then claimed that he didn’t
owe us any money at all because I could not
prove that any of our technicians had ever been
to his office!
I showed him the GoldMine screens where we
had three pages of date- and time-stamped
notes detailing everything we had done in the
past three months at his office. He asked if I
could print it all out. I told him, “Yes, but only for
the judge.” He literally ran out to his car to get
his checkbook, and he couldn’t pay us fast
enough.
I am certain that we never would have been
paid had we not maintained the complete notes
about all the work we had done for him.
The moral of the story is that you should write
everything down. And be especially careful and
thorough with your notes if your relationship
with an account seems to be headed in an
uncomfortable direction.

The main notepad lets you type anything you want. But be careful:
Everything you write can be read by everyone else on your team and possi-
bly by others outside your team. Never type anything that you wouldn’t put
out for public view.
In previous versions of GoldMine, you could edit or even delete your old
notes or someone else’s notes. That didn’t make for a very secure audit trail
and actually made the legal value of these notes somewhat questionable. In
GoldMine 8, you can no longer edit existing notes in the main notepad,
although it’s easy enough to just delete a note by right-clicking within the
note and then selecting Delete Note. There is no warning to make sure you
really mean it, though.
Designing a coherent report based on information in the main notepad is dif-
ficult. Finding key words or particular items that belong together can be
hard, but you can do a text search for a key word or phrase. This search will
go through all your active records to locate those accounts that have that
word or phrase in the main notepad. I mention “active records” because if
you activate a filter, only those records that belong with that filter are avail-
able for the search. More information is available about filters and groups
and SQL queries in Chapter 8.
Figure 6-2:

time stamp.
68
Part II: Managing Contacts 

To do a text search within the main notepads of all your accounts:
1. Select Search from the Toolbar.
The Search Center appears.
2. Select the down arrow to the right of the Search By box.
A drop-down list appears, showing Notes as one of the choices within
the alphabetical listing of fields.
3. Select Notes and then select the appropriate operator from the next
box, as shown in Figure 6-3.
When the Search By drop-down list is invoked, press the N key on the
keyboard. The first word that starts with N appears. Continue pressing N
until the word Notes appears. Then select it.
4. Click the Search button.
GoldMine begins cruising through all your active records. There is a per-
cent complete area that shows you GoldMine’s progress as it goes through
your records. If you have a large database, this could take a while.

Chapter 6: Handling Notes and Secondary Contacts

If meaningful reporting is your thing, you will find it easier to create a report
based on a particular user, a range of dates, or some kind of Result Code if
those notes are in Pending or History records rather than in the main
notepad.
When you come back from an appointment or hang up the phone and want to
detail what went on, write those notes in the Completed Activity notepad. See
Chapter 11 for more information on that.
The Contacts Tab
In many, if not most, of your accounts, you deal with more than one person.
When you need to keep track of more than one person for an account, you
can add the information for each additional person you deal with by using
the Contacts tab. GoldMine refers to these additional people as secondary
contacts or additional contacts. Entering information for primary contacts is
discussed in Chapter 5.
When I am dealing with a major account (one for which I have many impor-
tant contacts), I usually enter each of these people as a separate record and
relate them via the Relationships function that is explained in Chapter 24.
When I need to keep track of someone with whom I don’t expect to have
much communication, I enter that person as a secondary contact. In my own
case, for example, someone in accounting might be a secondary contact, and
that information is useful to me when I have to call to find out where my
check is. Because I don’t market my services to people in accounting, I can
get away with this. If I were consulting on accounting software, I would
approach it differently.
The Organization Chart was significantly enhanced in recent versions,
although in GoldMine 8 that has morphed into the Relationships tab. I now
use the Contacts tab to house only those people I don’t intend to directly cor-
respond with. An example might be someone in the Accounts Payable depart-
ment. I might need to call this person sometime, but I probably won’t include
him or her in my quarterly newsletter distribution list.
The Contacts section is the first section that is relational in nature. A rela-
tional system implies that you have a one-to-many situation. In this case, rela-
tional means there may be many secondary contacts for each account. In
fact, you have an unlimited number of secondary contacts that you can
attach to each account.
70
Part II: Managing Contacts 

Entering a new secondary contact
To enter a new secondary contact, follow these steps:
1. Click the Contacts tab.
2. Move the cursor anywhere in the area below the highlighted Contacts
tab and right-click.
You see a drop-down menu (shown in Figure 6-4) that enables you to
enter new contacts or edit existing contacts.
3. Select New from the drop-down list.
GoldMine then displays a data entry window in which you can enter a
considerable amount of information about a new contact, as shown in
Figure 6-5. The window contains four sections of information, same as
the window for entering the primary contact’s information. Read on for
more information about these four sections.
Figure 6-4:
The drop-
down menu

contacts.
71
Chapter 6: Handling Notes and Secondary Contacts

In the first section, you see three fields:
 Name: Enter names just as you do on the main screen. Use upper- and
lowercase letters, and enter the first name followed by the last name.
 Title: This field’s purpose is obvious. You can make use of a lookup list
with this field. The lookup list is the same as the Title lookup on the
main screen.
 Ref.: The Reference field is really synonymous with the Department field
on the main screen, and you should use it this way. See Chapter 5 for
details on entering information on the main screen. The Reference field
also has a lookup list.
The second section contains address information corresponding to the infor-
mation in the address area of the main screen. If this secondary person’s
address is the same as the address for the main record, you can just select
the Auto-Fill option. Auto-Fill automatically copies the address information
from the primary contact’s record to the secondary contact’s record. It’s a
time-saving feature and is great if you are entering a lot of people all at the
same address. Putting anything in the address fields, such as a room number
or P.O. Box, turns off the Auto-Fill feature from the primary record.
If you intend to use secondary contacts for mailing, be certain that either NO
fields or ALL fields of the secondary address are filled out.  
The third section contains fields for an e-mail address, a phone number, and a
fax number. Each of these fields is specific to the secondary person you’re
entering. Again, you can leave out the phone numbers if they are the same as
the primary contact’s phone numbers, but remember to collect as many
e-mail addresses as you can.
This third section also has an E-mail Merge code field. You can regulate what
e-mail correspondence goes to your secondary contacts. Also, this Merge
code field is what allows you to specify this. For example, by entering “XMAS”
Figure 6-5:
Enter the
new
secondary
contact’s
information
in the
Contact
dialog box.
72
Part II: Managing Contacts 

as a code in just select secondary contact records, you can regulate who gets
an electronic Christmas card. You can find a little more on this topic in
Chapters 13 and 14.
The fourth section contains the Dear field, mail merge codes, and another
one of the ubiquitous notepads.
The Dear field, or Salutation field, is the same as the Dear field on the main
GoldMine screen. Enter into this field the greeting you want to use when you
write a letter to this person.
The mail merge codes enable you to regulate what printed correspondence
this person receives. The mail merge field has a lookup list, and you can have
multiple entries from the lookup list, of course. These mail merge codes work
together with filters and groups that you can build. Working with filters and
groups is detailed in Chapter 8.
If you need multiple entries for mail merge codes, such as “XMAS, BD, ANN,
NYD,” keep your abbreviations short. You are limited to a total of 19 charac-
ters, and the commas and spaces between entries count. The E-Mail Merge
field discussed previously has only 15 characters. The shorter your abbrevia-
tions, the more choices you can fit into one field. See Chapter 26 for more
about using lookup lists.
Editing an existing secondary contact
Sometimes you create a secondary contact but you don’t have all the impor-
tant information at hand. You may need to go back and enter the contact’s
address or e-mail address later. Or perhaps this person’s phone number
changed. You can add or edit information in a secondary contact’s record by
following these steps:
1. Click the Contacts tab.
2. Right-click the contact name that you want to edit.
A drop-down list appears.
Double-clicking the secondary contact you want to edit also enables you
to edit a secondary contact’s information.
3. Select Edit from the drop-down list.
You return to the original secondary contact window.
4. Enter new information or edit existing information and then click OK
to save your changes when you’re done.
73
Chapter 6: Handling Notes and Secondary Contacts

Swapping the secondary contact 
with the primary one
Occasionally, someone who was secondary becomes more important in the
scheme of things, and you need to promote him or her to primary status.
GoldMine enables you to do this easily, as follows:
1. Click the Contacts tab.
2. Right-click the current secondary person you want to promote to 
primary status.
3. Click Options.
4. Click Swap with Primary and then confirm that you really do want to
do this.
After you confirm, the person who was the main contact is dropped into the
Contacts tab to join the rest of the commoners down there. The person who
had been in the secondary section is promoted to the top. This swap can be
temporary because you can reverse it very easily.
Converting a secondary record 
to a stand-alone record
Sometimes one of your secondary records deserves to become a separate
record, either by itself or still somehow related to a main record. For exam-
ple, a major change in the organization of an account may warrant a change
to a stand-alone record.
To create a separate stand-alone record, follow these steps:
1. Click the Contacts tab.
2. Right-click the current secondary person you want to deal with.
3. Click Options.
4. Select Convert to Record from the menu and then confirm that you
really do want to make the change.
GoldMine removes the secondary contact from the initial record and creates
a completely separate record for the contact. You can still maintain a rela-
tionship between the original secondary contact and the rest of the people at
that account by using the Relationships tab, which I discuss in detail in
Chapter 24.

Chapter 7
Details and Referrals
In This Chapter
 Taking care of the details
 Using the Referrals tab
T
he Details tab allows you to save random tidbits of information that
relate to individual records. You can search for them and report on them
as well. The Referrals tab enables you to relate one account in your database
to another.
The Details and the Referrals tabs are two of the least understood and least
used of the basic sections of GoldMine. But the truth is that they aren’t that
hard to understand, and they can both be very useful. In this chapter, you
find out how to use them, and you find some recommendations on clever
ways to make the most of them.
Taking Care of the Details
I like to think of the Details tab as containing random, relational information.
By relational, I mean that one account in your GoldMine database may con-
tain an unlimited number of detail entries. Another way to say this is to call it
a “one-to-many relationship.” You can use the Details tab to store data that
isn’t necessarily needed for every record.
For example, suppose you want to keep track of a credit card number for
each account. You could create a user-defined field for the credit card
number. A user-defined field is a new field that you define and place into the
GoldMine database. It would be fine to use one of these fields until the first
time a client tells you he has two credit cards you need to keep on file. You
paint yourself into a corner by using a user-defined field for credit cards or
for any other kind of data that might require multiple entries.

76
Part II: Managing Contacts 
The Details tab solves this problem by enabling you to set up many different
details and use each only when you need it. And you can use the same detail
(such as the second credit card number) as many times as you need to for
each account.
The Details tab also solves a problem sometimes involving the Fields tab. If
you have any user-defined, custom fields, they are displayed in the Fields tab.
For every record, whether or not you fill in any data in each of these fields,
space is taken on your hard drive. So, if you’ve developed 50 custom fields,
but on average use only three of them, the other 47 take up space but don’t
really do anything for you.
When you enter your data into the Details tab, only then does GoldMine
create the storage space it needs. If you don’t have credit card information
for an account, no space is taken up on your hard drive.
Using existing details
The Details tab includes 3 preset, separate details that you can use immedi-
ately, as shown in Figure 7-1.
Without a doubt, the most important detail record is the e-mail address.
When you create a new record for a contact (see Chapter 5 for information
about entering new records), one of the entries you make is in the E-Mail
Address field. When you enter an address in this field, GoldMine automati-
cally puts this e-mail address directly into the Details tab for that record. The
e-mail address is also displayed on the main GoldMine screen, along with the
phone numbers. You don’t need to do anything special to put the e-mail
address in either place, or even to use it later.
Figure 7-1:
The preset
details.

You’re not limited to just this one initial e-mail address. You can enter as
many more addresses as needed, which is becoming increasingly common as
more and more people acquire multiple e-mail addresses. GoldMine stores
one e-mail address as the primary address and the rest as secondary
addresses.
Aside from just storing data, the Details tab can also be actively used. For
example, you can send an e-mail message to one of your accounts directly
from its Details tab (assuming that you’re using GoldMine’s e-mail rather than
Outlook) by following these steps:
1. Click the Details tab.
2. Select the e-mail address you want to send the correspondence to.
3. Right-click and select Send E-mail from the shortcut menu.
4. Compose and send your e-mail message.
Entering new details
If, for some reason, you didn’t enter the e-mail address (or some other kind of
detail) when the record was first created, it isn’t too late. To enter an e-mail
address after the record has been created:
1. Click the Details tab.
2. Right-click in the area below the tab and choose New.
Immediately, the Detail Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 7-2,
appears, enabling you to enter a new detail. This figure shows an exam-
ple of driving directions.
The first field, Detail, stores the type of detail you’re recording. This field
wants to know, “What kind of information are you trying to set up here?”
Figure 7-2:
Enter new
information
in the Detail
Properties
dialog box. 
77
Chapter 7: Details and Referrals 

This Detail field has a lookup list that shows the preset details available to
you. To access this list, click the arrow to the right of the Detail field. Select 
E-Mail Address and tab to the next field, labeled Reference. GoldMine stores
the actual data for each detail in the Reference field. In this example, you
enter the e-mail address into the Reference field. 
Creating your own details
Creating your own, new detail isn’t hard and you probably at least several
kinds of Detail records that will be useful to your operation.
Remember, it’s appropriate to use a Detail record for any field that won’t be
used for every single record or when multiple entries may exist (such as
credit cards).
One of my favorite details to add to the system is one for driving directions
to the client’s location. To create this detail, follow these steps:
1. From the main GoldMine screen, click the Details tab.
2. Right-click in the area below the tab and choose New from the short-
cut menu.
3. Select the arrow to the right of the Detail field to see the Detail lookup
list.
4. In the lookup list, click the New button.
5. Type Directions and click OK.
The list of details now includes an entry for directions, and you can use it any
time. You may not need the Reference field, but you can use the Notes field to
write down the specific driving directions to get to this client.
Another common use of custom details is to track individual components of a
piece of hardware. Check out Figure 7-3 to see a typical detail record tracking
the parts of a computer.
Figure 7-3:

78
Part II: Managing Contacts 

More fields you can use with details
Sometimes the Reference and Notes tabs together do not allow for enough
information. Recent versions of GoldMine have provided eight more fields in
the Info tab that goes along with each detail.
You can even eek out a few more fields within the Details tab by using an add-
on product called Details Plus. I discuss add-on products in Chapter 30.
You may want to try using the Info tab to keep track of one or more shipping
addresses for each account. Or if you sell computers, you may want to track
the details of each computer — the processor speed, the hard drive size,
modem speed, amount of memory, and so on, as shown in Figure 7-4. In this
example, I have changed several field labels to reflect information appropri-
ate for credit cards. Use the Setup tab to change field labels.
You may want to consult the GoldMine Reference Manual for further explana-
tion of this advanced topic, or have an authorized GoldMine dealer actually
set this up, and then you can access this data.
Finding specific detail records
GoldMine provides you with a way to easily look up particular records within
the Details tab. For example, if an e-mail message comes to you with an
address that you don’t recognize, you can manually check your database to
find out who the mystery sender might be by following these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Lookup➪Detail Records.
2. Choose the appropriate Detail Record type from the lookup list.
For this example, choose E-Mail Address.
Figure 7-4:
The Info tab
stores more
details. 
79
Chapter 7: Details and Referrals 

3. Type the first couple of letters of the e-mail address you are trying to
find.
GoldMine brings you to its main contact window, sorted by e-mail
address and positioned at the first e-mail address, starting with the let-
ters you just specified.
The Details Property Dialog Box, shown in Figure 7-2, has several tabs, one of
which is the Audit Tab. GoldMine automatically tracks who initially created
each detail record and who most recently modified it. With this information,
one could create a report or a series of alerts each time a record is modified.
Making Use of Referrals
The Referrals tab on GoldMine’s main screen enables you to link one record
to another or, perhaps, one record to many other records. The Referrals tab
is relational, meaning that one piece of data links to multiple pieces of other
data. By linking one record to another, you can quickly see what the relation-
ship between two or more records might be. Suppose for example, that your
accountant referred 17 other clients to you. You thank her and record each of
the referrals in your accountant’s GoldMine record. Makes her look a lot
more important, doesn’t it?
An important note is that the Referrals tab is bi-directional, so after you link
A to B, B is linked back to A. The relationship works like a toggle switch. By
double-clicking a referral listing, the record that the referral is linked to
appears. You can get right back to the original record by double-clicking the
referral listing again. In Figure 7-5, you can see two records linked to each
other in the Referrals tab.
Even if you don’t have to track leads you have given out to dealers, you may
want to use the Referrals tab for some kind of related activity. Working with
an account that uses a consultant (or an accountant, or an attorney) presents
80
Part II: Managing Contacts 
Getting directions online
Another technique for getting assistance with
directions is to make use of the GoldMine Web
interface. Directly and automatically from the
client record, you can have GoldMine dial in to
MapQuest on the Internet and provide you with
a map and driving instructions. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. From the main GoldMine menu, choose
Lookup➪Internet Search.
2. Select maps from MapQuest.

an opportunity to employ the Referrals tab. A referral is especially useful if
this same consultant pops up in other accounts of yours, and it’s also rele-
vant if you’re part of a multi-level distribution system.
To create a referral link, follow these steps:
1. From the main GoldMine screen, click the Referrals tab.
2. Right-click in the area below the tab and choose New from the short-
cut menu.
A window displaying all the records in your database appears.
3. Double-click the record you want to link to.
The Referral Properties dialog box appears, enabling you to enter the
referral information. On the left side of the dialog box, you see the origi-
nal record and an empty Reference field below it. On the right side of the
dialog box is the listing for the record to which the referral is being
placed. You use the two reference fields (one for each record) to indi-
cate what the relationship is between the two records.
Each of these two Reference fields can have a lookup list. If you plan to make
extensive use of referrals, you should set up these lookup lists to ensure
some consistency in the relationships you use. Refer to Chapter 26 for more
details on using lookup lists.
For example, if you were referring CRMworldclass to The Wall Street Journal,
you might set up the referral as shown in Figure 7-6.
At my company, we prioritize our clients and prospects, usually based on pro-
jected or actual revenue. However, the Referrals tab can influence our priorities
because an account that may never generate any revenue for us itself may refer
so much business to us that we give it preferred status.
Figure 7-5:
Record
leads from a
client on the
Referrals
tab.
81
Chapter 7: Details and Referrals 

Starting in Version 6.5, GoldMine added another tab to the Referral Properties
Dialog Box — the Status Tab. The Status Tab, shown in Figure 7-7, gives you a
convenient place to track the progress of a deal that came to you via referral.
It’s all part of the Leads Distribution System that FrontRange has gradually
been developing since the middle of version 6. 
The Status fields are hard-coded but give you a 13 step plan for documenting
this progress. Selecting a particular status does not remove the check marks
anyone put in there previously. 
If you’ve referred the lead to someone on your team who is also using
GoldMine and either connecting directly to your database or synchronizing
with it, you can both update these status fields. If you’ve sent the lead to
some outside person who is not using GoldMine, you need to manually
update the Referral Status fields.

Using Filters, Groups, 
and SQL Queries
In This Chapter
 Using filters
 Using groups
 Using SQL queries
A
s your contacts increase and your database grows, you’ll quickly find a
need to isolate certain kinds of records. For example, you may want to
see all your accounts in Albany. Another time, perhaps just those accounts in
Colorado. Yet another time, perhaps you want to see only Moe’s accounts
that have fax numbers. You can organize your records into subsets using fil-
ters and groups.
Filters are like spaghetti colanders. You can use a filter to drain away all the
records you don’t need, leaving just the ones you want — as long as you have
some logical way to specify which records you want and as long as the fields
that help you specify your criteria are the right kinds of fields.
Groups are like filters on steroids. Using groups allows for faster access to
sets of records, and groups allow you to generate sets of records where no
logical method exists to select them other than pointing at individual
records. Selecting records by pointing at them is called tagging. See the
“Building groups from manually tagged records” section for more information
about tagging records.
Each time you activate a filter, GoldMine hunts for all the records that belong
to that filter. If you’ve added a record since the last time you ran that filter,
the filter will find it. That’s why the term “dynamic” applies to filters. Groups,

84
Part II: Managing Contacts 
on the other hand, are “static.” If you add a new record that belongs to a group,
you need to manually add the record to that group or re-create the group
based on the original parameters.
After you create either a filter or a group, you can use either tool to regulate
exactly what data shows up on a report, or which accounts receive corre-
spondence, or whom to schedule for a phone call via Automated Processes
(see Chapter 27). These components of GoldMine are extremely powerful.
If the power of filters, groups, or both isn’t enough, you can move right up to
SQL queries. Such queries within GoldMine used to be the realm of the seri-
ous geek, but now GoldMine has a SQL building wizard that allows anyone to
build sophisticated queries.
Building and Using Filters
Using GoldMine, you can build simple or sophisticated filters. A simple filter
may depend upon just one field — for example, all the accounts in one city. A
more sophisticated filter may be a function of several fields and requires
some understanding of Boolean logic. (Boolean logic deals with the evalua-
tion of mathematical expressions that contain one or more ANDs, ORs, NOTs,
and parentheses.)
But don’t worry. Even if Boolean logic isn’t your cup of tea, the next few sec-
tions show you how to create almost any filter you’ll ever need.
Accessing the filter system
To access the GoldMine filter system, choose Tools➪Filters and Groups from
the main menu or choose the Filters icon from the Toolbar. Either way, the
Filters and Groups window appears, as shown in Figure 8-1.
The View Filters field displays either a specific user or Public. You can assign
filters to particular users. In Figure 8-1, you can see the existing filters belong-
ing to me (JOEL). You can assign more general filters as Public filters. This
assignment process is really more a way of separating filters into manageable
sections than anything else.
The window shown in Figure 8-1 displays all the existing filters that belong to
me. To truly explore how to set up your filters, you need to create a new
filter.

Creating and using a new filter
To create a filter, follow these steps:
1. On the Filters and Groups window (refer to Figure 8-1), click the New
button.
The New Filter dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-2.
2. Enter a name for and assign an owner to your new filter.
GoldMine accepts almost anything as a filter name, but you should name
your filters logically and specifically. When you come back in six months
looking for some filter you’re sure you’ve already created, you don’t want
to see a list of filters called Filter#1, Filter#2, and Filter#3. For example, if
you want to create a filter to isolate accounts in Connecticut, name that
filter something like “Accounts in Connecticut” or “Connecticut records.”
To assign an owner, either select yourself, Public, or another user who
hasn’t read this chapter and needs your help. Assigning an owner to a
filter allows you to group your most commonly used filters together.
Figure 8-1:
The Filters
and Groups
window.
85
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries

Also, when setting user preferences (see Chapter 3), you can prohibit a
particular user from accessing someone else’s filters. That way,
GoldMine can somewhat regulate who sees whose accounts.
3. Click the Build tab to move on to the real action of building your
filter.
The Build tab is shown in Figure 8-3. On this tab, you select the field or
fields you want to base your new filter on, as well as operators and
values.
A. Select the field you want to base your new filter on.
Click the down arrow to the right of the Field name (refer to Figure
8-3) to display all the available fields, and then select a field. If you
want to isolate all your records for the state of Connecticut, you
select the State field here and then go on to Operator and Value.

Part II: Managing Contacts 

Only GoldMine’s standard fields and user-defined fields are avail-
able for use in Filters. You can access supplementary fields, such
as e-mail address and those others in the Details tab, only by using
Groups or SQL queries.
B. Select an operator from the lookup list.
For example, if you choose Equal to (the simplest of all the opera-
tors), you’re asking GoldMine to locate all the records for which
the field exactly matches the value you supply.
C. Enter a value in the Value field.
The value you enter must match entries in your records. For exam-
ple, if you use State as your field name, your value must be the
abbreviation of the particular state you chose. In other words, use
“CT” as your value rather than “Connecticut” because the State
field itself uses abbreviations rather than the full state name.
D. Click the Insert Condition button.
Your growing filter now displays in the rectangular area below the
Field name box. Your filter is practically built, and your dialog box
should look similar to Figure 8-4.
E. Click OK.
The dialog box that lists all available filters appears. You should
see your filter listed alphabetically. Your new filter won’t do any-
thing yet because you haven’t activated it. Activating a filter causes
GoldMine to focus on just those records that meet the conditions
of the filter.
Figure 8-4:
A

87
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries

4. Activate your filter by clicking the Activate button.
The main GoldMine screen appears. In the title bar at the top, you see a
statement that your filter is active, and the last record you were dealing
with is on the screen. That old record may be in front of you even if it
isn’t part of your filter. This is curious but not harmful.
When your filter is active, as soon as you press Page Up or Page Down or
scroll to another record, you begin seeing the effect of your filter. GoldMine
ignores all the records in the database that don’t match the filter, so you see
only the records that match the criteria in your filter.
At this point, you can use your filter with
 Any of the reports you want to run: As long as your filter is active, any
report you run will have only those records that the filter has found. See
Chapter 22 for details on reports.
 Mail, fax, and e-mail merges: You can send correspondence to just a
subset of your entire database by using a filter. 
 Automated Processes: These processes are a great way to regulate your
marketing efforts. Chapter 27 discusses the details of Automated
Processes.
When you get the hang of filters, you’ll discover that they’re critical to your
daily work and that they can help you with such things as
 Replacing fields globally
 Deleting unwanted records
 Merging/purging of records
 Creating transfer sets for synchronization
 Exporting
 Scheduling
 Running reports
Unlike Groups, when you use a filter it will find all the records that currently
match the filter’s criteria. This is called dynamic selection. With Groups, you
see only those records that met the Group criteria at the time the Group was
created unless you manually added records to the original Group. 
Releasing a filter
As long as a filter is active, you won’t be able to easily use records outside
the scope of that filter. You can get your entire database back by releasing the
active filter. You can release a filter by
88
Part II: Managing Contacts 

 Clicking the Filters icon from the Toolbar
 Clicking the Release button on the Filters and Groups window
After you release your filter, the main screen returns, and the title bar shows
nothing but the name of the current record.
Counting records in a filter
When you completely finish entering a filter, the Filters and Groups window
appears. Every time you finish developing a filter, ask GoldMine for a count of
the records that the filter finds. You can do so by highlighting the specific
filter, right-clicking, and selecting Count from the menu that appears, as
shown in Figure 8-5. Alternatively, you can use the Preview tab instead of
Count. The Preview option shows you the specific records that are included
in your filter.
GoldMine immediately begins counting how many records in the entire data-
base fall within the scope of this filter. Many times when you develop a filter,
you don’t know ahead of time exactly how many records you will find. That’s
okay, but you may want to know approximately how many are within a filter.
Figure 8-5:
Counting
records in a
filter.
89
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries

What you don’t want is a filter that finds either no records at all or one that
decides that every record in the database is part of the filter. In either of
these cases, something is likely wrong with your filter expression. If you
encounter this situation, go back and review your filter expression and adjust
it with the assumption that the problem is the interface between your key-
board and your chair.
Generally, you get a record count somewhere between none and all records in
the database and the percentage of the database included in the filter. You
can use this number to help you manage the use of the filter. If your filter
finds only three records, you may not consider that number to be enough
people to invite to a seminar. If the filter finds thousands of records, you may
consider that too many for the mailing you had in mind. Adjust the filter until
it finds a number of accounts you’re more comfortable with.
Reviewing Boolean logic
You may need to examine logical operators if you want to prepare for more
sophisticated filters. If this section brings back bad memories of eighth-grade
math class, I apologize in advance.
If two or more fields need to be involved in the development of a filter, they
must be connected to one another with logical operators. The operators are
 ( )
 AND
 OR
The order of precedence specifies which of the preceding operators GoldMine
evaluates first. Another way to look at it is, “Which of these is the most
important?” It turns out that the order shown in the preceding list is the
exact sequence that GoldMine uses to evaluate an expression.
This sequence corresponds with algebra. Everything within the parentheses
is calculated first, and then the expressions separated by AND are evaluated,
and the OR connections are done last. This order is critical to the proper
development of sophisticated filters.
Looking at a more sophisticated filter
An instructive example of a sophisticated filter comes from real life at my
company. We planned to host a User Group meeting and wanted to invite all
our clients from Connecticut and Massachusetts. I decided to fax the invita-
tions rather than mail them. I needed to develop a filter that isolated just the
right accounts.
90
Part II: Managing Contacts 

Whenever you want to develop a filter that’s even moderately complicated,
write it out on paper first, and then copy it character by character into the
GoldMine filter system. Editing a filter that isn’t quite right is relatively diffi-
cult, so you may just as well plan a little up front to avoid frustration later.
In the User Group meeting example, three statements need to be coordinated:
 The State field contains CT.
 The State field contains MA.
 The Fax field contains a fax number.
The filtering system provides only the three previously mentioned operators —
the parentheses, ANDs, and ORs. Each of the three statements needs to be
connected with an AND or an OR. As I set up the filter, my first few attempts
don’t work correctly. To help you avoid making similar mistakes, I show you
what’s wrong and how to fix the mistakes.
Just take one piece of the projected filter and connect the first two expres-
sions. I first try
State equals CT AND State equals MA
No matter what else follows in this filter expression, no records can be part
of this filter. Using the AND conjunction effectively asks GoldMine to find
accounts in both states. But no account can be in both states at the same
time — only one State field exists per record, and you can enter only one
91
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries
Sometimes patience is a virtue
One of the advantages of filters is that no matter
when you want to use one, it finds all the
records it’s designed to find. Your filter can find
records that didn’t even exist when the filter
was initially created. It does so by searching the
entire database for records every time you acti-
vate the filter.
Sometimes, that strength also can be a weak-
ness. If you have a large database (many thou-
sands of records), finding those records may
take a considerable time. A 10,000-record data-
base may require several minutes for a filter to
find all its records. You could view this as a good
time to get a cup of coffee or to investigate the
Optimize button on the Build Filter dialog box.
Optimizing allows you to restrict the filter’s
search to speed things up a bit. Groups were
developed, in part, to reduce your number of
trips to the coffee machine and to speed things
up a little.

state there. What I’m really looking for are any accounts either in CT OR in
MA. Thus, the OR conjunction is the correct one here. So the correct expres-
sion for this part of the filter is
State equals CT OR State equals MA
Next, I need to make sure that each record the filter finds contains a fax
number in the Fax field. I don’t need to check for any specific value; I’m con-
cerned only that something is actually in the field. I make the assumption
that if anything at all is there, it’s a valid fax number:
State equals CT OR State equals MA AND Fax Exists
Because the order of preference requires that expressions separated by AND
be evaluated before expressions containing an OR, we still have a problem.
The computer first looks for accounts in MA that also have fax numbers. And
that’s fine. But next it looks for any accounts in CT regardless of the existence
of any fax number. The way the preceding expression is configured, no con-
nection exists between the fact that the account is in CT and also has a fax
number. A set of parentheses fixes this problem:
(State equals CT OR State equals MA) AND Fax Exists
By enclosing the first two expressions within parentheses, you take advan-
tage of the order of precedence again. First, the computer checks each
account to determine whether it’s in CT or MA. If it finds a record that com-
plies, it then immediately checks whether it has a fax number. Any record
that complies with all three expressions is counted as part of the filter. So the
last expression is actually correct and produces the desired results. Yes!
Building and Using Groups
A group is a fixed set of records that meets a set of conditions you have
defined. Using a group, you can isolate a subset of the data whenever you want.
You can use groups with reports, mail-merge forms, and Automated Processes.
Groups can be created based on scheduled and historical activities and on
other supplemental fields, which filters can’t handle. Groups can also be cre-
ated based on an existing filter. Each GoldMine user can create an unlimited
number of groups, and each group can have an unlimited number of records.
The number one advantage of groups is their speed. When you create a
group, GoldMine automatically creates an index file that points to each
record within the group. This index file allows you to access each record
within the group almost instantaneously. In contrast to working with filters,
you don’t have to wait for records to be found when you activate a group.
92
Part II: Managing Contacts 

The index file is created automatically only once — when the group is first
created. As you add records to your database, those new records that belong
within a group are not automatically put into the group. You must add them
manually. That’s the price you pay for the speed you get with groups.
GoldMine has a Group Building Wizard to assist in the creation of groups. A
wizard is an intelligent system that walks you through a procedure, giving
you your options and helping with questions. The Group Building Wizard
allows you eight different bases for building a group:
 Filtered records
 Previewed records
 SQL queries
 Tagged records
 Search results
 Scheduled Calendar activities
 Completed History activities
 Supplemental contact data
Of these, filtered records and tagged records are the most commonly used
bases. I explain how to create groups by basing them on a filter and by manu-
ally tagging individual records in the following sections. You may someday
also want to create a group based on Calendar or History activities, or even
on supplemental contact data.
Usually, the best candidates for groups are sets of records that don’t change
much over time. If a small percentage of your accounts are major accounts,
according to whatever your definition of major is, these accounts constitute a
good set of records to turn into a group.
Building groups from filtered records
If you already have a filter, its population is fairly stable, and you want to
speed your access to those records, you can create a group from that filter.
To create a group based on a filter or expression, go to the Filters and Groups
window and follow these steps:
1. Select New from the Groups window.
A Group Profile window appears, requesting that you provide a name for
your new group. After you’ve named your group, click OK. The Group
Building Wizard begins.
93
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries

2. Select the Filtered records option.
With this option, you can use any predefined filter to add records to a
group. When a group is built based on a filter, all contact records that
match the selected filter become permanent members of the group. The
wizard also gives you the opportunity to create a brand new filter upon
which your group will be built.
3. Select a specific filter.
The Build a Group Based on a Filter dialog box appears, containing the
following options:
• Build on a Filter: Lists all the defined filters for the group’s owner.
Click the drop-down arrow and then select the desired filter. 
• Owner: A GoldMine user who “owns” the filter. Selecting a different
user from the drop-down list associated with this field changes the
display of defined filters in the Build on a Filter field. To display a
list of available user names, click the arrow to the right of the field.
If you don’t have access to other people’s filters, don’t get too
involved with changing users here. Your access rights are deter-
mined in User Preferences, which I discuss in Chapter 3.
• Build on an Expression: Displays the expression corresponding to
the filter displayed at the top of the list of predefined filters in the
Build on a Filter option. To type a new filter expression, select the
radio button corresponding to this option.
• Build Filter: Enables you to build a filter as opposed to picking one
from the list of predefined filters. 
You can also build a new Group based on a SQL Query that has already been
defined. See the “Building and Using SQL Queries” section, later in this chapter.
Building groups from manually 
tagged records
Sometimes no logical way exists to select the records you want in a group. An
example might be when you want to send a mailing to your ten best friends,
but no field exists in GoldMine defining friends.
Instead of struggling with a filter to make your group, you can tag, or manu-
ally select, multiple contact records from the Contact Listing or the Activity
list or the Search Center. As you select records, GoldMine indicates the total
number of tagged records in the title bar.
94
Part II: Managing Contacts 

To tag a record, you can do one of the following:
 Press and hold the Ctrl key and then click each record you want to
include in the group
 Press and hold the Shift key and press the down-arrow or up-arrow key to
move to the record that you want to select, and then press the spacebar
You can remove the tag from any record selected in the Contact Listing by
repeating the same steps by which you tagged the record. This method
works like a toggle switch.
Records remain tagged as long as you don’t close the Contact Listing window.
You can minimize the window, but if you actually close it, all tagged records
lose their tags. To actually create the group, after records are individually
tagged, use the Group Building Wizard to create the group.
After a group is created, you can perform any standard merge operation on
those records, including printing, sending e-mail and fax messages, and
scheduling. Groups, just like filters, need to be activated before you use
them, and they need to be released when you’re finished with them.
Building and Using SQL Queries
With SQL Queries you can go places that filters and groups just can’t go.
GoldMine now has a wizard that helps you build SQL Queries that allow the
creation of “filters” that include data from pending and historical activities.
Filters can’t do that. You might, for example, want to create a SQL Query that
shows all the calls that a certain salesperson was supposed to make last
week, but didn’t. You could then assign all those calls to someone else. 
You can get to the SQL Query Wizard several ways, but the simplest way is as
follows:
1. Choose Tools from GoldMine’s main menu.
A drop-down list appears that has an option for Filters and Groups. This
brings you to the Filters and Group dialog box.
2. Select he Filters and Group tab.
GoldMine displays the SQL Query builder, as shown in Figure 8-6.
95
Chapter 8: Using Filters, Groups, and SQL Queries

3. Click the Build option button shown in Figure 8-6.
This brings you to the GoldMine Lookup Wizard, through which you tell
GoldMine whether your SQL Query will be based on standard contact
information, custom fields, the details tab information, additional con-
tacts, or pending or historical activities. This is way more than you can
specify with filters.
The SQL Query Wizard leads you through the entire process of building or
editing a SQL Query, right up to naming and saving it at the end.
Real SQL aficionados will realize that SQL Queries also allow you to modify
data in SQL databases. GoldMine, however, has restricted this ability within
the wizard to protect its data from you. If you’re really confident of your SQL
abilities and your knowledge of GoldMine’s data structure, you can build your
own SQL Queries and place them in the wizard for later use (at your own
risk).

eeping track of names, addresses, and phone numbers is the heart of
GoldMine; recording pending activities in the Calendar is the soul. If you
don’t enter pending activities, you won’t have a record of completed activi-
ties, and then you’ll waste most of the power of GoldMine.
Plan on putting your entire life in the Calendar — whether you’re using
GoldMine’s calendar or Outlook’s. Sure, you’re using GoldMine for all your busi-
ness appointments, but you can put the Little League games and the dentist
appointments in there, too. That way, GoldMine reminds you about all the things
you don’t want to forget (and nags you about the things you’d like to forget).
This chapter shows you how to harness the organizational power of GoldMine’s
Calendar to track the activities in your busy life. I also show you how to share
your Calendar with other members of your team, a feature that my co-workers
and I find really powerful and efficient. I also discuss how to share appointment
information with people who don’t yet use GoldMine. Don’t worry — GoldMine
has plenty of safeguards built in, and enough privacy so that no one will ever
know about those weekly tee times or shopping trips. Trust me.
Defining Activities
GoldMine features nine types of activities, all accessible from the main menu
by choosing Schedule (see Figure 9-1). You also can access all these activities
from the Standard Toolbar (just below the main menu), although by default,

only a few of them show up. You can add to this list by customizing the
Toolbar (see Chapters 2 and 3 for customizing options). In the following list, 
I explain the different types of activities:
 Call: Generally, outgoing phone calls are scheduled with this coding,
although incoming conference calls may also come under this schedul-
ing regime.
 Next Action: Often, when you complete an activity with a client, you
need to schedule a follow-up. For example, after a fact-finding meeting,
you might schedule a “Review of Proposal” meeting as your Next Action.
 Appointment: An appointment can be a meeting that is scheduled either
inside your office or at some other location. Meetings are usually
person-to-person affairs, but meetings may also occur through the
Internet or via conference calls.
 Literature Request: This type of activity is used to schedule orders for
your shipping or fulfillment department to send out. These could be
marketing materials or actual products.

Activities
within the
Schedule
menu.

Part III: Managing Activities 

 Forecasted Sale: GoldMine has a simple sales forecasting system, and
you actually schedule the closing of a sale in the same way you schedule
anything else. I discuss sales forecasting in Chapter 12.
 Other Action: This is a catch-all category for activities that just don’t fit
nicely anywhere else. In my office, non-billable, R&D projects are sched-
uled as Other activities.
 Event: You use the event category to schedule daylong or multi-day
activities. For example, a trade show that requires you to be out of the
office for an entire day would be scheduled as an event. I don’t like using
Events too much, because they don’t show up as obviously on your
Calendar as other types of activities.
 To-do: To-dos don’t have a time of day associated with them, so they
never show up on the main Calendar. You see them listed below as spe-
cial items just to the left of the Events. For example, a reminder to pick
up milk and bread on the way home or to do some research at your com-
petitor’s store would fit in this category. You can see how To-do’s and
Events are displayed in Figure 9-2.
 GoldMine E-mail: From this selection you can create and/or schedule an
outgoing e-mail to other users on your team.
Whatever type of activity you’re scheduling, as soon as you click OK to actu-
ally schedule it, GoldMine automatically puts a record of the activity into the
Pending tab of the appropriate record (unless it’s a To-do, which is never
linked to a record). You can always see it or edit the activity from the Pending
tab. In addition, it shows up on your Activity List and on the Calendar itself.
Creating Activities
To schedule an activity, click the Activities button in the Navigation Pane.
The Activities window appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
Depending on your Preference settings, your calendar display may show less
information than is displayed in Figure 9-2. I configured my Calendar display
to show the maximum amount for purposes of this illustration.
Options include seeing a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly view of the
Calendar. I find the daily and weekly Calendar views to be the most useful.
These views show enough detail for me to understand exactly what I have
scheduled. As you progress to the monthly and yearly views, you see less
and less detail about specific activities. You can select any of these views
using the tabs on the Calendar View window.
101
Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 

In addition to these presentations, you have a choice of several not com-
monly used views. These options are all additional tabs on the local schedul-
ing window:
 Planner: Displays a Calendar for multiple GoldMine users. To display
this Calendar, click the Planner tab.
 Outline: Displays a Calendar in an outline, or hierarchical, format. To
display this Calendar, click the Outline tab.
 Peg Board: Displays a status chart of other GoldMine users. To access
this display, click the Peg Board tab. This feature allows users to log in
or log out and post a message regarding their whereabouts. It also
checks for inactivity as measured by the existence or absence of key-
strokes on the keyboard.
Entering Activities on the Calendar
You can schedule an activity either from the Calendar or by using the main
GoldMine menu. Both of these methods land you at the same place — the
Scheduling dialog box, shown in Figure 9-3. Scheduling from the Calendar,
however, saves you the effort of manually entering the date, time, and dura-
tion of each activity; these items are automatically filled in. Doing it directly
Figure 9-2:
The
Activities
window.
102
Part III: Managing Activities 

from the Calendar also allows you to easily check for scheduling conflicts
before you create the activity rather than waiting for GoldMine to tell you
there’s a scheduling conflict. Using the main menu allows you to schedule
activities that shouldn’t really occupy a significant block of time, such as
quick phone calls or short in-house meetings.
Make sure that the active record is the one you want to schedule an activity
for. But if you need to schedule an activity for another record, you can tem-
porarily switch records in the scheduling window by selecting the icon to the
left of the contact person field. After you finish scheduling, GoldMine takes
you back to your original record. This clever option is useful if you’re in the
midst of writing a summary of your recent meeting with Client A and sud-
denly remember that you need to schedule an appointment with Client B.
Scheduling activities directly from the Calendar is generally best for appoint-
ments or for any activity with a significant duration. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Calendar by clicking the Calendar icon on the Toolbar or by
clicking Calendar on the Navigation Pane.
The Calendar’s main window appears.
2. Select either the daily or weekly view by clicking the appropriate tab.
3. Click and drag the mouse over the desired time for your activity.
When you release the mouse, the main Schedule an Appointment dialog
box appears, shown in Figure 9-3, where you fill in additional details. (See
the next section for more information about the Scheduling dialog box.)

Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 

To schedule an activity from the main menu without opening the Calendar,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Schedule from the main GoldMine menu.
2. Choose the appropriate type of activity from the Schedule menu.
See the “Defining Activities” section, earlier in this chapter, to find out
about the different types of activities.
Creating a personal record for yourself is a good idea. When scheduling an
activity for yourself, such as a dentist appointment, you can then attach that
appointment to your own record in the database.
Always link pending and completed activities to an existing record in
GoldMine. GoldMine, by default, links each activity you schedule with the
record that’s currently active. For personal appointments, you should have a
record for yourself (complete with home address and phone numbers) and
link your own personal appointments to that record.
Filling in the Scheduling Dialog Box
After you use one of the two methods for getting to the Scheduling dialog
box, you see a series of fields you must fill out. I discuss each of these fields
in the following sections.
The Contact field
The first field you see on the Scheduling dialog box (refer to Figure 9-3) is the
Contact field. By default, this field contains the primary contact from the
record you were just using. Click the icon to the left of the primary contact
field to temporarily activate a different record in your database or to select a
secondary contact person from this same record. You can also select multi-
ple contacts or even multiple GoldMine users for the same appointment. 
The Code field
The next field is labeled Code, which GoldMine uses to describe the nature of
the appointment. Typical examples of activity codes are
 SLS — Sales
 ADM — Administrative work
 PER — Personal
104
Part III: Managing Activities 

You can see and use these choices by right-clicking in the field or by clicking
the drop-down arrow to the right of the field. In the Code field, you should
make up a short series of codes that cover pretty much every reason you
may ever deal with an account. You can use these codes later to develop
reports that select and sort based on your activity codes. See Chapter 26 for
further information on adding codes to lookup lists.
The Activity Code and Result Code fields in “Schedule” and “Complete” only
store three characters. I suggest they be all uppercase so they make sense
when it comes to reporting (for example, LVM = Left Voicemail or NIN = Not
Interested Now). 
The Primary User field
The next field you see on the Scheduling dialog box is the Primary User field.
GoldMine assumes that you’re scheduling this appointment for yourself;
therefore, you generally see your own user name showing up here. If you are
indeed scheduling for yourself, you can just skip this field entirely.
If you double-click in the Primary User field or click the down arrow to the
right of the Primary User field, the names of all the other users on your
system appear. You can schedule for someone other than yourself by simply
selecting his or her name. This feature is called delegating and is one of my
favorite GoldMine tools. See the sidebar “The art of delegating,” elsewhere in
this chapter, for tips on using this handy feature.
105
Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 
Colors, colors, everywhere
Colors are a great way to specify types of activ-
ities. When you use different colors for different
kinds of appointments, these colors show up
very clearly on your Calendar. Then, whenever
you look at your Calendar, you can very easily
see what kind of day you’re going to have.
My colleagues and I developed the following
color-coding scheme at our company that
works very well for us:
 Red: An appointment away from the office
 Gray: A tentative appointment that still
needs to be confirmed
 Yellow: An assignment requiring us to be in
the office, such as tech support
 Blue: An appointment in the office
 Green: Personal time
Feel free to develop your own scheme for your
company. Any consistent color scheme that
makes sense to everyone in your company is
better than no color scheme at all. Although
color scheme defaults can be set into your
Preferences (actually, in your lookup.ini
file), this is on a user-by-user basis and not for
your entire organization. As a result, an organi-
zation-wide color coding scheme is a policy
issue rather than a technical one.

The Reference field
Be sure to always use the Reference field to provide a short description of
the activity. Sometimes you may schedule activities many months in advance.
When an activity suddenly pops up on your activity list, the Reference field
reminds you what the activity is all about. For example, you may use “Initial
Sales Call,” “Project Review Meeting,” “Technical Support,” or my personal
favorite, “Close Deal.” Make up your own list, and put it into the lookup list
for this field. Again, you can refer to Chapter 26 for details on adding items to
a lookup list.
The Notes field
You can use the Notes field as a reminder of specific information pertinent to
this meeting, such as, “Remember to bring three copies of the proposal and a
projector.” Some people also use this field for directions to the account, but 
I prefer to put that information into the Detail section or have it mapped in
GM+Views.
This Notes field does not require date or time stamping, so you need only
click in the field and start typing.
The Date field
On the right side of the Scheduling dialog box is the Time section. Every
appointment, of course, has a date and a time associated with it. If you don’t
enter a date and time, then the appointment won’t show up properly on your
Calendar, and you may not realize that you need to be doing something. If
you began your scheduling directly from the Calendar, the Date and Time
fields are already filled in for you.
The best way to change the date is to click on the right arrow adjacent to the
date field. Voilà — a month’s worth of the Calendar instantly appears, as
shown in Figure 9-4. You can move ahead (or backwards) if necessary by
clicking the Month or the Year scroll buttons. When you see the date you
want, just double-click. GoldMine automatically fills in this date on the
Scheduling dialog box.
106
Part III: Managing Activities 

The Time field
The Time field works the same way as the Date field. Your preference setting
for Calendar intervals (see Chapter 3 for setting this up) determine whether
you can schedule activities every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, every hour, and so
on. I have mine set to 15 minute intervals.
Every appointment has an expected duration. Make sure that you enter a
duration either in minutes or in hours as seen in Figure 9-5. If you don’t, you
end up with conflicting appointments and a generally messed-up schedule.
Come up with a company-wide standard for dealing with travel time. Failing
to account for travel time on your Calendar may result in someone’s putting
another appointment in your schedule right when you’re driving back from
the first appointment. Color codes work well for this kind of situation. (See
the sidebar “Colors, colors, everywhere.”)
Figure 9-4:

ment.
107
Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 

If you select the Alarm, GoldMine automatically reminds you of an activity by
putting a notice on your screen ten minutes (you can adjust this interval in
User Preferences) before the scheduled activity time. This reminder is excel-
lent for out-of-the-office appointments, but if you overuse this function, you
may find it a bit annoying. When I schedule an appointment for someone else
in my office who tends to run late, I always make use of the Alarm feature.
Using the Options
You generally use most of the Options fields only if you’re part of a team. I
explain these Options and their purposes in the following list (refer to Figure 9-3
for the location of each of these options on the main Scheduling dialog box):
 Link: This button, which is on by default, links the activity to the
account that’s active. It’s hard to imagine a reason to ever turn this off.
Suggestion — just leave it alone.
 Notify via E-Mail: This button can be an extremely important tool to use
whenever you schedule for someone else. If you click this button,
GoldMine immediately notifies the person for whom you’re scheduling
the activity. This notification isn’t the same thing as an alarm, which
goes off shortly before the activity.
Figure 9-5:
Set the time
for your
appoint-
ment.
108
Part III: Managing Activities 

For example, if you schedule Harry to make a presentation to the Board
of Directors next Thursday, you can be fairly sure that he would like to
know about it more than ten minutes beforehand. Click the Notify via
E-mail button, and GoldMine immediately sends Harry an e-mail message
with the information about the activity you entered into his Calendar.
Forget to use this button once or twice, and you’re guaranteed to hear
about it.
 Auto-generate RSVP: You can select the RSVP button when you sched-
ule an activity for someone else. It allows you to keep track of when, and
if, activities that you have scheduled for other users are completed. This
field is particularly useful when activities are delegated to other network
or remote users. GoldMine creates an RSVP message on your Calendar
as soon as an activity you scheduled for another user is completed or
deleted.
 Mark as Private: If you select Mark as Private, other GoldMine users can
see that some amount of time is blocked out of your Calendar, but they
won’t be able to see exactly what you’re doing or where you’re going.
Use this option too much and your boss and co-workers are bound to be
a little suspicious. And, because the boss or your GoldMine administra-
tor probably has Master access rights, he or she can find a way to see
what you’re doing anyway.
You can assign an activity to an existing Opportunity, Project or Case. In the
lower left corner of the scheduling dialog box (see Figure 9-3 again) you have
the option to associate the current activity with either an Opportunity, a
Project or a Case.
Rescheduling an Activity
In real life, most people usually look at a calendar before scheduling any-
thing. GoldMine is no different. You can go directly to the Calendar by click-
ing the Calendar icon. Doing so immediately displays your Calendar so that
you can see what is already scheduled. Most people think it is important to
look before they leap.
The easiest way to reschedule an appointment is directly from the Calendar 
by using the drag-and-drop method (just like dragging cards when you’re
playing Solitaire). Click to select the appointment, hold down the left mouse
button, and drag the appointment to the new date or time, and then release 
the mouse button. You can also make the appointment longer or shorter by
dragging the top or bottom of the appointment to extend or reduce the time
allotted to it.
109
Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 

Scheduling Activities for Other People
GoldMine enables you to schedule activities for other users by accessing
their Calendars. This works very well in my office, and I highly recommend it.
But you must consider several key elements when you schedule an activity
for someone else:
 Make sure that the other person is okay with this arrangement. Also
make sure up front that everyone on the team agrees to the efficiency of
the idea.
 Make sure to schedule directly from the other person’s Calendar. You
do so by changing the User to the person for whom you’re scheduling.
When you change the User, you immediately see that other user’s
Calendar. (See the section, “The Primary User field,” earlier in this chap-
ter, for more information.) Because you’re probably less familiar with
someone else’s Calendar than you are with your own, check it first to
make sure you’re not creating a conflict.
 Make sure that you always use the Notify button. Doing so is courte-
ous and professional. Using a color-coding scheme, such as gray for an
appointment that the user needs to confirm, is a good idea too.
Using the iCal Features
The iCal feature is a hottie, and it comes under the heading, “If you can’t beat
’em, join ’em.” You won’t see iCal on the scheduling screen, but you access this
feature by selecting Send a Request with the Appointment to on the scheduling
screen. The developers at FrontRange realized that many people use tools
other than GoldMine for their scheduling and their e-mail. The most common
tool, of course, is Microsoft Outlook. The iCal feature allows you to use
GoldMine to schedule meetings with anyone using a scheduling program that
makes use of the iCal standards. You can translate that into Microsoft Outlook
and Lotus Organizer. If you haven’t convinced the Outlook stalwarts in your
company to convert to GoldMine, you can use this feature to coordinate your
schedule with theirs. If some of your clients or vendors use Outlook, you can
use GoldMine to formally request a meeting with these people.
This feature works both ways. Anyone using Outlook can send a meeting request
to you. You can accept, reject, or suggest an alternative. After you agree, that
meeting appears in both the GoldMine Calendar and in the Outlook calendar.
110
Part III: Managing Activities 

iCal standards still vary a bit from system to system, so not every function
works properly with every iCal-based program. For example, recurring
appointments in GoldMine may not translate perfectly to other programs. But
for regular, simple stuff, iCal is great.
Scheduling a meeting with an Outlook user
The key to scheduling a meeting with someone using an iCal-based system is
the little check box in the lower right side of the Scheduling dialog box. You
can see this check box in Figure 9-3. Selecting this option sends an e-mail
message to the recipient. The message is formatted in such a way that should
the recipient accept your invitation, the meeting automatically posts itself in
his or her Calendar.
The best way to test out all this iCal stuff is to schedule a meeting with your-
self as the recipient. That way, you won’t annoy all your friends as you experi-
ment. When you’re confident, you can try it with a real Outlook user.
111
Chapter 9: Scheduling Activities 
The art of delegating
Delegating is an absolutely great way to avoid
ever having to actually do any work yourself. On
the other hand, a few rules of professional cour-
tesy exist that you should probably be aware of
before you start delegating activities:
 Don’t ever schedule anything for a co-
worker without properly alerting him or
her. Properly alerting someone requires set-
ting an alarm and clicking the Notify button.
Although you may think that hollering
across the hall is adequate, always cover
yourself with an electronic notification.
 Don’t schedule appointments for people who
will be upset that you’re messing with their
schedules.You must understand and respect
the pecking order in your organization.
 Don’t tell your client that the person you’re
scheduling for will absolutely be there.
Whenever you schedule for someone else,
clarify to your client that you do so tenta-
tively; the appointment still requires final
approval by the user. Use the appropriate
Calendar color (in the color scheme at my
office, it’s gray) for a tentative appointment.
 Don’t delegate all the nasty or boring stuff. If
people get the idea that you’re doing that —
well, remember that they can delegate things
to you, too.

Responding to a meeting request
You may receive a meeting request from an Outlook or Lotus Notes user. The
fifth option on the window, shown in Figure 9-6, allows you to check your own
calendar before deciding to accept, decline, or revise the meeting schedule.
Scheduling Recurring Activities
Many times, you have a regularly scheduled activity. For example, if you have
a team meeting every Monday morning at 9:00 a.m., you don’t have to
painstakingly enter it on your Calendar for every week of the year. You can go
into the Schedule an Appointment dialog box and click the Recurring tab, as
shown in Figure 9-7. This tab enables you to automatically schedule a daily,
weekly, or monthly activity from now until the cows come home.
Figure 9-6:

112
Part III: Managing Activities 

The recurring appointment or activity system is a great way to make sure you
always remember to make the phone, rent, and tax payments on time. This
applies to company and to personal activities. (Remember, the personal ones
should be scheduled against your own personal record.) A color code for
payments may also be helpful.

Chapter 10
Viewing Scheduled Activities
In This Chapter
 Viewing activities from the Calendar
 Reviewing Activity lists
 Viewing other users’ activities
W
hat good is scheduling activities unless you can easily view them? You
can see scheduled activities in GoldMine by using either the Calendar
or the Activity list. The Calendar displays the same basic information as the
Activity list but in a graphical format. The Activity list displays all your open
activities, or selected categories of open activities, in a list format for any user.
(Open activities are any scheduled activities that have not yet been completed.)
If your GoldMine is integrated with Outlook, you can also view scheduled
activities within Outlook. (See Chapter 18 for more about Outlook.)
In this chapter, you find out how to view your scheduled activities as well as
those of your co-workers. You can look at completed activities as well as old,
still pending activities that you wish you had completed. You also discover
the different ways you can view activities. By viewing scheduled activities,
you can determine what you and everyone else in your organization will be
doing today, tomorrow, or any time in the future, and you can plan your time
accordingly. 
Viewing Activities Using the Calendar
Almost anything you can see from the Activity list you can also see from the
Calendar view. The advantage of looking at the Calendar is that it provides a
more graphical presentation, which, if you use color coding for your activi-
ties, can be a very clear way to look at your day’s or week’s action. (See
Chapter 9 for more about color-coding your activities.)

116
Part III: Managing Activities 
You can get to the Calendar by clicking the Calendar button in the Navigation
Pane.
Viewing open activities with the Calendar
The first thing I do when I arrive at work each morning is check my Calendar.
I look at all my scheduled activities and then review the schedules for every-
one else on my team. (See the “Viewing Groups of Users on the Calendar” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.) That way, I immediately know who is on vacation,
who is in the office, and who is scheduled to be out at some other location.
By consistently using the color-coding scheme, such as the one suggested in
Chapter 9, your view of the Calendar gives you a quick and easy way to see
what’s going on for that day or week.
When you open the Calendar, the basic User’s Calendar window appears, as
shown in Figure 10-1. The default view is Day. You can change the view on the
Calendar by clicking the following tabs:
 Week: You see seven days of activities, Sunday through Saturday, even if
you don’t work weekends. I select this Calendar view most often.
 Month: From this view, you can get an overall perspective of how busy a
month you have, but few details are visible. You can see what each activ-
ity is by hovering the cursor over the activity and looking at the status
bar. You see the contact’s name and reference of the activity. This is true
for the Year view, also.
Figure 10-1:
You can see
scheduled
activities on
the
Calendar
window.

 Year: As the highest level in the hierarchy, a year contains all activities
grouped by months.
 Planner: You can check the schedule of one or more GoldMine users by
clicking the Planner tab in the Calendar. Your settings in the Calendar
tab of the Preferences window determine the period of days that the
Planner tab displays. (See Chapter 3 to find out how to set preferences.)
By default, the Planner shows 18 days of activities for the current user.
Each activity is represented by a colored bar that shows the amount of
time reserved for the activity, as shown in Figure 10-2.
 Outline: You can display your scheduled activities in a hierarchical
structure by clicking the Outline tab. Each Calendar level is graphically
represented by an icon. This view, shown in Figure 10-3, is a concession
to those who are devoted to Day-Timers. The Outline view displays a
tree with branches that correspond to the Year, Month, and Day tabs.
 Date: Each date lists all scheduled activities.
 Peg Board: In the Calendar, the Peg Board tab displays the login status
and activity of individual users and system availability. For individual
users, GoldMine tracks login/logout times, total logged time, and activity
as determined by keystrokes and mouse use. When you need to leave
your desk, you can log away, posting your location and expected time of
return. See Figure 10-4.

Part III: Managing Activities 

Viewing completed activities 
from the Calendar
By default, when an activity is completed, it disappears from the Calendar. I
discuss completing activities in Chapter 11. A setting also exists within the
Calendar that allows even completed activities to remain on the daily or
weekly view of the Calendar. I highly recommend using this setting. By using
this preference setting, you can look at past days or weeks on your Calendar
to see what you (or others) have done. This feature is often useful, for exam-
ple, when compiling your long-overdue expense report. To retain completed
activities on your Calendar, follow these steps:
1. Display the weekly view of your Calendar.
2. Right-click anywhere within the Calendar and choose Activities from
the shortcut menu.
The Select Activities to View dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-5.
3. In the Completed Activities column, check all the activities you want
to remain on your Calendar and then click OK.
From this point on, your completed activities are displayed with a gray back-
ground and a horizontal line through the listing. That way, you can look at
last week’s Calendar to remind yourself what you actually did. Figure 10-6
shows an example.

119
Chapter 10: Viewing Scheduled Activities 

Modifying the listing within 
each Calendar activity
You can use an option setting within the Calendar to determine exactly which
fields display on the Calendar. Space is limited within each Calendar listing,
so you don’t want to view more than one or two fields at a time. The most
important fields are probably the Contact Person and the Company fields,
although you can elect to display any field or fields in the database. The fol-
lowing steps show you how to modify the display options on your Calendar:
1. Display the weekly view of your Calendar.
2. Right-click anywhere within the Calendar and, from the shortcut
menu, choose Options ➪Preferences➪More Options.
The Calendar Display Reference Properties dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 10-7.
3. Select the fields you want to display and then click OK.
Figure 10-6:

120
Part III: Managing Activities 

Using the normally available selections, you can have the Calendar display
either the company name or the contact name related to an activity. If you
would like a little more information, you can arrange it by entering an expres-
sion in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-8. These expressions need to be
written in dBASE, which is a little outside the scope of this book. But a good
example can go a long way toward enabling you to create your own expres-
sions in this case.

121
Chapter 10: Viewing Scheduled Activities 

If you want to see both the company name and the contact name on your
Calendar, you can have GoldMine display exactly that by entering the follow-
ing dBASE expression:
Trim(contact1->company)+”, “+ trim(contact1->contact)
The Trim function removes all the unnecessary spaces surrounding the data.
The expression within the parentheses specifies the name of the data file fol-
lowed by the data field itself. The two fields are separated by a comma and a
space.
Checking the Activity List
In addition to using the Calendar to view scheduled activities, another way to
find out what your coming attractions are is to use the Activity list. By using
the Activity list, you can see a little more information, such as the Reference
field related to each activity. To access the Activity list, click the Activities
button in the Navigation Pane. A window appears, just above the Navigation
Pane, shown in Figure 10-9, allowing you to specify exactly what activities you
want to see.
Figure 10-9:
View your

122
Part III: Managing Activities 

 Open: Displays all pending activities, regardless of category, for a partic-
ular user.
 Actions: Lists pending Next Actions.
 Appts: Lists pending appointments along with information about the
date, time, duration, the primary contact, and reference.
 Calls: Lists pending phone calls. If you select auto-forwarding for calls
(see Chapter 3), you may see pending phone calls that you were sup-
posed to make but haven’t gotten to yet.
 Events: Shows all scheduled events.
 Forecasts: Lists pending sales with data on projected close date, proba-
bility, amount of sale, product, and primary contact.
 Others: Lists pending Other Activities.
 To-do: Lists pending to-do activities.
 Opp/Proj Tasks: Shows scheduled tasks that are associated with either
an Opportunity or an on-going project.
 Alarmed: Shows all pending activities with an alarm.
 Completed Activities: Lists all completed activities for a specified date
range.
 E-mail: Lists pending GoldMine and pending Internet e-mail with infor-
mation about the sender and the subject matter.
 Inbox: Lists Internet e-mail messages you have already brought into
GoldMine.
 Outbox: Lists Internet e-mail messages that have been created but not
yet sent. This situation arises if you choose to queue your outgoing
e-mails rather than send them immediately. See Chapter 17 to find out
how to send e-mail and use the Out-Box. When you’re ready to actually
send your outgoing e-mails, go to this tab, right-click, and choose Send
to send all the previously queued messages.
 Filed: Lists all available information about GoldMine and Internet e-mails
that have been received. 
 Occasions: Shows personal holidays that you set up, such as birthdays
and anniversaries.
 Holidays: Lists company holidays, such as New Year’s Day and Christmas.
123
Chapter 10: Viewing Scheduled Activities 

Getting back to the account
If you double-click any activity within the Activity list, GoldMine brings you
directly to the proper account. From there, you can check either the Pending
tab or the History tab. These tabs are often useful if you want to see more
details, such as Notes, or if you want to make some modification to that activity.
Changing the focus of the Activity list
By default, the Activity list shows you the activities that are scheduled for the
current date and the activities that are assigned to you (your user name). You
can change either of these settings so that you can see activities assigned to
others and activities scheduled for a future date. 
By clicking in the Show field of the Activity list, you get a menu list of choices,
as shown in Figure 10-10. From this list, you can choose a variety of time
ranges.
Similarly, you can click in the User field and you get a drop-down list of all
users. By selecting another user you immediately see that person’s list of
activities.
Figure 10-10:

124
Part III: Managing Activities 

More actions you can 
perform on activities
There are several other, more global actions you can perform. You access
these actions by clicking the down arrow to the right of the Link button. The
choices described in the following sections appear.
Link
The Link option allows you to re-assign an activity to the active contact
record. You can do this only one activity at a time.
Roll-over
By selecting Roll-over, you can forward activities to yourself (presumably to
complete at a later date) or to another user. This option is potentially danger-
ous. More than one GoldMiner has come to grief using it. With one click of the
mouse, you send all your scheduled activities to someone else, and no easy
way exists for you to get them back, even if you really didn’t mean to do it.
Leave Roll-over alone; it has bitten more than one user in the past. Instead,
use Territory Realignment, which is a data management option under Tools
in the main menu. The Territory Realignment Wizard walks you through the
entire procedure.
Auto-Update
Auto-Update is a valuable feature that allows you to complete more than one
activity at a time. One of the most useful times to employ this Auto-Update
feature is when you’ve neglected to complete a bunch of pending activities.
My office has people who always forget to do this, literally for months at a
time. Rather than have hundreds of still-pending activities that someone
claims to have actually done, we use Auto-Update occasionally to fix this.
Viewing Groups of Users on the Calendar
You can actually view up to 16 users’ schedules simultaneously, which is
useful if, for example, you want to see whether anyone from your Boston
office is available to go to Halifax, Nova Scotia, next week. Viewing all these
schedules is made particularly simple if all your Boston people are in a user
group that you have already created. To see a list of all registered users,
follow these steps:
1. Click the drop-down arrow in the User field of the Calendar window.
A shortcut menu appears.
125
Chapter 10: Viewing Scheduled Activities 

2. Select Multiple Users.
This choice leads you to a dialog box listing all the registered users, as
shown in Figure 10-11.
3. Select as many users as you want, or a group, and then click OK.
You are limited to displaying a total of 16 separate users.
Another approach to viewing multiple users is to select a group. A typical
group may be the “Sales” group, or those people who work in one of your
regional offices. Then, instead of selecting those individuals, you can select
the group of which they are members.

Dealing with and Completing
Scheduled Activities
In This Chapter
 Delegating activities to other people
 Rescheduling activities
 Deleting activities
 Ignoring activities
 Completing activities
T
he whole point of using GoldMine is for you to schedule all sorts of activi-
ties and then dispose of each of them in some logical fashion. In this
chapter, you find out how to get all scheduled activities off your Calendar and
get home for dinner on time. I promise.
You have three ways to view previously scheduled activities:
 Directly from the Pending tab of an individual record. Use this
method when you want to focus on a particular account and have easy
access to the Pending folder. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more details on
how scheduled activities are related to records.
 From the Activity list. Use this method when you want to view all your
different types of scheduled activities for some time period.
 From the Calendar. Using this method is often the best, particularly
when you deal with activities that have a specific duration that you need
to reschedule.
Regardless of the method you use to access your scheduled activities, you
have five and only five things you can do with an activity: delegate, resched-
ule, delete, ignore, and complete. In this chapter, I explain these five actions
and how to accomplish completing your activities by using these actions.

128
Part III: Managing Activities 
Four Ways to Complete Your Activities
In this section, I describe four of the five ways to complete an activity. Each
of these methods is valid and gets the job done; however, these methods are
temporary or weak solutions. To discover the fifth and best way to complete
an activity, see the upcoming section, “The Best Way to Complete an
Activity.”
Delegating activities to other people
Remember, the fundamental design goal of GoldMine is to allow a team of
people to coordinate themselves. In this fashion, one way to complete an
activity is to delegate it to someone else, which is my personal favorite. To
delegate an activity, follow these steps:
1. In the Schedule an Appointment dialog box (see Figure 11-1), look for
the Primary User field in the upper-right corner and click the down
arrow next to the field.
A lookup list appears, and you immediately see all the registered Users
on your team. If you don’t see a list, then no other Users exist, and there
just isn’t anyone to delegate anything to. Too bad.
2. From the list of registered users, select the person to whom you want
to delegate the task.
Figure 11-1:
Delegating
an appoint-
ment.

3. Click the OK button and GoldMine immediately places this task on
your “delegee’s” Calendar.
You won’t be very popular in the office, however, if you don’t let people know
you’ve just delegated some task. Even setting the Alarm to go off 20 minutes
before the task is scheduled may not be enough time. No one wants just 20
minutes’ notice before giving a presentation to the Board of Directors. Refer
to Chapter 9 for delegating etiquette.
Always click the Notify button when delegating tasks to someone else. When
you do so, GoldMine immediately sends an e-mail message to that person, let-
ting her know that you have scheduled her for this activity.
Rescheduling activities
One of the most common actions you’ll take with an appointment is to resched-
ule it. The easiest way to reschedule an appointment is to do it directly from the
Calendar. Not only is the Calendar the best way to see what alternate times are
available, but physically changing the time of the appointment from the
Calendar is simple.
I like to use the drag-and-drop method for rescheduling. From either the daily
or weekly Calendar view, simply highlight an existing activity and drag it to
some other available time slot on either that day or another day. GoldMine
automatically changes the time and date on the Pending tab and in the Activity
list. If you need to make more than a minor adjustment to a scheduled activity,
you can double-click the specific activity in the Pending tab. This brings you
right back to the original Schedule dialog box, and you can defer the appoint-
ment for a year or more, or turn a one-hour sales call into a six-hour marathon.
Deleting activities
The only time you should ever consider deleting an activity from your sched-
ule is when you inadvertently schedule it for the wrong account. To delete an
activity, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the activity within the Pending tab.
2. From the menu that appears, choose Delete and confirm by clicking
the Yes button.
3. Find the correct account.
4. Schedule it all over again.
129
Chapter 11: Dealing with and Completing Scheduled Activities 

You’re probably inclined to delete an appointment when your client calls you
and cancels your appointment. Resist the urge. Instead, complete the
appointment and make a notation in the activity notepad that your client can-
celed, or alternatively, use a Result Code to indicate that the client cancelled
the appointment. That way, you create a historical trail of events that docu-
ments every appointment you’ve made and the action taken. The following
story is a perfect example of the importance of completing an activity rather
than deleting it.
An insurance agent (I’ll call him Moe) was having a hard time with a trouble-
some customer. Moe had scheduled an appointment at 2:00 p.m. with the cus-
tomer to renew a policy, but the customer called Moe and told him not to
come . . . ever.
So Moe deleted the appointment in GoldMine. At 2:30 p.m. on the appoint-
ment day, the client called Moe’s boss and complained that Moe had once
again not shown up for an appointment. Moe’s boss checked the account’s
Pending and History tabs and found no evidence that Moe had ever sched-
uled the appointment because Moe had deleted the appointment. Assuming
that Moe had just blown off another appointment, the boss fired him.
Ignoring activities
You don’t have to do anything to ignore an activity. But if you choose to
ignore an activity, it stays on your Calendar until you act on it. If you set the
preferences to auto-forward uncompleted activities (see Chapter 9) to the
next day, soon you’ll have hundreds of activities scheduled for yourself.
Coming into the office and finding a few thousand tasks on your schedule is
pretty discouraging. And if you’ve set an Alarm for an activity, the Alarm
annoyingly continues to nag at you until you have no choice but to do some-
thing constructive, such as completing it.
The Best Way to Complete an Activity
When you run out of all the other options and can no longer delegate or
reschedule an activity, it’s time to actually complete it. After all, you were
supposed to do that in the first place. Although I use the word “complete” in
different ways, let there be no mistake here: Completing an activity means
accomplishing the intended task (such as going to the meeting or making the
phone call) and then taking it off your schedule by actually completing it in
GoldMine.
130
Part III: Managing Activities 

You can complete an activity from the Calendar, the Activity list, or the
Pending tab. In this section, I explain the time and the place to use each
method. The first two methods allow you to review all your daily activities
and dispose of them appropriately. The Pending tab method forces you to go
from one account to another. I like to use the Calendar method for complet-
ing most of my activities, but it’s all just a matter of personal preference.
For at least the last few versions of GoldMine, you’ve been able to associate
an activity with an Opportunity or a Project. Now, with Version 8, you can
also associate an activity with a Case. To do so, no matter what technique
you use to actually complete your activity, select the appropriate Case from
the Complete an Activity dialog box.
Completing from the Calendar
To complete an activity from the Calendar, you must have the Calendar
window in front of you. (Open the Calendar by clicking the Calendar button in
the Navigation Pane.) I prefer to complete activities from the weekly Calendar
view (click the Week tab on the main Calendar window), but the daily view
also works well for this exercise.
To complete an activity from the Calendar, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the activity on the Calendar and select Complete.
The Complete an Activity dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2:
Completing
an 
activity —
in this 
case, an
appointment.
131
Chapter 11: Dealing with and Completing Scheduled Activities 

2. Fill in all the appropriate fields on this dialog box.
The most important fields to fill in are
• Result Code: Usually, you use the COM code to indicate the activ-
ity is complete.
• The Activity notepad: Enter notes about the appointment or the
call here.
• The Duration field: Use this field if you want GoldMine to track
how much time you spend on particular activities or with a partic-
ular client.
3. If you want to follow up on this activity with another activity for this
client, select the Schedule a Follow-Up option at the lower left of the
dialog box.
If you want to have the information from the activity notepad carried for-
ward as you continue with related activities, you can do so by choosing
Tools➪Options➪Schedule and then selecting Carry Over Completion
Notes. 
4. When you’re finished, click OK.
You may want to use the Follow-Up option if you have just come back
from an initial sales call, for example, and you promised your prospect
that you would come back in a week with a proposal. If you select the
Schedule a Follow-Up option, you then select from the lookup list what
type of action is next. When you have done this, GoldMine brings you to
yet another scheduling dialog box so that you can start all over again
scheduling another activity for this account.
As soon as you complete a scheduled activity, GoldMine automatically moves
it from the Pending tab to the History tab, where all the completed activities
for each account are stored.
Completing from the Activity list
If you’re more list oriented than graphically inclined, you may prefer to com-
plete your activities from the Activity list. You can access the Activity list by
clicking the Activities button from the Navigation Pane.
You can display the Activity list with many different options:
 The type of activities to be displayed. For example, you may be inter-
ested in seeing only appointments, or perhaps just phone calls. Just
select the appropriate type of activity from the context-sensitive pane
just above the Navigation Pane on the left of the screen. Figure 11-3
shows that Appointments have been selected.
132
Part III: Managing Activities 

 The range of dates to be displayed. Click the Show button, as shown in
Figure 11-3. A submenu appears, allowing you to change the range of
dates for the Activity list display.
Within the Activity list Actions is the Roll-over option. If you use this option
improperly, you can easily transfer all your pending activities to another user.
Because no way exists to get these activities back without also getting all of
that user’s regular activities, you could come to grief with this option.
Completing from the Pending tab
Complete an activity from the Pending tab if you want to focus on one partic-
ular account and if you’re trying to dispose of some of the scheduled activi-
ties for that account.
After you highlight the Pending tab, you immediately see all the scheduled
activities associated with that account. To complete any particular activity, you
need only right-click the activity. As you can see in Figure 11-4, you get a short-
cut menu. One of the choices is Complete, and you should choose that one.
Figure 11-3:

133
Chapter 11: Dealing with and Completing Scheduled Activities 

Selecting the Complete choice leads you directly to the same Complete an
Activity dialog box that the other two methods also arrive at. From there, you
can fill in a Result Code, add some notes, and immediately go into Follow-Up
mode.
Completing your activities, no matter which of the three methods you
employ, transfers that pending activity directly to the History tab.

Chapter 12
Sales Forecasting
In This Chapter
 Designing Quotas
 Forecasting your sales
 Reviewing the sales pipeline
 Completing those forecasts
S
ales forecasting is a basic tool that has been used by salespeople and
sales teams forever. The idea is to have quotas, forecasts, and completed
sales and to analyze each of these at every stage. By entering your expecta-
tions into GoldMine, you can then compare your forecast against reality as
time goes by. Within GoldMine, you can also view statistical graphs and print
reports to see how you and your team are progressing.
A forecasted sale is really just a special case of a scheduled activity. Basically,
you assign a sale to a user (usually yourself) and estimate when you think
you will close it. If you consistently perform this routine for every realistic
prospective sale, you can use GoldMine to compile all sorts of sales forecast-
ing graphs and reports. These analyses can relate to one individual salesper-
son or to an entire group of them.
You may already have a formal or an informal sales quota. GoldMine allows
your manager to set up a formal quota system (sorry) and then allows you
and the manager to check your progress against that quota. Even without 
a quota, the sales forecasting analysis will be very useful to you and to 
management.
Setting up Quotas
Setting up challenging but realistic quotas for yourself and your team is a
basic ingredient of success. It applies to all facets of life and is what the
monthly, quarterly, or annual quotas are all about.
Around the Thanksgiving holiday each year, I sit down and assign myself and
my team goals for the coming year. I break our goals down into bite-size

136
Part III: Managing Activities 
monthly sales numbers, trying to set the goals to be challenging enough to be
exciting but realistic enough so that no one gets frustrated. Goals and quotas
are also an important part of business planning: Someone else’s annual
budget is based on your quota.
To assign a quota, follow these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Go To➪Analysis➪Quota Analysis.
The Quota Analysis dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
2. Click the New button at the bottom of the dialog box.
The Assign New Quota dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-2. From
here, you can custom build weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even recurring
quotas for yourself or for other users.
3. Enter the dates for the beginning and the end of the particular quota
period.
You can do so most easily by clicking the arrow to the right of each date
field. That brings up the calendar. You can make the time periods as long
or as short as you like — but always in accordance with the accepted
practice within your company’s sales organization.
4. Enter an amount in the Quota field and, optionally, enter some Notes
in the blank area of the dialog box.
5. When you’re finished, click OK.
The screen shown in Figure 12-3 appears, in which you can see not only
the quotas for successive periods but also how your completed sales fig-
ures compare with those quotas.
Figure 12-1:
Beginning to
set up a
quota.

Don’t be surprised by the dates displayed in the Period column of the Quota
Listing dialog box. The date range is shown in the MM/YY format, which is
why you see only the month and year in Figure 12-3, even though I had actu-
ally entered the range as 07/01/07 through 07/31/07.
Entering Your Forecasts
First, let me state that not everyone enters forecasts for every possible sale. As
a group, your organization should decide what kinds of deals merit inclusion 
Figure 12-3:
Reviewing
all your
quota
periods.
Figure 12-2:
Assigning a
new quota.
137
Chapter 12: Sales Forecasting 

in the sales forecasts. Often, very small sales, or those that are transactional
(happen very quickly, perhaps with just one phone call), or those with very low
probabilities just aren’t included.
You can enter forecasts for those sales that are appropriate for forecasting by
following these steps:
1. Locate the account to which you intend to sell your product.
You can go directly into the Schedule a Forecasted Sale dialog box without
locating the account first, but I prefer this more consistent approach.
2. From the Global Toolbar, click the Sale button.
GoldMine brings you to the Schedule a Forecasted Sale dialog box, as
shown in Figure 12-4.
3. Fill in the Contact field.
This field defaults to the primary contact for the account. If you are not
positioned on the right account, you can do so by clicking the magnifying
glass to the right of the Contact field. 
4. Assign this sale to an Opportunity or Project in the second field (see
Chapter 23 for more about opportunities and projects). 
You probably won’t need to use this field for most sales forecasts.
Opportunities are relevant only to your largest and most complex deals.
5. In the Product field, enter the product line you intend to sell to this
account.
If you have a small and consistent set of products you typically sell, it is
useful to use the lookup list associated with the Product field. I discuss
Lookup lists in Chapter 26.
Figure 12-4:
Forecasting
a potential
sale.
138
Part III: Managing Activities 

6. In the Units field, enter how many of these products you expect to
sell. You can use decimals to sell fractional quantities. 
7. Enter the price of the individual product into the Price field.
As soon as you fill in the Price field, GoldMine automatically calculates
to the total amount of your projected sale. Items such as sales tax and
shipping are usually not included here.
8. In the Probability field, enter the probability that you will actually
complete the sale.
This field is always an interesting exercise. Your choices are integers
between 0 and 100. Neither of those two numbers is actually appropri-
ate. If you sale has a zero probability, you shouldn’t be wasting your
time predicting it. In fact, just go on to the next deal and forget about it.
A probability of 100 indicates that you already have at least a signed
deal. If that’s the case, this sale is complete and should not be in your
forecast anymore (unless it was a recurring sale).
9. In the Anticipated Sale Date field, enter what you feel is a likely date
for the completion of the sale.
This field is also a fun item. Most of the time, this date is the result of a
guessing game. If you enter a date that’s not too far away, your forecast
report looks good for the short term. Your sales manager will be pleased.
At least, she’ll be pleased until that date comes and goes and the deal
isn’t done. I assume that you’ve been doing this kind of forecasting one
way or another for a long time now. Pick a date in whatever way seems to
work for you and is consistent with your organization’s guidelines.
10. Select the Alarm check box if you want to be reminded of this sale.
I usually don’t use this alarm. Instead, I regularly check my pending
sales activities and do whatever follow-up seems best. Chapter 10 dis-
cusses how to check on pending activities such as sales.
11. When you finish entering your forecast data, click OK to register this
sales forecast.
Sales forecasting is easy, requiring only six or seven entries and, as a result,
you may never need to complete another forecast report again.
Click the Recurring tab on the Schedule a Forecasted Sale dialog box to enter
multiple sales simultaneously. For example, if you sell an insurance policy that
requires 36 monthly payments for the next three years, you can describe this
sale as shown in Figure 12-5. In this way, you need enter the sale only once,
not 36 times. This works only if each component is identical to the others.
139
Chapter 12: Sales Forecasting 

Viewing Your Sales Pipeline
If you or a manager previously entered a quota, you can readily compare
your current situation with this guideline. You can see the sales projections
in tabular format or in graphical format. Neither of these allows you to see
individual sales, but you can see those from the Forecasts tab of the Activity
list, which is discussed in the “Viewing individual items in the forecast” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Analyzing sales in tabular format
Tabular format is the simplest way of looking at your sales projections. In this
format, you can see weekly and monthly subtotals and totals. Start with this
method before going on to the graphical format that requires a few more
specifications before you actually see any results:
1. From the main menu, choose Go To➪Analysis➪Forecast Analysis.
The Forecasted Sales Analysis dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-6.
2. In the lower-left corner, click the Select User(s) button to select
whichever user or users you want to analyze.
Figure 12-5:
Recurring
sales are
repetitive
sales that
are exactly
the same
each time.
140
Part III: Managing Activities 

From the Select Users dialog box, you can select individual users or
groups. If you used the Code field when entering forecasts, you can 
isolate your analyses around the codes here as well. After you select
users and codes, the analysis dialog box returns, but you won’t see any-
thing different yet.
3. Click the Analyze button at the bottom of the dialog box to see some
totals.
You should almost immediately see statistics for the current four-week
period, for the next four months, and everything beyond, too, as shown
in Figure 12-7.

Analyze
button to

statistics.

Analysis
dialog box.
141
Chapter 12: Sales Forecasting 

Most of these numbers are obvious, except for the column labeled Potential.
Potential is a computed number and is the product of the total forecasted
amount and the average probability. In other words, the potential sale
amount is the amount you will probably sell in each time period.
Analyzing sales in graphical format
Sometimes a graph is worth a thousand tables. You can view your sales using
graphs by following these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Go To➪Analysis➪Graphical Analysis.
The Graphical Analysis Options dialog box appears. The dialog box is
divided into five sections:
• Graph Type
• Users
• Activities
• Time Span
• Options
This dialog box has a lot more options than the tabular analysis dialog
box; however, it’s not really hard to get through.
2. In the Graph Type section, select Scheduled and Totals and choose
whether you want to see the data as bars or lines — feel free to
experiment.
3. Select one or more users whose forecasts you want to see. To select
multiple users, double-click each user, one at a time, until all those
users appear in the Selected Users panel. If you have defined User
Groups previously, you can also choose one or more User Groups or
even All Users.
4. In the Activities section, select Sales.
5. Select either the weekly or monthly Time Span.
6. Click the Graphs button to see a graphical analysis of your sales.
GoldMine may take a few seconds to cook up your graph, but you
should shortly see a neat graph of your future. Figure 12-8 shows an
example of a sales analysis graph.
7. Click the Close button at the top right to exit this dialog box.
142
Part III: Managing Activities 

Viewing individual items in the forecast
Both the tabular and the graphical methods of examining your forecast give
you summary information only. To see each pending sale, follow these steps:
1. From the Navigation Bar on the left, choose Activities. Then, from the
Current List just above the Navigation Bar, choose Forecasts.
Immediately, you see the browse window detailing the individual fore-
casted sales, as shown in Figure 12-9. You can change the user if you
want. Just as important, you can click on any of the headings, such as
%Prob and Forecast, to sort the display any way you want.
2. To drill down on the details for each potential sale, double-click a sale.
The particular account for that sale appears. The forecasted sale itself is
in the Pending tab for that account. You can examine the sale in the
Pending tab by double-clicking the sale. Or easier still, right-click the
highlighted sale (while still in the Activity listing) and choose Zoom or
Edit to view the details. In either case (Zoom or Edit) you will see all the
details. However, by using Edit, you can make changes, whereas the
Zoom function allows you only to view or delete the forecasted sale.

Chapter 12: Sales Forecasting 

Forecast reports
GoldMine comes with an extensive series of standard reports, some of which
relate to sales forecasting. You can review these reports by first accessing the
report section. Clicking the Reports button on the Standard Toolbar takes
you directly to the Reports dialog box. 
Refer to Chapter 22 for more details on reporting, but for now, select the cate-
gory of reports called Analysis Reports, as shown in Figure 12-8. Many prede-
fined reports are included in the drop-down list within the field called
“Report.” One typical example is shown in Figure 12-10.
Viewing a group forecast
Although reports are often helpful, most of your analysis will probably be
done by reviewing forecast details onscreen. You can do so for an individual’s
sales or for a group’s sales. In the Forecasted Sales Analysis dialog box,
notice a button in the lower-left corner that allows you to select users. Click
this button and another dialog box appears that lets you select either individ-
ual users or groups of users.
Figure 12-9:
The Activity
list shows

144
Part III: Managing Activities 

Selecting a group of users is particularly useful if, for example, you’re a sales
manager and you want to see how all your people are doing according to
their quotas or forecasts. As long as you have defined each of these salespeo-
ple as belonging to a specific group, you can easily perform this analysis in a
moment.
Double-clicking any User or any group of Users listed just below will automat-
ically move those people into the list of selected Users. After you have done
this, click OK, and then click the Analyze button on the Forecasted Sales
Analysis dialog box.
Completing Your Forecasts
One way or another, win, lose, or draw, you eventually need to complete your
forecasted sales. You attack this from the individual account’s Pending tab,
from your Calendar, or from the Activity list. I usually start at the individual
account’s Pending tab. Highlighting the particular forecasted sale and right-
clicking brings you to an option to complete the sale, as shown in Figure 12-11.
Figure 12-10:
A standard
sales
forecast
report.
145
Chapter 12: Sales Forecasting 

Several key elements are available for you to consider as you complete the
sale. The first is the Private option on the upper-right part of the Complete a
Sale dialog box. You can select this if you never want anyone to know what
you sold. The Privacy button is particularly useful (not) if you expect a com-
mission for the sale. To be truthful, I can’t think of too many reasons to ever
select this.
Further down the Complete a Sale dialog box are the Code and Result fields. I
use the Code field to further describe the type of sale. For example, I might
want to separate software and hardware sales for reporting purposes. The
Result field allows the exact status of the deal to be further categorized. For
example, you may lose a sale for many different reasons. Perhaps the client
abandoned the project (ABA), or you lost it to a competitor because your
management wouldn’t budge on the price (PRI). Make up your own lookup
lists for these two fields. Refer to Chapter 26 for help with lookup lists.
On the right side of the dialog box in Figure 12-11 is the Success field. You
have two choices for this field: You either closed the sale or you lost it. Your
selection governs how this sale is reported on the Statistical Analysis and
Quota Analysis dialog boxes discussed earlier in this chapter. Any time you
enter Closed in the Success field, GoldMine interprets this as a good thing —
particularly in the Statistical Analysis area. As painful as entering Lost might
be, it will be even more uncomfortable when you can’t figure out why you are
so far over quota even though it was a terrible month!

In this part . . .
L
eads are the lifeblood of every organization. Without
them, no new business is likely. In this part, you learn
how GoldMine manages those leads and how marketing
can stimulate the acquisition of leads. One way to get
leads is to pester your vendors (all GoldMine dealers use
this methodology). Another way is to use some technol-
ogy to put your name out there. I like a combination of the
two techniques.
The Service Management Center is brand new to GoldMine.
It’s meant to handle simple customer issues, allowing you
to track each issue from the time it’s first presented until
it’s resolved.

very salesperson wants leads. I can’t tell you here how to actually get
leads, but I can tell you what to do after you do get them.
Importing Leads into GoldMine
Leads come from many sources. If you purchase lists, they hopefully come
to you in a spreadsheet or in some electronic form that allows you to use
GoldMine’s Import Utility. The Import Utility accepts the following formats:
 DBF
 ASCII
 SDF
 SQL
 XML
You can also import from several versions of ACT and Outlook, but these are
not usually sources of leads. You can see from the preceding list that Excel is
not listed. If you have an Excel file to import, you save it as a .DBF file.
To begin an import, from the main menu, choose File➪Import and
Export➪Import Contact Records, as shown in Figure 13-1. Doing so opens
GoldMine’s Import Wizard, which leads you through the entire process.

As with all the wizards in GoldMine, this one just “walks” you through all
the steps. Making sure that your incoming data is clean and consistent and
matches the format and the size of the corresponding GoldMine fields is
always a good idea. Figure 13-2 shows you the first real screen of the
Import Wizard.

150
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

More often than not, when importing data from multiple sources, you encounter
an issue with duplicate records. This can easily happen when two sales-
people are both working the same account. The duplicate records will likely
have conflicting information. If you are in the situation of needing to import
data from multiple sources, you are well served to consider using either
GoldBox or Inaport. You can find more details on these two utilities in
Chapter 30.
Follow the wizard along until it’s done. When your new records are in
GoldMine, you want to begin assigning these leads and monitoring their
progress toward your eventual goal: closing the deals.
Assigning Leads to Users
Unless you have a completely automated lead follow-up system, every lead —
and every account, for that matter — needs to be assigned to a real user. As
obvious as that sounds, I have only rarely seen this to be the case within the
thousands of databases our clients maintain. 
The first thing to avoid is the infamous “House” account. House accounts are
those accounts assigned to the company. This type of account happens when
no one is quite sure whom to assign an account to, or it happens when terri-
tories get reorganized or when salespeople leave the company. In reality, this
guy “House” rarely makes any calls and never does even the least bit of pro-
active sales.
Second, you should make sure that every lead is being handled by a real, live
person and not by someone who used to work at your company six years
ago. That means you have to stay on top of your logic for assigning leads. 
Using ZIP codes
The United States has many ZIP codes. In fact, it has more than 79,000 ZIP
codes, and that’s considering only the first 5 digits. Canada has even more.
The point is that basing your assignment of leads on ZIP codes forces you
to maintain a very large database of codes, which occasionally change. In
addition, in some states, ZIP codes are not arranged in any geographically
sensible manner. In general, ZIP codes are a poor choice for determining
whose lead it is.
151
Chapter 13: Managing Your Leads

Using telephone area codes
Telephone area codes are slightly more manageable. There are only hundreds
as opposed to tens of thousands. And, in general, telephone area codes relate
pretty well to geography and, to some degree, to population areas. However,
as cell phones and Internet phones become more and more prevalent, they
present a problem. My Internet phone number does not care where I am. It
follows me from Connecticut to North Carolina should I decide to move
my company.
Using geography
If you can assign accounts by state, you will have an easy time of it. But, of
course, giving someone Alaska may not be quite the equivalent of California.
I’m not sure about Hawaii. So, you may need to subdivide some of your larger
states. You may be able to use a combination of state and the first digit or
two of the ZIP code or, maybe, the telephone area codes. In general, this has
been one of the more successful methodologies rather than just relying on
ZIP codes or area codes alone.
In all three of these cases, you can make good use of GoldMine LOOKUP.INI
file to automatically assign leads. See Chapter 26 for more details on the
LOOKUP.INI file.
Other methodologies
Of course, you have other ways to divvy up leads. You can use a round-robin
approach, which is similar to eenie-meenie-meinee-moe. And, that’s fair but
may not result in the most logic or productive pairing of sales people with
accounts. You can do a weighted version of this approach, with your most
productive sales people getting a few “extra” leads. Or, you can do a proxim-
ity calculation and assign the lead to whichever salesperson is geographically
closest. Each of these “other” methodologies requires some amount of exter-
nal programming because GoldMine does not have a built-in system to
handle these approaches.
Or, you can forget geography altogether and assign leads based on that lead’s
product interest and each salesperson’s expertise. This is a good method in
an age when many sales are done over the phone and over the Web, and face-
to-face meetings are less common.

Analyzing Your Leads
Out of the box, GoldMine already has quite a bit of analysis built in. By
default, GoldMine assumes that you are using the Source field to track where
each lead came from. Why would you use any other field? 
To begin analyzing your lead data, choose Go To➪Analysis➪Leads Analysis,
which opens the screen shown in Figure 13-3.
In Figure 13-4, you see a tabular display of all your leads. The very first item
in the table shows 47 leads, but nothing in the Source field. This happens
when no one enters the Source of the lead and is typically the most common
result of manual entry of leads. An automated system, such as Web Import
(see Chapter 29), resolves this problem.
Figure 13-3:
Finding the
Leads
Analysis
area.
153
Chapter 13: Managing Your Leads

You can drill down and get a lot more detail on each line item by highlighting
that line and double-clicking. This is the same as the Zoom option and opens
the screen shown in Figure 13-5.
Using the Previous and Next buttons shown in Figure 13-5, you can scroll
through the statistics for each of your lead sources. Please be aware that, at
least as of the early builds of Version 8, some of the math displayed in these
screens is a bit suspect.

more detail
on each

Figure 13-4:

stats on all

154
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

Although you see the leads analysis based on the Source field by default, you
can also do the same analysis based on who is in charge of the account. By
selecting the Analyze button at the bottom of the screen in Figure 13-4, you
can specify sorting by other fields, for example by the Account Manager field,
as shown in Figure 13-6.
Using Automated Processes
Automating the entry of new records in general and leads in particular avoids the
syndrome shown in Figure 13-4 — the Empty Source Field Syndrome. Forcing
Valid Input for the Source field also goes a long way toward solving this problem.
One of the first business processes you develop should be to automate the
assignment of leads and actually schedule some activities. I discuss
Automated Processes in Chapter 27. 
Although I cannot design your specific Automated Process here (everyone’s
is a little different), following are the basic components to consider:
1. Assign each new record to a Track.
2. Make sure the Source field is filled in.
Even entering “Unknown” is better than just leaving the field blank.
3. Assign a salesperson based on one of the methodologies discussed
previously.
If you use some variant of one of those methods, make sure that your
Automated assignment process can handle it.
4. Have GoldMine automatically send out correspondence to the
prospect, whether by mail, fax, or e-mail.
5. Schedule the salesperson for a follow-up activity.
6. Start a drip campaign, which is just a steady stream of correspon-
dence and contacts until you can declare victory or defeat.
Do not give up before you’ve made at least six touches or have been
asked to stop.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the Campaign Manager
 Configuring the Essential Fields for Marketing with GoldMine
N
ot many people associate marketing with GoldMine. In fact, GoldMine
seems to have gotten a bad rap when it comes to marketing. In the past
seven or eight years, some of GoldMine’s competitors came out with modules
they labeled “marketing.” GoldMine didn’t have a module called “marketing,”
so the perception existed that GoldMine didn’t do marketing.
Now, GoldMine has a module — and you can see it in the Navigation Pane —
called Campaigns. Within this area is actually the same marketing functional-
ity that has been in GoldMine for a long, long time. Now it’s a little better
organized, and you can use it to organize simple marketing campaigns.
In my office, we’ve used GoldMine to do our marketing for years, and we’ve
developed some techniques to truly automate it and make it sing. This chap-
ter discusses some of those ideas and techniques.
Using the Campaign Manager
You can use the Campaign Manager (CM) to create multiple marketing cam-
paigns and assemble a series of simple steps inside each campaign. The CM
is the right tool for a campaign that consists of some combination of import-
ing data and then following up via e-mail, postal mail, or phone calls. A trade
show is a typical scenario appropriate for the CM.

To create a new campaign for the trade show you just attended, follow these
steps:
1. Click the Campaigns button from the Navigation Pane.
GoldMine displays the Campaign Management Center, as shown in
Figure 14-1.
2. Click the New Campaign icon from the local menu and enter a unique
campaign name into the Campaign Name field, shown in Figure 14-2.
Be sure to be very specific with your naming. Using just “Hartford Auto
Show” is probably not good enough if you intend to go back year after
year to this show, because you will want to track the results from each
year’s show. Click Next to go to the next step.
3. Select the records in GoldMine that will be part of this campaign.
If the records already exist in GoldMine, and if they are part of either a
filter or a group, you can select that filter or group from the list shown in
Figure 14-3. But, if you are building this campaign from scratch, click the
New button to create a new filter or group.
Figure 14-1:
Starting the
Campaign
Manage-
ment
Center.
158
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

In deciding whether to use a filter or a group, consider whether you will
be adding additional records later. A trade show, for example, is a one-
time event and you are not likely to add more records later, so using a
group makes more sense.
4. Click the New button and then Group from the drop-down list.
Enter the name for your new group and click OK. GoldMine now guides
you through a detour to define your group. When you’re done with this
detour, GoldMine returns you to actually building your campaign and
the screen shown in Figure 14-4.
After the campaign design is concluded, the tasks you define will be
shown as Open, Completed, and Contacts.

or a group,
you will end
up touching
every
account
with this
task.
Figure 14-2:

Campaign.
159
Chapter 14: Managing Your Marketing

5. Begin building the individual tasks that comprise your campaign by
clicking the New Task button (refer to Figure 14-4).
The New button actually specifies a new task. For example, you may
have purchased a list or just returned from that trade show. Select
Import Data from the drop-down list. Doing so displays the screen in
Figure 14-5.
6. Click the format your data is in and then click the OK button.
Keep building new tasks until you have specified all the general steps in
your Campaign. When you’re done adding tasks to the campaign, your
Campaign Manager looks like the one shown in Figure 14-6.

Figure 14-4:

place in a

160
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

You need to understand that no behind-the-scenes process runs these cam-
paigns. You are responsible for initiating each task, and here’s how.
After you have set up one or more campaigns, go back to the Campaign
Management Center. As shown in Figure 14-7, you can expand each of the
campaigns in the left panel to see each of the tasks.
To initiate the next task you want performed, right-click that task and then
select Complete Task from the drop-down list of choices (see Figure 14-8).
The Campaign Wizard guides you through the necessary steps and then
changes the task from Open to Completed.
The Campaign Manager is a good tool for simple campaigns. In reality, you
find no new functionality here; the Campaign Manager merely assembles the
already existing components of marketing into one place. To design a more
sophisticated system, you are probably better off using the tools indepen-
dently of the Campaign Manager.

Using the Essential Fields for Marketing
with GoldMine 
Most Marketing managers will admit that they do not market the same way to
every prospect or customer. Marketing mavens collect information that helps
them target their marketing. GoldMine has enough tools to handle a good
marketing program, but collecting some demographic information and stor-
ing that in GoldMine is essential. 
Some of the fields discussed in the following sections come with GoldMine
right out of the box. Others, such as Priority, Interest, and Products, must be
created before you can use them. Your GoldMine administrator or your
dealer can assist with that.
Source
The Source field is discussed in detail in Chapter 13, but needs to be reiter-
ated here. You should use the Source field to track very specifically how this
prospect or customer came to you. You should not use the Source field for
anything else, and despite the fact that you can theoretically have multiple
entries in the Source field, resist the urge to do so. Having anything other
than the one primary way that this prospect heard of you will render any
analysis of your marketing useless. The Source field has a lookup list and it
should be set to accept only “valid input.”
Priority
No Priority field comes with GoldMine, so you must create it if you want to
use this concept. You use Priority to rate the importance of each account.
You could use a simple “1,2,3. . .” or “A,B,C. . . “ system. That rating drives
your marketing. A-level accounts (or prospects) should be touched more
often than C-level accounts. 
You may want to calculate each account’s Priority, and you can do this based
on other fields you add to GoldMine. In my own system, we track custom
fields such as
 Marquee Account
 Referral Account
 Geographic Location
163
Chapter 14: Managing Your Marketing

 Attitude
 Payment Terms
 Gross Revenue
 Profit Potential
Each field gets a score and is a component of the calculation of that account’s
Priority. Based on the Priority field, an Automated Process determines how
frequently to schedule phone calls and appointments.
Products
The system needs to know which of your products or services each account
has already purchased. You can store this information in a single field, possi-
bly allowing for multiple entries in the field, or in the Details tab if more infor-
mation is needed. The Automated Process is easier to set up if Products are
stored in a single field.
Interest
The Interest field should store those products or services that the account
has expressed an interest in, or should be interested in. 
Merge codes
Every e-mail address has an associated Merge Code (see Figure 14-9). The
Merge Code is an essential component of any e-mail marketing campaign. You
use this field to regulate who gets e-mail from you. As an example, you might
set the Merge Code field to Z to prevent e-mail from going to a particular
address. This is particularly important when a customer requests to be taken
off your mailing list. You have a legal obligation to stop e-mailing at that
point, and the Merge Code field allows you to comply.

Handling Cases
In This Chapter
 Setting up your cases
 Making use of templates
 Handling your cases
 Using the Knowledge Base with cases
T
he Service Center is new in GoldMine Premium. It’s fully integrated with
the companies and contacts in the rest of GoldMine, not to mention with
GoldMine’s Knowledge Base. And, while you are reading about GoldMine 8,
be aware that the Service Center portion of the program is more like Version
1.0 or, maybe, 2.0. A good beginning with lots of potential.
If your organization needs to track customer-related issues such as com-
plaints, questions, or RMAs, GoldMine Premium might be just your ticket.
FrontRange already has another product that manages service related cases.
It’s called HEAT, and it goes well beyond what GoldMine Premium currently
does or is likely to ever do.
You can configure some of the fields in the Service Center, as I discuss in the
first section of this chapter. Also in this chapter, I explore the basic capabili-
ties of GoldMine’s Service Center and how you can make use of them.
Configuring Your Case Setup
Each record within the Service Center is called a “Case” and each Case has a
unique Case number. Other systems sometimes call these Ticket numbers.
Actually, the Case number is not a number at all, but it’s really a multi-part
sequence of numbers and digits. If you already have a numbering system,
you may be able to configure GoldMine’s Case numbering system to match
your existing system. 

Figure 15-1 shows a typical Service Center screen. I intentionally dragged
the main screen a little to the left to obscure some of the Navigation Pane.
Without doing this you might miss the Customize button in the upper-right
corner of the main work area. Clicking this button makes the screen shown
in Figure 15-2 appear.
The first thing to do with the screen in Figure 15-2 is to click the button to the
right of the Case Number Mask field. Doings so opens the screen shown in
Figure 15-3, where you can configure the format of the Case Number field.
For either the prefix or the suffix (or both) you can elect to use a date stamp.
GoldMine calls it a timestamp, but come on, it has only a date in it, and no
time. Using the timestamp feature in either the prefix or the suffix certainly
makes sense. That way, just by looking at a case number, you can tell when it
was created.
The Identity Seed field provides a starting point for a unique numbering
scheme. The Identity Format field controls how many digits are in that
middle part of the case number. Use enough digits to handle at least the
number of cases you anticipate in a typical year.
Figure 15-1:
A typical
Service
Center
screen. 
168
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

Put some thought into the format you will use, because you don’t want to
change the format after you already have a few hundred cases on file. When
you’re done with the screen in Figure 15-3, click OK to return to the screen
in Figure 15-2.
At this time, you cannot add additional fields to the Service Center screen,
and you can’t change the field labels. With any luck, such enhancements will
show up in later releases.
Using Templates
Many cases are similar, and to avoid entering the same old information time
and after time, you can create one or more templates that fill in the fields in
the upper area of the Service screen.
Figure 15-3:
Formatting
your case
number.
Figure 15-2:
Configuring
the Service
Center.
169
Chapter 15: Handling Cases

To create a new template, simply click the Template button in the Service
Center toolbar and then select Manage Templates. Next click the New button
on the Manage Templates screen. The screen shown in Figure 15-4 appears,
in which you name your new template and fill in the default values for each
of the fields shown.
Handling Cases
By “handling” cases, I mean assigning them to the right person, escalating
issues as needed, and then, finally, putting them to bed, either successfully
or not.
Assigning cases
When you configure your Service Center (refer to Figure 15-2), you can assign
a default assignee. This is the poor soul in your organization who needs to
deal with every gnarly issue that any customer or prospect ever calls in with.
Chances are, you will want to manually override this selection, at least occa-
sionally. You may, in fact, want to create a virtual user (someone who doesn’t
actually exist) called “Service Manager” and automatically assign all cases to
her. Then you can reassign cases to the appropriate person. 
Reassigning cases
The Service Center toolbar contains a button called Reassign. Clicking this
button opens the screen in Figure 15-5.
Figure 15-4:
Creating a
new
template
with default
values.
170
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

So, if you are not just automatically assigning every case to one individual, part
of your process should be to reassign each case to the appropriate person.
Make sure to include any special instructions, and be aware that text you enter
in the Message field does not word wrap — at least not in the June 2007 release.
When you click the Reassign button, GoldMine sends that user your message
and assigns the case to him or her. It also changes the status to “Reassigned.”
If you expect to do this kind of reassignment regularly, make sure that you
have opted for an automatic alert for reassigned (and escalated while
you’re at it) cases. Refer to Figure 15-2 for a view of these settings.
Escalating cases
If your customer calls and complains that you aren’t paying enough attention
to his or her issue, you can escalate the case. To escalate it, simply select the
Escalate button from the toolbar. The screen in Figure 15-6 appears.
Figure 15-6:
Escalating 
a case.
Figure 15-5:
Reassigning
a case.
171
Chapter 15: Handling Cases

When you escalate a case, the message you enter is e-mailed to the assigned
user, and the status of the case changes from Assigned to Escalated. Also, if
you’ve set your alerts properly (refer to Figure 15-2), the assignee receives
both an e-mail and an alert. However, nothing much else happens. The prior-
ity isn’t changed, nor is the deadline. So, you may want to manually change
those two fields if you are really serious about resolving the issue faster. You
may also want to notify someone higher up in the food chain. Again, that
would be done manually.
Resolving or abandoning cases
Ultimately, you want to resolve each case. This basically means that you are
completing the assignment and, probably, entering some notes. To officially
resolve a case, click the Resolve button on the Service Center toolbar. The
screen shown in Figure 15-7 opens. You should enter some notes and, per-
haps, link to a file in the Knowledge Base; then, click the Resolve button at
the bottom of the Resolve Case screen.
Typically, resolving a case means that you have successfully dealt with it.
Sometimes you may need to just abandon a case by no fault of your own. For
example, if the next step in the process is for the customer to call you back
with more information, and she never does, you may need to just abandon it,
as shown in Figure 15-8.
Figure 15-7:
Resolving 
a case.
172
Part IV: Marketing and Support 

Analyzing cases
The Service Center comes with some built-in analysis that you can access by
clicking the Analyze button on the Service Center toolbar. When you do so,
GoldMine opens the screen shown in Figure 15-9.
In the analysis screen, you can select one or more users as well as the time-
frame you want analyzed. As you can see from Figure 15-9, I have personally
resolved only a very small percentage of the cases assigned to me. The
solution may be for me to learn how to use the Reassign button better, or
just do my work.

Chapter 15: Handling Cases

Using Your Knowledge Base
The Knowledge Base in the Service Center is the same Knowledge Base as in
the rest of GoldMine. I discuss the Knowledge Base in much greater detail in
Chapter 20. In this section, I cover how you should use the Knowledge Base
in conjunction with the Service Center.
In the simplest sense, when setting up the Service Center (or GoldMine in
general, for that matter) you should stock the Knowledge Base with every
type of organizational expertise you have. When someone on the customer
service staff — and, please consider someone who is in his second day with
your company and is now manning the hot-line — needs to sound like an
expert, the Knowledge Base is what might come to his rescue.
When you go to resolve a case, and find yourself on the phone with a cus-
tomer, you can quickly search the Knowledge Base for all the relevant infor-
mation you need. The figures that follow show the sequence of screens for
locating information on how GoldMine interacts with the Internet. This, of
course, is just a typical example. You might be more interested in finding out
how to diagnose salmonella food poisoning or how to build a solar collector.
Clicking the Resolve button from the toolbar opens the screen shown in
Figure 15-10. You can enter some notes in the upper pane and then click the
Search Knowledge Base button to reach the screen shown in Figure 15-11.

In Figure 15-11, I have simply entered the word Internet. The next step is to
click the Search button, which immediately makes the window in Figure 15-12
appear. There, I have highlighted the entry for Internet E-mail. Doing so
displays the text that applies to this topic.

As long as your customer support needs are relatively simple, GoldMine

always upgrade to TeleSupport Help Desk, HEAT, or some other 
competitive product.

f you like to send out letters — the old-fashioned kind —
you’ll really like GoldMine’s interface with Microsoft
Word. You can create and maintain a series of template
documents that not only have HTML artwork but can also
include dates from records in GoldMine.
GoldMine’s e-mail system, which has been around since
the early 1990s, is a great way to easily track all your
incoming and outgoing e-mails. If you’re an Outlook
addict, you can use Outlook either in addition to or in
conjunction with GoldMine’s own e-mail system.
In this part, you also learn about linking documents of all
types to records in GoldMine. This works with incoming
and outgoing Word documents, e-mails, and any other
kind of file you might imagine.

B
ack in the day, GoldMine integrated with several word processing
systems. Now that all but one of those systems has essentially
bitten the dust, GoldMine can still claim a very tight integration with
Microsoft Word.
You can use this integration to create Word templates that you can then use
as mail merge documents. You can send these documents to clients on a
one-off basis or as part of a marketing campaign via mail merge.
In this chapter, I discuss what works with what, and how to create a simple
Word template and use it in a mail merge.
Understanding What Versions 
Work Together
GoldMine Premium officially works with Word 2003 (after you’ve installed
Service Pack 2) and with Word 2007. Figure 16-1 shows a chart from
FrontRange’s Compatibility Matrix. This is part of a larger compatibility
document published by FrontRange. The entire document is available at
www.ccc24k.com.

Creating Templates
You can easily create custom Word templates containing a combination of
pictures, data from GoldMine fields, and standard and custom text. 
After the link is created between GoldMine and Word, you have an extra tab
in Word called, interestingly enough, “GoldMine.” Clicking this tab, as shown
in Figure 16-2, displays a drop-down list of choices.
To create a simple company letterhead that you can use for correspondence,
follow these steps:
1. Open Word with a new, blank document and press Return to create a
couple of blank lines.
2. From Word’s main menu, choose Insert➪Picture➪From File. 
Browse to a copy of your company logo (assuming that you have such a
thing; if not, adding your logo is optional, anyway). Select the logo and
Word will position it where your cursor was positioned in the document.
Add a blank line below the picture.

Part V: Managing Documents 

3. From Word’s main menu, choose Insert➪Date and Time and then
select whatever date format appeals to you.
Word inserts that below your logo. You probably want to click the Enter
key once or twice to add blank lines below the date. 
4. From Word’s main menu, choose GoldMine➪Insert GoldMine Field(s).
Word brings you to a drop-down list of all the available fields, as shown
in Figure 16-3. Those selections starting with an ampersand are actually
combinations of fields. I recommend that you select &FullAddress. If 
the currently active GoldMine record has a complete set of contact
information, you immediately see that information displayed in the
template you are building.
Always use a record with all the address fields filled in for your template.
You can even create a test record with the names of each field so that
you will know what the &FullAddress or other available fields are insert-
ing into the template.
Figure 16-2:
Using the
GoldMine
tab in Word.
181
Chapter 16: Integrating with Word

5. Add a salutation line below the address by selecting &Contact.
You probably want to append a colon after this insertion so the colon
appears after the Contact name in your document.
6. Enter a few blank lines (just a few) to allow room for custom text that
you will compose each time.
If your text is longer than the two or three blank lines you’ve created,
Word will expand your document to deal with it.
7. Add some closing text and, better yet, add a picture of your scanned
signature.
8. To save this new and valuable template, click the GoldMine tab again
and then choose Save as GoldMine Template.
It is very important that you do NOT save this document by choosing
Word➪File➪Save As!
The preceding procedure adds your new template to GoldMine’s Document
Management Center, and it is immediately available for your use.

Using Your Templates 
GoldMine’s Document Management Center houses all your templates,
whether they are public templates or owned specifically by you or some
other user. You get to the Document Management Center from the main
menu by choosing Go To➪Document Templates. Doing so opens the screen
shown in Figure 16-4.
From the screen in Figure 16-4, you begin the process of merging the contact
information from one or more records in GoldMine with any of the templates
in the Document Management Center. Here are the basic steps:
1. In the left pane, double-click the template you want to use.
GoldMine responds with the screen shown in Figure 16-5, which enables
you to select either the primary contact or one of the secondary contacts.
Pick one. GoldMine merges the contact information into the template you
selected and displays the result on the screen.

GoldMine presents you with the option to print all the documents. If you
select No in Figure 16-7, you can add text to the documents before print-
ing. Otherwise, GoldMine sends your documents to the printer and logs

3. After you’ve given GoldMine permission to print, that process begins
and you should go hunting for stamps and envelopes.
Templates can be public or owned by one user. If you can’t locate the tem-
plate you have in mind, check to see whether you have the correct user spec-
ified in the Document Management Center.

f you are one of those people who thinks e-mail is now just the current fad,
then you can skip this chapter entirely. Papyrus, quills, and the abacus
could make a comeback, and then you’ll be in seventh heaven. (I still have
one of my slide rules just in case.)
If you’re thoroughly addicted to Outlook and just don’t want to be bothered
learning to use GoldMine’s built-in e-mail client, even though GoldMine’s is
easier, faster, and better integrated, you might also consider skipping this
chapter. You can go directly to Chapter 18, where I discuss all the pros and
cons of being an Outlook addict.
Despite the plague of spam, e-mail is still one of the best communications
tools ever developed. It’s fast, easy, and basically free. All these things appeal
to me, and apparently to many others as well.
The entire Document Management System, of which e-mail is a part, has been
continually enhanced since the late 1990s. In particular, FrontRange recog-
nizes that many, many people use Outlook as their e-mail client. Rather than
fight that trend, the GoldMine/Outlook interface continues to become more
and more robust. If you or others at your company are dedicated to using
Outlook for e-mail, you can find more details in the next chapter.
In addition, e-mail features full HTML capability, so you can read and create
rich-content e-mails.
In this chapter, you find out how to set up your GoldMine system to handle
all your e-mail requirements, how to send an individual e-mail, how to send
broadcast e-mails, and how to receive and catalog incoming e-mails.

Configuring Your E-Mail System
Before you can use GoldMine’s e-mail system, you must first set up an
Internet account, and you must configure GoldMine to use that account. 
To access the Internet, you must have an account with an Internet service
provider (ISP). This ISP must provide true Internet mail access. AOL, for 
example, does not provide true Internet mail access. There are many regional,
national, and international providers with good, competitive service. 
Entering your ISP’s account information
When you sign up with an ISP, you are given account information that you
need to configure your GoldMine interface. You do so within GoldMine’s User
Preferences dialog box. Please refer to Chapter 3 for more information on set-
ting up user preferences.
The QuickStart Wizard guides you through the setup of your e-mail account
in GoldMine. If you are already beyond the initial installation and still need
to configure your e-mail, follow these instructions:
1. Choose Tools➪Options from the main menu.
The User Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the E-Mail tab, as shown in Figure 17-1.
3. Enter the appropriate information, using the following explanations
as a guide:
• POP3 Server: The name of the server that holds your incoming e-mail,
and can be entered either as something like mail.something.com
Figure 17-1:
Set up 
your e-mail
preferences.
188
Part V: Managing Documents 

or as the actual IP address, which might be something like
207.187.163.57. In either case, your ISP provides this information.
• Username: You set up your user name with your ISP.
• Password: You also set this up with your ISP, and when you type
it in, it appears on the User Preferences dialog box as a series of
asterisks for security purposes.
• SMTP Server: The name of the server that processes your outgo-
ing e-mail. It may or may not be the same as your POP3 server
address. I use my actual IP address for both these fields.
• Your Return Address: Your actual e-mail address that probably
appears on your business cards or that you tell people.
• Network Connection: The last field on the Internet tab of the User
Preferences dialog box is for your network connection. If you do
not have a dedicated connection through a router, or something
like that, you do not need to select this option. If, on the other
hand, you want GoldMine to dial in and make the connection for
you each time you start the program, select the Use Dial-up
Networking option. If you do select this option, you may also
want to have GoldMine hang up for you when you are done. If so,
then select the Hang Up When Done option.
4. To set more options, such as composing, retrieval, and additional
account information, click the More Options button in the lower-left
portion of the E-Mail tab.
Clicking this displays the dialog box shown in Figure 17-2. This dialog
box allows you to tailor how you compose, retrieve, view, and customize
your e-mail messages.
5. Click OK when you’re finished.
Figure 17-2:

189
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

Setting options for composing 
your messages
This section deals with the most significant settings within the Internet
Preferences dialog box in GoldMine. Each of these settings is discussed in the
following sections. The new rules and wizards are set up within the E-mail
Center itself and are discussed in the “Sending E-Mail Messages” section,
later in this chapter.
Attaching a VCard to outgoing messages
You can have GoldMine attach your VCard (a .vcf file) to each of your out-
going e-mail messages. A VCard contains information similar to that of a
contact record, such as the entries you made in your Personal tab, or other
information that you enter outside of GoldMine. If the receiving system has
VCard capabilities, the system will decipher the .vcf file to import this
information. If the e-mail recipients use GoldMine to retrieve e-mail, they
can use your VCard information to create a contact record in GoldMine, if
a record does not already exist for you in their databases.
I don’t use this option myself because many of my non-GoldMine-using recipi-
ents can’t make use of it and virtually all my GoldMine-using e-mail buddies
already have a record for me in their databases. I don’t really care to receive
.vcf files from anyone, either, because I don’t want to store them on my
hard drive, anyway.
Creating an e-mail signature file
If you would like to create an e-mail template with a touch of class, you
should consider GoldMine’s signature file capability. Without investing in
any other HTML tools, you can still create an impressive and artistic signa-
ture that is automatically included in every one of your outgoing GoldMine
e-mails.
Now, I need to define what I mean by a signature file. Many people think that a
signature file contains an actual signature. The truth is, a signature file might
include an actual signature, but it might not. Often, a signature file just contains
personal and company contact information. And maybe a company logo or a
descriptive phrase.
If you want your e-mails to actually contain your personal signature, you can
do this, but you will need to scan a copy of your signature into a file. If you do
this, you might just as well do it in color. Then, when you include this signa-
ture, it can look as though you signed the e-mail with a blue pen.
190
Part V: Managing Documents 

To create your own HTML signature file, including your signature, follow
these steps:
1. Start a brand new e-mail to someone (anyone, actually).
A few steps down, you’ll add some simple text and a couple of graphics
to the still empty window where you usually type the text of the e-mail.
2. Add a couple of blank lines so that your final document will have
room for you to start typing a message
3. Type “Respectfully yours” and then add a couple more blank lines for
your signature.
4. Type your name, title, company name, company Web site, phone
number, and e-mail address — each on separate lines. 
5. Now comes the neat part: Position your cursor on the blank line
between “Respectfully yours” and your name. 
6. Click the Insert Picture icon, as shown in Figure 17-3, and then
browse to select the file in which you saved your scanned signature. 
After you’ve filled in the Picture Source field, click OK. You may need to
resize your signature.

template.
191
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

7. Click the HTML icon.
You will immediately see that GoldMine has turned your text into HTML
code. This code is what you want to save in your signature file.
8. Cut and paste the code you’ve just generated into Notepad or Word
and save it as a .txt file.
9. Tell GoldMine that you want it to always use this signature file by
choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Internet➪More Options.
Make sure that Use Signature File is selected; it’s the third option on the
screen. Click the Browse button just below to link GoldMine to the signa-
ture file you just created. You can see an example of the finished product
in Figure 17-4.
Violà! You’re in business and looking really professional! You can add a com-
pany logo and a slick catch phrase later.
I get far too many e-mail requests from people who don’t even bother to tell
me who they are. All I get is an e-mail message saying, “Please send me pric-
ing,” or “Send literature on Client Retention.” I am happy to do this, but only
if I know with whom I am corresponding. Proper etiquette dictates that you
provide this information; using a good signature file is the easiest, most con-
sistent way to do so.

Additional options for composing e-mails
Within the Composing tab of the E-Mail Preferences dialog box (refer to
Figure 17-2), you can make some additional choices, as explained in the 
following list:
 When Forcing Line Wrap, Wrap at Column X: Specifies the character at
which GoldMine wraps the text to the next line. By default, GoldMine
wraps to the next line at the 80th character in a line.
 Complete Original Message: Places the original message in the History
tab when you either reply to or forward a message. If you do not want
to designate the original message as a completed activity when you
respond, leave the check box corresponding to this option blank.
 Use Line Quote Style with Prefix: Specifies the characters that
GoldMine uses to identify lines quoted from the original message when
you copy those lines into your reply. By default, GoldMine uses >>.
 Quote Entire Message by Default: Specifies that GoldMine copies the
entire text of the original message in your reply, using the characters
entered in the Use Line Quote Style with Prefix option. This is a good
option to select if you want each e-mail you send to contain a thread of
the previous messages from a correspondent.
 Wrap Quoted Lines in Replies at Column X: Specifies the character at
which GoldMine wraps to the next line of quoted text. You can use this
option to create an indented block for text quoted from the original mes-
sage. By default, GoldMine wraps to the next line at the 80th character in
a quoted line.
 Default Templates: Select an existing e-mail template from the corre-
sponding drop-down list that appears when you work with one or more
of the following message types:
• New outgoing e-mail messages
• Replies
• Forwarded messages
To apply no default template to any or all of the messages, select None.
When you finish defining settings, either click another tab to continue defin-
ing options or click OK to close the Internet Preferences dialog box.
Retrieving e-mail from the Internet
You can define a variety of options for retrieving Internet e-mail messages.
These options, as shown in Figure 17-5, can specify the location of attach-
ments, scan intervals, and the criteria that GoldMine uses to select messages
for retrieval.
193
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

To define criteria for e-mail retrieval, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options, click the E-Mail tab on the dialog box that
appears and then click the More Options button.
2. Click the Retrieval tab and choose from the following options:
• Delete Retrieved Mail from Server: Removes messages from the
Internet mail server upon retrieval.
• Open ‘Read E-mail’ Dialog on Retrieval: Retrieves e-mail and
opens the Read E-mail dialog box, displaying the first retrieved
message.
• Use Date from Mail Header: Sets the date of incoming mail to the
date sent, as indicated in the header information of the message.
Selecting this option ensures that your e-mail is posted in true
chronological order on your calendar.
If you don’t retrieve e-mail frequently, however, you may want to
leave the check box corresponding to this option blank. For exam-
ple, with this option selected, a mail message sent four days prior
to retrieval is posted in the calendar with the four-day-old date.
• Scan Mail for UUEncoded Data: Sets GoldMine to scan the Internet
mail server for any e-mail messages that contain UUEncoded
attachments. Selecting this option does not affect retrieval of
MIME-encoded files.
• Prompt If E-mail Address Is Not on File: Sets GoldMine to display
the Attach E-mail to Contact dialog box upon retrieving an
unlinked e-mail message, from which you can select options for
linking the message.
Figure 17-5:
Choosing
your e-mail
retrieval
options.
194
Part V: Managing Documents 

• Preview X Lines of the Message: Specifies the number of lines of
text that GoldMine retrieves with the message for display in the
lower pane of the E-mail Center window. By default, GoldMine
retrieves the first 15 lines.
• Retrieve Mail Every X Minutes: GoldMine automatically connects
with your POP3 mail server to check for new mail at the interval as
specified in minutes. For example, if you want to retrieve waiting
Internet e-mail every two hours, type 120 in this field. The default
value of 15 sets GoldMine to scan for and retrieve waiting e-mail
every 15 minutes. You must select this option to define any
options listed in the Rules section.
To retrieve e-mail for the account, you must select the Auto-
retrieve option from the Account tab of the Internet Preferences
dialog box. If you do not select the Auto-retrieve option but select
the Retrieve Mail Every X Minutes and Send Queued Messages
options, GoldMine sends queued mail only.
• Skip Read Mail (Recommended): Bypasses displaying any e-mail
messages that you have already read if you have not selected the
Delete Retrieved Mail from Server option. This option is available
only if you select the Retrieve Mail Automatically Every X Minutes
option.
• Skip Mail Larger Than X KB: Retrieves only Internet E-mail mes-
sages that are equal to or smaller than the kilobyte (KB) value in
this field. By default, GoldMine skips messages that are 1,024 kilo-
bytes or larger. This option is available only if you select the
Retrieve Mail Automatically Every X Minutes option.
• Skip Messages from Contacts Not on File: Retrieves e-mail only
from those contacts who have Internet e-mail address entries in
their detail records. This option is available only if you select the
Retrieve Mail Automatically Every X Minutes option. This might
help reduce incoming spam, but you might also miss something
important from some new prospect.
• Send Queued Messages: Sends all queued messages when auto-
matically retrieving mail — see the description previously in this
list for the Retrieve Mail Automatically Every X Minutes option.
The Send Queued Messages option is available only if you select
the Retrieve Mail Automatically Every X Minutes option.
• Attachments Directory: Designates the destination for retrieved
e-mail attachments. Type the entire path information. To search
for the destination, select the Browse button, which displays the
Browse for Folder dialog box.

3. When you’re done defining retrieval settings, either click another tab
to continue defining options or click OK to close the E-Mail
Preferences dialog box.
Sending E-Mail Messages
GoldMine has a unified e-mail system, enabling you to use the same E-mail
Center for both internal (other users on your GoldMine system) and external
(Internet mail) correspondence. In addition, you can send an e-mail message
to an outsider who uses, say, AOL, and send a copy to your sales manager,
another GoldMine user on your team. I refer to this type of e-mail as “dual
e-mail.”
To create or edit an e-mail message to a primary contact, you can simply
position your cursor on the E-mail field label on the main screen. In
GoldMine, this field label is similar to a hyperlink. Clicking it displays the
Create E-mail window, as shown in Figure 17-6.
Figure 17-6:

196
Part V: Managing Documents 

Addressing a message
GoldMine assumes that you intend to send an external e-mail to the primary
contact of the record that is currently active. You can easily redirect this mes-
sage, however, if you want to send this e-mail to one of the secondary con-
tacts at this account. Click the down arrow to the right of the recipient in the
To field. You then get a list of all the other contacts at this account for which
you have an e-mail address. Selecting another contact replaces the default
recipient, as shown in Figure 17-7.
You can expand the scope of your recipient list by clicking the right arrow
button. You have a total of five options, as follows:
 To: Contact: You can use this option to redirect your e-mail to any
person at any account in your GoldMine database.
 To: Manual Recipient: You can use this option to redirect your e-mail to
someone who may not even be in your database, as long as you know
his or her e-mail address and are willing to type it in.
 To: GoldMine User or Group: This choice allows you to send the mes-
sage to another GoldMine user on your team, or even to an entire group
of users, for example, everyone in your Minneapolis office. (See the
“Sending messages to a group” section, later in this chapter.)
Figure 17-7:

197
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

 To: Distribution List: You can build a distribution list of recipients. This
is similar to a group and allows you include an almost random list of
people who should get regular messages from you.
 To: Outlook (MAPI) Recipient: This is part of the interface to Microsoft
Outlook, and allows you to redirect your e-mail output to someone in
your Outlook address book.
You can further expand the recipient list by clicking the CC (carbon copy)
symbol just below the primary recipient’s name. The menu that appears
(shown in Figure 17-8) allows you several more options:
 To: You can manually enter an e-mail address that may not exist in your
database.
 CC (carbon copy): You can select one or more additional primary or
secondary contacts to receive this message.
 BCC (blind carbon copy): You can select one or more people to send
this message to, but the primary recipient will not know you have sent it
to anyone else. For example, you might use this to notify someone of a
problem and to simultaneously inform his or her supervisor.
Figure 17-8:

Part V: Managing Documents 

Composing the subject and body of 
a message
The subject appears as a header so that your recipient has some idea what
this message is about. Below that, of course, is the area in which you com-
pose your actual message. Simply type your message in there.
Many people, aware of viruses and other suspicious things, won’t read or
even download messages that don’t have a recognizable Subject field. If you
want your messages properly dealt with, make the subject succinct and
appropriate.
Completing a message
After you address and compose your message, you can check your spelling,
attach a file or files, or print your message before you send or save it. You
select these options by clicking the icons on the Create E-mail window’s local
toolbar, as shown in Figure 17-9. The icons are as follows:
Figure 17-9:

199
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

 Send: Immediately sends your e-mail message.
 Queue: Puts the message into a queue with other messages for later
transmission. This might be useful, for example, if you are composing
e-mails in an airplane and intend to send a batch of them later.
 Save as Draft: Saves the message if you need to work on it later, before
you send it.
 Attach Files: Attaches one or more files of any type to your e-mail.
 Encrypt: Puts a password on your message and enables you to add 32-
or 128-bit encryption. If you use GoldMine’s encryption, only another
user with GoldMine (and only in the United States, believe it or not) can
read it.
 Check Spelling: Runs the spell checker on your message. This is good if
you can’t spell and your recipient can. While you’re composing, or when
you’re done composing a message, you can click the Check Spelling icon
to avoid embarrassing yourself.
 Save as File: Saves the message as a file on your system in addition to
sending it.
 Print: Prints the message.
 Cut, Copy, and Paste: The standard tools to manipulate your data within
your document or from/to another document.
Also notice the Link check box, which is already selected by default. This
selection automatically creates a link between this e-mail and the active
account. In this way, a record of this e-mail appears in the History and, if
there is an attached document, in the Links tab of the main record.
Sending messages to a group
One of the more powerful features of the e-mail system is its ability to auto-
matically send an e-mail message to each member of an active group of
accounts. This should be one of the cornerstones of your marketing program.
Not only can you use this to send an initial blast to prospects, but more
important, you can use this as part of a client retention system. You should
be regularly corresponding with all your clients, making sure that your name
gets in front of them as often as possible. This applies equally well to simple
e-mail messages and to e-mail templates.
The first step in sending e-mails to a select set of accounts is to activate
either a filter or a group. See Chapter 8 for details on this. After you have
200
Part V: Managing Documents 

activated your filter or group, you can send the e-mail message to each of
them quite easily. The following is a step-by-step outline for sending a boiler-
plate e-mail to a group of people after you activate a filter or group:
Bear in mind that in this version you don’t have to activate the filter or
group. You can choose at the time you decide to whom the email will be sent.
1. Click Go To➪Document Templates.
The Document Management Center appears.
2. Right-click on an e-mail template such as the Hello template that
comes with GoldMine and select Merge from the shortcut menu, as
shown in Figure 17-10.
The Mail Merge Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 17-11, appears.
You can now decide to send your e-mail just to the primary contact for
this one active record (if this is all you wanted to do, there are easier
ways) or all the secondary contacts for this record, or to a filter or
group that you have already set up.
Figure 17-10:
Choosing 
an e-mail
template.
201
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

3. Choose either the Send Now option or the Queue for Later Delivery
option and then click OK.
After you have completed these steps, your e-mail message is on the way to
all your recipients (assuming that you didn’t just put the message into the
queue for later transmission), and the message can be registered in the
History tab of each account to whom you sent the e-mail.
Getting Your Mail
In the simplest sense, you can use the GoldMine E-mail Center to retrieve
your messages, read them, and then either save them or delete them. From
the E-mail Center window, you can perform all the usual and simple e-mail
functions, but you can also go a step farther and define rule conditions and
actions. For example, you can tell GoldMine what to do with your e-mails
while you are on vacation, or what to do if the subject line contains the
word complaint. You can set all this up using the E-mail Rules Wizard.
I just wanna get my e-mail, already
Life in the e-mail fast lane is really not as complex as all the foregoing implies.
After your options are set, retrieving your e-mail is very easy. The E-mail
Center icon is on the main screen. Just click the Mail button in the Navigation
Pane to open the E-mail Center window, connect to the Internet (if you’re not
already connected), and retrieve your e-mail. The E-mail Center window is
shown in Figure 17-12.
Figure 17-11:
Specify
recipients
for your

202
Part V: Managing Documents 

You may have more than one e-mail message waiting for you. GoldMine
begins retrieving, and you can see each e-mail message coming in, along with
the sender’s name, the subject, the size of the message, and the date it was
sent to you. As soon as GoldMine is done retrieving these headings for you,
you can begin looking at each message.
With your user preferences, you can set a relatively small default amount of
text to come in with these headings. This text is displayed in the lower panel
of the E-mail Center window so that you can get a little better idea of the
topic of the e-mail. To see the full text of the message, double-click the partic-
ular From or Subject listing you want. GoldMine then retrieves any remaining
text or attached files. At this point, you have a variety of options, ranging
from reading the message, viewing the attached files, forwarding the message
to another person, replying, or saving the e-mail for future reference.
Defining rule conditions
Using the E-mail Rules Wizard, you can define one or more conditions for
GoldMine to evaluate when retrieving online messages. If a message meets
the conditions, GoldMine then applies the action(s) that you define in the
E-mail Rules Wizard.
Figure 17-12:
The E-mail
Center
window.
203
Chapter 17: Sending and Receiving E-Mail

Defining these conditions means that you can actually automate the process-
ing of your incoming e-mails. Examples of the use of such automation
includes having GoldMine redirect incoming messages with particular headings
to someone else, or send a return message indicating that you are on vacation
and won’t be reading your messages until you return to the office.
To define a new condition or to edit an existing condition, follow these steps:
1. Click the E-mail button on the Navigation Pane.
2. From the E-mail Center, click the Actions button and then set up
E-mail rules. The E-mail Rules Center appears.
3. Right-click in the left panel of the E-mail Rules Center and choose the
New icon, which is the leftmost local icon.
The E-mail Rules Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 17-13.
The E-mail Rule Wizard gives you the following options to choose from:
 Mail Field: Click to select the e-mail field that you want GoldMine to
search for a specified value. For example, if you want GoldMine to look
for a specified value that appears as the title of the e-mail, select
Subject.
 Logical Condition: Click to select a condition, such as Begins With. By
default, GoldMine displays Equal To.
 Value: Type the value for which you want GoldMine to search when eval-
uating the field that you selected in Mail Field.
Figure 17-13:

204
Part V: Managing Documents 

When you’re done setting up your new rule, click OK to enter the condition
in the Browse part of the Condition dialog box. To add another condition,
click the New button. To change a selected condition, click the Edit button.
When you’re done adding or editing rules, you can specify how GoldMine
should apply the rules by selecting either the All Of option or the Any Of
option.
When you’re done, click the Next button. The E-mail Rule Wizard: Action
dialog box appears. The actions you specify are executed only when the 
conditions you just defined are met.
Defining rule actions
After you have defined any condition that you want GoldMine to check for in
incoming messages, you can define the action or actions for GoldMine to
apply upon finding a message that meets the condition. Click the New button.
The E-mail Rule: Action dialog box appears, containing the following options:
 Action on Mail: Click to select the operation that you want GoldMine to
perform upon detecting a message with any specified condition, such as
the Move to Inbox option or the Delete Attachments option.
 Value: Provides additional information necessary for GoldMine to com-
plete the operation. For example, if you selected the Move to Inbox
option in the Action on Mail field, you can click to display a drop-down
list from which you can select the subfolder of your Inbox where you
want GoldMine to place the messages that meet any of the conditions.
The Value field is available only when needed to complete the action.
For example, if you select the Delete Attachments option in the Action
on Mail field, GoldMine needs no further information to process this
request, so the Value field is not available.
Click OK to enter the rule in the Browse section of the Action dialog box. To
add another action, click the New button. To change a selected action, click
the Edit button.
When you’re finished, click the Finish button. GoldMine adds the rule to the
selected rule set. The name of the rule appears in the left pane under the rule
set. Any selected conditions and actions of the rule set appear in the right
pane.
If you actually want your rules to work, you need to make sure that you’ve
told GoldMine to auto-retrieve your mail. You do this within your e-mail
options settings. And, of course, you need to leave your GoldMine system
running with an active Internet connection while you’re away.

irst, I have to go on record reminding you that GoldMine has its own
e-mail client. That’s my favorite way to send and receive e-mail and, for
the life of me, I don’t understand why anyone would actually want to compli-
cate life by adding Outlook to the mix. 
Okay, I do understand it a little. Many people were familiar with Outlook
long before they started using GoldMine and just don’t want to learn a new
system. Still, I just can’t see this as a good enough reason to insist on using
Outlook.
Because I have been losing this argument for seven or eight years now, it’s
time to include a chapter on how to use Outlook with GoldMine in case you
insist on doing so. 
What Versions Work Together
If you are looking for the simplest approach — just transferring records back
and forth from Outlook to GoldMine — then the chart in Figure 18-1 applies.
In this chart, C means the application has been fully tested and is supported;
NT means the application has not been tested and is not supported.
Figure 18-1:
Using
versions of
Outlook with
GoldMine.

If you are using GISMO, which is the most popular of the three methods, the
chart in Figure 18-2 applies.
The Three Options for Outlook 
Depending on the level of sophistication of your network and, of course, on
your requirements, there are three ways to connect GoldMine and Outlook.
This chapter focuses on the second method, GISMO, but at least knowing
about the other two is useful.
Importing and Exporting
GoldMine gives you the ability to simply export data from GoldMine into
Outlook. This is most appropriate as a one-time activity to populate Outlook
with your contact information from GoldMine or vice versa: send your
Outlook address book to GoldMine.

Part V: Managing Documents 

GISMO
GISMO, which is an acronym for GoldMine Integration Services for Microsoft
Outlook, is included (sort of) with GoldMine 8. It’s actually not on the CD you
get with your initial order, but you can download it via NetUpdate for free
after you’ve got GoldMine installed. Go figure.
With GISMO, you can
 Link both sent and received e-mails to a GoldMine contact
 Create a new contact and link the incoming e-mail to it
 Launch contacts in GoldMine
 Automatically link all the messages received from a particular e-mail
address to its corresponding GoldMine contact
 Access GoldMine contacts from the Outlook address book
GISME
GISME, short for GoldMine Integration Services for Microsoft Exchange
Server, is the most sophisticated of the integrations between GoldMine and
Outlook. It requires a Microsoft Exchange Server and gives your GISME users
access to shared calendar information.
GISME is not included with GoldMine Premium and needs to be purchased sepa-
rately. It also requires some in-depth technical expertise to properly implement.
Using GISMO
If you are already familiar with Outlook, then using GISMO shouldn’t stress
you very much at all. 
Before jumping in and processing your e-mail for the first time in GISMO, you
should set your preferences. To do so, choose Tools➪Options and then click
the GoldMine Link tab. The screen shown in Figure 18-3 appears; this figure
shows the way I have my preferences set.
209
Chapter 18: Using Outlook

When you “create the e-mail as a completed activity in GoldMine,” you are
really saying you want the e-mail logged in the History tab rather than the
Pending tab. I also recommend choosing all the auto-linking options, thus
having Outlook/GoldMine do as much of the work for you as possible. After
you save your settings by clicking OK on the screen shown in Figure 18-3,
you can move on to processing some e-mail.
You can see in Figure 18-4 that GISMO just adds an additional toolbar to Outlook.

Receiving e-mails in Outlook
The local toolbar in Figure 18-3 gives you all the tools you need. From left to
right, here’s what the buttons do and when to use them.
 Launch Contact Record in GoldMine: This button is important if
GoldMine isn’t open. Selecting this button opens GoldMine with the
appropriate contact record open (assuming that record exists). Of
course, because you will always have GoldMine open, you shouldn’t
need to use this button very often, or at all.
 Link Message to GoldMine Contact: This automatically links the email
message without forcing you to leave Outlook. In fact, you won’t even
see the GoldMine record, although if the record does not exist in
GoldMine, you will be asked whether you want to create the new record.
 Create a New GoldMine Contact and Link Message: If you already know
that the record doesn’t exist in GoldMine, this is a good option.
 Link All messages from This Sender: If you have multiple e-mails from
the same person, this option saves them all in one step.
 Unlink This Message from GoldMine: If you suddenly realize that you
just linked a confidential message to a contact record and have exposed
it to every user, you may want to unlink it with this option. 
 Re-link This message to GoldMine Contact: If the message has become
unglued, this option links the message to the contact you select.
 Auto-link All Messages to GoldMine Contact when Receiving E-Mails:
This is what makes GISMO do the most work for you, although actually
reading your e-mails before having the system just store them for you is
probably better.
 File This Message in GoldMine: This option saves the e-mail in
GoldMine but keeps you in Outlook.
 GoldMine Integration Service for Microsoft Outlook Help: This is the
place to go for immediate, context-sensitive help.
GISMO determines where the e-mail gets attached by the e-mail address on
the record. Don’t attempt to attach e-mails to a record that come from some-
one who is not part of the record unless you totally understand the
LINK/UNLINK concept in GoldMine.
211
Chapter 18: Using Outlook

Sending e-mails from Outlook
When you send an e-mail via Outlook, it is automatically linked to the
GoldMine record that contains that e-mail address. You have nothing manual
to do. However, you can avoid a lot of manual address entry into Outlook by
adding your GoldMine Address Book to Outlook before using Outlook to send
e-mails to contacts in GoldMine.
For Outlook 2000 users, the GoldMine Address Book is not available if your
Outlook is in “Internet Only” mode. To add your GoldMine Address Book to
Outlook, follow the steps below:
1. In Outlook, choose Tools➪E-mail Accounts.
The E-mail Accounts wizard appears.
2. Under Directory, select Add a new directory or address book.
3. Click Next.
The Directory or Address Book Type dialog box appears.
4. Select Additional Address Books.
5. Click Next.
The Other Address Book Types dialog box appears.
6. Select the GoldMine Address Book.
7. Click Next.
The GoldMine Integration Services for Microsoft Outlook information
dialog box appears. 
8. If the GoldMine Path text box is empty or incorrect, click Browse to
locate the correct gmw.exe file. 
9. Type your GoldMine Username and Password. 
10. Click Select and then OK.
11. Click OK to verify changes are applied the next time Outlook is run.
12. Click OK to save changes.
13. Exit and re-open Outlook.

Chapter 19
Linking Documents
In This Chapter
 Linking word-processing files and e-mails automatically
 Linking files and folders
 Accessing your linked documents
D
ocument links are a very powerful feature in GoldMine that allows you
to store any type of file with the contact record. Using document links,
along with the contact record, or even the service record, you can store
forms relating to the contact, incoming facsimiles, voice-mail messages, or
contract documents created with a word processor. When you need to view
or edit the linked file, GoldMine automatically loads both the application and
the file in one operation.
In this chapter, I explain what types of documents and files you can link to
contact records, demonstrate how to link documents and files, and show you
how to view your linked files. You also discover how to launch the application
that runs your linked file so that you can view the linked file quickly and
easily.
Exploring the Links Tab
The Links tab maintains the connections from the clients’ records to their
linked documents. When you click the Links tab, shown in Figure 19-1,
GoldMine displays each of that contact’s linked documents. The link to each
document shows the name of a file and the name of the application used to
edit or display the file.
The Links tab contains the following information:
 Document: Descriptive title of a document or folder that’s linked to 
the contact.
 Type: Document type that must match a registered application in the
Windows Registration Database.

 File: Filename and path of the linked file.
 Date: Date the file was linked to GoldMine. This date may be different
from the date the file was created or last modified. You can see the docu-
ment’s most recent modification date in Windows Explorer.
 Owner: Owner of the document or file, which is typically the user name
of the GoldMine user who created the document.
Each column can be sorted by clicking on the column header. Click again and
GoldMine sorts the opposite way. You can change the order in which the
columns appear by dragging and dropping the column headers. 
If you right-click a blank area in the Links tab, a shortcut menu enables you to
choose from the following options:
 Launch: Launches and loads the highlighted file and its application. This
option is the same as double-clicking the linked document entry in the
Links display.
 Move: Moves the highlighted file to a different location.
 E-Mail Document: Enables you to e-mail the highlighted file to a contact,
GoldMine User, User Group, Manual Recipient, or Outlook contact.
Figure 19-1:
A typical
view of the
Links tab.
214
Part V: Managing Documents 

 Find: Enables you to search the data associated with the link to the doc-
ument. This is used most often to locate documents with particular
words or phrases in their filename.
 Output To: Enables you to send the list of files under the Links tab to a
printer, Word, Excel, or the Windows Clipboard. This list includes all the
information found under the Links tab (Document, Type, File, Date, and
Owner) but not the information found in the actual files.
 New: Creates a new link.
 Delete: Deletes the highlighted link. The actual file is not deleted.
 Edit: Displays the Linked Document dialog box, in which you can edit
the highlighted link.
 Group: By choosing Group, you can click a column header and drag that
header into the gray bar above the column headers. That action then
groups your links by whatever header you choose.
 Summary: Doesn’t currently appear to do anything.
 Filter: Works in a way similar to Groups except that you click the down
arrow next to the column header that you want to sort by. For example,
you may want to see only Word document files. In that case, you select
Microsoft Word Document from the file type list, thereby activating a
filter for the Links tab of the entire contact set. As you go to other
records, only .doc files show.
215
Chapter 19: Linking Documents
The needle in the haystack
In my years of being in business B.G. (Before
GoldMine), I wrote many letters and proposals.
I would often mail a 15-page proposal and then
wait for the inevitable signed contract to arrive.
I now suspect that the arrival of those signed
contracts probably could have been expedited
and made a more regular occurrence if I had
followed up with a phone call. But without
GoldMine to remind me to make the calls, it
almost never happened — I relied on the innate
beauty of the proposal to pull me through.
An equally serious problem typically arose
about six months after I mailed a proposal — a
phone call from the prospective client. I would
pick up the phone and hear something like, “Hi,
this is Charlie at Universal. I want to go over that
proposal you just sent me.” My first problem
was trying to remember who Charlie was. If I did
remember him, I was still left with another issue:
What did I do with that proposal? Is it in the pile
on my desk, in the pile on the floor, or (I hope
not) in the circular file? “Charlie, I’ll call you
right back.”
GoldMine’s ability to keep track of documents
and files cured my disorganization. Well, maybe
not all of it, but I’m much better off now.
Whether it’s a 15-page proposal, a spreadsheet,
an e-mail, a fax, or a photo of the kids, GoldMine
can link the file to the appropriate contact
record. Locating any document that relates to
the client becomes a snap, so you won’t have to
call a client back after ransacking your office to
find a proposal.

Linking Files Automatically
Some of the more common file types, such as word-processing documents
and e-mails, link themselves automatically to records. Certain fax programs
also link automatically. Most other files require you to manually connect
them to the client record. (See “Manually Linking Files and Folders” later in
this chapter for more information.) In this section, you discover how
GoldMine automatically links files to a contact record.
Linking word-processing documents
Out of the box, GoldMine comes with links to various versions of Microsoft
Word. If you match the proper version of GoldMine with the correct linking
file and the correct version of Word, you can automatically link every docu-
ment you create to the Links tab. This process is actually easier than it
sounds.
When Word is initially installed, you must also install its links to GoldMine.
See Chapter 16 regarding setting up the Word link. If you don’t install it,
GoldMine can’t create mail merge documents for you. 
After the connection is made, creating Word documents starting from
GoldMine is easy, and linking them after they’re created is even easier. During
the linking procedure, Word creates several blank template documents, one
of which is BLANK.DOT. You can see it in the list of mail merge documents.
You access these documents by choosing Go To➪Document Templates from
GoldMine’s main menu. This takes you to the Document Management Center
window, as shown in Figure 19-2.
When you select Letter: Blank Letter, GoldMine shows you a Word template
document that starts creating a letter for you by filling in the salutation por-
tion of a typical letter you might write. You can fill in the actual text of the
letter and then save this letter using the Save As command. Make sure that
you don’t simply save the letter, because doing so overwrites the original
template. After you save the letter, Word automatically sends the file informa-
tion back to GoldMine.
GoldMine takes all the file information and lists it within the Links tab of the
active contact record for you. You don’t need to do anything, assuming that
you began this process from the Document Management Center window
within GoldMine. If you didn’t start from the Document Management Center
window, Word doesn’t send any linking information back to GoldMine, and
you have to manually link the document.
216
Part V: Managing Documents 

Linking e-mails
I discuss the details of sending and receiving e-mails in Chapters 17 and 18,
but basically, the GoldMine e-mail system is tightly integrated with contact
records through the History tab, not the Links tab. It’s as automated as the
Word link, but the results are a little different.
Outgoing e-mails
To automatically attach an outgoing e-mail to a contact record, you must
complete the following steps:
1. Find the record with which you’re associating the e-mail and display
it on-screen.
That record becomes the active record.
2. From the main menu, choose Go To and then Document Templates.
The Document Management Center appears.
3. Click the Create a New Mail Message icon on the local toolbar.
4. Compose the e-mail message and send it by clicking the Send icon on
the local toolbar.
Figure 19-2:
The
Document
Manage-
ment Center
window.
217
Chapter 19: Linking Documents

These outgoing e-mails, whether they have attached documents or not, are
automatically recorded in the History tab, not in the Links tab! If these outgo-
ing e-mails have attachments, you can access them by double-clicking the
e-mail message on the History tab.
Incoming e-mails
Incoming e-mails are automatically registered in the History tab, too. Any
incoming files attached to e-mails are recorded in the Links tab. The e-mail
system allows you a good bit of control over exactly which records are asso-
ciated with particular e-mails. Please refer to Chapter 17 for more details on
controlling incoming e-mails.
Linking faxes
You must have a third-party program in order to fax at all. Of the commonly
used ones, only one automatically records what it has done in the Links tab.
FaxRush (a.k.a. OmniRush) is the most tightly integrated fax system. When
properly configured, OmniRush automatically links all outgoing and incoming
fax activity for you. 
WinFax and ZetaFax, which also integrate with GoldMine and with Word, are
not quite so tightly integrated as to automatically record what they have
done in your GoldMine records. It is up to you to manually link or record
those files that these applications have sent or received. 
Manually Linking Files and Folders
You can manually link virtually any file to GoldMine. You can create docu-
ment links by using either the local (shortcut) menu on the Links tab of the
contact record or by dragging and dropping the file with an application that
supports file dragging, such as Windows Explorer.
Using the Links shortcut menu
To manually link a file using the local (shortcut) menu, follow these steps:
1. Click the Links tab on the contact record (the main GoldMine screen).
2. Right-click the mouse anywhere in the display area below the tab.
The Links shortcut menu appears, as shown in Figure 19-3.
3. Select New from the menu.
The Linked Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.
218
Part V: Managing Documents 

4. Enter a name in the Document Name text box that will make sense to
you six months from now.
5. Enter a user name in the Document Owner text box if it is someone
other than you.
Consider using Public as the Document Owner to make this file available
to everyone on your team.
6. Record the exact filename of the file using the Browse button at the
bottom of the Linked Document dialog box.

Chapter 19: Linking Documents

7. Select the Allow File to Synchronize check box if you want this file
included in a transfer set.
8. Click OK when you are finished, and your file is linked.
Using drag-and-drop
Using the drag-and-drop method is the quickest way to link a document to
GoldMine:
1. Click the document name in the application that supports drag-and-
drop (such as Windows Explorer) to highlight it.
2. Hold down the left mouse button, drag the file icon to the currently
open record (you don’t even need to have the Links tab selected), and
release the mouse button.
GoldMine displays the Linked Document dialog box.
3. Type the linked document name in the Document Name field.
In just three moves, you completely link almost any kind of file or document.
In no case have you moved the document itself. You merely established a
pointer from GoldMine to the document.
Accessing Linked Documents
When a document file is linked with GoldMine, you can launch directly into the
application and load the linked file with one operation. This means that you can
easily start Word or Excel and immediately display the linked file. To do this,
click the Links tab to access the list of linked files, and then double-click a file.
If you select a Word document, for example, GoldMine starts up Word (if it
isn’t already running in the background) and loads the document you have
requested. It does the same for Excel spreadsheets, or for that matter, for any
program that allows file access.
By linking all your client-related documents to the appropriate contact record,
you’re assured that you can always find those documents when you need them.
If you work on a network, always store your documents on a server accessi-
ble to all who may ever need to reference those documents. Even if others
won’t need to reference those documents, chances are that only your file
servers are being regularly backed up. And you probably want all your docu-
ments backed up. The take-home lesson is to save your documents in a stan-
dard, agreed-upon location that’s accessible to your team and that’s backed
up regularly.

T
he Knowledge Base is an intranet. It houses and orga-
nizes files and documents that are used in your daily
operations and directly integrates with the new Service
Center.
Managers worth their salt love graphs and statistics.
Sometimes, it’s hard to make decisions without them.
GoldMine provides a nice array of graphs, stats, and 
built-in reports. In addition, GoldMine provides the tools
to customize all these reports or to create new ones. You
can also use some third-party tools to get even more
sophisticated.
Complex sales require more complex tools to keep track
of what’s going on. That’s the Opportunity Manager. When
you successfully close a deal that you’ve been tracking in
the Opportunity Manager, you can use all that information
in the Project Manager to make sure that you come
through with everything you’ve promised.
The Relationships feature is the new Organizational Chart.
This is the perfect tool to see very graphically how each
person relates to others and how different accounts relate
to each other.

The Knowledge Base
In This Chapter
 Navigating through the Knowledge Base
 Creating new Knowledge Base sections
 Editing in the Knowledge Base
 Notifying your staff of important changes to the Knowledge Base 
T
he Knowledge Base is like an encyclopedia that you can develop for use
by your staff as well as for distributing information to clients and prospects.
In previous versions of GoldMine, the Knowledge Base was called the
InfoCenter. You can use the Knowledge Base to catalog your company’s
rules and regulations, make them available to every employee, and notify
staff of any changes to the rules and regulations. You can also stock the
Knowledge Base with product catalogs and price lists for easy maintenance
and distribution. And now with GoldMine 8, the Knowledge Base is integrated
with the new Service Center.
The Knowledge Base divides its information between two sections:
 Knowledge Base: Contains general information relevant to staff and
clients alike, such as company rules and product prices.
 Personal Base: Contains information pertinent to an individual user,
such as family birthdays and anniversaries.
The Knowledge Base and the Personal Base are structurally the same and
operate in the same way. Whereas only users with Master rights can control
access to the Knowledge Base, determining reading and writing access for
individual users, individuals can set up their own sections in their Personal
Base. The Personal Base is designed for use by an individual, and the only
way to access a Personal Base is to log on with the same user name as the
user who originally created that particular Personal Base. Also, whereas the
Knowledge Base is integrated with the Service Center, your Personal Base
is not.

This chapter explains how to navigate through the Knowledge Base to find
relevant information and how to create and post new entries. 
Navigating the Knowledge Base
You can easily access the Knowledge Base from the main menu by choosing
Go To➪Knowledge Base. The Knowledge Base window, shown in Figure 20-1,
appears.
As you can see in Figure 20-1, the Knowledge Base window contains two tabs:
the Knowledge Base and the Personal Base. The Knowledge Base and the
Personal Base tabs are functionally the same, so this chapter focuses just on
the Knowledge Base.

Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Understanding how the Knowledge 
Base is organized
The left pane in Figure 20-1, which by default shows the Knowledge Base tab
when you open the Knowledge Base, categorizes all the information in the
Knowledge Base into books, sections, and topics. A book is the most general
grouping. Each book contains one or more sections. Sections, in turn, may
contain one or more topics, or may themselves house information directly. If
sections contain topics, then topics are where data is actually stored.
Below the Knowledge Base section (refer to Figure 20-1) is the Personal Base
section. Again, the Personal Base is structurally identical to the Knowledge
Base; the only difference being the access rights.
When you first install GoldMine, two books exist — Topic Scripts and
Welcome to GoldMine. Each of these books is further divided into sections.
You can see this structure simply by double-clicking one of the book icons, as
shown in Figure 20-2. As soon as you open a book, the icon changes from a
closed book symbol to an open book symbol.

Chapter 20: The Knowledge Base

Searching the Knowledge Base
As you begin expanding your Knowledge Base, finding any particular item
within the Knowledge Base can become challenging. Fortunately, a search
tool exists that can help. The Search icon on the local Knowledge Base
toolbar allows you to search for keywords or phrases that may be in some
folder or topic in the Knowledge Base. Clicking this icon brings you to the
Search dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-3.
In the Search For field, you can either type the keyword or phrase you want
to search for, or you can select a previously searched-for item from the drop-
down list.
In the Search Scope section, you can specify the range of entries that you
want GoldMine to search. You have the following choices:
 Knowledge Base: Searches through every book, section, and topic in the
Knowledge Base for the term you entered in the Search For field. This is
often a good choice unless you have so much material in your
Knowledge Base that a full search takes a long time.
 Welcome to GoldMine: This is a context-sensitive choice and searches
just the book, folder, or topic you currently have highlighted in the left
pane of the Knowledge Base window. In the example shown in Figure
20-3, Welcome to GoldMine is highlighted, so the option shows up as
Welcome to GoldMine.
 Last Pages Found: Searches only the pages that were identified by the
last search you performed. This function allows you to drill down to find
further detail.
The following options allow you to determine how closely a phrase must be
matched during the search:
Figure 20-3:
Enter a term
you want 
to search 
for in the

Base
Search
dialog box.
226
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

 Match Whole Words Only: Considers the term in the Search For field as
a unit, so an exact match must be made to the entire value. In other
words, if you enter “Joe” as the term you want to look for, and “Joel”
exists in one of the topics, then “Joel” won’t show up as a match.
 Match Case: The exact upper- and lowercase letters must match
between your phrase and those phrases found in the Knowledge Base. If
you turn on this option, “Sun” will not match with “sun.”
In the Search Area section, you can identify which areas of the Knowledge
Base to search for potential matches. Your choices are
 Keywords
 Topic Name
 Folder Name
 File Names (of attached files)
 Topic Text
After you specify your search criteria, you can begin the search by clicking
the Search button at the bottom of the Search dialog box. Figure 20-4 shows
the results of a search for any book, folder, or topic containing the word
e-mail. To continue searching for a second, third, or further match, click the
Search Next icon, which continuously moves through the text looking for
additional matches.

Creating New Knowledge Base Books,
Folders, and Topics
You can set up a virtually unlimited range of material in your Knowledge
Base. I have found it particularly useful for housing my company’s employee
handbook. Other useful topics include such things as product catalogs, price
lists, and competitive information. Now that the Knowledge Base is inte-
grated with the Service Center, you should consider stocking the Knowledge
Base with product information that will be helpful to your customer service
people and to your customers.
Creating a Knowledge Base book
The following procedure illustrates how to create a new book in the
Knowledge Base. The procedure for creating books, folders, and topics is 
the same in both the Knowledge Base and the Personal Base, except that 
you don’t need to be concerned with access rights in the Personal Base.
1. From the Knowledge Base local menu, click the New Book icon (the
leftmost icon).
A temporary name, New Book, appears within brackets.
2. Type over <New Book> with the actual title of the new book you are
creating and press Enter to save your new title.
If you’re creating a handbook of company rules, you might call it some-
thing clever like Company Rules.
After you have a new book, you can add folders and topic pages. You can
create a folder or a topic page by following these steps:
1. Highlight the book in the left pane of the Knowledge Base and then
right-click it.
2. Choose New from the shortcut menu.
Choose book, folder, or page. Figure 20-5 illustrates this.
3. Enter your new text in the right pane.
4. When you’re done typing, click the leftmost local icon (Save) to save
this new text in the Knowledge Base.
228
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

After you create a topic page, you have three methods of getting information
into it. You can
 Type the information directly into the right pane of the Knowledge Base.
 Paste a document from another source, such as your word processor.
 Attach an existing file of any type, such as a text file, data file, picture,
and so on.
Here’s a clever idea. Because the Knowledge Base can house virtually any
kind of file, including a WAV file, you can record someone talking about a
solution to a particular problem. And, in fact, you can make these recordings
in multiple languages. Because the Knowledge Base is now integrated with
the Service Center, a recording can then be sent to a non-English speaking
customer!
Editing entries in your Knowledge Base
Editing a topic in the Knowledge Base is easy. Highlight the folder or topic
page in the left pane of the Knowledge Base. In the right pane, you see the
actual text, to which you can make necessary edits.

Chapter 20: The Knowledge Base

Notifying Your Staff of Important
Changes to the Knowledge Base — 
or Not
Back in the days of the InfoCenter, a What’s New feature existed that allowed
you to have each user automatically notified when you entered a new and
important entry into the InfoCenter. Sadly, that feature has not found its way

oldMine has a substantial amount of graphical and statistical analysis
capability built into it. Using this analysis capability, you can focus on
one individual account, a group of accounts, on a GoldMine user, or on a
group of users.
If you’re a sole practitioner using GoldMine by yourself, you can use these
analysis tools to monitor your performance and to keep yourself on target.
Resist the urge to check your stats only when you think you’re doing well.
Use the tool the same way a manager might. Check consistently, and make
mid-course corrections whenever needed.
If you’re a manager, resist the urge to use the analysis tools in a Big Brother
type of way. Use them to help your staff achieve goals. Your team probably
wants to achieve its goals as much as you do. Don’t ask, “When are you going
to close that deal?” Instead, you should ask, “What can I do to help you with
this opportunity?”
In this chapter, you find out how to get those statistics to help you chart
your course.
Displaying Account Statistics
Using GoldMine, you can track a variety of up-to-date statistics for any con-
tact in your database. To access this statistical data, follow these steps:

1. Open a contact record and then click the History tab.
2. Right-click in the display area and choose Options from the shortcut
menu.
3. Choose Analyze from the next menu that appears.
The Contact Record Statistics dialog box, shown in Figure 21-1, appears,
giving you information such as the amount of time you’re dedicating to
the contact and the amount of sales generated by the account.
The Contact Record Statistics dialog box displays important information
about the contact, grouped into the following categories:
 Summary: Displays the number of additional contact records, detail
records, and referral records; information about the creation and
updates to the record.
 Scheduled Activities: Shows the number of appointments, calls, fore-
casted sales, next actions, and other actions currently scheduled for the
account.
 Completed Activities: Lists the number of appointments, sales, forms,
and other actions that have been completed for the account.
 Sales Analysis: Displays the total dollar amount spent by this account
over the past 30 days, 90 days, and 12 months; the total amount the
account has purchased; the average sale amount; and how much is cur-
rently forecasted for the account.
 Phone Calls Analysis: Shows a breakdown, by number and total dura-
tion, for each type of phone call to and from this account.

Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Lying with Statistics
The Statistical Analysis of Completed Activities dialog box displays com-
pleted activity information for an individual user, a group of users, or on a
system-wide basis. Analyzing completed activities can provide useful
insight into your performance or into the performance of others in your
organization.
You can access the Statistical Analysis of Completed Activities dialog box,
as shown in Figure 21-2, from the main menu by choosing Go
To➪Analysis➪Statistical Analysis.
The Statistical Analysis of Completed Activities dialog box contains the fol-
lowing options:
 Select User(s): Click the Select User(s) button to display the Select Users
dialog box, from which you can pick GoldMine users for activity analy-
sis. The list box above the button displays the users who will be
included in the analysis; your user name is displayed by default.
 From Date: Sets the first date of the period to be included in the analysis.
 To Date: Sets the last date of the period to be included in the analysis.
 Activity Cd: Enter an activity code into this field, and GoldMine includes
in the analysis only those completed activities that have the activity
code you specify. When the field is left blank, GoldMine includes all com-
pleted activities.
Figure 21-2:
Viewing
completed
activities.
233
Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

If you code your activities as billable versus nonbillable, you could enter
the activity code for billable activities here and get an analysis of these
activities only.
 Result Cd: Enter a result code into this field, and GoldMine includes in the
analysis only those completed activities you specify by the result code.
When the field is left blank, GoldMine includes all completed activities.
 Phone Calls Analysis: Shows the total number of completed telephone
calls of the specified type in the history file. Call-backs, outgoing calls,
incoming calls, and returned messages are listed, as well as the total
duration of calls in each category. GoldMine displays the average duration
of calls below the total line for this section. Successful Calls shows the
number and percentage of calls with a satisfactory outcome, whereas
Unsuccessful calls are those calls that were not answered at all.
Unsuccessful outcomes (such as lost the sale or they told me to buzz off)
should be recorded through the result code. When you mark a call as
Unsuccessful, GoldMine labels that call Attempted in the Summary
tab, as opposed to Last Contact. You might want to consider using
Unsuccessful to indicate that you failed to connect with the person
related to the scheduled activity.
 Activities Analysis: Lists the total number of completed activities in the
history file, including to-do actions, sales, received messages, appoint-
ments, and other actions.
 Sales Analysis: Displays the completed sales statistics. Closed Sales
shows the total number of closed sales activities in the history file. The
totals are displayed on the right. Look at % of Calls Closed to compare
the number of completed sales as a percentage of completed call activi-
ties. The average sales value per completed call activity is also displayed.
 Analyze: Recalculates the totals in the display. Until you click this button,
your analysis window remains blank. After clicking the Analyze button
once, the Print button appears, which enables you to print this window.
After you select Analyze, GoldMine presents you with a Print button that
allows you to print out the results of this statistical analysis. This print
option also applies to the forecast analysis, discussed in the next section.
Using the Forecast Analysis
The forecast analysis is different than the sales analysis. Although sales
analysis contains information on quotas, forecasted sales, and completed
sales, the forecast analysis focuses on just those opportunities that have
not yet closed.
To access the Forecasted Sales Analysis dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-3,
choose Go To➪Analysis➪Forecast Analysis. This dialog box provides the
234
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

following information about projected sales or cash flows for individuals,
groups of individuals, or the entire organization:
 Analyze Users: Lists the users who will be included in the analysis; your
user name is selected by default. To add or change the analyzed users,
click the Select User(s) button.
 Period: Shows forecasted sales statistics divided into several periods.
The top portion of the analysis window shows forecasted sales statistics
by week for the next four weeks. Total amounts for the four-week period
are displayed below the weekly section.
Below the weekly section, forecasted sales for the next four months are
broken down by month. The Beyond line includes all forecasted sales
scheduled to close after the next four months. Grand totals for the lower
section are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
 # of Sales: Displays the total number of forecasted sales activities sched-
uled on the calendar for the period.
 Forecasted: Presents the total dollar amount of sales scheduled on the
calendar for the period.
 % Prob.: Unveils the average probability that a sale will close in this
period. This value is calculated by averaging the values entered in the
Probability field for all the Forecasted Sales activities scheduled in the
period.
 Potential: Lists the expected value (or weighted value) of sales that will
be closed in this period. This value is determined by multiplying the
total forecasted sales amount (Forecasted) by the average close proba-
bility (% Prob.).
 Select User(s): Click this button to display the Select Users dialog box,
from which you can select GoldMine users for activity analysis.
Figure 21-3:

Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

 Code: Displays forecasted sales that have the entered activity code. You
can use wild cards to select multiple activity codes. By default, this field
is blank, and the resulting analysis includes all activity codes.
 Analyze: Click this button to calculate the totals in the display.
Using Graphical Analysis
If you prefer graphs to columns of numbers, then graphical analysis is for
you. The GoldMine graphical analysis tool generates summary graphs of user
activity data based on a variety of criteria. You can display your data as a bar
graph or a line graph. GoldMine can represent all activity for a defined period
of time, or one of several defined types of activity. Graphs can also represent
total activities, a comparison of all users, or selected users.
To generate a graph, from the main menu choose Go To➪Analysis➪Graphical
Analysis. The Graphical Analysis Options dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 21-4.
The Graphical Analysis Options dialog box contains options that determine
the time range and activities to be included in the graph:
 Completed: Displays completed activities in the graph.
 Scheduled: Shows scheduled activities in the graph.
 Totals: Charts together activity data for all specified users on the graph.
 Comparison: Graphs activity data for individual users as specified.
Figure 21-4:

236
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

 Bar Graph: Generates a bar graph. Bar graphs are generally used to
compare different periods or users.
 Line Graph: Creates a line graph. Line graphs are generally used to
show trends over time.
 Select User(s): Click the Select User(s) button to access a list of users. If
the Comparison option is selected under Graph Type and more than one
user is selected, data for these users will be displayed on one graph with
color-coded entries to differentiate between users.
 All Activities: Displays scheduled or completed data for all activity
types in the graph.
 Call Backs: Generates a graph for either completed or scheduled call
backs, depending on whether Completed or Scheduled is selected under
Graph Type.
 Messages: Churns out a graph for either completed or scheduled mes-
sages, depending on whether Completed or Scheduled is selected under
Graph Type.
 Next Actions: Creates a graph for either completed or scheduled next
actions, depending on whether Completed or Scheduled is selected
under Graph Type.
 Appointments: Generates a graph for either completed or scheduled
appointments, depending on whether Completed or Scheduled is
selected under Graph Type.
 Sales: Shows a graph for either completed or scheduled sales, depend-
ing on whether Completed or Scheduled is selected under Graph Type.
 Others: Displays a graph for either completed or scheduled other
actions, depending on whether Completed or Scheduled is selected
under Graph Type.
 Time Span: Allows you to specify a time range for your graph. Selecting
the Hourly option provides a full day’s worth of hourly data, starting at
the beginning of the time period specified. The Daily option gives you
about 10 days of data. The Weekly option provides about three months
of data graphically.
 High End: Type a numeric value that corresponds to the uppermost
number you want displayed on the vertical axis of the graph. For
example, if experience shows that users rarely schedule more than 
30 appointments per week, entering 30 in the High End field generates
a graph with a vertical axis that ends at 30. The default, zero (0), allows
GoldMine to generate the high-end value based on included data.
 Low End: Type a numeric value that corresponds to the smallest
number you want displayed on the vertical axis of the graph. For exam-
ple, if experience shows that users have never scheduled fewer than five
call backs per week, entering 5 in the Low End field generates a graph
with a vertical axis that starts at 5. The default is zero (0).
237
Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

 Activity Cd: Generates the graph from activity records with the speci-
fied activity code. You can use wild cards to select multiple activity
codes. By default, this field is blank, and the generated graph includes
all activity codes.
 Result Cd: Type a result code to be used as the basis for graph data.
Only activity records with this result code will be included in the graph.
You can use wild cards to select multiple result codes. The default value
for this field is blank, and all result codes will show up in the generated
graph. This field is available only if you select Completed for Graph Type.
 From Date: Enter the beginning date from which data will be graphed.
The default is the current date. This field is available only for a graph of
completed activities; the ending date for scheduled activity graphs is
always the current date.
 To Date: Enter the ending date to which data will be graphed. The
default is the current date. This field is available only for a graph of
scheduled activities; the beginning date for completed activity graphs
is always the current date.
 From Time: Place the beginning time of a range you want to include in
the graph. The default is 12:00 a.m. When combined with the default To
Time entry of 12:00 a.m., the graph will display data for a 24-hour period.
This field is not available when generating hourly graphs for completed
activities.
 To Time: Place the ending time of a range you want to include in the
graph. The default is 12:00 a.m. When combined with the default From
Time entry of 12:00 a.m., the graph will display data for a 24-hour period.
This field is not available when generating hourly graphs for scheduled
activities.
 Show Grid: Displays lines that represent the horizontal axis of the graph
(default). To generate a graph without this grid, remove the check from
the check box.
 Graphs: Click the Graphs button, and GoldMine generates a bar graph or
line graph based on your selections in the Graphical Analysis Options
dialog box.
Using Leads Analysis
If you ever wondered what that Source field on the main screen is really for,
read on; you find out in this section.
GoldMine enables you to track valuable information on the current status of
sales efforts and on the effectiveness of various advertising and promotional
efforts in generating inquiries and sales. Employed in this way, GoldMine
238
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

becomes a strategic asset. GoldMine can provide timely and accurate infor-
mation to help managers make better decisions on deploying their resources.
You can use the Source field to determine the profitability of individual mar-
keting campaigns or groups of campaigns. GoldMine can report the total
number of leads generated from each seminar, advertisement, or trade show
from each Source value, the total sales volume generated from each Source
value, and the potential sales pending from each Source value. You can then
easily identify the most effective lead sources in terms of total leads or total
sales volume generated.
Further, if you also know the cost of each lead, you can calculate the profit
for each lead, easily locating the most profitable lead source. For example, if
this lead source is an advertisement, you have an excellent tool that helps
you determine whether to run that ad again.
When the analysis is complete, the Leads Analysis dialog box contains one
record entry for each unique value found in the selected field in the contact
database. These records appear in the Source column.
To generate a leads analysis, from the main menu choose Go
To➪Analysis➪Leads Analysis. The Leads Analysis dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 21-5.
The Leads Analysis dialog box contains the following fields, each of which
controls a portion of the analysis you can get:
 File Description: Profile name of the currently open leads analysis file,
followed by the filename (in parentheses). You can select a different
leads analysis from the drop-down list. 
Figure 21-5:
The Leads
Analysis
dialog box.
239
Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

 Maintain: Click the Maintain button to display the Open Leads Analysis
File dialog box, from which you can add, modify, or delete a leads analy-
sis. GoldMine does not automatically create Analysis files, so you need
to use the Maintain function to create a new Analysis file for each differ-
ent analysis you want.
 Source: Name of the lead source, such as LAN Magazine. This entry
appears in the Source field of the contact record.
 Leads: Total number of accounts in the database with this value in the
selected field.
 Closed: Total number of accounts with this source that have at least one
purchase, as recognized by the presence of a sales activity record in the
history file.
 Ratio: Percentage of closed sales based on number of leads.
 Sales: Total dollar amount of sales generated by this lead source. This
value is calculated by summing up all sales activity history records
linked to the accounts with this source.
 Potential: Total dollar amount of future sales activities scheduled on the
Calendar. This value is calculated by summing up all the Forecasted
Sales records linked to the accounts with this source.
The Leads Analysis dialog box also contains the following additional options:
 Find Source: Moves through the Source entries to position the list at the
first record that starts with the specified letter. For example, type C to
select the first Source that starts with the letter C, such as Comdex.
 Analyze: Click the Analyze button to regenerate the leads analysis infor-
mation for the current leads analysis database. You must select the field
on which to base the analysis and the range of dates to be scanned for
calculation of statistics. If you don’t click this button, no analysis is per-
formed.
 Sort: Click the Sort button to display the Leads Analysis Sort Menu
dialog box, from which you can select the ordering of the records in the
Leads Analysis dialog box.
 Zoom: Click the Zoom button to see more detailed information about the
highlighted leads analysis record in the Leads Analysis Zoom dialog box.
Setting Quotas and Measuring
Performance against Them
The sales analysis section of GoldMine can be independent of setting quotas
but is much more meaningful if quotas or guidelines are set up ahead of time.
240
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Whether you are a one-person operation or a multinational conglomerate,
you should always be setting performance goals, standards, and quotas. In
my company, toward the end of each year, I sit down and develop a game
plan for the coming year. That includes some strategic analysis and planning,
detailing the expected expenses for my company, and then setting sales goals
with the idea of bringing in sufficient revenue to handle all those expenses.
GoldMine’s quota analysis is a big part of that effort. By setting each sales-
person’s goals (quotas) for each product line, you can decide whether your
goals are reasonable and obtainable. Then, by comparing your forecasted
and completed sales against that quota, you can make midstream adjust-
ments as needed.
Assigning a quota
To assign a quota to a user, follow these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Go To➪Analysis➪Quota Analysis.
The Quota Listing dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-6.
2. To develop a new quota, click the New button.
The Assign New Quota dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 21-7.
Figure 21-6:
Viewing
your quota in
the Quota
Listing
dialog box.
241
Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

The dialog box for assigning a quota, contains the following information
and options:
• User: By default, GoldMine displays the name of the currently
logged-on user. To choose a different user, click the down arrow
to the right of the User field. The name of the selected salesperson
appears in the User column of the Quota Listing dialog box.
• From Date: Starting date of the quota period. By default, GoldMine
displays the first day of the current month.
• To Date: Ending date of the quota period. By default, GoldMine dis-
plays the last day of the current month.
• Quota: Dollar amount of sales that the salesperson is expected to
make during the quota period.
• Forecast: Displays the total dollar amount of forecasted sales
scheduled on the calendar for the period. This entry changes as
the salesperson schedules sales he expects to close during the
quota period.
• Closed Sales: Displays the total dollar amount of sales completed
successfully during the quota period. This entry changes as the
salesperson completes sales during the quota period.
• Lost Sales: Displays the total dollar amount of sales that are
completed as lost or unsuccessful during the quota period. An
uncompleted sale is neither closed nor lost and remains in the
Forecast field.
• Goals & Objectives: You can store up to 32,000 characters of infor-
mation related to the quota.
Figure 21-7:
Assign
quotas to a
user in the
Assign New
Quota dialog
box.
242
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

3. When you finish entering information, click OK to leave the Quota
Profile dialog box.
Doing so adds the new or updated quota entry to the Quota Listing. To
edit a previously defined quota, right-click the quota listing and choose
Edit from the shortcut menu.
The Quota Profile dialog box has a Recurring tab, as shown in Figure 21-8.
The recurring feature makes it easy to create quotas for daily, weekly, or
monthly sales. You enter one period’s quota and then immediately click the
Recurring tab. From this tab, you specify the rate at which the quota should
increase (or even decrease), as well as the period over which this should
occur. Before version 6.0, you had to manually enter each month’s quota.
Now you can do many in one fell swoop.
Analyzing sales versus quota
As soon as your quotas are established and entered, you can check your
progress against these quotas. For this process to work at all, you must 
be forecasting and completing all your sales (discussed in Chapter 12).
Assuming that you are religiously doing this, go to the main menu and 
follow these steps:
1. Choose Go To➪Analysis➪Sales Analysis to view the Sales Analysis
dialog box, as shown in Figure 21-9.
Figure 21-8:

Chapter 21: Graphical and Statistical Analysis

The Sales Analysis and the Select Users dialog boxes appear. Select at
least one user’s name in the Select Users dialog box.
2. Select individual users, multiple users, or groups by highlighting an
entry in either the User List or the Group List and double-clicking.
3. When you have chosen all the users you want, click OK.
The Select Users dialog box disappears, leaving you with a blank Sales
Analysis dialog box. It is blank because you have not yet asked it to do
any analysis. Before asking for your analysis, make sure that the range
of dates in the lower-left corner is correct. You may also want to enter
a particular activity code or result code if you want to analyze just those
types of sales. If you leave the Activity Code and Result Code fields
empty, GoldMine uses all sales activity within the date range you picked.
4. When you are satisfied with the dates and other codes, click the
Analyze button.
You then see the resulting analysis. Figure 21-10 shows an example.
According to this example, I’m not doing too well at sales. (Not to
worry; it’s not real data).

G
oldMine comes with 101 reports already developed for your immediate
use. As of the June 2007 release, no Service-related reports are included.
The 101 reports are divided into six report categories, so you can more easily
find the one you are looking for. In this chapter, I show you how to generate,
view, and print a GoldMine report.
Although GoldMine provides a report for almost every purpose, you may still
need to modify an existing one or even create one from scratch. Thus,
GoldMine provides the ability to revise any existing report or to develop new
reports from scratch. In this chapter, you also discover how to build a cus-
tomized report.
If the built-in report generator proves too limiting (and there’s a good chance
it might), a number of very good third-party, report-generating utilities exist
that work directly with GoldMine files. I also discuss a few of these third-
party utilities in this chapter.
Choosing a Report Category
GoldMine generates six different categories of reports. Each category enables
you to construct a report containing specific information. The following list
details the six report categories and the information each one contains:

246
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 
 Contact Reports: Print contact and activity data to meet a variety of
needs, such as phone lists and completed activity logs.
 Calendar Printouts: Print scheduled activity data in graphical formats,
such as monthly calendars.
 Service Reports: None exist yet.
 Analysis Reports: Print statistical information similar to the analyses
available from the View menu, such as phone-call statistics and quota
analyses.
 Labels and Envelopes: Print selected data in formats that conform to
various Avery label types and envelope dimensions.
 Other Reports: Present a variety of useful information, such as organiz-
ing information from your personal rotary file entries and a listing of
available merge forms.
Generating a GoldMine Report
In this section, I show you how to generate a GoldMine report. To create your
report, you must do the following:
 Select the type of report you want to create.
 Specify the order in which you want your data organized.
 Choose the actual data you want to include in your report.
Choosing the report type
From the Toolbar, choose the Reports button. This brings you to the Reports
Center. The left panel has a folder called GoldMine Reports, which you can
expand to show all the report categories, as shown in Figure 22-1. In this
example, you see the Analysis reports that come with GoldMine. Select the
report you want by clicking it.
The next step in creating a report is to select and sort the information each
report requires. See the next section for more details.
Sorting and selecting data for your reports
Contrary to popular belief, sorting and selecting are not the same thing.
Sorting a report means that the items on the report are alphabetized or, per-
haps, listed numerically. Selecting involves specifying a subset of all your
data — for example, only the accounts in California, or only those accounts

that are on credit hold. You may very well need to select a portion of your
database for your report and specify sorting criteria as well.
Sorting report data
When you prepare a report, typically you want to control the order in which
data is shown; that is, you want to list data in a sequence that makes the
information clear and meaningful. Sorting allows you to arrange data in a
specified order by one or more fields. GoldMine provides up to three levels
(primary, secondary, and tertiary) by which each report can be sorted. For
example, if you select the Company field as the first sort field, all the records
listed in the report will be ordered alphabetically by company name.
The Sorts option is available for only Contact Reports, Analysis Reports,
Service Reports, Labels and Envelopes, and Other Reports. This option is not
available for Calendar Printouts.
With many canned reports, if you change the sort field, the report does not
work without many other changes. If you’re a GoldMine rookie, I suggest that
you not change the sort option on a canned report without training or a real
knowledge of database report writing.
Because GoldMine allows three levels of sorting, you can also select a sec-
ondary sort order if the Company field is the same for two or more records.
For example, if you select the Company field as the primary sort, and the
secondary sort is the Last Name field, then the records will be ordered 
by company name in the report. However, when two records have the same
company name, they will be further ordered alphabetically by last name.
When a field is selected for tertiary sort, the records are ordered by the third
sort field only when the first- and second-level sort fields are identical. For
example, if the first- and second-level sorts are the State and City fields, and
the third-level sort is the Zip field, then records will be ordered by ZIP code
only when two or more records share the same state and city.
Without a second- or third-level sort, records in the report are ordered by
date and time of entry in the database when the first-level sort is the same
over several records. Listing records by the order in which they were entered
is known as the natural order of records.
When selecting the sort order for your report, keep in mind that GoldMine
queries the database in the most efficient way. If you select a multilevel sort,
or a single-level sort with a field that’s not already indexed, GoldMine builds a
report sort table. This additional step allows other users to access GoldMine
data while the report prints, and it speeds the printing process.
To sort records in a GoldMine report, click the Sorts button on the Reports
Menu dialog box. The Report Sorting dialog box appears, as shown in Figure
22-2, which shows the specific report highlighted in the right pane, the cursor
pointing to the Sorts icon, and the resulting dialog box.

Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Use the following options to specify your sort:
 Primary Sort: Specifies the first set of parameters for ordering records.
To complete the sort definition, select the Sort Database and Field Name
by which you want GoldMine to order records in the report. To specify a
range of records, specify a value in the Start At and/or End At fields.
Every GoldMine report must have at least a primary sort defined to
operate properly, even if no sorting is required. To preclude any sorting,
set the Sort Database option to (none).
If the Primary Sort option is defined as (none), the data preparation
entry dims, indicating that GoldMine will sort records by the natural
order of record entry.
 Secondary Sort: Specifies the second set of parameters for ordering
records. To complete the sort definition, select the database and the
field by which you want GoldMine to sort records. To specify a range of
records, specify a value in the Start At and/or End At fields.
You must define a first-level sort before you can define a second-level
sort. If you want a report with only one sort level, define the first-level
sort only.
 Tertiary Sort: Specifies the third set of parameters for ordering records.
To complete the sort definition, select the database and the field by
which you want GoldMine to sort records. To specify a range of records,
specify a value in the Start At and/or End At fields.
You must define a second-level sort before you can define a third-level
sort. If you want a report with only two sort levels, define the first-level
sort and the second-level sort only.
 Sort Database: Selects the contact database that contains the field on
which records will be sorted for the selected sort level — that is, pri-
mary sort, secondary sort, or tertiary sort. The selected database
appears to the right of the sort level.
To display a list of contact databases, click the arrow to the right of
the field.
 Field Name: Selects the field on which records will be sorted for the
selected sort level. The selected field appears to the right of the sort
level and the contact database name. To display a list of contact data-
bases, click the arrow to the right of the field.
 Start At: Specifies the beginning value of a range that defines how the
selected sort level will order records. If the Start At and the End At
fields are blank, (all) appears to the right of the sort level database 
and field, and all records will be sorted in ascending order. For example,
Primary Sort: Contact1->Lastname (all) indicates that the
first-level sort will order all records by the Lastname field of the database
in alphabetical order.
249
Chapter 22: The Reporting System

You can enter a value in the Start At field alone to define a range; that is,
without entering a value in the End At field, to specify a beginning point
from which you want GoldMine to select and order records. The result-
ing report will include and order records from the specified starting
point to the implied end of the range. For example, if the Start At field
contains 06/11/07, the report will order records by the selected field
from June 11, 2007, to the current date.
 End At: Specifies the ending value of a range that defines how the
selected sort level will order records. If the Start At and the End At fields
are blank, (all) appears to the right of the sort level database and field,
and all records will be sorted in ascending order.
You can use the End At field alone to define a range; that is, without
entering a value in the Start At field, to specify an ending point to which
you want GoldMine to select and order records. The resulting report will
include and order records from the earliest or smallest value through
the value entered in the End At field. For example, if the End At field con-
tains M, the report will order records by the selected field from the
beginning of the alphabet through records with field entries that start
with M.
 Save as Defaults: Saves the sort settings for future printings. If you want
to apply the sort settings to the currently generated report only, do not
click this button.
Playing with report specifications can be hazardous to the health of the origi-
nal report. You should not generally try any major modification unless you
are sure you have a backup of your files. That’s one thing that cloning is good
for. To clone a report, just right-click the report you want to alter and choose
Clone. Give it a new description and filename and you’ll be okay if you mess
up the original report.
When you finish choosing your sort options, click OK.
Selecting data for a Contact, a Service, an Analysis, 
or a Labels and Envelopes report
Five of the six report categories allow you to select further options before
printing. After you choose how you want your data sorted, select the data
you want to include in a Contact, an Analysis, Other Reports, or a Labels and
Envelopes report. In the Reports Menu dialog box, highlight the report you
want to set data options for and click the Options button. The Contact
Record Options dialog box appears.
The Contact Report Options dialog box, shown in Figure 22-3, is divided into
three sections. Each section contains options that you use to control which
data appears in the report.
250
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

 History Data: This section enables you to include activity data from his-
tory records (completed activities), as well as the date, time, and user
who created the history record, and any reference information associ-
ated with the record. Select one or more types of data by checking the
appropriate boxes in the dialog box (see Figure 22-3). In other words, if
you want appointments included in your report, check that option. You
can check multiple activity types.
You can also select the individual user who created history records, 
or you can select all users. You can also specify a range of dates as
well as an Activity (Actv) code and a Result code.
If an Actv code and a Result code have been entered, the two codes
work as an AND condition to include events that have been assigned
both to the specified Actv code and to the Result code. If no code is
specified, GoldMine includes data with all activity codes.
 Calendar Data: The Calendar Data section, on the right side of the
dialog box shown in Figure 22-3, allows you to select which kinds of
scheduled activities to include in your report. You can check off as many
activity types as you like, in the same way as you can in the History Data
section.
The User and Date fields function in the same way here as in the History
Data section. So does the Activity (Actv) field, but there is no Result
field. That’s because scheduled activities have not yet been completed,
so they don’t have a Result code associated with them.
Figure 22-3:
The Contact
Report
Options
dialog box.
251
Chapter 22: The Reporting System

If no items are checked under Calendar Data or no data exists for any of
the checked data types, GoldMine suppresses the scheduled activities
from the report and continues with the next section for which data is
available.
 Linked Data: The Linked Data section, at the bottom of the Contact
Report Options dialog box, allows you to choose what types of addi-
tional data to include on the report. Each of these warrants a little fur-
ther definition.
• Other Contacts: Includes data about individuals entered as addi-
tional contacts for the contact records, including additional con-
tact name, title, telephone number, and any reference data
associated with the additional contact.
• Document Links: Includes documents linked to the contact
records and provides information about the document, such as the
creating application, the user who created the document, and the
path and filename of the document.
• Details: Includes detail information linked to the contact records,
such as birthday, and provides data about the Detail record, any
reference data associated with the Detail record, and the date it
was created.
• Referrals: Includes referral information linked to the contact
records, such as the source of the referral (of:), to whom the
referral was made (to:), and any reference data associated 
with the referral.
• Organizations: Includes Org Chart information linked to the 
contact records.
Displaying and Printing Reports
The local toolbar in the Reports Center (refer to Figure 22-1) has a Print
Report icon. From the dialog box this displays (see Figure 22-4) you can spec-
ify where to send your report output by using the radio buttons. Your choices
are Window or Printer. In this case, selecting the Window option means that
the report will be displayed on-screen.
If you’re not sure about how much data will be printed, or if you’re unsure of
your own report specifications, you should generally send your output to the
window first. After the report is displayed on-screen and you’re satisfied with
it, you can easily send it directly to your printer from the window display.
252
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Sending a report to a printer
To print an entire report without previewing it on-screen, click the Printer
radio button in the lower-right corner of the Reports Menu dialog box, and
then click the Print button. The Printing in Progress status window appears,
displaying information about the selected printer, the number of pages
printed, and the number of records printed.
To stop printing at any time, click the Cancel button. Otherwise, the Printing
in Progress status window closes when GoldMine finishes sending the report
to the printer.
Sending a report to display on-screen
GoldMine can generate a report on-screen just as the report would look if
printed on paper. To make a report appear on-screen, simply select the
Output to Window radio button on the Print Report dialog box, and then click
the Print button. GoldMine may chug for a little while as it sorts and selects,
but your report shortly appears on-screen. From that window, you are given
the option to look at the data and cancel out of the report, or print the
report.

Chapter 22: The Reporting System

Modifying Existing Reports
The idea of a report is to have all the information you need, exactly the way
you want to see it, not the way the programmers think you want to see it.
GoldMine allows you to modify its already existing reports to meet your spe-
cific needs. However, this is another thing you may not want to try at home.
The best advice if you want to modify a report is to make sure you don’t
destroy the original, existing report. Make a clone, or copy, of the report you
want to modify and rename it to ensure that you don’t lose the original report
as follows:
1. Choose the Reports button from the Toolbar.
The Reports Center appears.
2. Highlight the report you want to modify, right-click, and select Clone
from the shortcut menu.
The Report Profile dialog box appears.
3. Enter the report description, any notes you feel appropriate, and the
report filename.
Make sure you give the cloned report a unique filename. If anyone else
uses this same report filename, it will overwrite your report. Also review
the User option. If this report is one that everyone should have access
to, you can leave User as Public; if this report is for your eyes only,
change it to your user name. If you do change a public report to one
with another user name, be sure to select the correct user the next time
you try to access that report.
4. Click OK.
You now have a cloned copy that you can feel free to modify.
Structuring your report
Modifying reports is not usually a fun task for poets, but if you need to, then
choose the Edit Report Layout icon from the Reports Center to display the
selected report in its design layout. A typical report layout is shown in Figure
22-5. The field labels and the fields themselves are designated by a series of Xs.
254
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

The first section is the Page Header. Any field in the Page Header prints on
the top of each page. The next section on a report is the Report Header,
which contains the title of the report. The data contained in the report
header prints only on the first page. The next section down is the sort head-
ers, in which the break field is defined. Break fields group the data within 
the report and specify the database that is linked to a particular section of the
report. You can only define break fields in a sort header. GoldMine limits the
number of sort headers to nine. Information such as company, contact,
address, and phone is contained in the sort header as well as the column
labels for the Detail sections. The sort header prints only once per company.
The Detail section is where the meat of the report displays. Working in con-
junction with the sort header, this section displays all the information in the
sort header based on the break field. The Page Footer is on the bottom of
each page of the report. Included in this section are the date the report was
printed and the page number. The date and page number are system fields
that GoldMine automatically updates.
To modify the design of a report, from the Reports Menu dialog box, follow
these steps:
1. Select Contact Reports from the categories listing and highlight the
Contact Wide Line Report — Landscape.
2. Click the Edit Report Layout icon from the Reports Center.
The programming involved in specifying this report appears in the
window.
The Page Header contains the title of the report (refer to Figure 22-5). The
Sort 1 header contains the company contact, address, phone, and text labels
for the information that will be displayed in the Detail 1 section. If you want
to see the actual field names instead of just Xs, right-click in any blank area of
the report and choose Edit➪Show Field Names.
To view the filter and break field for the Sort 1 header, shown in Figure 22-6,
double-click the dark bar labeled Sort 1 Header. The Sort 1 Header dialog box
appears, and you can choose break field or the filter from the buttons at the
bottom of the window. Click the Break Field button. In this report, it’s set to
“Contact1->Owner.” No filter exists on the sort header or detail header in this
report.

Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Adding new fields
One of the most common modifications you may make to existing reports is
to add a field that isn’t already on the report. For example, you might want to
include the Account Manager’s name along with the account itself; for exam-
ple, I want to add Key 4, Acct Mngr, under the company and address. Follow
these steps to add a field to your report:
1. Increase the size of the Detail 1 Section to accommodate the addi-
tional field by clicking the Detail 1 Section label and dragging down
to make the section larger.
Two small black squares appear at the top and bottom of the section
when you first click it. After you have dragged the section label to make
it larger, you have room for some extra fields.
2. In an empty area of the report, right-click and choose Insert➪Data
Field from the shortcut menu.
The Select a Field dialog box appears. The top drop-down list allows you
to choose what database you want to add a field from. Choose the field
from the database in the second drop-down list. To add Accnt Mngr,
choose Contact1 from the top drop-down list, and then Accnt Mngr from
the second drop-down list.
3. Click OK.
Your mouse pointer changes into an outlined field that you can move.
4. Move the cursor to where you want to place the field; in this case,
under Company, and then click to place it there.
After you place the field, you can use the black squares that appear to
resize the display of the field. You can move or change the size of the
field at any time. You may want to indent the Accnt Mngr field under
company for easier visual reference.
5. To change the font of the field, right-click in the field and choose
Edit➪Fonts.
The Font dialog box appears. Pick out a font you like and make any other
tweaks to the font’s appearance; click OK when you’re done.
In order to preview the changes, GoldMine asks whether you want to save the
modifications you have made. If you choose Yes, a sample of the report with
your changes appears. If you choose No, you lose all changes you have. To
change back to the Layout view, simply click the Layout icon on the Reports
toolbar.
257
Chapter 22: The Reporting System

Adding a label
Of course, what good is adding a field if you don’t label it? To add the label
for Accnt Mngr, you need to make the Sort 1 header larger. Click the Sort 1
header label and pull down the bottom black square. Notice that the shading
doesn’t increase with the size of the header.
1. Click the Label button at the top of the window.
A rectangle appears in the window with dashed lines surrounding it. The
word “Label” appears in this box.
In order to distinguish between Company and Accnt Mngr, indent the
field slightly under Company and click to place it.
2. To define the label, double-click it to see the Text Field Parameters
dialog box; in the text box, type Accnt Mngr and click OK.
The shading for the Sort 1 header is defined in the Company label. To
increase the shading, you need to resize the Company label.
3. Click the Company label and drag the bottom black square down until
the label meets the top of the Detail 1 header.
The shading now encompasses the entire Sort 1 header. Notice, how-
ever, that Company has moved down and is centered in the header.
4. To correct this problem, double-click the Company label, and in the
Text Position section of the Text Field Parameters dialog box, select
the Top option; click OK.
Company now aligns at the top of the header.
5. To view the changes, click the Preview icon in the Reports toolbar.
6. Make sure to save your modifications by clicking OK.
To get a better understanding of report design and modifications, choose dif-
ferent reports and go into each layout and see how they are set up. Look at
the break fields, filters, and general layout of the report. Doing so can give
you a good idea of how to make the modifications you desire.
Creating Custom Reports
Most of your reporting needs can be met by the reports that come with
GoldMine or by making some minor modifications to them. However, you
may find it necessary to create your own reports based on your company’s
specific needs.
To create a new report:
258
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

1. Choose the Reports button from the toolbar.
The Reports Center appears.
2. In the Report Description section and select the New Report icon.
The Report Profile dialog box appears.
3. Fill in the Report description, make any notes you may want to add,
and give the report a unique name; click OK.
You are returned to the Reports Menu dialog box.
4. Highlight the new report in the Reports Menu dialog box and click the
Layout icon.
GoldMine automatically gives you a Page Header, Sort 1 Header, Detail 1
Section, and Page Footer. Using the instructions from the example in the
“Modifying Existing Reports” section, earlier in this chapter, you can add
the labels in the Sort 1 header and fields in the Detail section.
If you want to add a filter to the entire report, click the Report Filter icon
from the Reports local toolbar (in layout mode). This brings up the Record
Selection Criteria dialog box, where you can build a filter for your report. See
Chapter 8 for more information on filters.
Using Alternatives to the Built-in
Reporting System
Because the GoldMine file structure is built on well-known and well-established
SQL files, you can use many third-party utilities to create reports. I discuss
some of the more common ones I have used in the following sections. Others
are available. Basically, any report system that can handle SQL files can pro-
duce reports from your GoldMine data.
Excel
Almost everyone has a spreadsheet program, and most of us have Excel.
Almost all the GoldMine data files are standard SQL files, which Excel can
read directly. If Excel can read the file(s), then Excel can also manipulate the
data for you.
By opening a GoldMine file with Excel, you can then reformat the data, per-
form all sorts of calculations, and generate graphs and charts. You can also
use Excel to save these same files in some other format if you need access to
the data from another program.
259
Chapter 22: The Reporting System

Do not open your GoldMine files with Excel or any other utility while
GoldMine is being accessed by another user. And, most important, do not
save the Excel files using the original name of the file. After you have made
any changes to the data or the file structure with Excel, GoldMine will not be
happy trying to use that file later. Even if it looks as though it is working, you
will probably have destroyed GoldMine’s ability to synchronize its data.
In order to successfully use Excel to manipulate your GoldMine data, you
need some understanding of the GoldMine file structure, or you at least need
to know what data is contained in which files. The GoldMine Reference Guide
details all this information.
Access
Consider Microsoft Access to be Excel’s big brother. You can use Access to do
almost anything Excel can do. In addition, Access has much more reporting
capability than does Excel. The downside is that you need to have some seri-
ous experience with Access before trying to do too much with GoldMine files.
Crystal Reports
Crystal 11 runtime licenses are included with GoldMine Premium. And, to tell
it the way it really is, Crystal Reports is probably the reporting tool of choice
with GoldMine. It’s much stronger and better documented and more widely
known than is the built in report writer that comes with GoldMine. Crystal is
what our team uses for most reporting requirements. If you need to make
more than a minor modification to an existing GoldMine report, or if your
GoldMine report is running like molasses in January, you should consider
using Crystal Reports instead.
Microsoft Reporting Services
For the first time, Microsoft Reporting Services is also included with
GoldMine Premium. This is another good choice, particularly if you need to
have reports automatically scheduled to run without human intervention.
Other report generators
Stonefield Query is a query builder and report writer with a simple wizard
interface. Its wizard is easy to use and allows you some flexibility that Crystal
Reports just doesn’t have. MasterMine is another well-respected tool that
generates Excel-based pivot tables from GoldMine data. For more about these
options, see Chapter 30.

Chapter 23
Opportunity and Project Manager
In This Chapter
 Using the Opportunity and Project Manager
 How the Project Manager differs from the Opportunity Manager
O
pportunity tracking is the next step up from just forecasting sales. It’s
actually a giant step up. You use the Opportunity Manager to track com-
plex sales. A complex sale involves either an individual or a team trying to
close a sale that may have more than one decision-maker on the other side.
These sales might also include multiple products or services. Often these
complex sales also have a long sales cycle compared to simpler sales.
Although the use of the Opportunity Manager is not directly related to the
dollar value of a potential deal, very often the more complex sales are also
the ones with greater-than-average value. It is probably not a coincidence
that these larger deals also seem to attract the most competitors. The
Opportunity Manager also allows you to track those competitors.
After you close a complex sale, it usually becomes a complex project. And
GoldMine lets you easily turn that opportunity into a project. A project is the
natural next step for an opportunity that you managed well. When you have a
project to track, you can manage your team of workers, the timeline, and the
money involved using Project Manager.
Initially, setting up the Opportunity or Project Manager (or both) is a lot of
work. Many fields need to have lookup lists built. It’s also a lot of work to
monitor an opportunity or a project in detail. You should probably consider
using these tools only for those opportunities and projects that really are
complex or are very important. This caution notwithstanding, these tools are
potentially valuable when used under the right circumstances.
In this chapter, you discover when and how to make use of the Opportunity/
Project Manager (O/PM).

The Opportunity/Project Manager
The Opportunity Manager and the Project Manager contain similar types of
information, and thus their screens look similar. The first icon on either
screen allows you to toggle back and forth from an Opportunity to a Project.
Each of these tools contains two major sections. The upper section displays
general information about a selected opportunity or project. The lower sec-
tion consists of a series of tabs. To access either of these screens, from the
main menu, choose either Go To➪Opportunities or Go To➪Projects. The
Opportunity or Project Manager screen appears. The Opportunity screen is
shown in Figure 23-1.
The Opportunity Manager 
and its functions
Chances are, if this is your first time anywhere near the Opportunity Manager,
nothing has been entered. Selecting the first icon at the top of the Opportunity
Manager screen displays the new Opportunity Manager Wizard (after confirm-
ing that you really want to run the wizard) as shown in Figure 23-2. This is a
terrific way to start — you never forget your first time.
Figure 23-1:
The
Opportunity
screen that
you will see
the first
time.
262
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

On the first wizard screen, as shown in Figure 23-2, you relate the new oppor-
tunity to a contact record and to a particular person at that company. You
should use the Browse button to the right of the Company field to assist in
locating the correct company. After doing so, click the Next button to move
on to the screen shown in Figure 23-3.
In Figure 23-3 you enter a unique and descriptive name for this opportunity.
Please remember that you may have multiple opportunities with the same
customer, and you may have similar opportunities with completely different
customers. So, you should select names that are descriptive enough to allow
you and others on your team to recognize which opportunity this really is.
Examples of reasonable names might be Designing Our Retention Workshop
or Competitive Bid on Space Shuttle.
Creating a template is possible, but in this chapter I discuss opportunities
from scratch. After you have named your opportunity, you can move on to
the next screen.

263
Chapter 23: Opportunity and Project Manager 

Figure 23-4 shows the third wizard screen, enabling you to begin specifying
the details of this opportunity.
 Manager: You can designate a manager for the opportunity if you like, or
you can accept the default manager, which is you (your user name).
 Code: You can classify your opportunities with a three-letter code from
the lookup list associated with this field. You may want to consider
using some departmental codes or product category codes.
 Probability: This field identifies the likelihood of successfully landing
this opportunity. The Probability field comes with a preset lookup list
that you will probably want to modify to your own situation and for your
entire team’s consistent use.
 Stage: Displays more detailed information related to the level, or stage,
of the process. The entry is represented by a number and a descriptive
reference, such as “10 - Initial Contact.”
 Source: This field is taken by default from the Source field on the main
screen of the contact record linked to this opportunity. You have the
same lookup list available to you, but you can enter a new selection if
you want.
 Start Date: This date relates to projects more than to opportunities, so
you can pass this one by for opportunities.
 Close By: The date by which you expect to close this deal. By default,
GoldMine sets it to be the current date, so take care to put in a more
realistic date. If this date comes and goes without someone actually
closing this deal, GoldMine sends you an alarm about it.
After you have finished with these fields, move on to the next screen, as
shown in Figure 23-5. This screen allows you to set up the Opportunity
Influencers.
Figure 23-4:
Beginning
to specify
the oppor-
tunity’s

on the
Overview
screen.
264
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Influencers and Contacts
Influencers are the people on the other side of the table who are involved in
the ultimate decision-making process. They don’t have to actually work for
the prospect. They might be outside consultants, for example. After an
opportunity becomes a project, these same people are referred to as contacts,
which is the usual terminology throughout GoldMine.
The Role field is for the specific contribution that this influencer or contact is
likely to make to the decision-making process.
The Response Mode field (in the Opportunity Manager only) specifies the
perceived attitude of this person toward your product or service. By default,
a few sample entries are already in the lookup list, such as Even Keel or
Trouble. Feel free to make up your own. If you’ve had any formal sales train-
ing, you might recognize where the default terminology comes from.
Forecasted Sales
The next section allows you to divide the total opportunity into its compo-
nent sales, assuming that you have more than one product or one stage of
the sale. A typical example may be when selling a GoldMine consulting pro-
ject that involves the software itself, a pilot or test phase, and then a full roll-
out to an entire sales force. Forecasting sales along with illustrations of the
various screens is discussed in Chapter 12.
An opportunity must already exist before you can link a forecasted sale to it.
In the normal course of business, you might just create a simple sales fore-
cast without any initial intention of using the Opportunity Manager. Then,
as the complexity of the potential sale begins to grow, you might decide to
create an Opportunity Record. If this happens, you can edit the original sales
forecast record and link it to the just recently created opportunity. 
Figure 23-5:
The
Influencer
screen.
265
Chapter 23: Opportunity and Project Manager 

The forecasting screen that you will use within the Opportunity Manager is
virtually identical to that of the general sales forecasting. Please see Chapter
12 for more details. You can, however, have multiple forecasts linked to one
opportunity. In fact, this situation is fairly common in a complex sale.
Team
These are the people on your team with whom you are working to close this
deal. You can even put someone from your prospect’s team, or someone else
from outside your own firm, on the team. Doing so is sometimes appropriate
when you have someone from the other side acting as a coach. The first field,
Type, shown in Figure 23-6, enables you to specify either a User, who is some-
one from your own team, or an Other Contact, who is anyone else in your
database.
In the Role field, you can enter each person’s anticipated role in the opportu-
nity or project. Examples are “write RFP response” or “Q/C testing.”
Issues
In this section, shown in Figure 23-7, you keep track of any issues that come
up that need to be addressed. As you pursue an opportunity, you may, for
example, become aware of a pending price increase that will go into effect
next month. Because this increase would conflict with the budget your
prospect has already set up, it could be a serious problem and have an
impact on your schedule for closing the deal.

Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

 Issue: Enter a brief description of the issue your team must handle, or
you can select a previously defined issue from the lookup list.
 Status: You can use this field’s lookup list or create your own brief
description.
 Priority: Specify a rank-order of this issue. You generally should assign
numbers in ascending order so that the more important issues have
smaller, or lower numbers.
 Date: You can set a date for this issue. You can either enter the date the
issue became known, or you can indicate when the issue needs to be
resolved. You must be consistent, however. I like to use the resolution
date in this field.
 User: Assign a member of your team to this issue.
Competitors
The Competitors screen, shown in Figure 23-8, allows you to track companies
and products with which you are competing for this opportunity. Competitors
do not apply to Project Management, because after you close the deal, if you’re
lucky, you don’t need to worry too much about competitors. If you’re lucky.
 Rating: You can indicate just how strong a competitor you are dealing
with. The standard ratings range from –5 to +5 and are a little out of
order due to the vagaries of alphabetic order in lookup lists.
 Status: You can describe your prospect’s attitude, as best you under-
stand it, toward this competitor. You can use or modify the lookup list
for this field. An example might be: If you were trying to upgrade a
prospect from ACT! to GoldMine, but they already had 30 users who
knew ACT!, you might describe them as “entrenched.”
Figure 23-7:
Tracking

267
Chapter 23: Opportunity and Project Manager 

 Product: You enter the name, if there is one, of the product against
which you are competing.
 Strengths: You can enter a brief description of the most attractive fea-
tures of this competitor. Please note that this field refers more to your
competitor than to that competitor’s product, although you can use it
either way.
 Weaknesses: The Weaknesses field is, of course, the exact opposite of
the Strengths field.
Tracking details
Using the Details/Links screen, you can track custom information associated
with the opportunity (or project). This section is a combination of the Detail
tab and the Links tab associated with the main records. You can define an
unlimited number of items. Each item has an associated Reference field that
actually houses the data. In addition, you can link an external file (a Word
document or an Excel spreadsheet, as examples) to each item. 
The Finish Line
On the last screen of the Opportunity Manager Wizard, you finish your data
entry with essentially the remaining parts of your sales forecast. That is,
you enter the probability, total revenue, and potential close date for this
deal. One of the slickest features of the Opportunity Manager is the graphical
pipeline that shows where all the deals are. The Pipeline Funnel icon at the top
of the Opportunity Manager produces this display, as shown in Figure 23-9.

Tasks 
An opportunity (or a project) complex enough to merit tracking by the
Opportunity Manager usually involves multiple tasks that start and end over
differing time periods. Some tasks might overlap in time, or occur at different
times, or be dependent upon the completion of prior tasks. In a complex sale,
tracking these individual tasks is essential to successfully completing a sale.
A completed set of Task specifications is illustrated in Figure 23-10.
To view or add tasks to an opportunity or to a project:
1. Make sure you have the proper opportunity or project displayed and
highlighted in the upper section of the Opportunity/Project Manager
screen.
2. Click the Tasks tab.
3. To add a new task, right-click below the Tasks tab and select New
from the local menu.
4. In the Reference field, enter a descriptive name for the task, such as
“Survey for number of users.”
5. Fill in the Status field from its lookup list.

6. In the Begin Date field, set the beginning date by either typing it in or
by accessing the calendar with the right mouse button.
7. Enter the User who is responsible for this task or for the entire
opportunity.
8. Use the Color field to designate the type of task.
These colors will then be displayed on the Gantt chart associated with
the opportunity or project. I like to use the same color scheme as
described in Chapter 9.
9. In the Priority field, enter a ranking order for the task.
You can use numerals (1, 2, 3, and so on) or an alphabetical scheme (A,
B, C, and so on). Just be consistent.
10. In the %Done field, enter the percentage of the task that has been
completed.
You will need to enter this information on an ongoing basis.
11. Use the Notes field for any additional free-form information.
12. When you are done, click OK.

Pending
This tab may contain the scheduled activities relating to an opportunity or to
a project. A complex opportunity or project usually involves many activities
to be performed by various members of your team. Although you can add
these activities from the Schedule main menu, you can view and manage each
one from the Pending tab of the Opportunity or Project Manager (O/PM). You
may also want to make use of the Gantt chart that GoldMine builds for you.
This will graphically lay out everyone’s tasks.
History
This tab contains all the activities that have been closed in pursuit of the
opportunity. The History tab in the O/PM relates to the O/PM just as the
Pending tab does. You can edit and close activities either from the main
screen or from the History tab within the O/PM.
Closing and Converting Opportunities
When an opportunity closes, it becomes a project. You close an opportunity
by right-clicking the opportunity and selecting Convert to Opportunity/Project
from the menu that appears. You can also convert a project into an opportu-
nity. Converting projects back into opportunities is a function of your Sales
Prevention Team. With luck, you don’t have such a team and won’t need to
do this.

T
hose familiar with previous versions of GoldMine and, specifically with
the Organizational Chart, will recognize a lot of the Organizational Chart
in the new Relationships tab. Basically, the Relationships tab is the
Organizational Chart’s bigger brother.
You use the Relationships tab to connect one GoldMine record with one or
more other records. GoldMine builds a graphic display of these connections
and allows you to not only see the connections but to use them as you might
use a filter. 
A typical Relationships tab display is shown in Figure 24-1. I call this a “chart”
from now on in deference to its predecessor, the Org Chart.
In this chapter, I explain how to use the Relationships tab. 

Building Relationships
Relationships are linked to each of the specified records. That is, the same
chart is displayed within the Relationships tab for each of the companies or
contacts within the chart. The relationship’s name is taken from the Company
field of the selected contact record. You can create up to five secondary levels
under each organization and you can link contacts to any section. 
You create a new relationship with the following steps.
1. From the Relationships Tab, right-click and select Create a new
Relationship.
The New Relationship Tree Options dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 24-2.
2. Lookup another contact and create a Relationship.
This launches the Contact Search Center and lets you add a new
Relationship to another Contact Record.
You may need to refresh the Relationships tab, move back and forth from one
record back to the original before you can actually see the results of adding a
new contact or company to your relationships.
Figure 24-1:
A simple
Relation-
ships tab.
274
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

Although you can add records to a chart one at a time, a more efficient way
to build a chart is to use filters or groups. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Activate an existing filter or group (see Chapter 8 for details on filters
and groups).
2. Right-click a section within your existing Relationships tab.
A menu of choices appears.
3. Select New Contact, which leads to yet another menu (see Figure 24-3).

275
Chapter 24: Managing Relationships

4. Select the last choice, which is Link all Group/Filter Contacts to the
Section.
This will automatically add every record from the active filter (or group)
to this section of your chart.
Even if using a filter adds a few too many records to your chart, it is way
easier to remove them than it would be to individually add more than a few
records.
Activating a Section
You can activate an entire relationship or just a section. This lets you quickly
create a working group of related contacts. When you do this, GoldMine
treats the activated section very much as it does a filter and allows you to
scroll through all the records in the chart exactly as you can scroll through
a series of records within an active filter or group. 
In the Relationships tab, right-click an entry (either a relationship or a sec-
tion) and then select Activate. (Depending on your selection, select either
Activate Relationship or Activate Section.) To deactivate the group, click the
Release button on the Relationships toolbar.
Doing a Rollup
I actually believe rollups are the most important feature of the Relationships
tab. Rollups are important when you want to view, for example, all the history
for all records within one section of the Relationships tab. A common request
from users in the financial community is to see all the history for the members
of a family in one consolidated view. This is actually called “householding.”
Doing a rollup accomplishes this, and more. In fact, you get this consolidated
view for pending and historical activities as well as for Contacts, Details,
Referrals, Linked Documents, Members, Tracks, Opportunities and for Projects.
If you have a particularly large database, or if the section of the Relationships
chart you are rolling up is large, you might need to go get a cup of coffee while
you’re waiting for your rollup to happen. You can expedite this by asking your
276
Part VI: Organizing and Distributing Information 

GoldMine Administrator to do some routine database maintenance first. To
actually do a rollup, you must activate a section and then select the Rollup
button in the Relationships tab. The information you see in the rollup applies
to the section of the Relationships chart that you have currently highlighted.
Here’s how you do it, step by step:
1. Right-click the entire relationship or just a section of it and then select
Activate Section (see Figure 24-4).
2. Select Rollup.
A caution appears, but if you did your maintenance recently, you might
just as well go ahead. This is shown in Figure 24-5.
3. Click the History tab (or any of the other supported tabs that you’re
interested in).
GoldMine displays all the history for all the members of the relationship
section you selected, as shown in Figure 24-6.

Customizing
GoldMine

In this part . . .
P
art of the power of GoldMine, in fact since the begin-
ning, has been your ability to expand the system by
adding new fields and customizing labels. In this part, you
learn how to do this as well as how to tailor lookup lists
that are associated with many of GoldMine’s fields.
Automated Processes is an underutilized and powerful tool
that, when properly designed, has GoldMine doing as much
grunt work as possible. A good Automated Process makes
sure that nothing falls between the cracks because it sched-
ules users to do things and sends out correspondence. 
GM+Browser enhances the power of GM+View by creating
an environment in which you can scroll through multiple
GM+Views, all organized in one place. 
The fact that you can fully integrate GoldMine with your
Web site should be enough to convince you to truly
enhance your Web site or create one if you don’t already
have one. Prospects and customers visiting your Web
site can automatically have their records created or
updated. When attached to a good Automated Process,
this updating can make it look as though your sales and
customer service teams are working 24/7.

Creating New Labels and Fields
In This Chapter
 Adding new fields to your database
 Organizing and creating field views
 Displaying new fields
 Changing field labels and data on the fly
 Modify an existing field
 Changing the face of GoldMine with Record Typing
O
ne of the most powerful aspects of GoldMine is its capability of con-
forming to your business. You can customize the labels for individual
fields so that they more closely fit your needs. You can create an almost
unlimited number of additional fields, and you can rearrange where many
existing fields appear on the screen. Record typing creates yet another
option for customizing your fields — you can completely change the fields
and appearance of your GoldMine screens depending on the data you enter
in just one of the fields.
Modifying fields and labels is relatively straightforward. All the tools you
need are included with GoldMine. But, very significant and powerful new fea-
tures, such as Record Typing, have been added recently, giving you a reason
to maintain a relationship with a knowledgeable dealer.
This chapter helps you break into some of the secret tools of those dealers
so that you can do at least some of your own customization, rather than pay
someone else to do it.
Adding New Fields to Your Database
You can add hundreds of additional custom fields. Several steps are involved,
the first of which is, of course, deciding what fields you need and where they
will go. Next you add the new field(s) to the database structure. And finally
you rebuild the database, and position the field somewhere in the window so
that you can see and use it.

A somewhat new Screen Design utility presents an alternate method of
adding new fields to your database. The older method, which I describe in
this chapter, allows you to see your existing fields while adding new ones. I
think this is a significant enough advantage that I recommend the older
method and ignore the new one.
To begin adding fields to the database, from the main menu, choose Tools➪
Configure➪Custom Fields. The User Defined Fields dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 25-1.
Select the New button and you can begin defining new fields, one at a time.
The User Defined Fields dialog box contains the following information:
 Field Name: Name that GoldMine uses to identify the field in the contact
database.
 Description: Description of the field that typically describes the con-
tents or purpose of the field; for example, Business Type.
 Local Label: Displays the default label that will ultimately appear 
on-screen.
 Field Type: Identification code for the data type of the field from one of
the following values:
• C — Character
• N — Numeric
• D — Date
 Len: Length of the field in number of characters. The length of the field
determines how much data the field can hold, or the total number of
characters that can be stored. For numeric fields, you must count the
decimal point and the plus or minus sign, if you anticipate using one.
Figure 25-1:
Use this
dialog box
to define
custom
fields.
284
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

When adding a field type, you should know the types of fields and when you
should use them. You can add three different field types:
 Character fields (C) can contain any keyboard character and are gener-
ally used to hold text. Although the maximum length you can define is
254 characters, a practical limit is imposed by the size of your screen.
The largest field that can be displayed across the screen and without
room for a field label on the same line is 76 characters. You can, of
course, have a field larger than 76 characters, and you can scroll from
right to left within the field.
 Numeric fields (N) have a maximum length of 16, including any plus or
minus signs. You can have from 0–9 decimal places. This limitation
should never be a problem if you design your numeric fields properly.
One of my clients in the financial services industry insisted that she
needed 25-digit numeric fields. Some of her clients, she said, had very
large accounts. The entire United States national debt is currently just
under 8 trillion, which would take up 13 digits in a numeric field. She and
I finally settled on 16 digits because that was all GoldMine can handle
anyway.
Very few human beings can look at a number like 5132563436666 and
have any appreciation for what it represents. If you need to keep a
number in the billions or trillions or more, you should label it as such
and keep the number itself to a reasonable length. Examples include the
following:
Field Label
Data Field
Bank balance (billions)
498.5
Avogadro’s number (1023)
6.023 
 Date fields must contain a valid date only and always have a length of
eight characters. Dates are represented in a MM/DD/YY format.
Creating a new field
To create a field and add it to your existing database, follow these steps:
1. If you don’t already have the User Defined Fields dialog box open,
choose Tools➪Configure➪Custom Fields and then click the New button.
(Refer to Figure 25-1 to see the User Defined Fields dialog box.) After you
click the New button, the User Defined Field Profile dialog box appears,
as shown in Figure 25-2.
285
Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

2. Enter the name of your new field.
The Field Name field itself already has a U as the first character. U stands
for user-defined and must be the first character in all fields you build. All
user-defined fields
• Must begin with the letter U.
• Can contain up to, but not more than, ten alphanumeric characters.
• Must have unique field names.
3. In the Description field, enter a short, plain-English phrase describing
the contents or purpose of this field. Spaces are allowed.
4. Select what type of data the field will contain and the length of the
field.
As mentioned previously, you have three choices of field type: character
(C), numeric (N), and date (D), and you must select one of these options
in this dialog box.
If you’re adding a field for a phone number, the field name should start
with UPHONE. You can use either upper- or lowercase. Designating a
user-defined field name with these first six characters forces GoldMine
to format the data into typical phone-number format, with parentheses
and dashes.
5. When you’re finished entering the information for a new data field,
click OK.
You return to the User Defined Fields dialog box. (Refer to Figure 25-1.)
You can continue with this procedure, adding as many new fields as you need.
After you finish adding all the new fields, you have one more step to complete
before you can actually use these fields: You must rebuild your database. In
fact, GoldMine has a reminder message that awaits should you forget the
rebuild process. See the next section to find out how to rebuild your database.
Note that only users with Master rights are allowed to rebuild your database
Figure 25-2:

286
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Rebuilding your database
To rebuild your database, simply click the Rebuild button in the User Defined
Fields dialog box. GoldMine asks whether you’re ready to rebuild the data-
base; click OK. The rebuild function appends all your new fields to the CON-
TACT2.DBF file. This process takes only a moment or two if you do it while
very few accounts are in your database. As the number of accounts grows, so
does the time it takes for a rebuild.
A little planning at the beginning of your project may save you a considerable
amount of time later if you have to do a few rebuilds with 25,000 existing
accounts in the database. Try your best to plan for new or additional fields
before you add a ton of data to the database. Then, rebuilding is quick; later,
it may be painfully slow. In fact, if you’re not completely sure how many fields
you may need, it might be clever to add a couple of spare character, numeric,
and date fields before you stock your database with 25,000 records.
Keep the following in mind when rebuilding:
 Always back up your entire database before rebuilding. 
 No one else should be running GoldMine while a rebuild is happening.
 Make sure you have enough free disk space available before rebuilding.
GoldMine will be adding each of your new fields to every record in your
database. You can find a formula for figuring free disk space in the
GoldMine Reference Manual, but a common guideline is to never allow
your hard drive to get more than about 70 percent full. Beyond that
level, your disk efficiency begins to deteriorate anyway, and you run the
risk of running out of space whenever GoldMine or any other program
creates temp files or backup files.
Rebuilding usually only takes a short time, and then you will be ready to dis-
play or use the fields.
Organizing and Creating Field Views
Field views are groups of fields organized into logical groupings and shown
together in one window display. GoldMine comes with basically one field view:
the one directly under the Fields tab. To further organize the data, GoldMine
enables anyone with Master rights to design custom views. Before you can
display a newly created field in a field view, you need to create that view.
One of the benefits of custom field views is that you can organize your data
logically. If you have a dozen fields related to accounting, you can put them
all together in one accounting view. Marketing fields can be placed together,
as can the fields for sales.
287
Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

In addition, you can control the access rights to individual field views. If you
don’t want people in the Marketing department to view or to manipulate data
in the Accounting view, you can preclude them from doing so. This is often a
valuable tool.
To create and maintain custom user-defined field views, follow these steps:
1. Click the Fields tab to highlight it.
2. Right-click anywhere in the Fields area and select Screens Setup from
the shortcut menu that appears.
The Custom Screens Setup dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 25-3.
3. Click the New button to create a new field view.
The Custom Screen Profile dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 25-4.
4. Fill in the following three fields on the Custom Screen Profile
dialog box:
• Screen Name: This is the name for the new dialog box and will be
shown in the Custom Screens Setup dialog box.
• Tab Name: Designing a tab name creates a custom tab in one of the
banks of tabs behind the standard tabs. Although you can enter up
Figure 25-3:

dialog box.
288
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 
Creating hot keys
If you want to gain access to a particular field
view by using hot keys (a special key sequence
that accesses a command), you can create a
custom hot key. For example, you may want to
go to the Accounting tab by simply pressing
Ctrl+A. To designate this hot key for the
Accounting tab, type &A in the tab name.
Actually, the ampersand (&) can appear any-
where within the tab name, but the following
letter will become the hot key for that tab.

to 22 characters for a tab name, although you may not be able to
see that many when the tab is displayed. Make sure the first 7 or 8
characters you use are sufficient to clearly describe what this view
is all about.
GoldMine now allows you to place your tabs on the screen in any
order you like by simply clicking and dragging each tab into the
position you prefer.
• Access: This field allows you to direct who has access to this par-
ticular field view. To restrict access to this field view, select a user
or a group of users who may access to it. To allow everyone to
have access, leave the access rights set to (public).
The last check box on the dialog box controls whether this custom
view is accessible from this particular contact database. Generally,
you want to leave the default setting as is.
5. When you’re finished, click OK.
Sometimes you will have several custom views that are very similar and 
actually contain many of the same fields. Rather than painstakingly recreate
the second or third such view, you can copy all the individual view and field
specifications from one view to another. You can do this by clicking the Clone
button on the Custom Screens Setup dialog box as seen in Figure 25-1.
Clicking the Clone button brings you to the Custom Screen Profile dialog box,
allowing you to give the old view a new name and then automatically copy all
the fields that are included into a brand-new field view.
Because you can assign hot keys in many places, keeping a list of the ones
you have created is wise! GoldMine goes to the first hot key assigned to a
function; for example, pressing Ctrl+A goes to CASES and then, if pressed
again, goes to the FieldView tab assigned to that sequence.

289
Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

Displaying New Fields
After you create all the field views that you need, you can begin placing indi-
vidual fields on those screens.
Quite a few methods exist for displaying individual fields. In this section, I
discuss a method that was introduced back in GoldMine 5.0. This method is
the most streamlined and logical method of them all.
To display a new field that already exists in your database, you must first
locate the proper field view. You can maneuver through the various tabbed
file folders by clicking the down arrow immediately to the left of the Fields
Tab. After you locate the custom screen tab on which you want to display
your field(s), follow these steps:
1. Highlight the custom tab.
2. Right-click in the blank area below the tab and select Screen Design
from the shortcut menu.
A series of drop-down choices appears, as shown in Figure 25-5.
3. Click the New Field option.
The Place Field dialog box appears, which allows you to select the spe-
cific field to place on this tab. Assuming that you have already created
the field and rebuilt the database since then, you can find this field by
clicking the arrow to the right of Field, as shown in Figure 25-6. Or, you
can actually create a new field, on the fly, by clicking the New Field
button in this dialog box. If you do create a new field on the fly, you have
to rebuild the database before you can add information into that field.
4. After you identify the field you want, click OK.
You return to the selected field view, with your new field highlighted in a
red or white box. A red box indicates that the field is currently posi-
tioned on top of an existing field. You don’t want two fields overlapping
each other, so you have to move at least one of them. A box with a white
background indicates that it doesn’t conflict with any other field, but
you may want to reposition it anyway.
You can reposition the field, whether it is highlighted in white or in red, by
clicking and dragging it to an empty place in the window. When you have it in
approximately the right place, double-click the box with the field you’re dis-
playing to show the Field Properties dialog box. Doing so allows you to do
some further fine-tuning of the field, as shown in Figure 25-7.

Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

Click the Security tab on the Field Properties dialog box. Among other options
in this tab, you can also specify who has rights to read and/or to change the
data on a field-by-field basis by choosing from the following options:
 Read Rights: By default, this field is listed as (public), which allows all
users to see the data in this field. You can enter either an individual or a
group name into this field, and thus control who can see the data in this
field.
 Update Rights: This option is similar to the Read Access field. By
default, everyone can edit the data in each field. If you turn off Read
Access rights, you also turn off Update Access, but situations may exist
where you want someone to be able to see the data but not change it. An
example might be a Credit Limit field. You may want anyone in the
Accounting group to be able to read it and update it, but you may want
the folks in the Sales group to be able see the data but not update it.
 Field Audit: If you turn on this option, GoldMine automatically keeps a
historical log of all changes to the data in this field. This log includes the
time, the date, and the user who changed the data. I have this set in the
Account Manager field just in case a salesperson decides to reassign all
the best accounts to him- or herself.
On the Layout tab, you specify the size and window positioning of each field
you are displaying, as shown in Figure 25-8.
 Field Label Size: You may need to adjust the length of the label you are
using for this field. You can increase or decrease the size of the label by
simply changing the number in this field. This may allow you to adjust
the window location of the data by making more room if you need it.
 Data Size: You can also adjust the actual size of the data display for the
field. This doesn’t affect the data itself but may affect how much of the
data you can see at one time without scrolling right and left.
 Colon: You can specify the position of the colon, which separates the
field label from the data itself. This essentially positions the entire
object, which is the label plus the data.
 Field Order: The integer in the Field Order field determines the order in
which you normally tab from one field to the next. GoldMine takes you
sequentially from one field to the next based on the number in the Field
Order field.
You can change a field that has already been placed for display by double-
clicking the label while you hold down the Ctrl key. The field and label
become highlighted, and you can then double-click the highlighted area. The
Field Properties dialog box reappears, and you can then make whatever
changes are needed.
292
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Changing Field Labels and Data
On the Fly
Any user with Master rights can change the labels of fields, including those
fields above the file folders as well as all the user-defined fields in the Fields
tab. For example, for a contact database that contains only educational insti-
tutions, you can change the label of the Company field to School.
In addition to changing a field label for every record, GoldMine can change
field labels on the fly based on the data entered in that or in other fields. For
example, if you enter Canada as the country for a particular record, you can
have GoldMine automatically display Postal Code as opposed to Zip Code in
the prior field. This comes under the heading of “Record Typing.” 
You can also change the data in particular fields on the fly based on what is
entered in other fields by using the LOOKUP.INI file (see Chapter 26), as
shown in Figure 25-9.
Using LOOKUP.INI, you can automatically have GoldMine assign an Account
Manager based on, say, the state the account is in. This happens, however,
only when you actually move the cursor into and out of the Account Manager
field. You may still need to resort to this original methodology if you have
more conditions than allowed in a typical dBASE expression.
Figure 25-8:
Setting up

293
Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

To change the label of a field, follow these steps:
1. Select the field label by holding down Ctrl and double-clicking the field.
Remember, it’s the field label, not the data area!
All the other fields in the window become highlighted in the color asso-
ciated with the main screen’s color scheme, whereas the selected field
remains in a white box.
2. Take your finger off the Ctrl key and double-click again in the white
area where the original field is.
The Field Properties dialog box appears (refer to Figure 25-8). The Field
Properties dialog box allows you to change not only the labels that
appear in the window but also a number of other properties, including
the size and position of the label. See the “Adding New Fields to Your
Database” section, earlier in this chapter, for details.
The Field Label section focuses only on the labels themselves:
• Global Label: Specifies field label text. GoldMine uses the text in
the Global Label field unless you have specified a value in the
Local Label field (see the next bullet). Global labels appear consis-
tently throughout all contact databases. If you want to use a differ-
ent label for this field in each contact database, use the Local Label
field to store the label text.
• Local Label: Specifies the text of a field label for only the currently
open contact database. This option allows you to use a different
field label for the primary field in different databases. An entry in
the Local Label field overrides whatever is in the Global Label field
for the one database that is open.

Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

The following limitations apply to local labels:
• Local labels can be used only with fields, not expressions.
• Local labels can be no more than 15 characters in length.
3. When you’re finished choosing labels and properties, click OK.
GoldMine updates the contact record display to show the new field
label. Changing the field label has no effect on the data in the field.
Modifying an Existing Field
Suddenly in GoldMine 6.0, we had much more control over labels and data
fields. This was one of the most powerful innovations introduced in version 6.0.
Assigning an account manager
Every account, whether big or small, whether prospect or active client,
should have a real live person in charge of it. This should be a basic principle
of your client retention strategy. You can assign account managers in many
different ways, based on product lines or on geography, for example. If you
pick geography, you can base the assignment on a state, counties, a range of
ZIP codes, telephone area codes, or a few other pieces of data.
As tempting as it is, resist the urge to use telephone area codes as the basis
for assigning account managers. Not only do area codes change fairly fre-
quently, but with the growing use of cell phones, area codes are less and less
related to geography. 
If you decide that states are the most appropriate way to assign an account
manager, you can enter a field expression in the Account Manager field that
automatically assigns the salesperson as soon as you enter the state. With the
LOOKUP.INI technology, you could do the same thing, but the user needed to
move his or her cursor into the Account Manager field for an assignment to
happen. This is much better. Figure 25-10 shows how to make this happen.
Changing the face of GoldMine
with Record Typing
You can use Record Typing to make really profound changes to the way in
which you use GoldMine. Perhaps you want to have several different kinds of
records in the same database. For example, perhaps you want records for
clients, vendors, and employees as well.
295
Chapter 25: Creating New Labels and Fields 

If you had a single field for Record Type, you could specify whether a particu-
lar record was a vendor, a client, or an employee. Based on the data you
enter, GoldMine can completely reconfigure the entire screen. Virtually every
field you see on the Vendor window can be different from what you see on
the Employee window.
To be more specific, you might want the first Key field in the Employee window
to house a social security number. For the Vendor window, you might want a
federal ID number. For the Client window, you might want an account number.
Based on that Record Type field, the label for Key 1 would automatically
change to accommodate to whatever type of information is appropriate.
Taking this a step further, you can change virtually every label to coincide
with the type of information this account has.
You can also control the GM+View tab (see Chapter 28) this same way. The
limits are your imagination, or the experience of the GoldMine dealer with
whom you are working.
If you select the Expression toggle switch, you can then enter a valid dBASE
expression to have GoldMine calculate a value for the field. For example, if
you have a field for Lease Signing Date and a field for Length of Lease, you
could have a third calculated field for the Lease Termination Date.
Record Typing is one of the more complex and sometimes problematic areas
of GoldMine. If you decide to make use of this feature, you should probably
enlist the help of an experienced dealer or consultant.

Creating and Modifying
Lookup Lists
In This Chapter
 Using existing lookup lists
 Customizing lookup lists
 Deleting standard entries
 Creating new entries
 Setting search options
 Using correct punctuation
M
any of the GoldMine standard fields and virtually any custom fields
you create come equipped with lookup lists. These lists can contain
prerecorded choices for entry into each such field. A number of advantages
exist to having and using these lists.
These lists are a particular boon to those who never took or didn’t like typing
class. So if you belong to the hunt-and-peck school of typing, you’ll find each
lookup list to be a real timesaver. If you got an A in typing class but flunked
spelling class, the lookup lists are there for you, too.
More important, the lookup lists help ensure that your entries into a field
are consistent with those of everyone else on your team or with what you
did last month. This consistency pays off when you want to generate reports
that are sorted on one of these fields because Schenectady will be spelled
the exact same way in every record. So the accounts from Schenectady will
appear together in reports sorted by city. Otherwise, who knows?
Frequently throughout the various GoldMine manuals and in the help files,
you see these lists referred to as F2 lookup lists. The term F2 is a holdover
from the days of DOS when users pressed particular function keys (in this
case, F2) to access lookup lists. F2 and lookup lists are the same thing, and so
you sometimes see them together in the same phrase.

Using Existing Lookup Lists
Every GoldMine field that can have a lookup list has a right arrow displayed
to the right of its data field. You can see this arrow as soon as you click in any
field that has a lookup list. If you see this arrow, you know a list exists that
you can use. Figure 26-1 shows a typical lookup list associated with the
Phone Extension field on the main screen.
As soon as you click the right arrow next to the field, a list similar to that
shown in Figure 26-1 appears. If data was already in the field you just came
from, that selection is highlighted in bold within the lookup list. Throughout
the list, all the choices are arranged alphabetically. If more choices exist than
can fit in one display window, you can scroll up and down using the scroll
buttons on the right side of the lookup list.
If the choice you want is visible in the window, you can simply double-click it
to send it into the data field. Unless some special punctuation exists (see the
“Using the punctuation tools” section, later in this chapter), this choice
replaces whatever is already in the data field.
Customizing Your Lookup Lists
One of the first things you need to do after installing GoldMine is to assemble
all the lookup entries you want to use. Solicit from the key people using the
system the choices they need in each field.
Figure 26-1:
The lookup
list for the
Phone
Extension
field.
298
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Deleting the standard lookup entries
For some reason, in version after version, the developers of GoldMine con-
tinue to supply a standard set of lookup lists whether you want them or not.
Likely, you don’t want most of the standard GoldMine lookups. To delete an
existing entry, follow these steps after you have displayed the particular
field’s lookup list:
1. Highlight the choice you want to remove.
2. Click the Delete button.
3. Confirm that you really want to delete this choice.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 until you have removed all the entries you
want to get rid of.
If the lookup list is long and you want to delete all the entries, then the use of
the delete key followed by the Y key is very handy. Hunt and peck typists will
find this especially fun. You can clean out a list in no time!
During the installation process, you can elect to install blank lookup lists.
That’s probably a good idea. If GoldMine has already been installed, however,
with a bunch of extraneous lookups, then you will have to go through the
preceding steps to clear them out.
Creating new entries
The Lookup Window dialog box contains the New button (refer to Figure
26-1) that allows you to enter new items into a lookup list. To create a new
lookup list choice, follow these steps:
1. Click the New button on the Lookup Window dialog box to gain access
to all the existing lookup choices for a particular field.
2. Enter your choice in the F2 Entry dialog box.
3. Confirm your entry by clicking OK.
Your new entries are automatically placed alphabetically into the lookup list
for that field.
If you have especially long lists and you want some particular entries at the
top, you can put numbers or nonalphabetic characters in front of the entries
to move them to the top; for example, 1 - Xeon, 2 - Argon, 3 - Helium, 4- Dirt.  
299
Chapter 26: Creating and Modifying Lookup Lists 

Setting lookup list options
In addition to deleting and creating lookup list entries, you can also customize
your lookup lists to make them easier for others (as well as for you) to use. Click
the Setup button in the Lookup Window dialog box (refer to Figure 26-1). The
dialog box shown in Figure 26-2 appears, which contains the following options:
 Allow Blank Input: Allows you to enter and leave the field without
entering any data.
 Force Valid Input: Forces you to enter data that corresponds exactly to
some entry in the lookup list.
 Insert Closest Match: Allows GoldMine to select the closest match from
the lookup list and enter it into the field. This option can help shorten
data entry time for experienced data entry operators.
 Capitalize First Letter: No matter how you capitalize your data,
GoldMine automatically overrides it and capitalizes the first letter of
each word. This might be appropriate for a person’s name or for a coun-
try, but is applicable only if you’re manually entering the data rather
than selecting from the F2 lookup list.
 Pop-Up when Selected: Forces the lookup list to appear immediately as
soon as you enter a field.
 Allow Adding: Allows users to add entries to the lookup list.
Adding to, editing, and deleting from lookup lists should be an administra-
tive task, and I recommend that you assign such tasks to only one or two
key people for coordination. Otherwise, you’ll end up with a complete
hodgepodge of conflicting and confusing codes and choices. Major mess.

Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

 Allow Editing: Allows users to edit entries in the lookup list.
 Allow Deleting: Allows users to delete entries from the lookup list.
 Auto Fill: As you type, GoldMine automatically places the closest match-
ing entry from the lookup in the field. This is often a better option than
Pop-Up when Selected, providing a little more flexibility when you are
manually typing an entry.
 Import Lookup Entries from Another Field: Often, one field in GoldMine
uses the exact same set of lookups as another. A field for State/Province
is a good example. This option allows you to essentially copy one field’s
lookups to another field. If you already have items in your lookup list
and you import entries from another field, these new entries are merged
alphabetically with those that already exist in the lookup list.
Using the punctuation tools
You can include four special punctuation tools in your lookup lists. These tools
allow you to program some advanced functionality into your lookups. I explain
these tools in the following sections.
Making remarks (//)
The double forward slash (//) separates your actual data from comments you
want in the lookup list. Nothing that appears to the right of the slashes is
actually put into the data field.
A typical example of the use of these slashes is in the Acct Mngr field.
Especially when you need multiple entries, you want to use short codes for
each account manager. If you were to spell out each manager’s entire name
and wanted three or four of them in one field, all the names just wouldn’t fit.
So you probably need to use their initials.
The downside of using initials is that other people on the team may not rec-
ognize the initials. The double slashes allow you to have the full name of
the account manager following her initials, so you can use the short codes
and still ensure that everyone else understands the meaning of each code.
Figure 26-3 shows a typical example of the use of the double forward slash.
Only your data in the lookup list actually goes into the data field. Nothing to
the right of the slashes is transferred.
301
Chapter 26: Creating and Modifying Lookup Lists 

Appending data (;)
Normally, when you select a choice from a lookup list, your choice overwrites
whatever was already in the data field. The semicolon, as well as the percent
sign, allows you to add your selection to the already existing data without
removing the original data. Figure 26-4 illustrates the use of these semicolons.
If a choice in your lookup list has a semicolon immediately after the data
itself, selecting that choice places it in the data field following the existing
data, separated by a comma and a space. Using this technique, you can have
multiple selections in your data fields.
When using multiple selections, you can quickly run out of space in your data
field. Be aware that you need to count not only the actual characters in each
selection but also the comma and the space that separate each choice in the
data field.

semicolons

list.

302
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

One field begets another (~)
The tilde (~) is the most sophisticated of the punctuation options in the
lookup lists. You can use the tilde to specify that whatever follows is a dBASE
expression that will compute the entry into the field. For example, you can
set a field equal to another field, or you can set a field equal to today’s date,
as shown in Figure 26-5.
The following are some examples of adding dBASE expressions to compute
an entry:
 ~Company places whatever data is currently in the Company field into
this field.
 ~dtoc(date( )) places the current date in the field in character format; for
example, 09/08/03.
 ~Contact2->UserDef03 takes the information from the third user-defined
field in the Contact2.dbf file and puts it into this field.
You can also use this programming technique to improve upon the standard
lookup list associated with the Dear field. Out of the box, GoldMine has Dear
field choices of Dr., Mr., Mrs., and Ms. You can keep these choices, but you may
want to add several expressions that append last names to these salutations.

Automated Processes
In This Chapter
 Designing Automated Processes
 Creating tracks
 Creating events
 Running processes
A
utomated Processes are routines that sit quietly in the background,
looking for events or conditions within each record that trigger some
action, or even a whole series of actions. You can use the Automated
Processes feature to perform a set of actions to accomplish a specific task.
The Automated Processes feature is one of the key features that differentiates
GoldMine from the vast majority of its competitors. I am convinced that prop-
erly implemented Automated Processes are the most powerful tools for grow-
ing your business that you will ever encounter.
You can design an unlimited number of Automated Processes to emulate a
wide variety of already-existing processes within your business. You can also
design some of the processes that have never been manually implemented
due to lack of resources. The clear advantage of the GoldMine Automated
Processes is that they never forget to do their assigned tasks, never call in
sick or go on vacation, and never ask for a raise. Automated Processes just
keep doing their job for you without complaint and without fail.
In most industries, selling something to a prospect for the first time takes a
considerable effort, and staying in touch enough after the sale to have a rea-
sonable expectation of a repeat sale takes further effort. Many sales consul-
tants estimate that it takes at least six touches before you can close a new
sale. A touch is some sort of communication, whether in person, on the
phone, via mail, fax, or e-mail.
The average professional salesperson gives up after fewer than three touches
due to the pressures of other commitments and other opportunities. The
whole concept behind the GoldMine Automated Processes is to provide the
ability to perform most of these touches without any human intervention. (Of
course, the best scenario is when the prospect or customer doesn’t realize
that the computer, and not the salesperson, is doing the touching.) This

chapter presents some simple examples of how to get the computer to do the
work that salespeople or administrators are either doing now or that they are
supposed to be doing but never seem to get to.
In addition, I show some examples of more complex Automated Processes
that may be effective after the initial sale. Anyone with a background in mar-
keting knows that selling something to an existing customer is easier and
more cost effective than finding a brand-new customer for one of your prod-
ucts or services. I have seen many statistics claiming that finding a new cus-
tomer is six times more expensive than selling to an existing one. I don’t have
a clue where that statistic came from, and my work in client retention tells
me otherwise, but any salesperson would be wise to put the GoldMine
Automated Processes to work to keep his or her clients.
Designing and Implementing
Automated Processes
Every successful business has processes. A process may be as simple as an
edict that when the sales manager gives a salesperson a lead, he or she must
follow up within one day. Another example is that whenever a salesperson
returns from an initial sales call, he or she should immediately send a follow-
up thank-you letter.
A more sophisticated process may be one that performs a series of follow-up
steps after talking with a prospect at a trade show — an initial thank-you letter
via e-mail, a second mailing with brochures, and then a scheduled follow-up
phone call by the salesperson. (Check out the sidebar, “My favorite Automated
Process,” elsewhere in this chapter, for a good example of such a process.)
A good starting point when you’re designing an Automated Process (AP for
short) for GoldMine is to examine all those processes you already have in
place. You want to have the computer, as opposed to people, performing as
many of the grunt-work steps as you can. This step is often the place where a
good, experienced consultant can help you take a fresh look at procedures
and policies.
Next, you should examine all the potential areas of your business where no
processes exist, but where they could be implemented and could be beneficial.
Keep in mind that just because you have a process in place doesn’t mean you
should just blindly stick it into GoldMine. Although implementing just one
good AP can have a huge positive effect on your bottom line, implementing a
306
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

not-so-well-thought-out process may not have the positive effect you hoped
for. In fact, automating a poor procedure, or implementing a good procedure
poorly, will only cause your new system to screw you up faster and more effi-
ciently than you could ever imagine. This is a great time to reexamine all your
business processes and do some reengineering.
307
Chapter 27: Automated Processes
My favorite Automated Process
FrontRange suggests implementing several key
types of Automated Processes: performing
administrative tasks, managing leads, following
up on contacts, sending warranty renewal
reminders, automating direct-mail campaigns,
and validating data. You can design and imple-
ment an Automated Process to help you accom-
plish any task that you want done automatically.
When I first began my computer consulting
business, I occasionally exhibited at trade
shows, which were expensive and a lot of work.
I wanted to take advantage of any leads I got at
these shows. After several days of standing in
our booth, I went back to my office with a stack
of business cards. These cards were like manna
from heaven — hot leads that I just couldn’t let
go to waste.
After being out of the office for a few days, I
returned to a handful of crises that demanded
my immediate attention. Before I knew it, my
stack of hot leads was in my desk drawer, for-
gotten. I did this for three straight trade shows,
and I just couldn’t understand why trade-show
results were so poor!
So my company turned over a new leaf and
implemented an Automated Process for trade
shows that never fails us. At the end of the first
day of a trade show, as the other vendors head
for the bar, we grab our computer and head for
my hotel room. All day long we collected leads
and put them directly into GoldMine. We make
sure our AP has started and we then head for
the bar ourselves: Step One of the Trade Show
Automated Process has begun. The computer
e-mails and faxes each new lead, sending a
letter that basically says, “Thanks for stopping
by our trade-show booth today. We were just
overwhelmed by all the interest and activity
today, but nonetheless, your account would be
very important to us. When we get back to our
office on Monday, we will send out the literature
you requested. If you can’t wait until then, call
Jane at our office. . . .”
We repeat this process after each day of the
trade show. When we get back to the office, Step
Two begins. A notice is sent, directing the appro-
priate person to mail the requested literature.
GoldMine assigns an account manager to the
account based on geography and also generates
a cover letter. After all these processes are done,
GoldMine schedules the account manager to
make a follow-up call in one week. The process
checks to see whether the prospect has called
us already, which prevents us from appearing
out of control.
The response to this Automated Process is
amazing. Literally 35 percent of the people we
contact each night call us the next day, stunned
that we responded so quickly. The early bird
catches the worm: While our competitors cele-
brate down in the bar, we do our follow-up mar-
keting to make sure that they have as little to
celebrate later as possible. And it works!

I classify processes into three categories that represent all the major life
stages of an account:
 Hunting: This stage is the entire sales cycle from suspect to prospect
to a closed deal. Many steps exist that most companies routinely follow,
or should, to move an account from suspect status to becoming a client.
 Farming: After prospects become clients, they should get just as much,
if not more, attention as they got before. A well-known fact is that it’s
more cost-effective to get additional business from an existing account
than it is to find a new account to replace one you’ve lost or failed to
penetrate.
 Resurrecting: Sometimes accounts are lost; it happens to everyone.
Sometimes it happens for reasons beyond your control, or sometimes
due to neglect. Just because a client has left the fold doesn’t mean you
should give up. Implementing some Automated Processes to stay in
touch with former clients often reaps some surprising and positive
results.
Developing Tracks
One of the confusing aspects of Automated Processes is the terminology,
which is probably all new to you. One of the key terms to understand is
track. GoldMine uses this term interchangeably with process. Tracks consist
of one or more events, which are step-by-step instructions that GoldMine
evaluates to perform a series of activities. Each event is composed of a
trigger and an action. A trigger, such as a warranty period about to expire,
causes a specific action, such as sending a letter about your extended
warranty plan.
Setting process options
To set up a new Automated Process or to view existing Automated Processes,
choose Tools➪Automated Processes➪Manage Processes from the main menu.
The Automated Processes Center window, shown in Figure 27-1, displays a
summary of what has already been developed. The window lists all your
processes, each one’s options as well as the associated events. You can
develop a new Automated Process by using the AP Wizard, which guides
you through setting up your Automated Process as follows:
308
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

1. To start the Automated Process Wizard, choose Tools➪Automated
Processes➪Manage Processes and then click the New Automated
Processes icon (it looks like a yellow gear).
The Automated Process Wizard appears, as shown in Figure 27-2. The first
two fields in the AP Wizard enable you to name the process and to give it
a code number. The name of each process should indicate the function or
purpose of that track. Tracks are arranged alphabetically by the process
code you enter and are displayed this way in various AP dialog boxes. If a
process has no code (another possibility), it will be listed first.
2. Give your process a name and a code (and possibly assign ownership
of this process to someone else) and click Next.
On the second page of the AP Wizard, shown in Figure 27-3, the following

• Allow Only One Attachment of This Process per Contact:
Prevents the track from being attached more than once to a partic-
ular record. For example, you would use this option for a process
that sends a thank-you letter to a first-time customer.
• Execute This Process Immediately upon Attachment: Starts pro-
cessing the track as soon as a user attaches it to one or more
records.
• Execute This process Only when Scanning for Processes:
Prevents a track from being executed even if you select the preced-
ing choice.
• Restart This Process Each Time that It Ends: Reattaches the track
as soon as processing for the track is done.
• Allow Users to Attach This Process: Allows manual attachment of
the track by the system users. You would use manual attachment
for a process that is not run for every account.
• Attach This Process to All New Contact Records: Causes
GoldMine to automatically attach the track to each new contact
record, which could be useful in conjunction with use of a monitor
track (see the sidebar, “The monitor track: An elegant approach,”
later in this chapter).
3. Select the options you want and then click Next.
The next step in the AP Wizard, the Events page, appears. If you are creat-
ing a new Automated Process, this page is empty, as shown in Figure 27-4.
Events are the actual activities the AP is causing. For example, an Event
might be a scheduled phone call or an appointment, or an Event might be
a letter that is automatically sent. The Events page enables you to specify
these activities.

Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

It is critical that a process that performs a particular task, such as send-
ing out an e-mail after a trade show, have a setting that does not allow
that action to happen again. I know someone who created his own AP
and sent out 1,000-plus e-mails to clients in his database. The next day, he
cranked up his APs again and resent the e-mail to all the same clients —
all because he didn’t have anything in his process to see whether it had
been previously sent. The first process option shown in the upper-right
pane of Figure 27-1 is what regulates this.
4. Click the New button if you are creating a new Automated Process.
The Event Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 27-5. The
“Programming event properties” section, later in this chapter, describes
the options in the Event Properties dialog box.

6. Click the Finish button.
The AP Wizard brings you back to the Automated Processes Center
window, similar to that shown in Figure 27-1, except that your new AP is
listed. 
Programming event properties
The Event Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 27-5) contains important
options for setting up your Automated Processes. The dialog box’s options
are divided into three groups: Event, Trigger, and Action. The following sec-
tions describe the options in each group.
Preemptive events
Two kinds of events exist in GoldMine: preemptive and sequential. Every track
can have many of each kind of event, but each track must have at least one
sequential event. Every event is given a numerical sequence from 0 to 999.
Preemptive events are conditional statements, or more simply, they are IF
statements. For example, IF you want to send a notice to all customers that
have not purchased anything in the last three months, you can put in a pre-
emptive statement that says, “If a sale occurred in the last three months in
their History, then remove this track from the record.”
You can number preemptive events only from 0 to 99 and, therefore, they are
always at the beginning of the track. When you initially number your events,
do not use consecutive numbers; allow some space to interject another event
later. As a guideline, number your preemptive events 5, 10, 15, and so on.
Usually when you program preemptive events, you’re trying to eliminate
records from contention. Thus, try to create the logic within your preemptive
statement to eliminate the record, rather than to confirm that this process is
appropriate for this record.
Sequential events
Sequential events are always numbered from 100 to 999, and you must always
have at least one sequential event in each track. Because the sequential
events actually perform actions, if you didn’t have at least one, the track
would never do anything.
Just as with preemptive events, you should allow some room for growth, and
make sure to number them in increments of 5 or 10. Sequential events are
programmed into the system with the same procedure you use for preemp-
tives. The only difference is that in the Event Properties dialog box, you
select the Sequential radio button rather than the Preemptive radio button.
312
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Choosing a trigger
A trigger is the condition within the contact record’s data that determines
what action should be taken. For example, this might be an amount of time
that passed since the last time this client was visited, or perhaps a scheduled
activity that requires a notice being sent to a manager.
In the Event Properties dialog box, the Trigger On drop-down list enables you
to choose from the following seven options to trigger an activity:
 Elapsed Days: This trigger activates as soon as the number of days you
enter has gone by since the last event was processed; or if this is the
first event in your AP, since the track was attached to this account.
 Immediate: This trigger sets GoldMine to immediately execute the
action associated with the event.
 Detail Record: This trigger looks for the addition of a specific Detail,
Document Link, Referral, or Other Contact. Don’t be confused by the
name Detail Record. This Detail Record can trigger on almost any kind of
new supplemental information.
 History Activity: This trigger looks for the existence of a specific type of
history record in order to activate — for example, the completion of a
sales call with a result code of INT, indicating that it’s an initial sales call.
 Scheduled Activity: This trigger looks for a specific type of calendar
activity. For example, it may look for a scheduled training class before
reserving a projector.
 dBASE Condition: This one is triggered by a dBASE expression you
build using the GoldMine expression builder.
 Disabled: This option turns off the trigger for this event. Without a trig-
ger, the event will never happen. This can be used to document, to
debug, or simply to space things for easier reading.

Chapter 27: Automated Processes
The monitor track: An elegant approach
If you’re likely to have more than one Automated
Process (and you should assume that you will),
using a monitor track is a clever way to imple-
ment your system. The monitor track (also
referred to by some consultants as an observer
track or a watchdog track) is the only track that
records are ever attached to. In fact, the moni-
tor track should automatically be attached to
every record. Then you won’t ever have to
worry about attaching records to tracks at all.
The monitor track is like the traffic cop for the
whole Automated Process system: It watches
out for all the possible conditions within a record
and directs each record to the appropriate track
or tracks. Because one track (the monitor track)
can call another track (for example, the trade-
show track), using the monitor track is an elegant
programming approach to developing a very
sophisticated series of processes.

Actions speak louder than words
The Perform Action drop-down list in the Event Properties dialog box (refer
to Figure 27-5) supplies you with many options to choose from. These
options are actions that will be performed when the trigger event you choose
from the Trigger On drop-down list occurs, as discussed in the previous sec-
tion. The actions you may choose from are as follows:
 Print Form: Prints or faxes a merge form when the event is triggered.
 E-mail Message: Generates and sends an Internet-based e-mail template
when the event is triggered.
 Print Report: Prints a report when the event is triggered. Some reports,
like the Address and Phone Report, print the entire database every time.
Make sure not to have your AP print this report, or similar ones, for
every record it scans.
 Schedule Activity: Schedules a calendar activity for a selected user
when the event is triggered.
 Create History: Adds a history record to the contact record when the
event is triggered.
 Create Detail: Adds a detail record to the contact record when the event
is triggered.
 Add to Group: Adds the contact to a specified group when the event is
triggered.
 Update Field: Updates one of the fields in the contact record with the
result of a dBASE expression when the event is triggered.
 Remove Track: Removes the track from the contact record when the
event is triggered, thus ensuring that no further actions will be taken for
this account.
 Add a New Track: Attaches a new track to the contact record when the
event is triggered. See the sidebar, “The monitor track: An elegant
approach,” in this chapter for some thoughts on when to use this
approach.
 Branch to Event: Directs GoldMine to proceed to a specified event, and
uses the code numbers of the events as a reference.
 Run Application: Starts an external application (for example, a Visual
Basic program) when the event is triggered.
Executing a Process
Remember that processes, however well designed, will not work unless they
are attached to records and then told to run. I discuss attaching records in
314
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

the “Setting process options” section, earlier in this chapter. To run a
process, follow these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Tools➪Automated Processes➪Execute
Process.
The Automated Processes Execution dialog box, shown in Figure 27-6,
appears.
2. Attach one or more records to a track by selecting the Attach Track to
Selected Contacts option and choosing from the drop-down list.
3. Click the Process button.
This causes the Process Monitor window, shown in Figure 27-7, to imme-
diately appear.
Figure 27-7:
The Process
Monitor
window.
Figure 27-6:

315
Chapter 27: Automated Processes

The upper pane of the Process Monitor window displays the elapsed time,
the record currently being processed, the total number of records scanned,
the number of events that have been triggered, and the title of the track cur-
rently being processed.
From the Process Monitor window, you can
 Stop all processes to stop all processing for all contacts.
 Stop selected processes to stop the current track for the current record
from processing.
 Copy logs to Windows Clipboard to copy the log entries in the lower
pane of the display to Windows Clipboard. From there, you can paste the
information into your word processor or into a spreadsheet for further
reporting.
Automated Processes are the most powerful features in GoldMine. Any con-
tact management system can keep track of names, addresses, and appoint-
ments. But these Automated Processes, when properly implemented, are like
a Marketing department in a box. Putting this together properly will easily
pay for the whole installation of GoldMine, so don’t neglect it.
The most important suggestion I can make with regard to Automated
Processes is that you should seriously consider enlisting the aid of an experi-
enced GoldMine consultant. This advice applies to the overall design of your
processes as well as to the implementation of at least the first few processes.
The second most important suggestion is to really focus on creating these
processes because this is how GoldMine pays you back for your investment
in it.

GM+View and GM+Browser
In This Chapter
 Viewing the GM+View tab

 Using GM+Browser 
F
irst, I need to talk about terminology. Older versions of GoldMine had a
display tab called GM+View. This was used to display various kinds of
data that lived outside GoldMine. If you were clever, you could even have
multiple GM+View displays. Now, with GoldMine 8 you can use GM+Browser
to display and scroll through multiple GM+View screens.
Every record in GoldMine 8 contains an HTML-based GM+View tab, which
stores customized Web pages. These pages, or views, can include rich con-
tent, such as text and graphics. The GM+View tab is particularly useful when
you have a variety of graphics associated with your accounts. For example, a
recruiter or a talent agency could use the GM+View tab to store a photo of
each client with that client’s record. A real estate agency may use it to store a
photo or a series of photos of each property it has listed. Going a step fur-
ther, for particularly high-valued properties, a real estate agency might want
to store an entire walk-through video tour with sound on the GM+View tab.
Basically, you can think of the GM+View tab as a customized Web page for
each account in GoldMine. Any type of information you have ever seen on a
Web site can probably be housed in the GM+View tab.
A key to making good use of this tab is to understand how flexible it is. You
can have many different views set up, and the view shown for any particular
account is controlled by rules that you set up. The data in a particular field
can also determine what view is displayed, or you can use a dBASE expression
if a single field is not sufficient to control the view. Finally, you can leave it up
to the user to determine the view when he or she activates a record and wants
to see what’s on the GM+View tab. If you’re really technically inclined, you can
add some HTML code to your GM+View and further automate the display.

In this chapter, you find out how to access information in the GM+View tab
and how to set up some simple views.
Displaying the GM+View Tab
Every GoldMine record has its own GM+View tab. By simply clicking that tab,
you see what information is associated with that particular record. Figure 28-1
shows a sample of a GM+View tab with two pictures associated with the active
GoldMine record. A real estate agent might find a display like this to be helpful.
Each GM+View tab can have one or more links to Web sites. The links in the
GM+View tab are like hyperlinks on a Web page; just click the link to go to
that Web site. For example, you might have a link to a mapping system, such
as MapQuest, that displays the exact location of the active account, or per-
haps gives you the driving instructions. You need to click that link to display
the map or instructions.

Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Creating GM+View Templates
Only users with Master rights can design or even edit GM+View templates.
The template contains all the instructions needed to actually display a series
of graphics or links. To create a GM+View template, follow these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Web➪SetupGM+View.
The GM+View Tab Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 28-2.
All the existing templates appear in the upper-left box. You specify the
default template by selecting it from the drop-down list on the upper-
right part of the dialog box. The default template shows up automati-
cally for every record in the database, unless some rule you have set
countermands that. In the lower panel, you can see a preview of each
template to get a feel for what it will actually look like.
2. Click the New button to display the Edit GM+View window, shown in
Figure 28-3.
Enter a descriptive name for your new template.
3. Position your cursor wherever you want text or a graphic to be dis-
played and right-click.
Your choices for adding text, graphics, or links are shown in Figure 28-3.
Right-clicking anywhere in the initially blank area accesses this shortcut
menu.
Figure 28-2:

Chapter 28: GM+View and GM+Browser

After you have properly positioned your cursor, you can place fields or text
files anywhere on the window. By right-clicking and selecting Insert, you get
three additional choices, as shown in Figure 28-4.

Figure 28-3:

320
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Inserting fields and text files
When you right-click and choose Insert➪Insert Field, you get yet another
menu, as shown in Figure 28-5. The Contact Details menu choice gives you
most of the critical fields from the upper portion of the main GoldMine screen.
These fields are usually on display right in front of you anyway, so I’m not sure
why it would be necessary to repeat them in this view. However, if you select
the Include a Text File choice, you can have an associated file readily displayed
in addition to the standard GoldMine fields.
Inserting links
Links, I believe, are more useful to have in the GM+View tab. By inserting a link,
you can associate a GoldMine record with one or more Web pages. For exam-
ple, you can include a link to a map with or without driving instructions. You
could have a link to a weather site showing the weather forecast for this loca-
tion. Perhaps more significantly, you could have a link to a news service or
credit bureau Web site showing the latest news about each of your accounts.
Following the instructions within GoldMine itself, you end up with a link in
the GM+View tab that you still have to click in order to access the Web page.
If you’re good with HTML code, or know someone who is, you can automate
this so the requested Web appears without any further clicking on your part.
Figure 28-6 shows an example of the code that automatically displays
MapQuest info for each contact record in GoldMine.
Figure 28-5:
Inserting

321
Chapter 28: GM+View and GM+Browser

Inserting pictures
Inserting graphics is a third and powerful choice. This seems to be an obvi-
ous one for real estate agencies, talent agencies, and recruiters. But the pos-
sibilities for using photographs, or even WAV (sound) files are endless. You
may want to have photos of equipment that each account has on its shop
floor, for example. Insurance companies might want photos of damaged cars
and buildings to assist in claim evaluation.
You can insert one or more graphic files into a template and then manipulate
its positioning and alignment by following these steps:
1. From the main menu, choose Web➪GM+View Tab; click the Edit
button on the GM+View Tab Settings dialog box.
2. In the Edit GM+View window (refer to Figure 28-3), click the Insert
Picture icon on the local toolbar.
The Picture dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 28-7.
3. Click the Browse button and locate the picture you want to insert.

322
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

4. In the Alternate Text field, type what text you want shown if the pic-
ture can’t be displayed.
The alternate text selection allows you to specify some standard text in
the event that your primary source is unavailable. This could happen,
for example, if you are disconnected from either a disk drive housing the
graphic or if you are disconnected from the Internet.
5. Set the alignment of your picture, the border thickness, and spacing;
click OK when you’re done.
The layout and spacing sections of the dialog box allow you to position
your pictures relative to the borders of the tab view and in relation to
other pictures and text you may be displaying.
Selecting Your Template
Regulating who sees various templates requires Master rights. The starting
point for template selection is the GM+View Tab Setting dialog box (refer to
Figure 28-2). You can set up any template as the default template by selecting
that template in the drop-down list in the upper-right part of the dialog box.
Then, unless overridden by some other instruction, every user will see the
default template associated with every record.
If you want to be cleverer, you can set up rules that govern the display of var-
ious templates. These rules can be based on the following:
 The value in one particular field
 A dBASE expression that might be a function of several fields
 User selection
Figure 28-7:
Inserting
a picture
in the
GM+View
tab.
323
Chapter 28: GM+View and GM+Browser

The following steps show you how to set up these rules:
1. From the main menu, choose Web➪GM+View Tab.
The GM+View Tab Settings dialog box appears (refer to Figure 28-2).
2. Click the Rules button.
GoldMine displays the dialog box shown in Figure 28-8.
3. Select an option to determine the template selection condition.
You can choose to have the template selected based on the field value, a
dBASE expression, or to allow users to select the template themselves.
For example, you might select the Field Value option and choose
Account Mgr for the field name. Then, by clicking the New button, you
are led through a series of selections.
In this example, you are shown a listing of all the Account Managers in
your company. Select one. By doing this, you can now have separate tem-
plates for each Account Manager. Moe and Larry will each see potentially
different aspects of each account’s business. Perhaps Curly sees nothing.
4. Click OK when you’re done setting up your rules.
Changing the rules so that different GoldMine users see different GM+Views
might be relevant in the financial services arena, where investment bankers
and stock brokers are not allowed to see any aspect of each others’ business.
If you don’t need to be so restrictive, you can have multiple templates and
allow each user to decide which template he or she needs to see at any time. In
the GM+View Tab Rules for Template Selection dialog box (refer to Figure 28-8),
if you select the User Selected option, all templates become available to each
Figure 28-8:
Using a field
to determine
a GM+View
template.
324
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

user. When Moe brings up a particular GoldMine record, he can right-click in
the GM+View Tab area and select from the entire list of templates. This is a
great way to organize a large amount of graphic data that might be too confus-
ing to display all in one window.
Using GM+Browser
Don’t feel alone if you’re confused by the terminology of GM+View and
GM+Browser. The GM+Browser is just a way to automatically scroll through
all the different GM+View tabs you may have. In addition, by default,
GM+Browser displays your default Internet Explorer page as its first tab.
1. From the main menu, choose Web➪GM+Browser.
The GM+Browser Settings dialog box appears (see Figure 28-9).
2. Click the GM+Browser Setup button, as shown in Figure 28-9.
The screen shown in Figure 28-10 immediately appears. By highlighting
any available GM+Views (in the left panel) and clicking the >> box, you
tell the GM+Browser to display that particular GM+View.

my default

325
Chapter 28: GM+View and GM+Browser

3. Save your selected GM+Views by clicking the Save button.
GoldMine returns you to the GM+Browser display, similar to that shown
in Figure 28-9, but with the additional views you’ve just requested. Each
view is shown as a tab at the top of the display.
With the assistance of a good GoldMine professional, you can display not
only Web pages within GM+Browser but also data from other applications.
Good examples might be to show accounting transactions, or inventory items
with, or without photos.

I
make the assumption that you already have a Web site and that you have
the ability to make some changes to it. That being said, you have an
opportunity to truly automate the collection of leads and your responses to
those prospective customers.
GoldMine’s Web Import utility helps you create the pages on your Web site
that collect information (those are your Web forms) as well as the behind-the-
scenes scripts that grab the information from each Web form and put it all
into GoldMine.
Getting the contact information into GoldMine cannot be the end of the
process. After the data is in GoldMine, you need a plan to respond. And,
responding quickly is a key ingredient. That’s where some well-designed
Automated Processes come into play.
In this chapter, I show you how to set up a simple data entry form, gather that
data and put it into GoldMine, and then hand it off to an Automated Process.
Preparing to Link GoldMine
and Your Web Site
One of the basic ideas behind a successful Web Import implementation is
that prospects and customers have to be drawn to your Web site and moti-
vated to provide real contact information to you.

In the past — before Web Import existed — we attracted people to our com-
pany Web site because we had brilliantly written and insightful articles that
we knew everyone would want. And we gave them away for free, believing
that every reader would realize that the best source for good consulting was
the group that had written all those good articles. Well, I have to tell you, that
idea never worked very well. I now know why: It’s just in the nature of people
who like to download free stuff, and I won’t say any more.
We made a major improvement in our lead generation and in our sales
pipeline when we stopped literally giving away free stuff for free. Instead, now
the price for free stuff is providing a set of valid contact information. When
designing your Web forms, focus on just those pieces of information that you
really, really need in order to follow up. The more you ask for, the less likely
you are to get anything meaningful. At the very least, though, get a name, a
phone number, and an e-mail address.
GoldMine’s Web Import is the ideal tool for making sure that you actually get
that valid contact information before providing information. One of the keys
to ensuring that people give you their real contact information is to let them
know that your system automatically sends the documents, files, or other
information to the e-mail address they provide. Therefore, if they give you
something like joe.blow➝bc.com, they just won’t get anything in return. They
other important key is to continually provide useful information from your
Web site. If the information is perceived as useful, people will come (assum-
ing that you market your Web site). Continually updating your offerings keeps
a steady flow of repeat visitors.
The bottom line is to avoid allowing visitors to simply download your valu-
able information without giving you something in return — that being their
valuable information. And with that, GoldMine can begin an automated,
proactive marketing campaign! In the rest of this chapter, I discuss how to get
that information from a Web form into GoldMine.
Designing Scripts
GoldMine leads you through the creation of the script that is quietly behind
each of your Web forms. To begin this process, choose Web from the main
menu and then choose Setup Web Import. This brings you to the first screen
for building your script, as shown in Figure 29-1.
GoldMine now requires a password for your Web import, and it must match
the password contained within the Web form script. In the Web Import
Profiles area of the screen in Figure 29-1, you enter a unique name for your
script. The whole point of developing each of your scripts is to have the
input entered on the Web form either create or update records in GoldMine. 
328
Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

After you enter a name for your Web Import profile, click the Edit button.
This brings you to the input form shown in Figure 29-2.
The fields displayed in Figure 29-2 are not only the standard fields that come
with GoldMine but also any custom fields that have been added. In addition
to specifying which fields are to be displayed on the Web form, you can also
specify which fields are used for duplicate record checking. When the
GoldMine script finds a potential duplicate record (this visitor to your Web

site already has a record in GoldMine), it opts to update the existing record
rather than create a duplicate. When you are done selecting fields, click the
Next button at the bottom right of the screen. GoldMine moves on to Step 2,
which is shown in Figure 29-3.
The first three fields shown in Figure 29-3 are all required fields. With regard
to the scripting language you are using, in general if you have a Windows
server, you use some flavor of ASP, and if you have a Linux/Unix server, you
use PHP. For the Web format language (the last field in the Step 2 form, which
is not shown in Figure 29-3), you probably want to use XML, which is a more
current and general language than the older GoldMine INI format. When fin-
ished with Step 2, click Next at the bottom of the screen. GoldMine brings
you to Step 3, which is shown in Figure 29-4.

Part VII: Customizing GoldMine 

Unless you have an extremely simplistic Web site, and Web forms in particu-
lar, you likely want to have GoldMine just provide the raw HTML code for the
labels and fields on your form. With this raw code, you or your Web designer
can then format the Web form to fit in with the design of the other pages of
your Web site. Once again, clicking Next takes you to the next and final
screen of this procedure. Step 4 is shown in Figure 29-5.
You can preview your new form from Step 4 and send the source code to an
e-mail address of your choice.
When you Save and Exit, GoldMine returns you to the screen in Figure 29-1
where you will now confirm to GoldMine that this is what you actually want.
You confirm this by entering I Want To Allow Fields To Be Updated By
WebImport. You need to type it exactly as shown.
Designing Forms
In Step 3 of the preceding section, you can select something other than raw
HTML. For example, you can select Centered, as shown in Figure 29-6. You
can certainly experiment with the choices in Step 3. If any one of them looks
good to you, you can go with that and avoid additional form design work.
One suggestion is to be consistent throughout your Web site and not switch
from one form design to another.

Ten Useful Add-Ons
In This Chapter
 Remote Access
 Handheld devices
 General utilities
 QuoteWerks
 BounceLinker
 Business Intelligence Products
 Honorable mentions
O
ver the past fifteen years, many organizations have developed add-ons
to GoldMine. In the mid-1990s, a very active and enthusiastic third-party
development group existed. That group and the number of products have
both dwindled, but a significant core of products that bears scrutiny is still
around.
This chapter cites ten of the best and most significant add-ons. I have used
them all, and they work. I have used others that work also, but I had to select
just ten to describe here. Of course, I have also used some that didn’t work
too well. I can recommend all the ones in this chapter. 
Not making it into this chapter is not necessarily an indication that the soft-
ware isn’t good. I provide Web site information for each product. In some
cases, you can purchase directly from the manufacturer, if you want. In most
cases, you can also purchase (at a Dummies discount) from www.ccc24k.com.
Remote Access
One of the most frequent demands of users is to be able to access their
data when away from the main office. This applies to workers who travel

occasionally as well as to home-based workers. Built into GoldMine 8 is the
old GoldSync methodology, so it’s hard to call this an add-on, although it is
an option for remote access.
Opinions vary about the pros and cons of synchronizing versus having online
access. More and more, the consensus is becoming that synchronizing is too
often fraught with technological challenges (it’s too hard, too slow, and doesn’t
always work quite right) and limiting users to just Internet access is a better
way to protect critical organizational data.
iGoldMine Plus
iGoldMinePlus (the successor to iGoldMine) is a product that FrontRange has
licensed from GraphOn Corporation. It works with GoldMine Corporate and
with GoldMine Premium, but not with GoldMine Standard. That restriction
arises from FrontRange’s desire to differentiate Corporate and Premium from
the Standard Version. Please note: FrontRange has now completely discontin-
ued sales (and soon support) of Standard. In addition, FrontRange says that
you can use iGoldMinePlus to access up to 35 separate applications —
including GoldMine and one of FrontRange’s other products, HEAT. Unfor-
tunately, if you try to use iGoldMine to access both GoldMine and HEAT, you
quickly discover that you need to purchase separate iGoldMine licenses.
Again, just more unfriendly and, in my opinion, inappropriate restrictions
iplaced on the licensing. 
If you want to use a FrontRange-certified product to access software on your
server, iGoldMinePlus is certainly a choice. But if you want the insider’s view,
just move on to the next section.
For more information, go to www.frontrange.com.
GoGlobal
GraphOn Corporation created GoGlobal and has licensed this technology to
FrontRange. It has basically the same capabilities that iGoldMinePlus has,
without any of the licensing restrictions. After it is set up on your computer,
it allows you to access the applications on your server. It has enough security
for most organizations, and when you’re connected, you’re using the software
almost exactly as you would if you were sitting in the main office.
For more information, go to www.graphon.com.
336
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Remote Desktop
Remote Desktop is a Microsoft product. It is actually the successor to
Terminal Services. In many cases, you already have Remote Desktop licenses
and need only to deploy this utility to enjoy remote access. 
For more information, go to www.microsoft.com.
Using Handheld Devices
Two basic methodologies exist for using your Blackberry or Treo or other
handheld device with GoldMine. One methodology actually loads your data
on your handheld; the other allows you to view and edit the data over the
Internet, but does not actually store data on your device.
Each method has its pros and cons. Having critical client data on peoples’
handhelds is a potential security issue. But please note that it’s even easier to
lose a phone than to lose a laptop.
CompanionLink
CompanionLink is a tried and tested product. It allows you to synchronize
your GoldMine data with your handheld. Of course, this puts your data
directly on the handheld. This is sometimes more convenient than systems
that have you access the data via the Internet.
For more information, go to www.companionlink.com.
wMobile
wMobile takes a different approach to connecting your handheld to
GoldMine. With its method, no data is stored on your handheld. You can view
and edit data by dialing in via the Internet. Of course, no Internet, no data,
but just about the only places you can’t get to the Internet are on airplanes
and, maybe, on subways. Soon, major airlines plan on supplying Internet con-
nectivity while in flight.
Although wMobile costs more than CompanionLink, it is my own personal pref-
erence because it eliminates the need to synchronize and greatly reduces the
security issues involved in having people running around with critical data.
For more information, go to www.w-systems.com.

Two major and well-recognized packages provide additional tools for manipu-
lating the data that goes into, comes out of, and sits in GoldMine. They have
both been around for years and they are both good.
GoldBox-7
GoldBox originated as a tool to import data into GoldMine. It has since grown
into the Swiss Army knife of utilities. Although it provides many data manipu-
lation tools, it also allows for recurring imports and linking to outside tables.
Its prior weaknesses, documentation, and user interface have all been
improved somewhat in the past few years.
It is very important that you read and observe all the caveats on the Web site
cited here. Be sure before you purchase. Caveat emptor. There is a free demo
that you can test.
For more information, go to www.redstonesoftbase.com.
Inaport
This product is a little more flexible than GoldBox, particularly in terms of
integrating with outside sources of incoming data. Also, Inaport can be very
valuable as a migration tool when switching from one CRM package to
another.
For more information, go to www.inaplex.com.
QuoteWerks
GoldMine doesn’t do quotes, which is one of the most common requests for
additional functionality. QuoteWerks tightly integrates with the GoldMine
Standard, Corporate, and Premium editions. That integration automatically
transfers fields from GoldMine directly into quotation forms. When the quote
is being prepared, using a database of products and services that QuoteWerks
maintains, QuoteWerks creates a sales forecast record directly in GoldMine.

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

QuoteWerks is the system that I have used for many years in conjunction
with GoldMine, and it has stood the test of time.
For more information, go to www.quotewerks.com.
BounceLinker
If you use GoldMine for mass e-mail marketing, you need to consider
BounceLinker. BounceLinker automates the entire process of handling e-mails
that can’t be delivered, as well as removal requests. For example, if you do an
initial e-mail blast from GoldMine to 10,000 prospects, in all likelihood at least
2,000 will not reach the recipient and possibly another 1,000 might request
removal from your mailing list.
If you have BounceLinker, those 3,000 necessary transactions will be done
automatically. It’s money well spent if you do any significant amount of mar-
keting with your GoldMine database. 
For more information, go to www.ck-soft.com.
KnowledgeSync and TaskCentre
If you are in need of a tool to develop really powerful alarms and alerts or
automation beyond what GoldMine’s Automated Processes can produce,
either KnowledgeSync or a newer product called TaskCentre is a good bet.
With these products I get daily alerts about activities that have not been com-
pleted, contracts that are on the verge of expiring and a host of other events
that might otherwise fall through the cracks. TaskCentre is a bit more graphi-
cally oriented than is KnowledgeSync, but both are excellent management
tools. For more information, go to www.vineyardsoft.com (for
KnowledgeSync) or www.orbis-software.com (for TaskCentre).

 GoldMine Standard Bites the Dust
T
he Premium Edition contains the first truly significant upgrades to
GoldMine since version 6 came out five years ago. Not only are they sig-
nificant, but these enhancements are truly positive, showing off FrontRange’s
renewed commitment and resources.
New User Interface
If you ever used GoldMine before Premium Edition, you can’t help notice the
new interface. No more four quadrants, although the same old fields are basi-
cally in the same old places. Now there’s a little more flexibility when design-
ing custom fields in this part of the screen. Oh, and, this “part of the screen,”
which used to just be called the “main screen” or the “four quadrants,” is
now called the “work area.”

Navigation from one function to another is greatly streamlined by using the
new Navigation Pane on the left side of the screen. In fact, the new user inter-
face greatly facilitates navigation in almost every case. Just as an example,
GoldMine now keeps track of where you’ve been so that you can easily
backtrack.
Plus, it all looks much more modern.
Customer Support Module
The original GoldMine focused on coordinating a team of sales people.
Starting with GoldMine 6, additional attention was paid to marketing.
Although GoldMine was advertised as a complete CRM system, it was lacking
the kind of service contract management or customer support module that
many of the competing products already contained. Organizations using
GoldMine but needing service management needed to buy FrontRange’s
HEAT product (which was, compared to GoldMine, quite expensive) or some
third-party add-on such as Resource Dynamic’s Tele-Support HelpDesk.
Now, finally, with the Premium Edition, GoldMine has its own answer, built
right into the system with a Knowledge Base to boot. The Service Module
keeps track of customer complaints or issues or questions that need to be
addressed. RMAs can also be handled here. The Service Module does not
really handle contract or billable time. Computer Control’s Billable Time
Manager fills that void nicely. Refer to Chapter 30 for more information on
many good add-ons.
Tabbed View
In previous versions of GoldMine, as you moved from one topic to another,
such as from a Contact Record to the E-mail Center, GoldMine would close
the Contact Record and open the E-mail Center. That entire navigation system
has been changed with the introduction of Tabbed Views.
The Premium Edition sports an entirely new methodology. GoldMine now
keeps track of where you’ve been and keeps each of those windows open.
Near the top of the work area, GoldMine Premium shows you a running trail
of the windows you have opened. 
There are pros and cons to this, but the biggest advantage is that you can
pop back and forth between several different tasks without closing out what
you are doing.
342
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

For example, you can work on updating an individual contact record, jump
over to scheduling an appointment with someone else, and then come right
back to the original contact record you were updating without stopping to
save anything. This is much more efficient than the older methodology as
long as you don’t get lost by having too many open windows.
You can avoid the open window syndrome by remembering to close windows
when you are truly done with them.
Auto-Complete
Not really new in GoldMine Premium, but new since GoldMine 6, is the ability
to create a lookup list for a field and specify Auto-Complete. With this feature,
as soon as you type enough in the field for GoldMine to uniquely identify
which entry from the lookup list you want, it fills in the rest for you. This fea-
ture provides more streamlining and ease of use.
GM+Browser
The GM+ Browser is an extension of the popular GM+View functionality that
allows you to view information from external sources such as other data-
bases, back office systems, and Web sites. Sometimes, you may still see offi-
cial documentation referring to GM+Browser as GM+View. But, no matter. You
can have multiple GM+Browser windows open simultaneously, providing you
the information needed to maximize your productivity. That’s the main differ-
ence between GM+Browser and GM+View.
Enhanced Reporting & Microsoft SQL
Reporting Services
When GoldMine was first released, it had its own report generator. It was
never well supported or documented. After a few years, Crystal Reports took
over as the de facto standard for creating reports from GoldMine data. In fact,
Crystal was actually included with the Corporate Edition. Several additional
statistical and reporting utilities, such as MasterMine and Stonefield Query,
were developed by third parties.
343
Chapter 31: The Ten Most Important New Developments Since 6.0 

Now, with Premium Edition, FrontRange has added another reporting option:
Microsoft’s SQL Reporting Service. The word “Service” is what’s really signifi-
cant here. Now you can schedule reports to run at predetermined times or
intervals without human interaction. 
SQL Query Wizard
You no longer have to speak SQL. The first versions of GoldMine had filters
that allowed you to create subsets of all the records. Later, groups were
developed — in a sense, these were filters on steroids.
SQL Queries have much more power than either filters or groups. With SQL
Queries, you can identify any logical set of records. In addition, despite the fact
that the word “queries” makes you think that all you can do is ask questions of
the data, the truth is that you can also use SQL Queries to edit existing data.
Very important.
With the SQL Query Wizard, even a technophobe can easily do sophisticated
searches and updates. Try it. You’ll like it. Back up the system first, though.
Web Integration
The Web Import feature allows you to integrate your Web site with your
GoldMine database. When a prospect fills out an inquiry page on your Web
site (that is, enters his contact information), Web Import automatically takes
that information and creates a new record in GoldMine, or updates an exist-
ing record if the prospect is already in the database.
If that’s not enough, through clever use of Automated Processes you can then
have GoldMine automatically respond to the prospect and schedule the right
person in your organization to follow up. This is a great and underutilized
feature.
Record Typing
Although not new in GoldMine Premium but finally tuned up enough so that
we can have some confidence in it, Record Typing allows you to completely
change the appearance of the screens and fields based on your entry in one
field.
344
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

For example, you could have a field called Record Type. Within this field, you
might enter Prospect, Customer, or Vendor. Depending upon which of these
you enter, GoldMine might then present completely different fields or tabs.
This is a great way to further customize and streamline GoldMine. It’s also a
bit complicated, and you might want to work with a dealer on this one.
Several Other, Miscellaneous
New Features
GoldMine Premium also boasts the following:
 Further streamlining of its Search Center 
 A new API (one of the tools programmers use to integrate other systems
or data with GoldMine)
 Improved Palm PDA integration
GoldMine Standard Bites the Dust
I am listing this development last, but doing so doesn’t make it the least
important. 
GoldMine Standard was the original dBase product that first came into the
market in the late 1980s. In April 2007, FrontRange announced its plan to sunset
the venerable Standard version. So, effective as of May 1, 2007, FrontRange no
longer sells the Standard version. This also applies to GoldSync licenses.
Support will continue until April 2008, although no button exists any longer
to press on your phone when you call FrontRange for technical support for
the Standard version. FrontRange is trying to encourage organizations using
GoldMine Standard to upgrade to Corporate, Premium, or even Enterprise.
