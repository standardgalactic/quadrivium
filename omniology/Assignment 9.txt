KEITH DEVLIN: Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (Winter 2014)
ASSIGNMENT 9
1. Express as concisely and accurately as you can the relationship between b|a and a/b.
2. Determine whether each of the following is true or false and prove your answer.
(You saw these
questions in the in-lecture quiz, so th ﬁrst part is a repeat, except that now you should know the right
answers.) The focus of this assignment is to prove each of your answers.
(a) 0|7
(b) 9|0
(c) 0|0
(d) 1|1
(e) 7|44
(f) 7|(−42)
(g) (−7)|49
(h) (−7)|(−56)
(i) (∀n ∈Z)[1|n]
(j) (∀n ∈N)[n|0]
(k) (∀n ∈Z)[n|0]
3. Prove all the parts of the theorem in the lecture, giving the basic properties of divisibility. Namely,
show that for any integers a, b, c, d, with a ̸= 0:
(a) a|0, a|a ;
(b) a|1 if and only if a = ±1 ;
(c) if a|b and c|d, then ac|bd (for c ̸= 0) ;
(d) if a|b and b|c, then a|c (for b ̸= 0) ;
(e) [a|b and b|a] if and only if a = ±b ;
(f) if a|b and b ̸= 0, then |a| ≤|b| ;
(g) if a|b and a|c, then a|(bx + cy) for any integers x, y.
OPTIONAL PROBLEMS
1. It is a standard result about primes (known as Euclid’s Lemma) that if p is prime, then whenever p
divides a product ab, p divides at least one of a, b. Prove the converse, that any natural number having
this property (for any pair a, b) must be prime.
2. Try to prove Euclid’s Lemma.
If you do not succeed, you can ﬁnd proofs in most textbooks on
elementary number theory, and on the Web. Find a proof and make sure you understand it. If you
ﬁnd a proof on the Web, you will need to check that it is correct. There are false mathematical proofs
all over the Internet. Though false proofs on Wikipedia usually get corrected fairly quickly, they also
occasionally become corrupted when a well-intentioned contributor makes an attempted simpliﬁcation
that renders the proof incorrect. Learning how to make good use of Web resources is an important
part of being a good mathematical thinker.
