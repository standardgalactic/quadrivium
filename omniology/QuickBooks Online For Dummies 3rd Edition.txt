Introduction      1
Introduction
H
ave you been thinking about moving your accounting into a web-based 
product? Are you a QuickBooks desktop user who wants to stick with 
something you know but wants the flexibility of a web-based product? Are 
you interested in finding out more about Intuit’s web-based product, QuickBooks 
Online (QBO)? Are you an accountant who is considering beginning to support 
your QuickBooks clients via QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)? If you 
answered yes to any of these questions, this book is for you.
QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Online Accountant are web-based accounting 
solutions from Intuit. Don’t be fooled; they are not the desktop product migrated 
to the web. They’ve been built from the ground up to function on the Internet.
About This Book
Intuit’s web-based accounting product is really almost two products: end users 
who want to do their accounting on the web use QBO, whereas accountants use 
QBOA, which enables the accountant to log in to a client’s books and make changes 
and queries as needed. Although much of QBO and QBOA look and behave alike, 
QBOA incorporates tools that an accountant needs while working on a client’s 
books. And accountants need to manage multiple client companies, whereas end 
user clients typically do not.
QBO and QBOA are not for everyone. Before you commit to Intuit’s web-based 
solution, you need to explore the available editions and examine the requirements 
for the products.
Because these products are both similar and different, I’ve divided this book into 
three parts. In the first part of the book, I examine what QBO and QBOA are — and 
what they aren’t — and I describe what you need to be able to use QBO and QBOA. I 
explain the various editions available and the product costs at the time I wrote this 
book, and I describe the features available. And in Chapter  1, you’ll find some 
information about the available interfaces for QBO and QBOA (you can work with 
the products using a browser or using an app).

2      QuickBooks Online For Dummies
The second part of the book focuses on using QBO and is aimed at the end user; 
but, the accountant who opens a client’s company via QBOA will be able to use the 
same tools that the end user uses to manage lists, enter transactions, and print 
reports.
The third part of the book is aimed at the accountant and covers using QBOA.
I don’t pretend to cover every detail of every feature in QBO or QBOA. Instead, I 
focus on covering the tools I think most users will need as they navigate QBO and 
QBOA.
As I discuss in Chapter 2, there are different versions of QBO; I used QBO Plus as I 
wrote this book because it contains the most features. Users of other versions 
might find references in this book to features they don’t have because they aren’t 
using the Plus version.
Before we dive in, let’s get a few technical convention details out of the way:
»
» Text that you’re meant to type as it appears in the book is bold. The exception 
is when you’re working through a list of steps: Because each step is bold, the 
text to type is not bold.
»
» Web addresses and programming code appear in monofont. If you’re 
reading a digital version of this book on a device connected to the Internet, 
note that you can tap or click a web address to visit that website, like this: 
www.dummies.com.
»
» You can use QBO and QBOA from the Windows app for QBO and QBOA or 
from Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer; at the time I wrote this 
book, you could use QBO and QBOA with Microsoft Edge, but you could not 
use Edge to export to the QuickBooks desktop product. In my experience, 
QBO and QBOA function best in Chrome. For that reason, I’ve devoted The 
Part of Tens chapters in this book to Chrome so that, if you aren’t familiar with 
Chrome, you can get up and running more quickly.
»
» When I discuss a command to choose, I’ll separate the elements of the 
sequence with a command arrow that looks like this: ➪. For example, when 
you see Chrome Menu ➪   Settings, that means you should click the Chrome 
Menu button (on the right side of the Chrome screen — see Chapter 16 for a 
description of Chrome’s screen elements) and, from the drop-down menu 
that appears, click Settings.

Foolish Assumptions
I had to assume some things about you to write this book. Here are the assump-
tions I made:
»
» You know that you need to manage the accounts for your business, and you 
might even have some sort of setup in place to record this information. I don’t 
assume that you know how to do all that on a computer.
»
» You have some interest in managing the accounts for your business using a 
web-based product.
»
» You are probably but not necessarily a QuickBooks desktop edition user.
»
» You have a personal computer (that you know how to turn on) running 
Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. I wrote this 
book using Windows 10.
»
» You might have purchased an edition of QuickBooks Online, but not 
necessarily.
Icons Used in This Book
Think of these icons as the fodder of advice columns. They offer (hopefully) wise 
advice or a bit more information about a topic under discussion.
This icon points out juicy tidbits that are likely to be repeatedly useful to you — so 
please don’t forget them.
Danger, Will Robinson, danger! Well, okay, it’s really not life-threatening. In this 
book, you see this icon when I’m trying to help you avoid mistakes that can cost 
money.
Beyond the Book
In addition to the content in this book, this product also comes with a free 
access-anywhere cheat sheet that gives you keyboard shortcuts for QBOL and 

4      QuickBooks Online For Dummies
QBOL Accountant and some handy tool buttons in QBOL. To get this cheat sheet, 
simply go to www.dummies.com and search for “QuickBooks Online For Dummies 
Cheat Sheet” in the Search box.
Where to Go from Here
Simply turn the page. Seriously. You can dive in anywhere you want and come 
back as often as you like. You don’t have to read through this book cover to cover, 
because each section stands alone and provides step-by-step instructions for 
common tasks. You should consider this book a reference that you use when you 
need it.
That said, if you’re just getting started with QBO or QBOA, you might want to turn 
the page and follow, in order, the chapters in Part 1. Then feel free to explore any 
topic you like, using the table of contents or the index to help you find a topic.

Introducing QBO 
and QBOA
Q
uickBooks Online (QBO) and QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA) are 
web-based products you can use to manage your business’s accounting. 
This chapter introduces these products and discusses whether you should 
move into the cloud to manage your accounting. It also examines the system 
requirements for these products.
QBO for the Client and 
QBOA for the Accountant
QuickBooks Online offers you the ability to manage your business’s accounting in 
the cloud. The software is divided into two products: one for end users and the 
other for accountants. Interfaces for both products are available on multiple 
platforms.
QuickBooks Online (QBO) is the cloud-based product for end users who need to 
perform typical accounting tasks. QBO is based on the same principles as the 
QuickBooks desktop product  — that is, it uses lists to, for example, manage 
Chapter 1

8      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
customers and vendors, and it includes transactions similar to the ones found in 
the QuickBooks desktop product. But, QBO is not simply a “rewrite” of the Quick-
Books desktop product for the web.
QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA) is the cloud-based portal that accountants 
use to access client QBO companies, work in them, and communicate with clients. 
QBOA also comes with one free company that accountants can use to track their 
own businesses.
Comparing interfaces
QBO and QBOA were initially written and optimized to be used in the major web 
browsers — Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. Later, Intuit added 
QBO apps that you can use for Windows, Mac, and Android mobile devices. In this 
section, you explore what QBO and QBOA look like in a browser and in the 
Windows app.
In addition to using the QBO mobile apps for iOS and Android, you also can access 
QBO from your mobile device’s browser at https://qbo.intuit.com.
In a browser, an open company in QBO looks similar to the one shown in Figure 1-1. 
I cover the interface in more detail in Chapter 3, but for the time being, the most 
important thing to notice is the Navigation bar that runs down the left side of the 
screen. If you’ve been a QuickBooks desktop user and you’ve used the Left Icon bar 
in that product, you might find the Navigation bar a familiar tool. The Left Icon 
bar and the Navigation bar work the same way; you click a link in either of them 
to navigate to a portion of the program.
FIGURE 1-1: 
An open 
company in QBO.

CHAPTER 1  Introducing QBO and QBOA      9
Clicking the arrow in the Navigation bar enables you to collapse the Navigation bar 
to view just the icons (and clicking it again expands the Navigation bar back to the 
view in Figure 1-1). When you collapse the Navigation bar (you see an example of 
it collapsed in Chapter 3), you have more screen real estate to view the right side 
of the QBO interface.
At the time I wrote this, the arrow feature was being tested in QuickBooks Labs. I 
include this feature in some of the figures because I want to give you an idea of 
things that might make their way into the software. You, too, can turn on features 
being tested in the lab; see Chapter 3 for details. And, in Chapter 3, I’ll show you 
the new navigation centers being tested for QBO  — another feature currently 
available via QuickBooks Labs.
At the top of the screen, you see tools that help QBO users create transactions, 
search for existing transactions, and view recent transactions.
Figure 1-2 shows what an accountant sees immediately upon logging in to QBOA. 
The Navigation bar changes to support an accountant’s needs; you can read more 
about the QBOA interface in Chapter 11.
When an accountant opens a client’s company from within QBOA (see Figure 1-3), 
the interface resembles what a client sees, with some minor differences. Compare 
Figure 1-1 with Figure 1-3. First, you know you’re using QBOA because the top of 
the Navigation pane shows QuickBooks Accountant. Second, the tools used to 
search for a transaction, go to a report, and view recent transactions are combined 
into one Search box near the right side of the screen. And third, the Accountant

The first view an 
accountant  
sees when he 
opens QBOA.

Tools menu (the briefcase icon) displays tools not found in QBO that help accoun-
tants manage client companies.
Even though an open company looks a bit different depending on whether it is 
opened using QBO or QBOA, the basic functionality doesn’t really change, other 
than accountants having more options than end users have.
Because QBOA contains functionality that QBO doesn’t have, I’ve organized this 
book so that QBO users can focus on Part 2 when using the product, and QBOA 
users can use the information in both Parts 2 and 3 to work with a company online.

shows QBO in the Windows mobile app, and Figure 1-5 shows QBOA just after 
opening it in the Windows mobile app (but before opening any client company).
Mobile apps are also available for Macs and iPhone, iPad, and Android devices at 
no additional cost to you. And, you’ll find Pinch and Zoom functionality now in 
the mobile apps and in browsers on mobile devices.
If you compare Figure 1-4 to Figure 1-1 and Figure 1-5 to Figure 1-2, you’ll notice 
that, once again, QBOA users have the same additional options in the Windows 
app that they have in a browser. The menus at the top of the screen in the mobile 
app are the biggest visual difference between QBO and QBOA in the mobile apps 
FIGURE 1-3:

CHAPTER 1  Introducing QBO and QBOA      11
and QBO and QBOA in a browser. If you’ve been a QuickBooks desktop product 
user, you know that you can use the menus to navigate. Under the hood, the Win-
dows app offers some options that you won’t find readily available in a browser, 
such as the ability to work in multiple windows.
So take your choice: Work in a browser, work in a mobile app, or work in both, 
depending on your needs at the moment! You’re not limited; you don’t have to 
choose between an app and a browser. Work in one or the other, as suits your 
needs at the moment.

12      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
Understanding the Cloud
Just to make sure we’re on the same page here, I’m defining the cloud as software 
and data housed securely in remote data centers (not on your office premises) and 
accessed securely using the Internet. Working in the cloud can increase your 
­efficiency by offering you the opportunity to work anywhere, communicate easily 
with others, and collaborate in real time.
Regardless of whether you use QBO or QBOA in a browser or in an app, both the 
software and the data are housed on servers controlled by Intuit and accessible via 
the Internet.
In the traditional model of software use, you buy software and install it on your 
computer. Or you might buy the software and install it on a vendor’s server. QBO 
and QBOA fall into the category of Software as a Service (SaaS). You typically don’t 
buy SaaS software; instead, you rent it (that is, you purchase a subscription).
Because SaaS software is typically web-based software, you typically access SaaS 
software over the Internet using a browser. A browser is software installed on your 
local computer or mobile device that you use to, well, browse the Internet, looking 
up cool stuff like what the stock market is doing today, what kind of weather can 
you expect on Friday when your vacation starts, how to get to your boss’s house 
for the party he’s having, and — oh, yes — to work with web-based software such 
as QBO and QBOA. In the case of QBO and QBOA, you can work with these web-
based SaaS products using either a browser or an app you download to your 
computer.
Using web-based software can be attractive for a number of reasons. For example, 
using web-based software, you have access to that software’s information any-
where, anytime, from any device — stationary or mobile.
Some folks see the “anywhere, anytime” feature as a potential disadvantage 
because it makes information too readily available — and therefore a target for 
hackers. Intuit stores your data on servers that use bank-level security and 
encryption, and Intuit automatically backs up your data for you. Other folks see 
the “anywhere, anytime” feature as a disadvantage for exactly the reason that 
they have access to the software’s information anywhere, anytime, and from any 
device, offering the opportunity to work more than they’d like. You are in charge 
of your life, so . . . no comment on this “disadvantage.”
In addition, web-based software like QBO and QBOA promotes collaboration and 
can help you save time. Using QBO and QBOA, accountants, bookkeepers, and 
­clients can communicate about issues that arise, as described in Chapter 14.

CHAPTER 1  Introducing QBO and QBOA      13
Then there’s the issue of keeping software up to date. Desktop software such as 
QuickBooks is updated typically once each year. Unlike their desktop cousin, QBO 
and QBOA are updated every two to four weeks.
Because updating occurs so frequently to QBO and QBOA, by the time this book is 
published, things (and screens) might have changed. Actually, make that “probably 
have changed.”
Should You Move to the Cloud?
Before you make the move to the cloud, you should consider the needs of your 
business in the following areas:
»
» Invoicing, point of sale, electronic payment, and customer relationship 
management
»
» Financial and tax reporting
»
» Budgeting
»
» Time-tracking and payroll
»
» Inventory, job costing, and job scheduling
»
» Managing company expenses and vendor bills
Beyond the advantages described in the preceding section, the particular needs of 
a business might dictate whether you can use QBO. For example, QBO won’t work 
for you if your business has industry-specific needs or is mid-sized and needs to 
use ODBC-compliant applications. In addition, QBO won’t work for you if you 
need to
»
» Track your balance sheet by class
»
» Process more than 350,000 transactions annually
»
» Track labor costs
»
» Manage a robust inventory
»
» Prepare and track progress invoices
Robust inventory means that you make and sell goods instead of selling finished 
goods. If you sell finished goods, QBO will work for you.

14      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
In any of these cases, you would probably be better off with one of Intuit’s desktop 
products.
When QBO and QBOA were first released, the US version didn’t support multiple 
currencies. That feature has been added to both products. And, you can set a 
“home currency” without enabling multicurrency support. See Chapter 3 for more 
information.
System Requirements
Using a web-based software product typically doesn’t require a lot of hardware 
and software; in fact, the demands of QBO and QBOA aren’t extensive. In particu-
lar, you need
»
» An Internet connection — Intuit recommends a high-speed connection
»
» One of the four supported Internet browsers:
•	 Chrome
•	 Firefox
•	 Internet Explorer 10 or higher
•	 Safari 6.1 if your operating system is iOS 7 or higher
At the time I wrote this, you could use Microsoft Edge but not to export to the 
QuickBooks desktop.
Although QBO and QBOA work in all the major browsers, they work best, in my 
experience, in Chrome, with Firefox coming in a close second. Therefore, I use 
Chrome throughout this book, and the Part of Tens chapters cover using Chrome 
so that you can get comfortable with that browser. If you’re a Firefox user, give 
QBO and QBOA a try in Firefox.
You also can use the QuickBooks Online mobile app, which works with Windows 
phones and tablets, the iPhone and the iPad, and Android phones and tablets. The 
requirements for the QuickBooks Online mobile app are the same as those out-
lined for the non-mobile versions: You need a browser on your device and an 
Internet connection. Be aware that mobile devices do not support all features of 
QBO and QBOA.
In this book, I use a Windows 10 desktop computer and the Chrome browser.

CHAPTER 1  Introducing QBO and QBOA      15
Whether you work on a desktop computer or on a mobile device, the computer or 
device should meet the basic requirements of the operating system you use on 
that computer or device. For example, if you’re using a Windows desktop com-
puter, you need the amount of RAM (random access memory) specified by Micro-
soft to load Windows on the computer before you ever launch your browser. If you 
don’t have sufficient RAM to run the operating system, you certainly won’t be 
happy with the behavior of QBO and QBOA. You won’t be happy with the behavior 
of the computer, either.
Basic requirements (and I stress the word basic) for a Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 com-
puter, as specified by Microsoft, are
»
» 1-gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor
»
» 1 gigabyte (GB) of RAM (32 bit) or 2GB of RAM (64 bit)
»
» 16GB of available hard disk space (32 bit) or 20GB (64 bit)
»
» A display that supports at least 800 x 600 dpi
»
» DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver
These versions of Windows work with multi-core processors, and all 32-bit  
versions of Windows can support up to 32 processor cores, whereas 64-bit  
versions can support up to 256 processor cores.
And a word on the word basic. You’ll be a whole lot happier if your desktop computer 
components have higher numbers than the ones listed above. If you have a com-
puter that’s fairly new — say, three to four years old — you might need only to add 
some RAM or possibly hard disk space. If your computer is older than three or four 
years, you should consider purchasing new equipment, simply because you’ll be 
unbelievably happier with the computer’s performance. Technology continues to 
improve dramatically in short spurts of time.
If you buy a new computer, you don’t need to worry about much to meet more 
than the basic requirements. I’m pretty sure you can’t buy a new computer 
­containing a 1-gigahertz processor; most computers today come with at least 
2.5-gigahertz processors and they support better graphics than the DirectX 9 
graphics listed in the basic requirements. And most monitors available for 
­purchase today don’t support low resolutions such as 800 x 600; you most likely 
own a monitor that supports higher resolution. In my opinion, 1GB of RAM is 
insufficient; your desktop computer should have at least 4GB of RAM, and you’ll 
be much happier if it has 8GB of RAM. On the hard drive requirement, if you don’t 
have the 16GB or 20GB of available space specified, you probably should be 
­considering a hard drive replacement for your computer.

16      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
The amount of RAM your computer can successfully use depends on the ­computer’s 
architecture — in particular, if your computer uses a 32-bit processor, as older 
computers often do, your computer might not be able to “see” more than 4GB of 
RAM. So, you could put 16GB of RAM in the computer and only be able to use 
4GB. And part of that 4GB goes to other stuff, like your video card; so, with most 
32-bit processors (there are a few exceptions), your computer can use only 3GB of 
RAM.  Bottom line here: Newer computers use 64-bit processors and can take 
advantage of much more RAM, which makes them much faster.

Embracing the 
QBO/QBOA Format
Q
BO and QBOA are not traditional software that you buy and install on your 
local computer. In this chapter, we explore the QBO/QBOA software for-
mat, and I assume that you’ve read Chapter 1 and evaluated whether QBO 
can meet your needs.
It’s All about Subscriptions
QBO and QBOA fall into the category of Software as a Service (SaaS). As such, you 
don’t buy the software. Instead, you rent it; that is, you buy a subscription to use 
the software for a time period specified by the seller.
Traditionally, you buy a license to use software that you install on your computer, 
and typically, that license permits you to install the software on only one 
computer.
And, of course, a QBO user can pay varying amounts for a subscription, depending 
on the subscription level purchased.
Chapter 2

18      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
QBO is available at four different subscription levels, and each subsequent sub-
scription level costs more and contains more functionality. The QBO subscriptions 
available at this writing are
»
» Self-Employed
»
» Simple Start
»
» Essentials
»
» Plus
All versions of QBO share three attributes in common. First, you can use a tablet, 
smartphone, or desktop computer to access your data. Second, your data is auto-
matically backed up online. And third, all versions of QBO use 128-bit Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL), the same security and encryption used by banks to secure 
data sent over the Internet.
After you assess your needs as described in Chapter 1, use the following informa-
tion to identify the lowest subscription level that will meet your requirements. At 
this point in time, you can upgrade to a higher level, but you cannot downgrade to 
a lower level.
Accounting professionals signing up clients for QBO and creating client compa-
nies originally couldn’t switch client companies from one version of QBO to 
another if the accounting professional created the client as part of the Intuit 
Wholesale Pricing program. However, that’s no longer true. So, you no longer 
need to anticipate your client’s requirements for more advanced features like the 
ability to track inventory or prepare 1099s.
The Self-Employed version
This version of QBO is aimed at freelancers and self-employed individuals, basi-
cally, those who receive Federal Form 1099 to account for the money they’ve been 
paid and pay their taxes using Schedule C of IRS Form 1040. Using the Self-
Employed version, you can
»
» Separate business from personal spending
»
» Calculate and pay estimated quarterly taxes
»
» Track mileage and IRS Form 1040 Schedule C (the IRS form that most self-
employed people must complete to determine business net income or loss) 
information

CHAPTER 2  Embracing the QBO/QBOA Format      19
»
» Track income and expenses
»
» Download transactions from your bank and credit card accounts
Like the other versions of QBO, you can use a tablet, smartphone, or desktop com-
puter to access your data. In addition, the Self-Employed version uses the same 
security and encryption as banks, and your data is automatically backed up online. 
As you might expect, this version has the fewest reports available — only three — 
and only one person can access QBO.
Be aware that, when I wrote this, the Self-Employed version of QBO didn’t link 
with QBOA.
If you opt to include TurboTax in your subscription, you also can pay your esti-
mated quarterly taxes online and export Schedule C information from QBO to 
Turbo Tax so that you can prepare your tax return more easily. With TurboTax as 
part of your subscription, you receive one federal and one state electronic tax 
return filing at no extra cost.
The Simple Start version
The Simple Start version of QBO is great for a new business with basic bookkeep-
ing needs. With Simple Start, you can
»
» Track your income and expenses
»
» Download transactions from your bank and credit card accounts
»
» Create an unlimited number of customers
»
» Send unlimited estimates and invoices
»
» Print checks and record transactions to track expenses
»
» Import data from Microsoft Excel or QuickBooks desktop
»
» Invite up to two accountants to access your data
»
» Integrate with available apps
Although the Simple Start version supports Accounts Receivable functions, you 
can’t track bills due in the future in the Simple Start version because it doesn’t 
include any Accounts Payable functions. And, one other important consideration: 
The Simple Start version also has no general ledger.
Although the Simple Start version allows two accountants to work in the client’s 
company, Simple Start is still designed for a single user. Therefore, the accountant 
cannot create the client’s company for the client. At the time the company is 

20      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
created in QBO, whoever creates the company becomes, in QBO parlance, the 
­Master Administrator.
In addition to the single-user restriction, the Simple Start version offers more 
than 20 reports. And Simple Start users can memorize report settings and produce 
memorized reports.
For subscription levels that support multiple users, the accountant can create the 
company for the client and then assign the Master Administrator role to the client. 
And, if the accountant doesn’t make the client the Master Administrator when 
creating the company, the accountant can, later on, transfer the Master Adminis-
trator role to the client.
The Essentials version
The Essentials version of QBO includes all the features found in Simple Start. In 
addition, with the Essentials version, you can
»
» Set up invoices to automatically bill on a recurring schedule
»
» Take advantage of Accounts Payable functions, including entering vendor bills 
and scheduling their payment for later
»
» Compare your sales and profitability with industry trends
»
» Compare your sales and profitably with industry trends
»
» Create and post recurring transactions
»
» Control what your users can access
The Essentials version permits three simultaneous users and two accountant 
users. In addition, the Essentials version contains the reports found in Simple 
Start and 20 additional reports.
The Plus version
The Plus version of QBO is the most full-featured version of QBO. It contains all 
the features found in the Essentials version. In addition, you can
»
» Create, send, and track purchase orders.
»
» Track inventory using the first in, first out (FIFO) inventory valuation method. 
QBO supports light inventory needs: If you sell finished goods, QBO should 
be able to manage your needs. But if you need to assemble finished goods 

CHAPTER 2  Embracing the QBO/QBOA Format      21
to sell, QBO won’t meet your needs on its own. You can look for an app to 
supplement your inventory needs; I talk about apps at the end of this chapter.
»
» Track, create, and send 1099-Misc forms.
»
» Categorize income and expenses using class tracking.
»
» Track sales and profitability by business location. You can assign only one 
location to a transaction, but you can assign multiple classes to a transaction.
»
» Give employees and subcontractors limited access to the QBO company to 
enter time worked.
»
» Track billable hours by customer.
QBO supports light job-costing needs, but it does not allow you to automati-
cally cost labor.
»
» Create budgets to estimate future income and expenses, and create multiple 
budgets per year, location, class, or customer.
I used QBO Plus as I wrote this book because it contains the most features, there-
fore users of other versions might find references in this book to features they 
don’t have. Accounting professionals: The company that comes with QBOA is a 
Plus company.
The Plus version supports five simultaneous users and two accountant users and 
can be scaled up to support 20 users. The Plus version also contains more than 65 
reports: all the reports found in both the Simple Start and the Essentials versions, 
and some additional reports.
Essentials and Plus with Payroll
If an end user signs up for QBO Essentials or Plus on his own and creates his own 
company, he can create the company using the Plus Payroll option, or later he can 
sign up for QBO Payroll (QBOP) separately. An accountant also can create the 
company that uses QBOP for a client. For details, see the section “Addressing Pay-
roll Needs” later in this chapter.
What Does It Cost?
The big question: What’s it cost? The price is dependent primarily on the QBO ver-
sion you choose.
If you are an end user who signs up on your own for a QBO subscription, the price 
per month as of the date this book was written appears in Table 2-1.

22      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
The prices shown in Table 2-1 are monthly subscription prices, and, at the time I 
wrote this, the sale price was good for six months. In some cases, when you sign 
up, you’ll be offered the option to pay for an entire year. And, paying for a full year 
might turn out to be less expensive than paying on a monthly basis.
At the time I wrote this, Intuit offered a bundle for the Self-Employed version — 
QBO and TurboTax for $12/month instead of the regular price of $17/month.
You’ll receive a bill on a regular basis from Intuit. Intuit gives you a free 30-day 
trial that includes payroll processing along with the rest of the subscription’s 
features. If you opt to continue QBO Payroll after the 30-day trial, your subscrip-
tion fee increases. The free trial also includes the Payments app, which gives you 
the ability to process online and mobile payments with rates per use as low as 1.75 
percent + 25 cents per swipe and 50 cents per bank payment/ACH.
If you opt for a 30-day free trial, you won’t get the sale price for the subscription. 
But, if you “buy now,” Intuit gives you a 60 day, money-back guarantee on your 
purchase.
If you are an accounting professional, you can sign up for the Wholesale Pricing 
program and use QBOA for free. If you create a client’s company as part of the 
Wholesale Pricing program and you manage the client’s subscription, Intuit sends 
you the bill for the client’s subscription. It is your responsibility to bill the client 
for the QBO subscription. The bill you receive from Intuit is a single consolidated 
bill for all the QBO subscriptions you manage. For a little more information on the 
Wholesale Pricing program, see Chapter 11. But, for the complete skinny on the 
Wholesale Pricing program, contact Intuit. Note that accounting professionals 
might be able to get QBO for their clients at a reduced price.
If an accounting professional creates a company through QBOA, the company does 
not come with a 30-day free trial. Instead, at the time the accounting professional 
creates the company, he must provide a payment method to ensure uninterrupted 
service.

CHAPTER 2  Embracing the QBO/QBOA Format      23
If your client initially sets up QBO with his or her own subscription, you can move 
that existing QBO subscription to your consolidated bill at the discounted rate. 
And, if your arrangement with your client doesn’t work out, you can remove the 
client from your consolidated bill, and the client can begin paying for his own 
subscription.
Addressing Payroll Needs
QBO can handle payroll regardless of whether an end user or an accountant cre-
ates the QBO company.
If an end user signs up for QBO Essentials or Plus on his own, he can create his 
own company using the appropriate “with Payroll” option — Enhanced or Full 
Service Payroll  — or, after the fact, he can sign up for QBO Payroll from the 
Employees screen (see Figure 2-1).
The distinction between the two options, besides price, is that you choose 
Enhanced Payroll if you want to prepare payroll on your own; for details on pre-
paring payroll in QBO, see Chapter 9. Alternatively, you can subscribe to QBO Full 
Service Payroll, which integrates with QBO, where Intuit prepares payroll for you.
It’s easy to get confused here . . . I know I was. Intuit also offers another payroll 
product, Intuit Full Service Payroll, which is a standalone product that doesn’t 
integrate with QBO.
FIGURE 2-1: 
If you sign up for 
QBO on your 
own, you can turn 
on payroll from 
the Employees 
screen.

24      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
Both Enhanced and Full Service QBO Payroll sport the following features:
»
» Paying employees with printed checks or by directly depositing paychecks
»
» Automatically calculating tax payments and paying them electronically
»
» Processing Federal and State quarterly and annual reports and preparing W-2 
forms
»
» Processing payroll for employees in multiple states
»
» Keeping payroll tax tables up to date without having to install updates like you 
do with the QuickBooks desktop product
»
» Using the QBO Payroll mobile app to pay employees, view past paychecks, 
electronically pay taxes, and electronically file tax forms
If an accountant who is not enrolled in the Intuit Wholesale Pricing program 
­creates a QBO Essentials or Plus company for a client, the client company can turn 
on QBO payroll (QBOP) from the Employees screen in the client’s company (refer 
to Figure 2-1). Clients can prepare payroll for themselves or accounting profes-
sionals can manage all payroll functions for clients.
If the accountant is enrolled in the Intuit Wholesale Pricing program and creates 
a QBO Essential or Plus company for a client as part of the program, the accoun-
tant can set up the QBO company to use QBO Payroll (QBOP).
Last, an accountant can add an Intuit Full Service Payroll subscription to a client 
company subscription through QBOA, regardless of whether he or she is enrolled 
in the Wholesale Pricing Program.
Switching from QuickBooks Desktop
At this point (or maybe earlier than now), you might have been wondering if you 
can easily switch to QBO if you have been a QuickBooks desktop program user. 
And, the answer is yes. Chapter  12 provides details on importing QuickBooks 
desktop data into QBO. And, the import process doesn’t affect your original desk-
top company; it’s still available via the desktop product. After you import your 
data into QBO, you should run the Profit & Loss report and the Balance Sheet using 
the Accrual method for all dates from both QBO and QuickBooks desktop to ensure 
both versions show the same information.
And, if you want some reassurance that you’ll get the same accurate information 
from QBO that you got from QuickBooks desktop, you can “run in parallel” for a 
time period you specify. For example, you might decide to enter all your ­transactions 

CHAPTER 2  Embracing the QBO/QBOA Format      25
in both versions of the software for one month; at the end of that time, you can run 
reports from both products and make sure you see the same information.
Although you can continue to use the QuickBooks desktop, once you make the 
switch to QuickBooks Online, be aware that no synchronization occurs between 
QuickBooks desktop and QBO. So, changes you make in one are not reflected in the 
other. Unless you’re temporarily running in parallel, continuing to use both prod-
ucts could really mess up your books, because you might accidentally enter trans-
actions into one product and not the other.
Where Add-On Apps Fit In
QBO doesn’t operate as a complete, standalone accounting solution. It has func-
tional limitations. The section “Addressing payroll needs” highlights one such 
limitation — and shows how you can use Intuit add-ons to achieve more function-
ality in QBO. And, earlier in this chapter I briefly mention Intuit’s Payments app, 
which supports electronic customer payment processing and integrates with QBO.
But those aren’t the only apps available for QBO; third-party developers have been 
creating apps to enhance the functionality of QBO. And, over time, you can expect 
more apps to be developed.
You can click the Apps link in the Navigation bar that runs down the left side of 
QBO to visit the App Center and explore available apps (see Figure 2-2).
FIGURE 2-2: 
Take a trip to the 
App Center to 
search for 
additional 
functionality  
for QBO.

26      PART 1  Getting Started with QBO and QBOA
Click any app to navigate to a page that describes the app, provides pricing 
­information, and often provides a video about the app (see Figure 2-3).
Although add-on apps can provide additional functionality in QBO, some func-
tionality is still missing; no doubt, that functionality will appear over time. For 
example, using QBO, you can’t
»
» Track your balance sheet by class
»
» Process more than 350,000 transactions annually
»
» Track labor costs
»
» Manage a robust inventory
»
» Prepare and track progress invoices
But apps are making inroads to eliminating these limitations. For example, Let-
tuce, an app that provided advanced inventory management features for QBO, did 
such a fine job of handling inventory functions that Intuit acquired Lettuce for the 
purpose of integrating it into QBO.

When you click an

Center, you

for the app.

A
fter you sign up for QBO, you log in. QBO then prompts you to set up your 
company. With certain limitations, you can import a company if you’ve 
been using a QuickBooks desktop product. Or, you can use the QBO Setup 
wizard, as shown in this chapter.
For details on importing a company, see Chapter 12 (or ask your accountant to 
help you with the import). And, don’t worry, if you don’t import your entire desk-
top company; you can import just the list information from that company, as 
described in Chapter 4. Importing lists will still save you a lot of time and setup 
work.
Signing Up for QBO
After you complete the sign-up process for a QBO account, Intuit, by default, logs 
you in to your account and walks you through the process of setting up your QBO 
company. The process is short — much shorter than the one you go through when

To sign up for a QBO account, follow these steps:
1.	 Visit quickbooks.intuit.com/online.
2.	 Scroll down the page until you find the three boxes describing each 
version of QBO.
3.	 In the version of QBO that you want to try, click the Free 30-Day Trial link.
The Free 30-Day Trial link appears below the Buy Now button.
Be aware that the price you pay for QBO depends on whether you choose the 
Buy Now option or the Free 30-Day Trial. If you opt to “buy now,” you pay less 
for your subscription because discounts don’t apply to the Free 30-Day Trial.
4.	 Fill in your name, email address, and a password (see Figure 3-1).
If you already have an Intuit user ID, supply that user ID and password.
Your password must be between 6 and 32 characters and consist of a mix of 
letters and numbers. The password can also contain some special characters;  
I included an exclamation point (!) in my password and it was accepted. The user 
ID and password you supply are the ones you use each time you log in to QBO.
5.	 Click the Sign Up button below the boxes you completed in Step 4.
At the time that I wrote this, a window appeared that offered the option to skip 
the free trial and buy the product at a discounted rate. You can buy, but I opted 
to click the Continue to Trial button.
QBO sets up your free trial, logs you in to QBO, and displays the Set Up 
wizard . . . read on.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      31
Setting Up a New Company
When you first sign up for a QBO account, Intuit logs you in to your QBO account 
and, by default, displays the set up wizard. The first screen of the wizard, shown 
in Figure 3-2, asks for basic company information.
FIGURE 3-1: 
Fill in the 
information 
needed to start 
the free trial.
FIGURE 3-2: 
Provide basic 
company 
information.

32      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
As you supply address information, QBO automatically prepares an invoice form 
that contains the information; you’ll use this form (or a variant of it) to prepare 
the invoices you send to customers.
If you have a basically square company logo in JPG, GIF, BMP, or PNG format, you 
can upload it to include it on your invoice. Just click the Logo button to navigate to 
your logo.
When you finish providing address information, click the Next button in the lower 
left corner of the screen.
On the next screen, shown in Figure 3-3, you provide more information about 
your company so that Intuit can customize QBO to suit your needs: Supply your 
industry, the type of things you sell, and, if you have the information handy, your 
business type and age. Then click Next.
Only your industry and the type of stuff you sell are required. Supplying your 
business type helps QBO set up your Chart of Accounts more accurately.
If you’re keeping track of your business information now, supply the method you 
currently use on the next screen. You can choose from the following:
»
» Excel
»
» Google
FIGURE 3-3: 
Provide 
­information

»
» Pen and paper
»
» QuickBooks Desktop
»
» Online banking
»
» Other software
The answer you provide determines the screen you see next. For example, if you 
select QuickBooks Desktop, you then answer questions about importing informa-
tion from the QuickBooks desktop product. For this book, I chose “pen and paper,” 
which assumes you have nothing in electronic form to import.
If you opt not to import desktop information, you can change your mind later, as 
long as you do so within 60 days of starting your QBO subscription. If you decide 
that you want to import data after 60 days, you must cancel your subscription and 
start a new one.
When you click Next, the wizard then asks you to select the elements that matter 
to you most; you can choose all of the following that apply to you:
»
» Invoicing
»
» Expense tracking
»
» My accountant
»
» Mobile
»
» Point of sale
»
» E-commerce
»
» Sales tax
»
» My employees
For my trial company, I chose invoicing, expense tracking, sales tax, and my 
employees. If something matters to you later (like working with an accountant), 
you can set that up in your company when it suits you. So, don’t worry if you don’t 
select something that you later determine you should have selected.
Click Next, and QBO searches online for businesses similar to yours and estab-
lishes appropriate options and settings; when QBO finishes the search, you see a 
message that your QuickBooks is ready and you click the Let’s Dive In button to 
get started.

34      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When you click Next, QBO displays your company’s Home page and displays links 
to options you might want to set up to get started. In my case, I see boxes contain-
ing options to use Bill.com to easily pay bills online, along with options to set up 
sales tax and payroll (see Figure 3-4).
We’ll examine the Home page in the next section, but essentially you’ve just com-
pleted most of the initial setup work; I’ll cover other program settings later in this 
chapter.
Understanding the Home Page
When you first see your QBO company, your Home page contains boxes with links 
to options you can use to set up features in QBO that are important to you (refer 
back to Figure 3-4). You can use those links and set up those options now, or, you 
can wait until later. To hide the options, slide your mouse over any item, and an X 
appears in the upper right corner of the box (see Figure 3-5).
When you click the X, QBO offers you the option to permanently dismiss the box 
or to see it later (see Figure 3-6). Click your choice. If you choose to see the option 
later, the box will reappear the next time you log in to your QBO company.
FIGURE 3-4: 
Your QBO Home 
page just after 
creating your 
company.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      35
Don’t worry; you can still set up the options associated with any of these boxes. 
And, be aware that each box you dismiss is replaced by another associated with the 
list of options that matter to you that appear at the end of the preceding section.
Once you close the boxes, your Home page displays information specific to your 
company.
You can click the Take a Tour of the Home Page link in the Activities section to let 
QBO show you, interactively, the things I’m about to show you.
FIGURE 3-5: 
You can close the 
boxes that offer 
to help you 
perform some 
QBO set-up work.

page after closing 
the boxes.

36      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
In Figure 3-7, I’m using a company that already has some data in it to try to make 
things a bit more meaningful. In the center of the screen, using most of the Home 
page real estate, you find information that changes depending on what you have 
clicked while using QBO. For example, when you initially open QBO, the informa-
tion is overview company information. If you click an entry in the Navigation bar 
(on the left side of the screen), the information in the center of the Home page 
changes to information related to the entry you click. If you select a setting on the 
Gear menu (discussed later in this section), the information is related to the set-
ting you select.
You might have noticed the Private Mode button in Figure 3-7. This button appears 
after you have entered at least one transaction, and you can use it to temporarily 
hide financial information on your Home page. For example, you might want to 
turn Private Mode on if you’re using QuickBooks in a public place or even in your 
office when you’re not alone. Once you turn Private Mode on, it remains on until 
you turn it off again.
As I just mentioned, the Navigation bar runs down the left side of the screen. You 
use the Navigation bar the same way you’d use a menu; click an item in the 
­Navigation bar to, well, navigate to that part of QBO. For example, you can click 
Transactions in the Navigation bar to see the available transactions in QBO and 
then click one to use that type of transaction.
FIGURE 3-7: 
Examining Home 
screen elements.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      37
The highlighted entry in the Navigation bar does not always change to match the 
information shown in the main portion of the Home page. You use the Navigation 
bar to navigate to a portion of the program, not to determine the portion of the 
program you are viewing. In other words, don’t depend on the Navigation bar to 
“tell you” how you got to what you’re viewing.
On the right side of the screen, you find a list of the bank accounts you’ve set up 
as well as the Activities list — a list of things that QBO thinks need your attention. 
The list is interactive, so you can click items in the list to take various actions.
When you click the Help button, you see a menu of common topics related to the 
area of QBO you are currently viewing, and you can type in the search box to find 
help on a particular topic (see Figure 3-8).
For example, when you click the Home page overview link, QBO displays the QBO 
Welcome Guide, which provides a brief overview of the Home page along with a 
list of topics you can use to help you further configure QBO (see Figure 3-9).
In the center of the top of the screen, you see three transaction-related buttons 
that display lists you can use to work with transactions. Figure 3-10 shows what 
you see when you click the leftmost transaction button, the Search button.
Figure 3-11 shows the Create menu that appears when you click the center trans-
action button.
FIGURE 3-8: 
The Help menu.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      39
The Create button appears as a plus sign (+) when the menu is closed and an X 
when the menu is open; compare Figures 3-7 and 3-11.
When you click the third transaction button — the one that looks like a clock — 
you see a list of recently entered transactions; you can click any transaction in the 
list to open that transaction (see Figure 3-12).
To the right of the three transaction-related buttons, you see the Gear button fol-
lowed by your company’s name. If you click the Gear button, you see the menu 
shown in Figure 3-13, which you use to look at and change QBO company settings; 
view lists; work with tools such as import and export, reconciliation, and budget-
ing tools; and view information about your QBO account. Note that the Gear menu 
is divided into four columns that organize related commands.

Establishing Company Settings
After you set up your company, you should review the default settings Intuit 
established and make changes as appropriate. To examine and make changes to 
payroll settings, see Chapter 9.
Examining company preferences
Choose Gear ➪   Account and Settings to display the Company tab of the Account 
and Settings dialog box (see Figure 3-14).
At the time I wrote this, QBOA users working in client companies were still seeing 
older Gear menu options — and so would see Gear ➪   Company settings instead of 
Gear ➪ Account and Settings. I use the newer interface options throughout Part II 
of the book, so, QBOA users, be aware: When I say choose Gear  ➪   Account and Set-
tings, you’ll be choosing Gear ➪   Company settings.
On this tab, you can make changes to your company name, address, and contact 
information.
To change any setting, click anywhere in the group where the setting appears. 
When you finish making changes, click the Save button that appears in the group 
of settings. You can then move on to other settings on the page.
If you make changes, click Done in the lower right corner of the screen to 
save them.
FIGURE 3-14:

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      41
Examining billing and subscription settings
To review the settings related to your QBO billing and subscription, choose 
Gear ➪   Account and Settings to display the Account and Settings dialog box. Then 
click Billing & Subscription in the pane on the left.
QBOA users choose Gear ➪   Your Account.
This page, shown in Figure  3-15, shows you the status of your QBO, Payroll, 
and Payments subscriptions. From this page, you can convert your trial version of 
QBO and of the QBO Payroll product to a regular subscription; converting cancels 
your trial. You also can use this page to order checks and supplies, should you 
need them.
The subscription Payments product that Intuit offers enables you to receive online 
payments from your customers. If you already have a subscription to the ­Payments 
product, you can connect to it from the Billing & Subscription page of the Account 
and Settings dialog box. If you don’t have a subscription, you can (naturally) 
­subscribe from the Billing & Subscription page.
Setting sales preferences
To review the Sales preferences of your QBO company, choose Gear ➪   Account and 
Settings to display the Account and Settings dialog box. Then click Sales in the 
pane on the left.

At the top of the page that appears (see Figure 3-16), you can click the Customize 
Look and Feel button to customize the appearance of the invoice you send to cus-
tomers. We’ll return to the customization process at the end of this section; first, 
let’s examine the settings available to you.
Examining sales settings
You can set a variety of options related to sales:
»
» In the Sales Form Content section, you can define the fields that appear on 
the form you complete to prepare invoices, sales receipts, and other 
sales forms.
»
» In the Products and Services section, you can make changes to the product- 
and service-related fields that appear on sales forms. If you’re using QBO Plus, 
this is where you turn on inventory tracking.
»
» In the Messages section, you can control the default email message sent to 
customers with sales forms and the default message that appears on those 
sales forms.
»
» If you scroll down the Sales page, you can set, in the Online Delivery section, 
email delivery options for sales forms such as attaching the sales form as a 
PDF, showing a summary or details of the sales form in the email, and email 
formatting options for invoices.
»
» In the Statements section, you can specify whether to show the aging table at 
the bottom of the statement.
FIGURE 3-16: 
The Sales page

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      43
Customizing form appearance
To customize forms that your customers receive, click Customize Look and Feel at 
the top of the Sales page in the Account and Settings dialog box to display the 
Custom Form Styles page shown in Figure 3-17.
The Custom Form Styles page lists any form styles you have already created.  
By default, QBO creates one form style for you when you sign up; that form style 
is named Standard and is used by default for invoices, estimates, and sales  
receipts.
If you are satisfied with the appearance of the majority of the form style, you can 
edit it instead of creating a form style. Alternatively, you can create separate cus-
tomized forms for invoices, estimates, and sales receipts. To do so, click New Style 
in the upper-right corner of the Custom Form Styles page. Whether you edit or a 
create a new form style, QBO displays the Customize Form Style dialog box, whose 
appearance varies only slightly, depending on whether you are editing or creating 
a new form style. In particular, if you opt to create a form style, the dialog box 
gives you the option to select the type of form style (see Figure 3-18).
You use the tabs that run down the left side of the dialog box to establish form 
style settings:
»
» From the Style tab, shown in Figure 3-18, you can select a style for the form: 
Airy, Modern, Fresh, Friendly, or Bold. The preview shown in Figure 3-18 is the 
Fresh form style.
FIGURE 3-17: 
Use this page to 
edit an existing 
form style or

44      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
»
» From the Appearance tab, you can modify the appearance and placement of 
your logo; set the form’s font, line height, and page margins; and specify 
whether to print your form to fit in a standard window envelope. You also can 
opt to show an account summary table, which shows your customers how 
much past due they are in paying you.
»
» From the Header tab, you can define the names used for each form and the 
fields that appear in the header area of the form — such as your company 
name, address, contact information, payment terms, due date, and form 
number. You also can opt to show your customer’s terms, due date, shipping 
and payment methods, as well as set up custom fields.
»
» From the Activity Table tab, you can control the appearance of the body of the 
invoice, determining whether to display, in columns, information such as the 
quantity, rate, and description for each item — and the order in which the 
elements appear. For each row of information, you also can specify whether 
to display billable time and markup on billable expenses (most people don’t 
display markup on billable expenses), and you can choose whether to show 
the employee’s name and the hours and rate. You also can choose the way 
you want to group activity (by day, week, month, or type), and, if you group 
activity, you can choose to subtotal by group. You also can combine rows that 
show the same rate and description and omit the dates for those rows.
FIGURE 3-18: 
The dialog box 
you use to 
customize sales 
forms.

Chapter 6 contains an example of customizing the Activity Table so that you 
can include subtotals on an invoice.
»
» From the Footer tab, you can control the information that appears in the 
footer portion of the form, along with messages to your customer.
You can click the Preview or Print button to preview your invoice in a browser 
window but in PDF format.
Click the Save button to save changes you make to the appearance of your forms.
Importing form styles
At the time I wrote this, importing form styles was a feature “under construction” 
in QBO and is therefore not available unless you enable it using QuickBooks Labs. 
For details on using QuickBooks Labs, see “Working with QuickBooks Labs,” later 
in this chapter. For purposes of this discussion, I have enabled the feature.
If the form templates supplied with QBO don’t meet your needs, you can use 
Microsoft Word 2010 or later to create a form style and then upload it into QBO. As 
part of the import process, you map fields you’ve identified on your Word docu-
ment form style to QBO fields.
The tricky part of this process is getting the form correctly designed in Word. But, 
luckily, Intuit anticipated the challenge and provides sample forms and instruc-
tions to simplify the process. To download the samples and instructions, you need 
to pretend you’ve already created your form style in Word. If this feels like I’m 
putting the cart in front of the horse, well . . . I am, sort of.
To get the sample information and instructions, enable the Import Form Styles 
feature through QuickBooks Labs. Then click Gear ➪   Custom Form Styles. On the 
Custom Form Styles page, click the down arrow beside New Style, and choose 
Import Style. QBO displays the page shown in Figure 3-19.
To download the sample information, click the Download a Sample Invoice link.  
A Zip file downloads, containing two sample forms you can use as starting points.
The Zip file also contains detailed instructions that describe what to do and what 
not to do when creating a form style. For example, the instructions list the fonts 
QBO will recognize and also describe the best way to use Word tables. Suffice it to 
say, use these instructions and save yourself some pain.

46      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Open either of the sample files to see how a customized form style should look in 
Word (see Figure 3-20). Note, for example, that you simply type information that 
won’t change, but you place less than and greater than brackets around fields you 
want to replace with QBO data, such as your customer’s billing and shipping 
addresses and item information.
FIGURE 3-20: 
Place information 
that QBO should 
replace in 
brackets.
FIGURE 3-19:

Form Style page 
to download 
sample forms 
and instructions 
to create your 
own form style.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      47
When you’re ready to upload your form style, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Gear ➪   Custom Form Styles to display the Custom Form Style page.
2.	 Click the arrow beside the New Style button and choose Import Style to 
redisplay the page shown earlier in Figure 3-19.
3.	 Click the Browse button and navigate to the Word document you created 
for your form style.
4.	 Click Next.
QBO uploads the document and scans it for fields you placed in brackets. If 
you successfully upload the Word document, you’ll see a message telling you 
that you succeeded in uploading. If this process is not successful you will see 
errors; review the instruction document included with the sample files for 
details on errors and how to correct them.
Assuming your document uploads successfully, a page appears where you can 
map the fields on your form style to fields in QBO.
5.	 Match the fields on your form style to QBO fields; when you finish, click 
Next.
A preview of the new form style appears on the Confirm Style page.
6.	 If you’re happy with what you see, click Save and supply a name for your 
form style. It’s now ready to use.
If you’re not happy, click Back and correct any problems.
Taking a look at expense preferences
From the Expenses tab of the Account and Settings dialog box, you can control 
expenses related to purchase orders, bills, and payments you make to vendors (see 
Figure 3-21). Choose Gear ➪   Account and Settings ➪   Expenses.
In the Bills and Expenses group of settings, you can opt to display a table on expense 
and purchase forms so that you can itemize and categorize the products and ser-
vices you buy. If you purchase goods and services for your customers, you can
»
» Add a column to the table so that you can identify the customer for whom you 
made the purchase.
»
» Add a column where you identify expenses and items for which you want to 
bill customers.

48      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You also can set default bill payment terms.
In the Purchase Orders group, you can opt to use purchase orders and you can opt 
to copy estimates to purchase orders. For more information about converting an 
estimate to a purchase order, see Chapter 6.
Examining options to receive  
customer payments
The Payments tab of the Account and Settings dialog box offers you a way to con-
nect with Intuit Merchant Services via a QuickBooks Payments account. If you 
don’t have a QuickBooks Payments account with Intuit and you want one, click the 
Learn More button. If you already have a QuickBooks Payments account, you can 
click the Connect button to connect your QBO account with your QuickBooks Pay-
ments account.
QuickBooks Payments is the name Intuit uses to describe the service it offers  
that enables you to accept credit cards or bank transfers from your customers  
and email invoices that contain a Pay Now button so that your customers can 
pay  you online. You might also know this service as GoPayment or Merchant 
Services.
FIGURE 3-21: 
Expense 
preferences you 
can control.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      49
Reviewing advanced preferences
The Advanced tab of the Account and Settings dialog box enables you to make 
changes to a variety of QBO settings (see Figure 3-22). Choose Gear ➪   Account and 
Settings ➪   Advanced to view and update these settings:
»
» In the Accounting group, you can control fiscal year settings and the accounting 
method your company uses (cash or accrual).
»
» Use the Company Type group to establish the legal organization of your 
company.
»
» In the Chart of Accounts group, you can turn on account numbers — something 
most accountants prefer you do.
»
» Depending on the version of QBO you use, you can use the Categories section 
to opt to track information using classes, locations, or both. You also can opt 
to have QBO warn you if you don’t assign a class to a transaction, and you can 
opt to assign classes individually to each line of a transaction or assign one 
class to the entire transaction. For locations, you can choose from seven 
different labels; one of these choices might better describe your intended use 
of the Location category.
»
» In the Automation group, you can control some of QBO’s automated behavior. 
For example, if you don’t want QBO to prefill new forms with information 
from forms you entered previously, feel free to turn that setting off.
»
» In the Time Tracking section, you can control the appearance of timesheets. 
For example, you can opt to add a service field to timesheets so that you can 
FIGURE 3-22: 
The Advanced tab 
of the Account 
and Settings 
dialog box.

50      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
select services performed for each time entry. By default, QBO includes a 
customer field on timesheets so that you can optionally charge work per-
formed to a customer.
»
» Use the Currency section to turn on multicurrency tracking and to set your 
company’s Home Currency. If you change the home currency symbol, QBO 
changes the symbol for future transactions; existing transactions will still be 
calculated at the original currency value. For more information about 
Multicurrency and Home Currency, see the section “Working with Multiple 
Currencies” later in this chapter.
Turning on multicurrency eliminates your ability to change your home 
currency. Further, you can’t turn multicurrency off after you turn it on.
»
» In the Other Preferences group, you can make changes to a variety of settings, 
such as date and number formats, whether QBO warns you if you reuse a 
check number or bill number you used previously, and how long QBO should 
wait before signing you out because you haven’t done any work. And, if you 
prefer to call your customers something other than Customer (such as Client, 
Patron, or Shopper), you can change the label you use to refer to those who 
buy stuff from you.
CATEGORIES, CLASSES, AND 
LOCATIONS . . . OH, MY!
Don’t confuse the options you see in the Categories section of the Account and Settings 
dialog box (QBO classes and locations) with QBO categories. The QBO Category feature 
is entirely separate from the class and location features shown in the Categories section 
of the Account and Settings dialog box.
If you turn on the Class and Location options shown here in the Account and Settings 
dialog box, you can then assign classes and locations to transactions to help you further 
break down financial data beyond the account level. To create classes and locations, 
first enable them in the Account and Settings dialog box. Then choose Gear ➪   All Lists. 
Then click Classes to create new classes and click Locations to create new locations.
QBO categories, NOT shown in the Account and Settings dialog box (and no need to 
turn them on), replace sub-items and are available to users of QBO Plus to help orga-
nize item information for reporting purposes; see Chapter 4 for details.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      51
Working with Multiple Currencies
The Plus version of QBO supports using multiple currencies. Typically, you use the 
Multicurrency feature when you sell products and services to customers or buy 
products and services from vendors whose base currency is different from your 
home currency. If you don’t need to record transactions in multiple currencies, 
don’t turn on this feature because you can’t turn it off again.
Also be aware that the multicurrency feature in QBO doesn’t support customer- or 
currency-specific pricing. If you need either of those features, you need to use 
QuickBooks desktop.
Because you can assign only one currency to each account, customer, or vendor, 
you need to add new asset and liability accounts, customers, and vendors for each 
different currency that you will use in transactions; as you create these new 
­elements in QBO, you assign to them the currency you want to use. Be aware that, 
once you’ve posted a transaction to an account, a vendor, or a customer, you 
­cannot change the currency of the account, vendor, or customer.
Income and expense accounts continue to use your home currency — the currency 
of the country where your business is physically located.
So, if you’ve decided to use the Multicurrency feature, do these things in the order 
listed:
1.	 Turn on the Multicurrency feature.
2.	 Set up the currencies you intend to use.
3.	 Add customers, vendors, and necessary asset and liability accounts for each 
currency you expect to use. Note that QBO automatically creates Accounts 
Receivable and Accounts Payable accounts in the foreign currency after you 
create one foreign sales and one foreign purchasing transaction, so you don’t 
need to set up those accounts.
4.	 Enter transactions.

How the Multicurrency feature  
changes QBO
After you turn on the Multicurrency feature, you will see new fields in QBO.   
Specifically, you’ll see changes on these screens:
»
» When you open the Gear menu, you’ll see the Currencies option at the bottom 
of the Lists column. You use the Currencies list to establish the foreign 
currency you want to use, along with the exchange rate. I’ll describe using this 
option after I show you how to turn on the Multicurrency feature.
»
» When you view the Chart of Accounts, you’ll find a Currency column that 
shows the currency assigned to each account. You’ll also find a new 
account — an Other Expense account called Exchange Gain or Loss.
»
» When you view Bank and Credit Card registers, the currency of each transaction 
appears in brackets in the Payment, Deposit, Sales Tax, and Balance Due columns.
»
» Sales and purchase forms use both your home currency and the foreign 
currency; QBO does all the conversions for you on the screen.
»
» On QuickBooks reports, you find that QBO converts all foreign currency amounts 
to home currency amounts, automatically reflecting exchange rate changes.
Turning On the Multicurrency feature
You can change your home currency from the same place that you enable the 
­Multicurrency feature. Follow these steps:
DO I NEED THE MULTICURRENCY FEATURE?
You need the Multicurrency feature only if you work with customers or vendors whose 
base currency is different from your own base currency. Suppose that your home coun-
try does not work in U.S. dollars but you only buy and sell using your home country’s 
currency. In this case, you work in a single currency and you don’t need the 
Multicurrency feature. Instead, you need to use the International version of QBO and 
set your home currency to the proper denomination — and you’ll find steps to set your 
home currency in the section “Turning on the Multicurrency feature.”
If you turn on the Multicurrency feature, you cannot change your home currency.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      53
Once you turn on the Multicurrency feature, you cannot change your home 
currency.
1.	 Click Gear ➪   Account and Settings.
QBO displays the Account and Settings dialog box.
2.	 Click Advanced.
3.	 Scroll down to the Currency section.
4.	 Set your home currency by clicking the Home Currency list box.
Choose the currency of your country. If you’re not in the United States, don’t 
set the United States as your home currency.
5.	 Select Multicurrency (see Figure 3-23).
QBO warns you that, once you turn on the Multicurrency feature:
a)	 You can’t turn it off, and
b)	 You can’t change your home currency.
6.	 Select I Understand I Can’t Undo Multicurrency.
7.	 Click Save.
8.	 Click Done.
You can’t turn off the Multicurrency feature because it affects many accounts and 
balances in QBO.
FIGURE 3-23:

Multicurrency.

54      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Setting up currencies
After enabling the multicurrency option, you’ll find an option to display the Cur-
rencies list if you click the Gear button; the Currencies option appears at the bot-
tom of the Lists section on the Gear menu. Follow these steps to set up the 
currencies you need to use:
1.	 Click Gear ➪   Currencies.
QBO displays the Currencies page (see Figure 3-24).
2.	 In the upper right corner of the page, click Add Currency.
QBO displays a drop-down list.
3.	 Select a currency you want to use.
4.	 Click Add.
QBO redisplays the Currencies page with the new currency added.
QBO always records exchange rates, shown on the Currencies page, as the number 
of home currency units needed to equal one foreign currency unit. QBO downloads 
exchange rates every four hours from Wall Street On Demand, but you can, if you 
want, provide your own exchange rate. Click the Edit Currency Exchange link 
beside the rate you want to edit and supply the rate you want to use.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      55
Using multiple currencies
Let’s examine, briefly, the effects of creating an invoice that uses multiple cur-
rencies; creating a purchase transaction for a foreign vendor works in a similar 
fashion.
Suppose that you have a customer whose base currency is the Canadian dollar and 
your home currency is the U.S. dollar. So, in this example, when I refer to the 
“foreign currency,” I mean the Canadian dollar.
At this time, QBO doesn’t support letting either your employees or contractors 
record time entries (using either the Weekly Timesheet or the Single Time Activity) 
associated with a foreign currency customer.
First, create the customer: Click Customers ➪   New Customer. Fill in the window as 
you usually would with the following addition: Click the Payment and Billing tab. 
Then open the This Customer Pays Me With list and select the customer’s cur-
rency. In Figure 3-25, my customer, uninspiringly named Foreign Currency, uses 
the Canadian Dollar.
You’ll find a similar setting available when you create a new vendor.
FIGURE 3-25: 
Assigning a 
foreign currency 
to a new 
customer.

56      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Once you save the customer, if you look at the Customer list page, you’ll see the 
customer listed, and, in the Currency column, you’ll see the foreign currency. 
Your home currency customers display your home currency.
Next, in the Invoice window, select your “foreign transaction” customer. QBO 
automatically displays, below the customer’s name, the two currencies (first the 
foreign currency and then your home currency) associated with the transaction 
(see Figure 3-26).
Once you add products or services to the invoice, as shown in Figure 3-27, the 
amounts for each line appear in the foreign currency, and totals appear in both 
currencies. The Balance Due on the transaction appears in the foreign (customer’s) 
currency so that your customer knows how much to pay.
Saving your first sales or purchase document for a customer or vendor using a 
foreign currency makes QBO automatically establish a foreign currency-related 
Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable account.
Reports in QBO show values in your home currency. Figure 3-28 shows the A/R 
Aging Summary; the customer who uses a foreign currency is the third customer 
on the list.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      57
Figure 3-29, the Balance Sheet, shows the multiple Accounts Receivable accounts 
QBO uses when you’ve enabled the Multicurrency feature and created a sales 
transaction using a foreign currency; the values on the report appear in the home 
currency.

Updating the Chart of Accounts
On the Advanced tab of the Account and Settings dialog box, you see that you can 
turn on account numbers for the accounts in your Chart of Accounts. To make 
changes to those accounts, choose Gear ➪   Chart of Accounts or Transactions ➪   Chart 
of Accounts. On the page that appears (see Figure 3-30), you can perform a variety 
of functions. For example, you can print a list of your accounts if you click the Run 
Report button, which is at the top of the page.
If you’ve enabled the Multicurrency feature, you’ll see a Currency column on the 
Chart of Accounts page.
For individual accounts, you can perform a few actions. Balance Sheet accounts 
have registers; you can view the transactions in the account by clicking View 
Register in the Action column. You can identify Balance Sheet accounts by looking 
in the Type column. Balance Sheet accounts display one of the following account 
types:
»
» Bank
»
» Accounts Receivable
»
» Other Current Assets
»
» Fixed Assets

» Equity
For other accounts — the ones without registers — you can run reports for the 
account by clicking Run Report in the Action column.
You also can edit any account and you can delete an account you have not yet used. 
Click the down arrow in the Action column (at the right edge of the account’s row) 
to display a short menu of the actions you can take for the account.
If you edit an account, don’t change its type unless you’re sure you know what 
you’re doing. Consider consulting your accountant before you make a change to an 
account’s category or detail type. You also can identify if the account is actually a 
sub-account of another account.
If you decide to turn on account numbers, you can click the Batch Edit icon (it 
looks like a pencil and appears just above the Action column). The appearance of 
the Chart of Accounts page changes to enable you to quickly assign account num-
bers (see Figure 3-31).

A FEW NOTES ON PAYING OWNERS
Many small business owners wonder about the accounts they should use to pay them-
selves. Owners and partners typically are not considered employees and therefore are 
not paid through payroll. To pay an owner or partner, use the Chart of Accounts page to 
set up a Draw account (Owner’s Draw, Partner’s Draw, whatever is appropriate; if you 
have multiple partners, set up draw accounts for each partner) and use it to pay 
owners. The Draw account is an equity account. Similarly, owners and partners some-
times put their own money into the business; to account for these contributions, set up 
equity accounts (again, one for each owner or partner) called Owner’s Contribution, 
Partner’s Contribution — again, whatever is appropriate.
Note that you use the Draw account not only to pay the owner but also to account for 
personal items an owner might buy using the business’s money. You record the with-
drawals using the appropriate bank account and the appropriate Draw account. Note 
that these transactions don’t show up on your Profit and Loss report because they are 
not business expenses. To find out the total amount paid to an owner, run a report for 
the Draw account.
And, finally, housekeeping about the Draw and Contribution accounts: At the end of 
your fiscal year, you need to enter a journal entry, dated on the last day of your fiscal 
year, that moves the dollar amounts from the appropriate Draw or Contribution 
account to Retained Earnings — another equity account. If I just lost you, talk to your 
accountant about how to handle closing the year.
FIGURE 3-31: 
The Chart of 
Accounts page in 
Batch Edit mode.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      61
If you’ve enabled the Multicurrency feature, the Chart of Accounts page in Batch 
Edit mode also contains a Currency column.
Type a number for each account; when you finish entering all the numbers, click 
the Save button at the top of the page. QBO displays the account number as part of 
the account name on the Chart of Accounts screen.
You also can establish budgets for accounts; see Appendix A for details.
The screens you use to add or edit an account look almost exactly alike. Because 
you’ll need a Bank account for your company, we’ll examine the screens as you 
create your Bank account. If you plan to connect your QBO Bank account to its cor-
responding account at a financial institution, don’t follow these steps; instead, 
see Chapter 8 for details on creating the account. And, if you decide now that you 
don’t want to connect and later you decide that you do want to connect, all isn’t 
lost. Once again, see Chapter 8 for details on merging the Bank account you create 
here with an online version.
To ensure an accurate bank balance in QBO, reconcile your bank account before 
you set up the account in QBO. Follow these steps to create an account in QBO:
1.	 Click the New button on the Chart of Accounts page to open the Account 
dialog box (see Figure 3-32).
2.	 Open the Category Type list and choose Bank.
FIGURE 3-32: 
The dialog box 
you use to create 
an account.

62      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
3.	 Click the entry in the Detail Type list that most closely matches the type 
of account you want to add.
QBO uses the choice you make in the Detail Type list as the account’s name, 
but you can change the name to something else. For my example, I chose 
Checking, changed the account name to Checking-Chase Bank, and supplied 
Chase Checking account as the description.
4.	 If you’re using account numbers, supply a number for the new account.
You can, optionally, supply a description for the account.
If you’ve enabled the Multicurrency feature, the dialog box you use to create a 
bank account — or any type of asset or liability account except an Accounts 
Receivable (A/R) or Accounts Payable (A/P) account — also contains a list box 
from which you select the currency for the account. QBO automatically creates 
currency-related A/R and A/P accounts when you create transactions for 
foreign customers and vendors.
5.	 You can enter your account’s balance as it appears on the last statement 
you received from your bank.
My example company is just starting out and has no opening balance yet, so 
I’m not entering an opening balance. See the sidebar, “Proper account 
balances,” for details on what to do here.
6.	 Click Save.
QBO redisplays the Chart of Accounts page and your new account appears in 
the list.
PROPER ACCOUNT BALANCES
If you’ve been in business for a while, transactions have occurred. To ensure accurate 
account balances, you need to account for these transactions in QBO.
To make sure that you start your work in QBO with correct account balances, begin by 
deciding on the first date you intend to use QBO. This date determines the “as of” date 
of historical information you need to collect. Try to start using QBO on the first day of an 
accounting period — either on the first day of your company’s fiscal year or on the first 
day of a month. If you start using QBO Payroll (QBOP) on January 1, you do not need to 
enter any historical payroll information.
Although it might seem like more work, I suggest that the easiest way for you to ensure 
proper account balances is to enter $0 as your Bank account’s opening balance in  
Step 5 in the preceding steps for creating a Bank account. Then enter all transactions 
that have occurred so far this year.

CHAPTER 3  Creating a Client Company in QBO      63
If you’ve been in business since before the beginning of the year, enter $0 for your Bank 
account’s balance and ask your accountant for opening amounts for your Balance Sheet 
accounts as of December 31 of last year. Enter these amounts by entering a journal 
entry: Click the plus sign (+) icon at the top of QBO and choose Journal Entry from the 
Other column in the list.
The transactions you enter for the current year will ultimately affect your bank balance 
(for example, a customer eventually pays an invoice), and, when you finish entering the 
transactions, your QBO Bank account balance should agree with the one your financial 
institution has. So, I suggest that you enter transactions for all customer invoices (and 
corresponding payments customers made) and all vendor bills (and corresponding pay-
ments you made) during the current year.
If you choose to ignore my suggestion and enter an opening amount for your bank bal-
ance in Step 5, you need to then enter all transactions that have affected your bank 
account since the last statement.
QBO posts balances you enter while creating an account to the Opening Balance Equity 
(Equity) account, an account created by QuickBooks. Most accountants don’t like this 
account and will want to create journal entries to move the balances to proper 
accounts.
That second approach sounds like a lot less work and, if you don’t use payroll, or you 
make payroll payments from a separate bank account, you can safely ignore my sugges-
tion and enter an opening amount for your bank balance in Step 5 and then enter out-
standing customer invoices and unpaid vendor bills.
But, if your company does prepare payroll, has prepared one or more payrolls so far 
this year, and you use only one bank account, I strongly urge you to take my suggestion 
because you need accurate annual information to successfully manage payroll. The eas-
iest way to ensure that you have accurate annual payroll information is to enter all pay-
rolls you’ve completed this year so far — and these payrolls will affect your Bank 
account, so, entering a Bank account balance in Step 5 will lead you into trouble. Yes, 
you can try to do a mix of both approaches and subtract payroll amounts from the bank 
balance you previously entered in Step 5, but that approach is seriously error-prone.
If you use one bank account for everything and you feel that entering all transactions 
that have occurred so far this year is just too much work, I suggest that you enter your 
bank account’s balance as of your last bank statement, enter outstanding invoices and 
unpaid vendor bills, and then contact Intuit technical support for help entering historical 
payroll information.

Taking Advantage of QuickBooks Labs
You might be wondering about the QuickBooks Labs option on the Gear menu (you 
can see it if you refer back to Figure 3-13). Intuit calls QuickBooks Labs its “high-
tech playground.” If you’re adventurous, check out the lab and turn on experi-
mental features to see how they work.
In most cases, features you find in QuickBooks Labs eventually become part  
of QBO.
For example, when I wrote this, the Import Style feature discussed earlier in this 
chapter was a QuickBooks Labs feature and therefore didn’t appear by default. 
Here’s how you turn on a QuickBooks Lab feature:
1.	 Log in to your company.
2.	 Click Gear ➪   QuickBooks Labs.
The QuickBooks Labs window appears (see Figure 3-33).
Note that you can provide feedback on QuickBooks Labs features. The more 
positive feedback a feature receives, the more likely that feature will become a 
standard part of QBO.
3.	 Check out the features available and, for any you want to try, click the 
Off button.
The Off button changes to the On button.
FIGURE 3-33:

turn on features 
not yet available 
by default in

4.	 When you finish turning on features, click Done.
Your QBO company reappears, with the features you selected enabled.
You might need to refresh the browser page to see the new features you choose  
to make available. Click your browser’s Refresh button or press F5 on your 
keyboard.
Signing In to and Out of QBO
If you followed the process in this chapter to sign up for QBO, you’re currently 
signed in to QBO. But, obviously, you don’t sign up for QBO every time you want 
to use it. And then, of course, there’s the question of how you sign out of QBO each 
time you finish using it.
To sign out of QBO, click the Gear button and, from the menu shown earlier in 
Figure 3-13, click Sign Out (at the bottom of the list of commands under Your 
Company).
To sign in to QBO in the future, visit qbo.intuit.com (you get redirected to a long 
web address you don’t need to type) and supply your username and password (see 
Figure 3-34). I suggest you bookmark this page to make signing in easy.

Managing List 
Information
L
ike its cousin the QuickBooks desktop product, QBO relies on lists to help you 
store background information that you’ll use again and again. For the most 
part, you enter information about the people with whom you do business — 
customers, vendors, and employees — and the stuff you sell or buy. But you also 
store other background information in lists, such as the accounts your company 
uses and the payment methods your company accepts. In this chapter, you’ll find 
information that all QBO users need about setting up customers and vendors. And, 
QBO users will be interested in the portions of this chapter that focus on setting 
up items you sell or buy. Finally, at the end of the chapter, you learn where to find 
other lists you might need.
Importing People into a List
If you’ve been running your business for a while, you probably have lists of cus-
tomers and vendors. If they’re stored electronically, you might be able to save 
yourself some setup time in QBO if you import them. And, because most people 
tend to worry about accounting “later,” after they’ve been running the business 
Chapter 4

68      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
for a bit, I’ll start this chapter by assuming you do have lists stored in some elec-
tronic form. In the Adding New People to a List section of this chapter, I’ll show 
you how to manually set up a customer or vendor. That will be important to those 
of you who don’t have anything already in electronic form, and to all of you as 
your business grows and you add new customers and vendors.
If you’ve been using the QuickBooks desktop product, you can import your list 
information from it into your free trial of QBO, which can help you become accus-
tomed to QBO using list information you already recognize.
Importing list information is not the same as importing a QuickBooks ­desktop 
company. For details on importing a company, see Chapter 12 in Part 3.
Even if you haven’t been using QuickBooks desktop, be aware that you can import 
list information from an Excel file or a CSV file. CSV stands for comma-separated 
values; most programs, including QuickBooks desktop, enable you to export infor-
mation to a CSV format. Coincidentally, Excel can open and save CSV files. So you 
can open a CSV file, edit it in Excel as needed, and then resave it as a CSV file. Or, 
after editing, you can save the file as an Excel 97-2003 workbook.
You can create a CSV file by saving an Excel file in CSV format. With the Excel file 
open, choose File➪Save As. In the Save As dialog box, change the Save As Type list 
below the filename from Excel Workbook to CSV (Comma Delimited).
You use the same process to import customers or vendors from a QuickBooks desk-
top product. QBO is more obvious about encouraging you to import customers, as 
you can see from Figure 4-1, which appears when you click Customers in the Navi-
gation bar before you’ve added any customers. Because the screens for importing 
customers or vendors are the same after the first screen, I’ll show you how to 
import vendors (QBO is less obvious in its encouragement to import vendors).
Follow these steps:
To successfully import information into QBO from a CSV file or an Excel work-
book, the information must conform to a specific format. And, luckily, QBO gives 
you the option to download a sample file in Excel format so that you can view the 
required format for importing list information; you can use this sample as a 
guideline for setting up the data in your own file.
The steps that follow assume you have installed Excel on your computer. If you 
don’t own a copy of Excel, you can use Excel Mobile, the free app from Microsoft. 
To make editing changes to your files in Excel Mobile, you need to sign in to Excel 
Mobile with your Microsoft account email and password.

To download and view the sample file for vendors, follow these steps:
1.	 Click Vendors in the Navigation bar to display the Vendors page (see

If you’re working on importing customers, skip Steps 1 to 3 and instead, click 
Customers in the Navigation bar and then click the Upload Excel or CSV File 
button to have QBO display the Import Customers page. From this point on, 
the steps to import customers and vendors are identical.
4.	 Click the Download a sample file link.
Once you click the link, QBO downloads the sample file and displays a button 
in the Windows taskbar for it.
5.	 Click the sample file’s button in the Windows taskbar.
The sample file opens in Excel (see Figure 4-4).
6.	 Examine the file’s content by scrolling to the right to see the information 
stored in each column.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      71
7.	 Create your own file, modeling it on the sample file.
If you’ve been using QuickBooks desktop, you can export lists to CSV or Excel 
files; see QuickBooks desktop Help for details.
You’ll find that importing your data works best if you can match the headings 
in your data file to the ones found in the sample data file. Also, your data file 
cannot contain more than 1,000 rows or exceed 2MB in size. Don’t forget to 
save your data file as either an Excel 97-2003 workbook or as a CSV (comma-
delimited) file.
FIGURE 4-4: 
A file showing the 
format you need 
to successfully 
import list 
information.
THE DATA FILE’S LAYOUT IN EXCEL
Excel stores the information in the sample file (and you’ll need to store the information 
in your data file) in a table format, where each row in the Excel file contains all the infor-
mation about a single vendor or customer (each row is referred to as a record), and each 
column contains the same piece of information for all customers and vendors (each 
column is referred to as one field in a record). For example, in Figure 4-4, all the informa-
tion about Adam Saraceno appears in Row 3, and all vendor email addresses appear in 
Column C. Also note that Row 1 contains a label that identifies the type of information 
found in each column; don’t forget to include identifying labels in your data file.

72      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
After you have created an Excel file or a CSV file containing your list information, 
you can import it. Follow these steps:
1.	 Make sure your data file is not open.
2.	 Follow Steps 1 to 3 to display the Import Vendors page shown previously 
in Figure 4-4.
3.	 Click the Browse button.
4.	 Navigate to the folder where you saved the file containing your list 
information.
5.	 Select the file and choose Open.
QBO updates the Import Vendors page with the name of the file you selected.
6.	 Click Next.
QBO uploads your file and displays the Map Data screen shown in Figure 4-5.
7.	 Make sure that the fields in your data file correctly match fields in QBO.
As needed, open the list box beside each QBO field name and match it to the 
labels in your data file.
8.	 Click Next.
QBO displays the records it has identified (see Figure 4-6).

9.	Review the records QBO proposes to import to make sure the informa-
tion is correct.
You can make changes to the information in any field by clicking that field and 
typing. You also can uncheck any row to avoid importing the information in 
that row to QBO.
10.	When you are satisfied that the information is correct, click the Import 
button in the lower right corner of the screen.
QBO imports the information and displays a message that identifies the 
number of records imported. The list you imported appears on the appropri-
ate page (see Figure 4-7).

Adding New People to a List
You use the Customers, Vendors, and Employees links in the Navigation bar to 
work with, well, your customers, vendors, and employees. In this section, I’ll 
show you how to set up a new customer. The steps are the same to set up a new 
vendor or a new employee; you just start by clicking the appropriate link in the 
Navigation bar. Follow these steps to set up a new customer in QBO:
If you have determined that your company needs to use the Multicurrency feature, 
turn it on before you start creating people so that you have available the fields you 
need to establish each person’s currency. See Chapter 3 for details on the Multi-
currency feature.
1.	 Click Customers in the Navigation bar to display the Customers page 
shown in Figure 4-8.
If you see the page shown earlier in Figure 4-1, you can, for Step 2, click the You 
Can Also Add Customers Manually link at the bottom of the page.

4.	 Click Save.
QBO saves the customer and displays a page showing information specific to 
that customer, such as the customer’s transactions. If you click Customers in 
the Navigation bar, the Customers list page reappears, and the new customer 
now appears in the list.
You can make any list entry inactive. Click that entry in the appropriate list, and 
then click the Action down arrow at the right edge of the list. In the list that opens, 
click Make Inactive.

WHAT’S A SUB-CUSTOMER?
Sub-customers are a way for you to create a hierarchy for customers, and you can  
use sub-customers pretty much any way you want. For example, if you’re an architect, 
sub-customers might represent jobs or projects. If you’re an attorney, sub-customers 
could represent cases.
If you set up sub-customers, you can choose to bill either the parent or the sub- 
customer. Sub-customers’ balances are included in the parent customer’s balance. 
Transactions for sub-customers appear in the sub-customer’s register as well as the 
parent customer’s register.
You can create as many sub-customers as you want, but, for any given customer, you 
can assign sub-customers up to five levels deep, including the parent customer.

Searching Lists for People
You can use the Customers, Vendors, and Employees pages in a variety of ways. 
From the Customers, Vendors, or Employees pages that list all the people in those 
categories, you can sort the people in the list, export the list to Excel, and perform 
actions on a selected group of people on the list.
Working with a particular person
You can select a particular customer, vendor, or employee and view the transac-
tions associated with that person as well as the person’s details, and you can 
attach files to the person. For this section, I’ll work with customers.
To search for a particular person, type some characters that match the person or 
company name in the search box that appears above the list of people (see 
Figure 4-10).
When you select any person from the list, QBO displays the page specifically asso-
ciated with that person. The page has two tabs; in Figure 4-11, you see the Trans-
action List tab, and in Figure 4-12, you see the Customer Details tab.
FIGURE 4-10: 
To find a 
particular person 
on a list, use the 
search box that 
appears above 
the names 
on the list.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      77
From either tab, you click the Edit button to edit information on the page; you also 
can click the New Transaction button to add a transaction associated with that 
person.
From the details page of a person, you can attach files to keep track of important 
financial information. For example, you can attach a vendor’s 1099 document, a 
customer’s contract, or an employee’s receipts. You’re not limited to text docu-
ments; you also can attach photos. Simply drag and drop the item into the Attach-
ments box at the bottom left side of the appropriate details page; if you prefer, you

can click the box and a standard Windows Open dialog box appears so that you can 
navigate to and select the document you want to attach.
The attachment size is limited to 25MB.  To view documents you’ve already 
attached, click the Show existing link below the Attachments box.
While viewing the Transaction list of a particular person, you can add the Attach-
ments column to the table. Display the person’s Transaction List page and then 
click the Gear button. From the list that appears, click Show More (see Figure 4-13). 
Show More changes to Show Less and a check box for Attachments appears; click it 
and the Attachments column appears as part of the table grid. You can identify it as 
the column heading with a paper clip.
Displaying the Attachments column for one person displays it in the Transaction 
List table for all persons in that category.
When you finish working with one person, you can easily switch to another in that 
list using the list’s Split View. You can click the Split View icon, shown earlier in 
Figure 4-13, to display the people stored in the list (see Figure 4-14).
FIGURE 4-13: 
Adding the 
Attachments 
column to the 
table on the 
Transaction List.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      79
From the Split View, you can scroll down to find a person, or you can type a few 
letters of the person’s name or company name in the search box at the top of the 
list to find that person in the list. Or, you can sort the list by name or by open 
­balance. Click a person to switch to that person’s page.
To add a new person to the list, click the plus (+) symbol at the top of the list to 
see the dialog box shown earlier in Figure 4-9. To display the Customers page 
shown earlier in Figure 4-7, click Customers at the top of the Split View list or 
click Customers in the Navigation bar.
To close Split View, click the Close Split View button (refer to Figure 4-14).
Sorting a list
In addition to sorting in Split View, you can sort the lists on the Customers and 
Vendors page by name or open balance. By default, QBO sorts the entries on these 
pages alphabetically by name in ascending order.
To change the sort order for either of these lists, click the Customers or Vendors 
link in the Navigation bar to display the appropriate page; for this example, I use 
the Customers page.
Next, click the heading for the column by which you want to sort. If you click the 
Customer/Company column heading, QBO displays the customers in descending 
alphabetical order. If you click the Open Balance column heading, QBO sorts the 
list in Open Balance order, from lowest to highest.
FIGURE 4-14: 
Displaying a list’s 
Split View.

80      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Once you turn on payroll, you can sort the employees that appear in the payroll list 
alphabetically in ascending or descending order by clicking the Name column 
heading.
Exporting a list to Excel
You can export a list of your customers or vendors to Excel.
In this section, I assume you have a copy of Excel on your computer; otherwise, 
downloading your list to an Excel file wouldn’t make much sense. If you don’t 
have a copy of Excel on your computer, you can download and use the free mobile 
version of Excel.
Click the appropriate link in the Navigation bar to display either the Customers 
page or the Vendors page; I use the Vendors page in this example. At the right edge 
of the page, just above the list, three buttons appear. Click the middle button, and 
QBO exports the list to an Excel file; a button for the file appears at the bottom of 
the screen (see Figure 4-15).
Click the button at the bottom of the screen, and Excel opens the file. You can edit 
the file if you click the Enable Editing button in the yellow bar at the top of the 
window.
FIGURE 4-15: 
Exporting a 
vendor list to 
Excel.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      81
If you’re using Excel mobile, you need to sign in using your Microsoft account to 
edit the file.
Working with a batch of people
When you work with customers or vendors, you can take certain actions simultane-
ously for a group of people. For example, you can select specific vendors by clicking 
the check box beside each name and then send the same email to those vendors.
For customers, in addition to sending email, you can send statements to them.
To use one of these actions for a group of people, click the appropriate link in the 
Navigation bar to display the associated page. For this example, I used the Cus-
tomers page.
Next, click the check box beside the names you want to include in your action and 
then click the Batch actions button (see Figure 4-16). Select the action you want 
to take, and then follow the prompts onscreen to complete the action.
Changing Settings for People Lists
You can, to some extent, control the appearance of the lists on the Customers 
page, the Vendors page, and the Employees page. For example, you can opt to 
show or hide street address, email, and phone number information, and you can 
opt to include or exclude inactive entries in the list. You also can control the 
FIGURE 4-16: 
Performing an 
action for several 
customers.

82      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
number of entries displayed on each page, as well as adjust those entries’ column 
widths.
Click the appropriate link in the Navigation bar to display the associated page; for 
this section, I worked on the Vendors page.
To control the information displayed in the list, click the Gear button at the right 
edge of the page just above the list’s labels (see Figure  4-17). Then select or 
­deselect check boxes to display or hide information. Click outside the list when 
you finish.
When you click outside the list, I suggest that you click in the empty area at the 
bottom of the Navigation bar (below the Apps link) so that you don’t accidentally 
navigate away from the current page.
To adjust the width of any column, slide the mouse pointer into the row of column 
heading labels above the list and place it over the right edge of the column you 
want to adjust. Drag the mouse when the mouse pointer changes to a pair of verti-
cal lines and a pair of horizontal arrows pointing outward, (see Figure 4-18). A 
vertical bar appears to guide you in resizing the column. Release the mouse button 
when you’re satisfied with the column width.
QBO remembers column width adjustments you make in registers and on pages 
like the Customers and Vendors pages, even after you sign out of QBO and then 
sign back in again.
FIGURE 4-17: 
Controlling  
the information 
that appears 
in the list.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      83
Working with Products and Services Items
Inventory tracking is available in the QBO Plus edition, and you need to turn on 
the feature. Click Gear  ➪   Account and Settings. In the Account and Settings dialog 
box, click Sales and, in the Products and Services section, click Track Inventory 
Quantity On Hand.
QBO Plus can support inventory tracking capabilities, but, if you’re looking for 
inventory capabilities to support manufacturing, you’ll be happier in QuickBooks 
desktop.
The Products and Services list, shown in Figure 4-19, is the QBO equivalent to the 
QuickBooks desktop product’s Items list.
FIGURE 4-18: 
Adjusting the 
width allotted to 
the vendor’s 
name on the 
Vendors page.
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SKUs
You can control whether SKU information appears on the Products and Services list and 
on transaction forms from the Account and Settings dialog box. Click Gear  ➪   Account 
and Settings  ➪   Sales. Click in the Products and Services section and check or uncheck 
the Show SKU column. Click Save and then click Done. Using a custom form style (see 
Chapter 3 for information on creating custom forms), you can add the SKU to your 
invoice form.

84      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You use the Products and Services list pretty much the same way you use the Cus-
tomer and Vendor lists; for example, you can search for an item by its name, SKU, 
or sales description. You can identify the columns you can use to sort the list if you 
slide your mouse over the column heading; if the mouse pointer changes to a hand, 
you can click that column to sort the list using the information in that column.
Enabling the Multicurrency feature, described in Chapter  3, has no effect on 
inventory item valuations; QBO assesses and reports inventory item values in 
home currency units, regardless of the currency used by the vendor who sold you 
the items. For that reason, the Products and Services list shows no distinctions 
related to currency.
You can import and export items using an Excel or CSV file, the same way you 
import and export people information. See the sections “Importing People into a 
List” and “Exporting a list to Excel” earlier in this chapter.
The importing and exporting processes include the information about the item’s 
taxability.
You also can print a basic report by clicking the Print button on any list page; the 
Print button appears just above the Action column. And, you can print a more 
detailed report for a list entry by selecting it and then clicking the Report button.
Establishing categories
Categories replace sub-items for QBO Plus users in all regions except France. You 
can use categories to organize what you sell and, using various Products and 
FIGURE 4-19: 
The Products and 
Services list.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      85
Services reports, hopefully help you better understand what people are buying 
from you. Categories do not affect your accounting or your financial reports and 
you cannot assign categories to transactions.
Use classes and/or locations to help further catalog transactions and financial 
information. See Chapter 3 for more information.
You can create new categories as you create items or, if you prefer, you can click 
the Manage Categories button and create categories so that they are available as 
you create items. Yes, you can do both.
From the Product Categories page shown in Figure 4-20, you can click the New 
Category button to add a category; the Category Information panel appears on the 
right side of your screen and you simply supply the category name. If the category 
is a sub-category of an existing category, check the Is a Sub-Category box and 
select the name of the existing category. Click Save at the bottom of the panel to 
set up your category.
You can create sub-categories up to four levels deep. That is, you can create a 
category called Clothing and then create a sub-category of Clothing called Shoes. 
For the Shoes sub-category, you can create a sub-category called Women’s Shoes, 
and, for the Women’s Shoes category, you can create one last sub-category called 
Sneakers. You can’t create a sub-category for Sneakers, but you can create another 
sub-category for Women’s Shoes called Dress Shoes.
If necessary, you can edit an existing category; click the Edit link beside the cat-
egory you want to modify in the table on the Product Categories page. Once again, 
FIGURE 4-20: 
The Product 
Categories page.

86      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
the Category Information panel appears, displaying the category’s current infor-
mation. Make changes and click Save; alternatively, you can click Remove to 
remove a category.
The effect on items of removing a category depends on whether you remove a 
sub-category or a category. If you remove a sub-category, QBO moves the items 
assigned to it up one level. If you remove a category (with no sub-categories) QBO 
reclassifies the items as uncategorized.
Adding service and non-inventory items
You can create inventory, non-inventory, and service items, and you can edit 
batches of items to change their type; I’ll show you how to change an item’s type 
after I show you how to add an item to the list.
1.	 To display the Products and Services list, click Gear➪Products and Services.
2.	 Click the New button.
QBO displays the Product/Service Information panel on the right side of your 
screen (see Figure 4-21) where you select whether you’re creating an inventory 
item, a non-inventory item, or a service.
3.	 Click a type to select it.
For this example, I chose Non-inventory item. You create a service item the 
same way you create a non-inventory item, supplying the same kind of 
FIGURE 4-21: 
Select a type of 
item to create.
www.allitebooks.com

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      87
information shown in these steps. See the next section, “Creating an Inventory 
Item,” for details on the additional information you supply when creating an 
inventory item.
QBO then displays the panel for the type of item you chose; Figure 4-22 shows 
the Non-inventory panel.
4.	 Supply a name for the item and, if appropriate, a stock keeping unit (SKU).
You also can select the item’s category.
You can upload a picture of the item by clicking the Upload button and 
navigating to the location where you store the picture.
5.	 In the Sales Information section, you can:
a.	 Select the I Sell This Product/Service to My Customers check box and 
supply a default description,
b.	 Supply the price you charge when you sell this item,
c.	 Select the income account associated with the item, and
d.	 Select the Is Taxable check box if appropriate.
QBO uses this information when you select this item on sales transactions.
6.	 Click the Show More link at the bottom of the window to display the 
Purchasing Information section (see Figure 4-23).
FIGURE 4-22: 
Use this window 
to create a 
non-inventory 
item.

88      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
7.	 If appropriate, place a check in the I Purchase This Product/Service From 
a Vendor check box. Then, supply a default description, the cost you pay 
when you purchase the item, and the expense account associated with 
the item.
QBO uses this information when you select this item on expense transactions.
8.	 Click Save and Close.
QBO saves the item and redisplays the Products and Services list; the new item 
appears in the list.
Creating an inventory item
Creating an inventory item has a few additional types of information you need to 
supply. As you can see in Figure 4-24, in addition to the other information you 
supply when you create a service or non-inventory item, for an inventory item 
you supply quantity on hand information as well as the inventory asset account 
that tracks your inventory items.
Supply the quantity you have on hand and the date on which you determined the 
quantity on hand. Remember, before you can sell an item, you must own some of 
it. If you don’t own any at the time you create the item, you’ll probably buy some 
of it using an expense transaction, and that will update your quantities for you.
FIGURE 4-23: 
Add purchasing 
information for 
the item.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      89
Changing item types
You can change a service or non-inventory item’s type individually or you can 
select several items and change their item types simultaneously.
FIGURE 4-24: 
Supply quantity 
on hand and 
inventory asset 
account 
information for 
inventory items.
TYPES OF CHANGES YOU CAN MAKE
Be aware that you can change item types with some limitations. Specifically, you cannot 
change Inventory items to any other item types. You can make the following types of 
changes:
•	 Non-inventory and Service items to Inventory items,
•	 Service items to Non-inventory items or Inventory items, and
•	 Non-inventory items to Service items
When changing item types, you change several items at one time only if you are chang-
ing Non-inventory items to Service items or Service items to Non-inventory items. If you 
need to change either a Service item or a Non-inventory item to an Inventory item, you 
can make the change only one item at a time.

90      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
To change any single item’s type, edit that item by clicking Edit in the Action 
­column of the Products and Services list; QBO displays the item in the Product/
Service information panel (refer to Figure 4-21). Click the Change Type link at the 
top of the panel above the item’s name.
QBO displays a panel very similar to the one shown in Figure 4-20; the only dif-
ference you’ll notice is that current item type contains a check. Click the new item 
type, and QBO redisplays the Product/Service Information panel using the new 
item type. Make any other necessary changes and click Save and Close.
Changing the type of a single item using the method just described works well 
when you only need to change one or two items. But, when you need to change 
multiple items, use a different approach to save time when changing items of the 
same type to a different type; follow these two steps:
1.	 On the Products and Services page, select the check box that appears to 
the left of each item you want to change.
Make sure that you select either service items or non-inventory items, but 
not both.
QBO displays two buttons above the table of items (see Figure 4-25).
FIGURE 4-25: 
Changing  
the type of 
multiple items 
simultaneously.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      91
2.	 Click the Batch Actions button and select the new type for the selected 
items.
QBO whirs a bit and then redisplays the Products and Services list, showing the 
new item types for the items you selected in Step 1.
Note the Assign Category button at the top of the Products and Services list; this 
button appears when you select multiple items, and you can use it to simultane-
ously assign the same category to multiple items.
Adjusting inventory item information
On occasion, you might need to make adjustments to inventory item information. 
Specifically, you might need to adjust inventory item quantities on hand or start-
ing values.
You can edit any item to change descriptive information, such as its name or 
description; just click the Edit link in the Action column beside its name on the 
Products and Services page to view the item’s information in the panel shown 
previously in Figures  4-22,  4-23, and  4-24. In this section, I’m talking about 
adjusting inventory item information, which encompasses more than editing 
descriptive information.
Adjusting inventory quantities
You might discover, particularly after physically counting inventory, that you 
have a different number of an inventory item than reported in QBO. In this case, 
you need to adjust the quantity in QBO to match what you actually have in stock.
Remember to use the Physical Inventory Worksheet report in QBO to record item 
quantities on hand as you count inventory. The report information can help you 
determine the adjustments you need to make. See Chapter 10 for details on work-
ing with QBO reports.
To create an adjustment for a just a few inventory items, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create menu (+ at the top of the QBO window) and choose 
Inventory Qty Adjustment (see Figure 4-26).
Don’t forget that the Create menu plus sign changes to an X when the menu 
is open.
QBO displays the Inventory Quantity Adjustment window (see Figure 4-27).
2.	 If necessary, change the adjustment date and the Inventory Adjustment 
Account.

92      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
3.	 In the table, click the Product field, click the drop-down arrow that 
appears, and select an inventory item.
QBO fills the inventory item’s SKU, description, and quantity on hand. QBO also 
suggests the Qty On Hand value for the New Qty value.
If you’ve enabled class and location tracking, you can supply information for 
those fields as you complete the Inventory Quantity Adjustment window.
4.	 Enter either a new quantity or a change in quantity.
Suppose that the Qty On Hand field indicates you own 25 of your item and you 
need to reduce the quantity you own by 5. You do either of the following:
a.	 Enter 20 in the New Qty field, or
b.	 Enter -5 in the Change in Qty field.
FIGURE 4-27: 
You can use this 
window when 
you have just a 
few adjustments 
to make.
FIGURE 4-26: 
Starting an 
inventory  
item adjustment 
for a single 
inventory item.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      93
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each inventory item you need to adjust.
6.	 In the Memo field, enter a description that explains why you made this 
adjustment.
7.	 Click Save.
If you have a lot of inventory items to adjust, you can save some time by preselect-
ing them and adjusting them as a batch. Choose Gear➪Products and Services to 
display the Products and Services page (see Figure 4-28).
Then, select the inventory items you want to adjust by placing a check in the column 
to the left of the item name. Click the Batch Actions button and choose Adjust Quan-
tity. QBO displays the Inventory Quantity Adjustment window shown previously in 
Figure 4-27, but prefills the window with the information about the inventory items 
you selected. Complete Steps 4, 6, and 7 above for each item in the window.
Editing an inventory quantity adjustment
If you need to edit an inventory quantity adjustment you previously saved 
(hey . . . it happens), follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create menu plus sign (+)➪Inventory Qty Adjustment to display 
the Inventory Quantity Adjustment window.
2.	 In the upper left corner of the window, click the Recent Transactions 
button (see Figure 4-29).
QBO displays recent inventory adjustment transactions.
FIGURE 4-28: 
Selecting multiple 
inventory items 
to adjust.

94      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
3.	 If the adjustment appears in the list, click it.
If the adjustment doesn’t appear, click More to display the Search page, where 
you can expand your search for the transaction. In most cases, changing the 
date range will do the trick.
4.	 Make the necessary changes.
You can remove a line from an adjustment by clicking its Delete button at the 
right edge of the row.
5.	 Click Save and Close.
Adjusting an inventory item’s starting value
Suppose that you made a mistake when you set up the starting value for an inven-
tory item; you can edit the item’s starting value as long as you created the inven-
tory item after the November 2015 QBO release.
Changing an item’s starting value can have wide-ranging effects, and QBO will 
display a warning to this effect when you start your inventory item starting value 
adjustment. If you’re not sure about what you’re doing, ask your accountant. Please.
To adjust an inventory item’s starting value, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Gear➪Products and Services.
FIGURE 4-29:

to edit.

CHAPTER 4  Managing List Information      95
2.	 In the Action column beside the inventory item you want to adjust, click 
the drop-down arrow and select Adjust Starting Value (see Figure 4-30).
QBO displays a warning explaining that changing an inventory item’s starting 
value may affect the initial value of your inventory.
3.	 Assuming you’ve heeded the warning above and know what you’re doing, 
click Got it!
QBO displays the Inventory Starting Value window (see Figure 4-31).
FIGURE 4-30: 
Getting ready to 
adjust the

FIGURE 4-31: 
Use this window 
to adjust an

96      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
If you’ve enabled class and location tracking, note that you can supply informa-
tion for those fields along with other fields that affect the inventory item’s 
starting value.
4.	 Make the necessary changes.
You can’t change an item’s inventory asset account from the Inventory Starting 
Value window. To change the item’s inventory asset account, display the 
Products and Services page and click the Edit link for the item to display the 
item’s information in the Inventory Item Product/Services Information panel 
shown previously in Figure 4-24.
5.	 Click Save and Close.
A Look at Other Lists
Just as QuickBooks desktop has other lists besides lists of people and items, QBO 
also has other lists. To find them, click the Gear icon beside the company name 
and, from the menu that appears, click All Lists in the second column from the 
left. QBO displays the Lists page shown in Figure 4-32.
Click any list name to open that list and work with it. You can add new entries, 
select and edit existing entries, and select and delete entries that have never been 
used. The steps to create any new list element are pretty much the same as the 
steps you’ve seen in this chapter to create people, items, and product categories.

Dealing with the 
Outflow of Money
I
t’s always more fun to make money than to spend it, but paying bills is part of 
life — unless you’re living in Star Trek: The Next Generation, where they have no 
bills — but, I digress. This chapter explores the transactions you use in QBO to 
meet your financial obligations.
To record most expense-related transactions, you can choose Transactions ➪   
Expenses to display the Expense Transactions page shown in Figure 5-1. Click the 
New Transaction button to select a transaction type.
If the transaction type you want to record isn’t available, click the Create plus  
sign (+) icon at the top of QBO and choose the type of transaction you want to 
record from the Create menu that appears; expense-related transactions show up 
in the Vendors column (see Figure 5-2).
The Create icon changes to an X when you open the menu.

GETTING UP-AND-RUNNING
If you start using QBO after you’ve been in business for a while and have some outstand-
ing bills you haven’t yet paid, you can use those bills as a learning tool and enter them as 
described in this chapter. If you recorded an opening bank account balance back in 
Chapter 3, be sure to enter into QBO the checks you’ve written that haven’t yet cleared 
your bank. If you didn’t record an opening bank account balance back in Chapter 3, or 
you recorded a bank account balance as of December 31 of last year, be sure to enter 
into QBO all the checks you’ve written this year, even if they have cleared the bank.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      99
Writing a Check
Typically, you enter a check transaction when you intend to print a check to pay 
for an expense. Suppose that the UPS guy has just made a delivery for which you 
owe money and you want to give him a check: Use the Check transaction. You can 
print the check immediately or at a later time.
Assigning a check to accounts or items
When you write a check, you need to assign the expense for which you’re writing 
the check to either an account or an item, and you can assign one check to both 
accounts and items. Follow these steps to enter and print a check:
1.	 On the Expense Transactions page, click the New Transaction button.
2.	 From the list that appears, click Check.
QBO displays the Check window, which is divided into four sections:
•	 The Header section: Shown in Figure 5-3, this section displays the balance 
in the selected checking account, the selected payee and the payee’s 
mailing address, the payment date, the check amount and number, and 
the option to print the check later.
•	 The Account Details section: You use this table when the expense is not 
related to an item you’ve defined.
•	 The Item Details section: You use this table when you’re writing a check 
to pay for a product or service you purchased. If you don’t see this table, its 
preference isn’t enabled. To display the table, choose Account and 
Settings ➪   Expenses ➪   Bills and Expenses and edit the Show Items Table 
on Expense and Purchase Forms option.
You typically write a check using either the Account Details section or the 
Item Details section, but not both. However, you can use both sections. If 
you won’t be using a section, you can hide it by clicking the downward-
pointing arrow beside the section name.
•	 The Footer section: Contains the check total, the Memo box, and the box 
you use to attach an electronic document to the check.
FIGURE 5-3: 
The Header 
section of the 
Check window.

100      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
3.	 Choose a payee and an account from which to make the payment.
Along with the payee’s address information, QBO displays information from 
previously entered transactions unless you haven’t entered any transactions 
for that payee yet, or you have disabled the setting to display previously 
entered transaction information in Account and Settings.
If a pane appears on the right side, it displays transactions you might want to 
link to the check you’re writing — and, if that’s the case, see the next section, 
“Writing a check for an outstanding bill.” On the other hand, if the check you’re 
writing has nothing to do with any transaction that appears in the pane, just 
ignore the pane; you can hide it as described in the next section.
4.	 Double-check the payment Date, and Check Number, and make an 
appropriate selection in the Print Later check box.
5.	 Assign part or all of the check to an expense account or an item using the 
Account Details section or the Item Details section (see Figure 5-4). To 
assign a portion to an expense account:
a.	 Click in the Account column and select an appropriate expense 
account for the check you are recording.
You can type characters that appear in the account name and QBO will help 
you find the account.
FIGURE 5-4: 
The Account 
Details and Item 
Details sections 
of the Check 
window.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      101
b.	 In the Description column, describe the expense you’re paying.
c.	 In the Amount column, supply the amount of the check that you want 
to apply to the selected account.
d.	 If you incurred the expense on behalf of a customer and you want to 
bill the customer for the expense, check the Billable box — and, if 
appropriate, the Tax box — and select the customer’s name in the 
Customer column.
e.	 Repeat Steps a to d to add more lines to the check.
6.	 To assign part or all of the check to items or services you have defined, 
use the Item Details section (also shown in Figure 5-4):
a.	 Click in the Product/Service column and select an appropriate item for 
the check you are recording.
You can type characters in the Product/Service column and QBO will help 
you find the item.
b.	 Optionally, edit the Description column for the selected item.
c.	 Use the Qty, Rate, and Amount columns to supply the quantity of the 
selected item you are purchasing, the rate you’re paying for each item, 
and the amount you’re paying.
When you supply any two of the Qty, Rate, and Amount values, QuickBooks 
calculates the third value.
d.	 If you purchased the item on behalf of a customer and you want to bill 
the customer for the item, check the Billable box — and, if appropriate, 
the Tax box — and select the customer’s name in the Customer column.
e.	 Repeat Steps a to d to add more items to the check.
7.	 You can scroll down in the Check window to the Footer section, type a 
message to the payee, and attach an electronic document (such as the 
payee’s invoice) to the check.
To attach an electronic document to the check, click in the Attachments box; a 
standard Open dialog box appears that you can use to navigate to the docu-
ment. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the electronic copy into the 
Attachments box.
8.	 At the bottom of the window, you can
•	 Cancel your action or clear the window and start again.
•	 Click Print Check to print the check.

102      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
The first time you print checks, QBO walks you through the process of 
selecting the type of checks you use and aligning them for your printer.
•	 Click Order Checks to visit the Intuit Marketplace and order check 
stock.
•	 Click Make Recurring to set up the check as a recurring payment you 
intend to make on a schedule you specify.
•	 Click More to see additional actions, such as voiding the check or 
viewing its audit history.
•	 Click Save and New to save the check and redisplay the Check 
window so that you can write another check.
The Save and New button is a sticky preference. That means, if you click the drop-
down arrow to the right of the button and select Save and Close, the next time you 
open the window to write a check, the default button will be the Save and Close 
button.
Writing a check for an outstanding bill
You can use the Check window to write a check to pay a bill you previously 
entered — something that you cannot do in the QuickBooks desktop product.
Don’t use the Check transaction if you’re planning on paying several bills. Instead, 
see the section “Paying bills” at the end of this chapter.
If you select a payee for whom an outstanding bill exists, QBO displays a pane at 
the right side of the Check window (see Figure 5-5) that shows all transactions 
linked to the selected payee; each transaction appears as a separate entry. If noth-
ing in the pane applies to your transaction, you can hide the pane by clicking the 
button shown in Figure 5-5.
If you’re writing the check to pay a bill that appears in the pane, click Add in the bill 
transaction you want to pay. That way, QBO appropriately applies the check you’re 
writing to the outstanding bill and correctly reduces your outstanding obligations.
If you write a check to pay a bill and you don’t apply the check to the bill, your 
reports show that you continue to owe the bill amount to the payee, which really 
messes things up.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      103
When you click Add, QBO adds that bill to the check and switches to the Bill 
­Payment window, essentially converting the check to a bill payment transaction. 
In Figure  5-6, you see the Bill Payment window after I added an outstanding  
bill to a check in the Check window. If you compare Figures 5-5 and 5-6, you’ll 
notice that the original check number was 71, and it’s still 71 in the Bill Payment 
window.
FIGURE 5-6: 
The Bill Payment 
window.
FIGURE 5-5: 
If you select a 
payee for whom 
you previously 
entered a bill, the 
outstanding bill 
appears in the 
pane on the right 
side of the Check 
window.

104      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You complete the Bill Payment transaction the same way you complete a Check 
transaction; follow Steps 7 and 8 in the preceding section.
If you add the wrong bill to a check, you can cancel the Bill Payment transaction 
without saving it.
Creating an Expense Transaction
You use an Expense transaction when you’re trying to record an expense without 
printing a check. For example, you record Expense transactions in QBO to account 
for a payment you make using a credit or debit card. And, you use an Expense 
transaction if you have manually written a check that you now need to record in 
QBO without printing it.
The major difference between the Expense transaction window and the Check 
transaction window is the lack of any tools to help you print an Expense transac-
tion; compare Figures 5-4 and 5-7.
The Expense transaction window also contains a Payment Method list box that 
you don’t find in the Check transaction window. Other than those two differences, 
the windows appear and function the same way.
FIGURE 5-7:

transaction 
window to record

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      105
QBO AND CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS
By default, QBO treats Credit Card account transactions as cash transactions, a conser-
vative approach that recognizes expenses as they occur. To account for credit card 
transactions, set up both your credit card company as a vendor and a Credit Card 
account for the credit card in your Chart of Accounts, and use Expense transactions to 
record credit card purchases to the account as you make each purchase. If you need to 
record a credit card return, use the Credit Card Credit transaction.
When the credit card bill arrives, you can pay it in a number of ways:
•	 To pay by check, use the Check transaction, select your credit card company as the 
vendor, and, in the Account Details section, select your credit card account.
•	 To pay by transfer (where you transfer money electronically or manually from a 
bank account to your credit card account, which reduces both accounts), use the 
Transfer transaction, selecting the bank account you’ll use to pay the bill as the 
Transfer Funds From account and the credit card company/vendor you’re paying as 
the Transfer Funds To account.
•	 To pay the bill while reconciling the credit card account, follow the steps in 
Chapter 8 to reconcile the account. When you click Finish, you’ll be given the option 
to write a check to pay the amount due, enter a bill to pay the bill later, or do noth-
ing about paying the bill now (and later, on your own, enter a check or a bill for the 
amount due).
If you want to recognize credit card expenses when you pay your credit card bill (rather 
than when you make a purchase using your credit card), do set up a vendor for your 
credit card company, but don’t set up a Credit Card account in the Chart of Accounts, 
and don’t enter Expense transactions or Credit Card Credit transactions in QBO for 
credit card transactions as they occur. Instead, when you receive your credit card state-
ment, enter a Bill transaction, as described later in this chapter, and allocate each line 
on the credit card statement to the appropriate account or item; record credit card 
refunds as negative lines on the Bill transaction. QBO then treats your credit card 
account as an Accounts Payable vendor. And when you’re ready to pay the credit card 
bill, you can write a check, transfer funds, or use the Pay Bills page to pay the credit card 
statement. Remember, this is the less conservative approach to tracking credit card 
expenses; if you are a heavy user of your credit card, do yourself a favor and use the 
first approach so that you can effectively manage your credit card spending.
If you want to download credit card transaction information into QBO, see Chapter 8.

106      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Entering a Purchase Order
Businesses that order lots of stuff from vendors often use purchase orders to keep 
track of the items on order. Purchase orders in QBO do not affect any of your 
accounts; instead, they simply help you keep track of what you order. And, when 
the order arrives, you can compare the goods that come in the door with the ones 
listed on the purchase order to make sure they match.
If you plan to use purchase orders, then your ordering process typically happens 
in the following way:
»
» You place an order with a vendor and you enter a purchase order in QBO that 
matches the order you placed.
»
» You receive the items you ordered, typically along with a bill for the items; you 
then match the items you receive to the purchase order and enter a bill for 
the items. Note that sometimes you receive the bill without the items or the 
items without the bill.
»
» You pay the vendor’s bill.
You enter a purchase order using the Purchase Order transaction window; you can 
open this window either from the Expense Transactions page or from the Create 
menu (the plus sign). A typical purchase order looks like the one shown in 
­Figure  5-8, and you’ll notice the window closely resembles the Check window 
shown earlier in Figure 5-4.
FIGURE 5-8: 
The Purchase 
Order window.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      107
As you fill in the Purchase Order transaction window, QBO assigns a status of Open 
to the purchase order; the status appears just below the vendor’s name in the 
upper left corner of the transaction window.
When you receive the goods, the vendor’s bill, or both, you record a bill as described 
in the next section, or a check, an expense transaction, or a credit card charge as 
described earlier in this chapter, showing what you paid (or what you owe) the 
vendor.
When you select a vendor who has open purchase orders on any of these types of 
transactions, a pane appears on the right side of the window, showing available 
purchase orders. You add a purchase order to the transaction the same way you 
add a bill to a Check transaction: by clicking the Add button. In Figure 5-9, I’ve 
opened a Check transaction and selected a vendor who has open purchase orders.
When I click Add to add the purchase order to my transaction, QBO adds the pur-
chase order lines to the first available line in the Item Details section of my Check 
transaction. QBO also indicates, immediately below the vendor name, that the 
Check transaction has one linked transaction (see Figure 5-10).
If you save the Check transaction and then reopen the purchase order, QBO has 
changed the purchase orders status from open to closed so that you don’t acciden-
tally add the purchase order to another transaction.
FIGURE 5-9: 
The Check 
window, with a 
vendor selected 
who has open 
purchase orders.

108      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
If you add the wrong purchase order to a transaction, you can remove the pur-
chase order line in the Item Details section by clicking the Trash Can icon at the 
right edge of the line.
QBO can’t add only part of a purchase order to a transaction. So, if you receive only 
part of a purchase order, add the purchase order to your transaction and then 
record a payment for the part of the purchase order you received by deleting lines 
from the check for items you didn’t receive. To continue to track the outstanding 
part of the purchase order, you can manually close the original purchase order and 
create a new purchase order that contains the remaining outstanding items; when 
you create the second purchase order — essentially a back order — try to assign a 
number to it that helps you track it in relation to the original purchase order.
You can use your own custom purchase order numbers if you choose Gear ➪   Account 
and Settings ➪   Expenses. Then click in the Purchase Orders section to edit  
purchase order settings, select the Custom Transaction Numbers check box, and 
then click Save. You also can convert Estimate transactions to Purchase Order 
transactions; see Chapter 6 for details.
When you need to identify open purchase orders, use the Open Purchase Order List 
report. For more on reports, see Chapter 10.
Entering and Paying Bills
You use QBO’s Bill transaction to enter a bill from a vendor that you don’t want to 
pay immediately. QBO tracks the bill as a payable, which is a liability of your 
FIGURE 5-10: 
A Check 
transaction  
after adding  
a purchase 
order to it.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      109
business — money you owe but have not yet paid. Most companies that enter Bill 
transactions do so because they receive a fair number of bills and want to sit down 
and pay them at one time, but they don’t want to lose track of the bills they 
receive. They also want to be able to easily determine how much they owe; if you 
enter Bill transactions, you can print the A/P Aging Summary and Details reports 
to find that information.
Depending on the version of QBO that you use, the Bill transaction might not be 
available to you; if that’s the case, pay your bills using the Check or the Expense 
transaction.
Entering a bill
To enter a bill you receive from a vendor, use QBO’s Bill transaction. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪   Expenses.
2.	 Click the New Transaction button in the upper right corner of the 
Expenses page and select Bill.
QBO displays the Bill transaction window shown in Figure 5-11.
3.	 Select the vendor from whom you received the bill.
QBO fills in the vendor’s mailing address information.
4.	 Check and, if necessary, change the bill date and the due date.
FIGURE 5-11: 
The Bill 
­transaction 
window.

110      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
5.	 Use the Account Details section, the Item Details section, or both to 
record information about the bill.
See the section “Writing a Check” for details on filling out the Account Details sec-
tion and the Item Details section. Be aware that I hid the Account Details section 
in Figure 5-11 so that you could see the information in the Item Details section.
6.	 Optionally, scroll down to the Footer section (which isn’t shown in 
Figure 5-11) and enter information in the Memo field and attach electronic 
documents to the bill.
7.	 Click Save.
Recording a vendor credit
You enter a vendor credit to record returns to vendors or refunds from vendors. A 
vendor might supply you with a credit document that indicates you no longer owe 
the amount stated on the document, or the vendor might issue a refund check to you.
If a vendor issues a credit document, you enter a vendor credit and then apply it 
when you pay the vendor’s bill. If a vendor issues a refund check to you, you still 
enter a vendor credit, but you also enter a deposit and then link the deposit to the 
vendor credit.
Follow these steps to enter the vendor credit:
1.	 On the Expense Transaction page, click New Transaction➪Vendor Credit.
QBO displays the Vendor Credit window shown in Figure 5-12.
FIGURE 5-12: 
A Vendor Credit 
transaction.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      111
2.	 Select the vendor who issued the credit.
3.	 Enter the date of the credit.
4.	 Enter the credit amount.
5.	 In the Account Details section, select the account used on the  
original bill.
If you received the credit because you returned items to the vendor, select the 
items you returned in the Item Details section.
6.	 You can optionally scroll down and attach an electronic copy of the credit 
to the Vendor Credit transaction.
7.	 Click the arrow beside Save and New and choose Save and Close.
The Save option referenced in Step 7 is called a sticky preference, which means 
that after you select Save and Close, it will appear as the default Save option 
the next time you display this screen.
If the vendor issued only a credit document, read the section “Paying bills” to 
learn how to use the vendor credit you just entered to reduce the amount you owe 
the vendor when you pay the vendor’s bill.
RECORDING A REFUND TO A CARD CREDIT
If a vendor issues a credit to your credit card, the way you handle it depends on how 
you track credit cards in QBO.
If you haven’t set up a credit card account and you wait to enter credit card transactions 
when you receive and record the credit card vendor’s bill, enter a line on the Bill transac-
tion using the account associated with the refund and make the amount negative.
However, if you have set up a credit card account, record a Credit Card Credit transac-
tion, whether you manually record Expense transactions or download them; when you 
record a Credit Card Credit, QBO lets you post the transaction to any of your available 
credit cards. In the Account Details section, select the account associated with the 
refund. Note that when you download transactions, you’ll be able to match both 
Expense transactions and Credit Card Credit transactions to downloaded information.

112      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When a vendor issues a refund check . . .
If the vendor issued a refund check to you, you need to complete the previous 
steps to enter a vendor credit. Then, follow these steps to enter a deposit to record 
the refund check in your bank account and then link it to the vendor credit:
1.	 Click the Create plus (+) sign and, from the Other section of Create menu 
that appears, choose Bank Deposits.
QBO displays the Deposit transaction window shown in Figure 5-13.
2.	 In the Add New Deposits section, enter the following information:
•	 In the Received From column, select the vendor who issued the 
check.
•	 In the Account column, select the Accounts Payable account.
•	 In the Amount column, enter the amount of the check.
3.	 Click the arrow beside Save and New and choose Save and Close.
The Save option functions as a sticky preference and you might not see Save 
and New because you previously made a different choice.
4.	 Click the Create plus (+) sign and, from the Create menu that appears, 
choose Expense.
5.	 Select the vendor whose refund check you deposited.
QBO displays available deposits, credits, and bills (see Figure 5-14).
FIGURE 5-13: 
The Deposit 
transaction 
window.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      113
6.	 Click Add in the Deposit transaction.
7.	 Click Add in the outstanding Vendor Credit transaction.
When you add these two transactions, in this order, to the Expense, QBO 
creates a Bill Payment transaction with a net value of $0 because QBO applies 
the deposit to the vendor credit; Figure 5-15 focuses on the Details section of 
the transaction.
8.	 Click the arrow beside Save and New and choose Save and Close.

114      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Paying bills
If you’ve been entering bills from vendors, then, at some point, you need to pay 
those bills. Most people sit down once or twice a month and pay outstanding bills. 
To pay bills in QBO, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create plus (+) sign and, from the Create menu that appears, 
choose Pay Bills in the Vendors column.
QBO displays the Pay Bills page shown in Figure 5-16.
Overdue bills display a red flag.
2.	 In the Payment Account list, select an account to use to pay the bills.
3.	 Provide a payment date at the top of the screen.
4.	 Enter the number of the first check you’ll use to pay bills.
You can select the Print Later button to identify bills to pay and schedule them 
to print later; at the time you print the checks, QBO lets you establish the 
starting check number.
5.	 In the Filter list, select an option to specify the outstanding bills you want 
to consider paying.
By default, QBO displays unpaid bills for the last year, but you can limit what 
appears onscreen for your consideration by a variety of dates and even for 
selected payees.
FIGURE 5-16: 
The Pay Bills page 
lists bills you  
owe but have  
not yet paid.

CHAPTER 5  Dealing with the Outflow of Money      115
6.	 By clicking the appropriate column heading, you can opt to sort the listed 
bills by Payee, Reference Number, Due Date, or Open Balance.
7.	 Select the check box in the column at the left side of each bill you want  
to pay.
As you select bills to pay, QBO updates the Payment column using the bill 
amount as the default payment amount (see Figure 5-17). You can change the 
payment amount of any bill by typing in the Payment column.
If a vendor credit exists, QBO assumes you want to apply outstanding vendor 
credits to reduce the amount you owe a particular vendor.
8.	 Click Save and Print, or click the arrow beside Save and Print to choose 
either Save or Save and Close.
Click Save or Save and Close to mark the bills paid without printing any checks. 
Click Save and Print to print checks and mark the bills paid.
If you choose to pay the bills using a credit card instead of a bank account, the 
window looks the same except that no options appear related to printing checks, 
just as you’d expect.
If you opted, in Step 4, to print checks later, you can print those checks by choos-
ing Create ➪   Print Checks. The Print Checks option appears in the Vendors column 
of the Create menu.
FIGURE 5-17:

T
his is where the fun starts. “Why?” you ask. Because this chapter covers 
stuff related to bringing money into the business, which, from any busi-
nessperson’s perspective, is the reason you started your business — and 
therefore the most fun part!
To record most sales-related transactions, you can choose Transactions ➪   Sales to 
display the Sales Transactions page shown in Figure  6-1; then click the New 
Transaction button. If the transaction type you want to record isn’t available on 
the Sales Transactions page, open the Create menu by clicking the Create button — 
the plus sign (+) icon at the top of QBO, which changes to an X after you click it. 
Then, choose the type of transaction you want to record; sales-related transactions 
appear in the Customers column (see Figure 6-2).

GETTING UP-AND-RUNNING
If you’ve been in business while when you start using QBO, and you have some invoices 
you’ve issued but customers haven’t yet paid, you can use those invoices as a learning 
tool and enter them as described in this chapter. If you recorded an opening bank 
account balance back in Chapter 3, be sure to enter into QBO the deposits you’ve made 
since your last bank statement. If you didn’t record an opening bank account ­balance 
back in Chapter 3, or you recorded a bank account balance as of December 31 of last 
year, be sure to enter into QBO all the deposits you’ve made this year, even if they have 
cleared the bank.

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      119
Customizing Forms to Handle Subtotals
Before we dive into preparing various types of forms, you should address a house-
keeping task: setting up sales forms so that you can include subtotals on them. If 
you have no need to subtotal information on your sales forms, you can skip this 
section and move on to the next one.
You can subtotal lines on an invoice, an estimate, or a sales receipt. First, turn on 
the feature; for this example, I turn on the feature for the Invoice form. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Choose Gear ➪   Custom Form Styles.
The Custom Form Styles page appears, which displays the form styles you have 
set up.
In Chapter 3, you saw how to customize forms. If you opted not to set up any 
custom forms, you might not see anything listed on the Custom Form Styles 
page. In that case, click the New Style button and continue with these steps.
2.	 Select a form to customize, and then click Edit in the Action column.
The Customize Form Style dialog box appears.
3.	 On the left side of the dialog box, click the Activity Table section.
4.	 In the More group, select the Group Activity By check box and make a 
selection from the list.
For my example, shown in Figure 6-3, I chose Type.
FIGURE 6-3: 
Turn on the 
setting to enable 
grouping on  
the selected  
sales form.

120      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You can select Subtotal Groups if you want QBO to group specifically by the 
grouping type you select in Settings. Not selecting the option gives you more 
flexibility on the forms.
5.	 Save the settings.
You’ll need to repeat the preceding steps for each type of form (invoice, estimate, 
and sales receipt) on which you want to be able to subtotal information.
Preparing an Invoice
You enter invoices in QBO to inform customers that they owe you money for goods 
you sold them or services you performed for them. In QBO, you can prepare 
invoices and send them using email or using the U.S. Postal Service.
When you prepare an invoice, you include information about what you’re selling 
to the customer by including items on the invoice. You create items for both ser-
vices and products using the Products and Services list, as described at the end of 
Chapter 4. To enter an invoice, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪   Sales to display the Sales Transactions page.
2.	 Click the New Transaction button and, from the list that appears, click 
Invoice.
3.	 Choose a customer.
QBO displays the customer’s mailing address, payment terms, invoice date, 
due date, and Send Later option.
If a pane appears on the right side, it displays transactions you might want to 
link to the invoice you’re creating; you can see examples in the sections 
“Preparing an Estimate” and “Creating Billable Time Entries.”
4.	 Double-check the Invoice Date, Due date, and Terms, and make an 
appropriate selection in the Send Later check box.
If you want to send invoices via email, you can set up your preferences; from 
the QBO Home page, click the Gear button beside your company name and 
choose Account and Settings.
5.	 Fill in the products and services the customer is buying:
a.	 Click in the Product/Service column and select an appropriate item for 
the invoice you are creating.

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      121
You can type characters in the Product/Service column and QBO will help 
you find the item.
b.	 Optionally, edit the Description column for the selected item.
c.	 Use the Qty, Rate, and Amount columns to supply the quantity of the 
selected item you are selling, the rate you’re charging for each item, 
and the amount the customer should pay. When you supply any two 
of the Qty, Rate, and Amount values, QBO calculates the third value.
d.	 If appropriate, check the Tax box.
e.	 Repeat Steps a to d to add more items to the invoice.
6.	 To add a subtotal in the proper place on the invoice:
a.	 Click the last line on the invoice that should be subtotaled; in Figure 6-4, 
I clicked the third line of the invoice.
b.	 Click the Add Subtotal button, which appears below the lines on 
the invoice.
QBO adds a line that subtotals the ones above it. You can continue adding 
lines to the invoice, and you can add more subtotals.
7.	 You can scroll down in the Invoice window, as shown in Figure 6-5, and 
select a sales tax rate and, if appropriate, a discount amount or percent.
You see the Sales Tax Rate option on invoices only if you have turned on the 
Sales Tax feature by choosing Sales Tax ➪   Set Up Sales Tax Rates.

You can also apply a discount to the invoice if you have turned on the company 
preference to display the Discount box; type a message to the customer; type 
information in the Statement Memo box, which QBO transfers directly to any 
statement you create in the future; and attach an electronic document to the 
invoice.
You can control whether the discount is a pre-tax or after-tax discount by 
clicking the switch that appears to the left of the Discount and Sales Tax Rate 
boxes. Clicking the switch swaps the position of the two boxes; when the 
Discount box appears on top, the discount is pre-tax.
If, in the Account and Settings dialog box, you turn on the preference to display 
the Deposit box at the bottom of the invoice, you can use it to reduce the 
amount of the invoice by a deposit amount paid by the customer.
8.	 To attach an electronic document to the invoice, click in the Attachments 
box and navigate to the document or drag and drop the electronic copy 
into the Attachments box.
9.	 At the bottom of the window, you can
•	 Cancel the invoice or clear the window and start again.
•	 Click Print or Preview to print or preview the invoice.
•	 Click Make Recurring to set up the invoice as a recurring invoice you 
intend to send on a schedule you specify.
•	 Click Customize to customize the invoice form as described in 
Chapter 3.

•	 Click Save to assign an invoice number and save the invoice in QBO.
•	 Click Save and Send to assign an invoice number, save the invoice, 
and email a copy to the customer.
A window appears, in which you can write an email message and look at a 
preview of the invoice. After you send your invoice, the email time and 
date-stamp information appears in the header.
You can click the arrow beside Save and Send and then choose Save and New 
to save the invoice and start a new one, or choose Save and Close to save the 
invoice and close the Invoice window. The option you choose will appear the 
next time you display the Invoice window. In fact, in any transaction window, 
the choice you make appears the next time you open the window.
Recording a Customer Payment
When you receive a payment from a customer, you record it in QBO. You can dis-
play the Receive Payment window in the following ways:
»
» You can click the Create menu and select Receive Payment.
»
» You can click the New Transaction button on the Sales Transactions page and 
select Payment.
»
» In the Sales Transactions list, you can find the invoice for which you want to 
record a payment and click Receive Payment in the Action column.
If you use either of the first two methods, QBO displays an empty Receive Payment 
window. You then select a customer, and QBO displays all the customer’s open 
invoices in the Outstanding Transactions section, at the bottom of the window 
(see Figure 6-6).
If you choose the third method in the previous list, QBO displays the Receive Pay-
ment window, prefilled with the information for the invoice you selected in the 
Sales Transactions list.
At the top of the screen, select a Payment Method and select the account in which 
you want QBO to place the customer’s payment. In the Outstanding Transactions 
section, place a check beside each invoice being paid by the customer’s payment.
So, what happens differently if you use the third method and opt to find the 
invoice on the Sales Transaction list, shown in Figure 6-7, and click the Receive 
Payment button in the Action column? If you work from the list, QBO automati-
cally fills in the customer name; displays and selects, in the Outstanding 

124      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Transactions section, the invoice you chose in the Sales Transaction list; and fills 
in a proposed payment amount. The window you see when you click the Receive 
­Payment button looks just like the window shown in Figure 6-6.

tional customer payments, or click the arrow beside Save and New and choose

USING THE UNDEPOSITED FUNDS 
ACCOUNT
If you receive more than one customer payment on any given day, you’ll find the 
Undeposited Funds account a convenient way to handle the money that comes into 
your business. If you take several checks to your bank on a given day and deposit all of 
them as a single deposit, most banks typically don’t record the individual checks as 
­individual deposits. Instead, the bank records the sum of the checks as your deposit — 
pretty much the same way you sum the checks on the deposit ticket you give to the 
bank teller.
“And why is this important?” you ask. This fact is important because, when you receive 
your statement from your bank, you need to reconcile the bank’s deposits and with-
drawals with your own version of deposits and withdrawals. If you track each customer 
payment you receive as a deposit in the bank, then your deposits won’t match the 
bank’s deposits. And, if you don’t use the Undeposited Funds account — and instead 
record customer payments directly into your QBO Bank account — your deposits defi-
nitely won’t match the bank’s version of your deposits.
Herald the arrival of the Undeposited Funds account in QBO, which acts as a holding 
tank for customer payments before you’ve prepared a bank deposit slip. If you place 
customer payments in the Undeposited Funds account, you can then use the Bank 
Deposit feature in QBO to sum up the payments you receive and intend to deposit at 
your bank simultaneously — and, if you don’t go to your bank daily to make deposits, 
there’s no problem. QBO records, as the deposit amount in your QBO Bank account, 
the amount calculated in the Bank Deposit window, which will match the amount you 
actually deposit at your bank. Then, your bank reconciliation process becomes quick 
and easy — well, okay, maybe not quick and easy, but certainly quicker and easier  
than if you were trying to figure out which customer payments made up various bank 
deposits.
See Chapter 8 for details on preparing a bank deposit and reconciling a bank statement.

126      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Working with Estimates
You can use estimates to prepare a document that estimates what you need to 
charge a client to complete a project; estimates don’t update your QBO accounts 
but do enable you to keep track of proposals you make to customers. If a customer 
decides to buy, based on your estimate, you can copy the estimate to a purchase 
order to easily order the items needed to complete the job. You also can copy the 
estimate to an invoice.
You can copy only those estimates with a status of Pending. Copying an estimate 
to an invoice automatically changes the estimate’s status from Pending to Closed. 
Therefore, if you want to copy an estimate to both a purchase order and an invoice, 
make sure you copy the estimate to the purchase order first.
NON-POSTING TRANSACTIONS
Estimates and purchase orders are two examples of non-posting transactions. Non-
posting transactions don’t affect your accounts in any way, but they are helpful because 
they enable you to enter potential transaction information you don’t want to forget. In 
addition to the estimate and the purchase order, QBO Essentials and Plus also enable 
you to record two other non-posting transactions: the Delayed Charge and the Delayed 
Credit.
You can use a Delayed Charge transaction pretty much the same way you use an esti-
mate. The Delayed Charge transaction records potential future revenue, and you can 
convert a Delayed Charge to an invoice in the same way you convert an estimate to an 
invoice. For details, see the section “Converting an estimate to an invoice.”
The Delayed Credit transaction enables you to record a potential future credit memo. 
When you prepare an invoice for a customer for whom you’ve entered a Delayed Credit 
transaction, QBO displays the Delayed Credit in the pane on the right side of the Invoice 
window, and you can add the credit to the invoice. A Delayed Credit transaction differs 
from a Credit Memo transaction because a Credit Memo transaction updates your 
accounts when you enter it, but a Delayed Credit transaction updates your accounts 
only when you include it on an invoice.
You fill out both forms the same way you create an invoice; for details, refer to the 
section “Preparing an Invoice.”

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      127
Preparing an estimate
You prepare an estimate in much the same way you prepare an invoice. To display 
the Estimate window, click the Create menu and choose Estimate. Or, if you prefer 
to work from the Sales Transactions page, choose Transactions ➪   Sales, click the 
New Transaction button, and, from the menu that appears, click Estimate. QBO 
displays the Estimate window (see Figure 6-8).
Choose a customer, and QBO displays the customer’s address information and 
the estimate date. You supply the estimate’s expiration date and optionally 
select the Send Later option. Figure 6-8 also shows a Crew # field that appears 
because the estimate was customized. You can read more about customizing forms 
in Chapter 3.
QBO sets an estimate’s status as Pending as long as the estimate is open and has 
not expired or been converted to an invoice. The status appears just above the 
customer’s billing address.
To fill in the products and services the customer is considering for purchase, click 
in the Product/Service column and select an item. You can type characters in the 
Product/Service column and QBO will help you find the item. QBO fills in any 
default information stored about the item. You can change the description, quan-
tity, rate, amount, and taxable status of the item. Repeat this process to add more 
items to the estimate.
If you scroll down in the Estimate window, you see the additional fields shown in 
Figure 6-9.
FIGURE 6-8: 
Creating an 
estimate.

128      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You can select a sales tax rate, apply a discount percentage or dollar amount to the 
estimate if you have the company preference turned on to display the Discount 
box, type a message to the customer, type information in the Memo box, and 
attach an electronic document to the estimate.
To attach an electronic document to the estimate, click in the Attachments box 
and navigate to the document or drag and drop the electronic copy into the Attach-
ments box.
You control whether the discount is a pre-tax or post-tax discount by clicking the 
switch that appears to the left of the Discount and Sales Tax Rate boxes. Clicking 
the switch swaps the position of the two boxes; when the Discount box appears on 
top, the discount is pre-tax.
At the bottom of the window, you can
»
» Cancel the estimate or clear the window and start again.

» Click Save and Send to assign a number to the estimate, save it, and email a 
copy to the customer. A window appears, in which you can write an email 
message and look at a preview of the estimate. After you send your invoice, 
the email time and date-stamp information appears in the header.
You can click the arrow beside Save and Send and then choose Save and New to 
save the estimate and start a new one, or choose Save and Close to save the esti-
mate and close the Estimate window.
Copying an estimate to a purchase order
So, you did a good job on your estimate, and now your customer wants to purchase 
based on the estimate you provided. In this case, you often want to use the esti-
mate information to prepare a purchase order for a vendor. QBO Plus enables you 
to copy an estimate with a status of Pending to a purchase order if you turn on the 
feature.
An estimate’s status determines whether it can be copied. If the estimate is open 
and has not expired or been converted to an invoice, the estimate’s status is Pend-
ing. Converting an estimate to an invoice automatically changes the estimate’s 
status to Closed. So, copy an estimate to a purchase order before you convert the 
estimate to an invoice.
Be aware that QBO includes on purchase orders only those items for which you 
have selected the “I Purchase This Product/Service From a Vendor” option. If you 
include items on the estimate for which you have not selected this option, those 
items won’t copy to the purchase order. To solve this problem, you can edit your 
items and make sure you select the option.
To give yourself the option of copying an estimate to a purchase order, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click Gear ➪   Account and Settings.
QBO displays the Account and Settings dialog box.
2.	 Click Expenses on the right side of the dialog box.
3.	 Click in the Purchase Orders section.
QBO enables editing for the options in that section.
4.	 Select the Copy Estimates to Purchase Orders option (see Figure 6-10).
5.	 Click Save.
6.	 Click Done.

130      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
At this point, you’ll find you can copy any estimate with a Pending status to a 
purchase order. Follow these steps:
1.	 Create and save a new estimate using the steps in the preceding section, 
“Preparing an estimate,” or open an existing pending estimate.
2.	 At the top of the Estimate window, click the down arrow beside the Copy 
to Invoice button and choose Copy to Purchase Order (see Figure 6-11).

option to copy 
estimates to

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      131
You might see the message that explains that some items on the estimate 
might not carry over to the purchase order. The message appears because 
some items on the estimate are set up without the “I Purchase This Product/
Service From a Vendor” option selected.
3.	 If the message appears, click OK to dismiss it.
QBO creates a purchase order using the information from your estimate and 
displays it in the Purchase Order window (see Figure 6-12).
4.	 Edit the purchase order as necessary, selecting a vendor and adding any 
more items to the purchase order.
5.	 Save the purchase order.
Converting an estimate to an invoice
When you’re ready to prepare an invoice for a customer based on an estimate you 
previously created, save yourself some time and effort and convert the estimate’s 
information to an invoice. You can, if necessary, make adjustments to such an 
invoice by adding or removing lines. You can convert an estimate’s information to 
an invoice using any of several approaches.
Converting an estimate to an invoice in QBO automatically changes the estimate’s 
status from Pending to Closed.
First, you can open the Invoice window and select the customer with the open 
estimate. QBO displays available documents you can link to the invoice, including 
FIGURE 6-12: 
A purchase order 
QBO created 
from an estimate.

132      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
any estimates (see Figure 6-13). Click the Add button at the bottom of an estimate, 
and QBO automatically adds the estimate information to the Invoice window.
Second, you can filter the Sales Transactions page to display only estimates, and 
click the Start Invoice link in the Action column beside the estimate you want to 
convert (see Figure  6-14). QBO displays an invoice that contains all the lines 
available on the estimate.
Third, from the Sales Transactions page, you can click the estimate to open it (and 
review its content, if you want). In the Estimate window of any estimate with a 
status of Pending, you’ll find a Copy to Invoice button, as shown in Figure 6-15; 
click that button, and QBO displays the Invoice window containing all the infor-
mation from the estimate.
Regardless of the method you use, after you have converted an estimate on an 
invoice, QBO changes the estimate’s status from Pending to Closed. Be aware that 
QBO closes the estimate even if you don’t invoice the customer for all lines on the 
estimate. Also be aware that you can change an estimate’s status from Closed to 
Pending, but, if you do, you are making all lines on the estimate available for 
invoicing — and you could then accidentally invoice your customer twice for the 
same goods. So, if your customer buys only some lines on the estimate but intends 
to buy other lines at a later point in time, your best bet to ensure that you have the 
right information available for a future invoice is to let QBO close the original esti-
mate and create another estimate for only the lines the customer didn’t yet buy.

Copying an existing estimate
Suppose that you have an existing estimate — even one you’ve already converted 
to an invoice — and you want to create a new estimate using most of the informa-
tion on the existing invoice. You can make a copy of the existing estimate, edit the 
copy as needed, and then save the new estimate. Making a copy saves you time 
because you don’t need to reenter a lot of information.
On the Sales Transactions list, click the estimate you want to copy to open it in the 
Estimate window. Notice that, in Figure 6-16, I’ve displayed an estimate with a 
status of Closed.
At the bottom of the window, click the More button and, from the menu that 
appears, click Copy.
QBO opens a new estimate that already contains the information of the estimate 
you copied. Just above the Billing Address information, you see a message that 
explains that the estimate you’re viewing is a copy and you should make any 
changes you need (see Figure 6-17). For example, change the customer, and QBO 
updates the Billing Address information. Feel free to add or delete lines as needed. 
When you finish making changes, click Save or Save and Send, as appropriate.
FIGURE 6-16:

it’s closed.

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      135
Working with Sales Receipts
You use invoices when you need to track money that a customer owes you but 
hasn’t yet paid. But suppose that your customer pays you at the time you sell 
goods or render services. In these situations, you don’t need to enter an invoice; 
instead, you can enter a sales receipt. And, if you’re shipping the items to the 
customer, you can print a packing list, which shows the quantities of the items the 
customer purchased without price information.
Entering a sales receipt
To enter a sales receipt, click Create ➪   Sales Receipt or, from the Sales Transac-
tions page, click New Transaction ➪   Sales Receipt to display the window shown in 
Figure 6-18.
The sales receipt form closely resembles other sales forms you’ve seen in this 
chapter: You select a customer — QBO fills in customer billing address informa-
tion and assigns today’s date to the transaction — enter a payment method and 
optional reference number, and select the account into which QBO should place 
the funds. See the sidebar in this chapter, “Using the Undeposited Funds account,” 
for information on selecting an account from the Deposit To list.
FIGURE 6-17: 
Edit the 
duplicated 
estimate and 
save it.

136      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You fill out the rest of the Sales Receipt transaction the same way you fill out an 
invoice transaction; if you scroll down in the window, you’ll find the same fields 
at the bottom of the Sales Receipt window as the ones that appear at the bottom 
of the Invoice window.
Printing sales receipts and packing slips
You can print both the sales receipt and, if appropriate, a packing list. To print 
either document, click the Print or Preview button at the bottom of the Sales 
Receipt window. Regardless of the document you opt to print, QBO saves the sales 
receipt and then displays a preview window. If you opt to print the sales receipt, 
QBO displays a preview window you can use to scroll through the appearance of 
the sales receipt. But, a better preview appears when you click the Print button 
(see Figure 6-19).
Notice that the sales receipt displays all pertinent information, including the 
prices of items.
If you opt to print the packing slip, QBO again saves the sales receipt if you haven’t 
already saved it. Then, QBO again displays a preview window you can use to scroll 
through the appearance of the packing slip, but, a better preview appears when 
you click the Print button (see Figure 6-20).
Notice that the packing slip identifies only what the customer bought and not how 
much the customer paid.
FIGURE 6-18:

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      137
Giving Money Back to a Customer
It happens. It’s a bummer, but, it happens. Occasionally, you need to return money 
you have received from a customer.
If a customer returns merchandise to you, issue a credit memo. Alternatively, if 
you need to refund money to a customer  — perhaps because goods arrived 
­damaged and the customer doesn’t want to reorder them — issue a refund receipt.

138      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Recording a credit memo
If a customer returns goods previously purchased or if you and your customer 
agree that the customer’s outstanding or future balance should be reduced, record 
a credit memo in QBO.
By default, QBO automatically applies credit memos to outstanding or future 
invoices. If you want to change that behavior, open the Account and Settings dia-
log box (choose Gear menu ➪   Account and Settings) and click Advanced on the left. 
Scroll down to the Automation section on the right, and click the Automatically 
Apply Credits option.
You enter a Credit Memo transaction pretty much the same way you enter an 
invoice; to display the Credit Memo window shown in Figure 6-21, you can click 
the Create menu button and choose Credit Memo or, from the Sales Transactions 
page, you can click the New Transaction button and choose Credit Memo.
Select the customer, fill in the products or services for which you are issuing a 
credit memo, fill in the bottom of the Credit Memo window with appropriate infor-
mation, and save the transaction. This transaction window is very similar to the 
Invoice transaction window: Refer to the section “Preparing an Invoice” for details.
You can enter a credit memo for a customer even if that customer currently has no 
outstanding invoices; when you enter the customer’s next invoice, QBO will apply 
the credit memo to the invoice.
When you enter a credit memo for a customer who has outstanding invoices, QBO 
applies the credit memo to an outstanding invoice; if you view the Sales 
FIGURE 6-21: 
Entering a credit 
memo.

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      139
Transactions list for that particular invoice, you’ll notice that its Status is Partial, 
meaning that the invoice is partially paid (see Figure 6-22).
If you click the invoice to view it, you’ll see the credit amount on the Amount 
Received line at the bottom of the invoice (see Figure 6-23).

140      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Issuing a refund to a customer
Use QBO’s Refund Receipt transaction if you need to refund money to a customer 
instead of reducing an outstanding or future balance. In this example, I’m going 
to issue a refund check to a customer, which will deduct the amount of the refund 
from a Bank account and reduce an Income account. The customer didn’t return 
any items.
To account for refunds you issue when a customer doesn’t return an item, first set 
up an account called something like Returns and Allowances and assign this 
account to the Category Type of Income and a Detail Type of Discounts/Refunds 
Given. Then set up a service on the Products and Services list and call it something 
like Customer Refunds or even Returns & Allowances. Do not select Is Taxable for 
the service. Assign the service to the Returns and Allowances account and don’t 
assign a default Price/Rate.
Filling in the Refund Receipt window is very similar to filling in the Invoice win-
dow, so, if you need more details than I supply here, see the section “Preparing an 
Invoice.” To display the Refund Receipt window shown in Figure 6-24, click the 
Create button — the plus (+) sign — and choose Refund Receipt in the Customers 
column. Select a customer, and QBO fills in related customer information.
Select a payment method and an account; if you select a Bank account like I did, 
QBO lists the Bank account’s current balance and the next check number associ-
ated with the account. If you want, click the Print Later check box.
In my example, the customer isn’t returning any items, so I selected the Refunds &  
Allowances service. If your customer is returning items, select the item in the 
FIGURE 6-24: 
Issuing a  
refund check.

CHAPTER 6  Managing the Inflow of Money      141
Product/Service column that the customer is returning in exchange for the refund 
and don’t select the Refunds and Allowances service shown in Figure 6-24.
You can scroll down to the bottom of the Refund Receipt transaction window and 
fill in all the same information available at the bottom of an invoice.
Creating Billable Time Entries
Your employees might work directly for you on activities needed to run your com-
pany (such as preparing customer invoices or entering accounting information 
into QBO), and they might also perform work directly related to your customers. 
In the latter case, you might want to track the time employees spend on client-
related projects and then bill your customers for your employees’ time.
To track time, you use either the Time Activity window or the Weekly Timesheet 
window; regardless of the window you use, QBO tracks the time entered and, 
when you prepare an invoice for a client for whom time was recorded, QBO 
prompts you to add the time to the invoice.
In this section, you’ll learn to enter time using both the Time Activity window and 
the Weekly Timesheet window, and you’ll see how QBO prompts you to include 
the billable time on a customer’s invoice. Note that a time entry that you can bill 
back to a customer is called, cleverly, billable time.
Entering a single time activity
Open the Time Activity window using the Create plus (+) sign menu at the top of 
QBO. Follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create plus (+) sign button to open the Create menu.
2.	 In the Employees column, click Single Time Activity.
QBO displays the Time Activity window shown in Figure 6-25.
3.	 From the Name list, select the employee or vendor who performed the work.
4.	 Enter the date the work was performed.
5.	 From the Customer list, select the customer for whom the work was 
performed.
6.	 From the Service list, select the service that was performed.
7.	 Place a check in the Billable box, which changes to the Bill At box, and 
supply an hourly rate.

142      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
8.	If the work performed is subject to tax, place a check in the Taxable box.
9.	In the Time box, enter the amount of time spent on this activity.
You can enter start and end times, including any break time, by checking the 
Enter Start and End Times box; QBO calculates the time spent and displays it 
below the Description box.
10.	Enter a description of the work that will appear, by default, on an invoice.
You can change the description after adding the time entry to the invoice.
11.	Click Save to save the entry or Save and New to enter another time 
activity.
If you click the arrow beside Save and New, you can choose Save and Close.
Using a timesheet to record time
If you prefer to enter time in a grid format that shows the days and dates for a 
week, then the Weekly Timesheet, shown in Figure 6-26, is for you. To enter time 
using this window, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create button — the plus (+) sign — to open the Create menu.
2.	 In the Employees column, click Weekly Timesheet.
3.	 Select the name of the person whose time you’re recording.
4.	 Select the week for which you want to record time.
5.	 In the Details section, select a customer name, a service item, and, if 
appropriate, supply a description.

6.	 To bill the time back to a customer, select the Billable check box and 
provide a rate at which to charge the time.
7.	 Fill in the time worked on the appropriate day.
8.	 Click Save, Save and New, or click the arrow beside Save and New and 
select Save and Close.
Adding a billable expense to an invoice
You can add billable time entries to an invoice in a couple of ways. For example, if 
you view any customer’s page, QBO displays a list of outstanding transactions, as 
shown in Figure 6-27. In the Action column of any billable time entry, QBO dis-
plays a Start Invoice button that you can click to start an invoice to the customer 
and include the billable expense on the invoice. To view a customer’s page, click 
Customer in the Navigation bar and then click a customer’s name.
But you don’t need to go looking for billable time entries. QBO prompts you to add 
them to any invoice you create for a customer for whom billable time entries exist. 
Start an invoice (from the Create menu — the plus sign — click Invoice) and select 
a customer. If the customer has billable time entries, they appear in the pane on 
the right side of the screen (see Figure 6-28).
Click the Add button in each billable time entry that you want to add to the invoice. 
Or, to add all the entries, click the Add All button at the top of the pane on the right. 
QBO enters each billable time entry’s information on a line on the invoice, filling in 
the service, description, quantity, rate, and total amount. You can edit any informa-
tion on the line as needed. Fill in the rest of the invoice as described in the section 
“Preparing an Invoice,” adding other lines that might not pertain to time entries.
FIGURE 6-26: 
The Weekly 
Timesheet.

144      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Don’t forget that you can add a subtotal for time entries, if you choose. See  
the first section in this chapter, “Customizing Forms to Handle Subtotals,” for 
details.

Working in Registers
C
hapters 5 and 6 show you how to enter transactions such as checks, sales 
receipts, invoices, and customer payments using various QBO transaction 
windows. You also see ways to find and filter for certain transactions.
But transaction windows and lists aren’t the only way to work with transactions 
in QBO.  You can use registers. Some people are more comfortable entering 
­transactions, particularly checks, into a register.
And many people find it easy to use a register to quickly view the transactions that 
affect a particular account and find particular transactions, as described at the end 
of this chapter.
Understanding Registers
You use registers to see every transaction that affects a particular account. 
­Registers in QBO contain much of the same information you find in the paper 
registers that banks give you along with handwritten checks. To view the register 
for a particular account, click Gear ➪   Chart of Accounts. Then use the View 
­Register link in the Action column to display the register of a particular account 
(see Figure 7-1).
Chapter 7

146      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When you switch to a register, QBO assumes you want to enter a new transaction 
and displays a new transaction window at the bottom of the register. In Figure 7-2, 
I’ve closed that new transaction window so that you can see a Bank account  
register in QBO as it appears by default.
The register page displays the name of the account — in this case, Checking — 
and its ending balance at the top of the register.
FIGURE 7-1: 
Use the Chart of 
Accounts page to 
open a particular 
account’s 
register.
FIGURE 7-2: 
A typical Bank 
account register.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      147
Because the bank account register shown in Figure 7-2 is electronically connected 
to its counterpart at a banking institution, you also see the balance in the account 
as that financial institution reports it — and in this case, the balance at the bank 
is negative.
One rule you need to remember about registers: They are not available for all 
accounts. You’ll find that registers are available for all balance sheet accounts 
except Retained Earnings. Balance sheet accounts fall into the following QBO 
account category types:
»
» Bank
»
» Accounts Receivable
»
» Other Current Assets
»
» Fixed Assets
»
» Other Assets
»
» Accounts Payable
»
» Credit Card
»
» Other Current Liabilities
»
» Long Term Liabilities
»
» Equity
You see these account category types when you add a new account to the Chart of 
Accounts or when you view the Chart of Accounts page in QBO.
If you use account numbers, then typically all asset accounts begin with 10000, all 
liability accounts begin with 20000, and all equity accounts begin with 30000. 
This numbering scheme is not carved in stone, but most accountants recommend 
that you follow these guidelines when you assign numbers to the accounts in your 
Chart of Accounts.
Within the register, you see column headings that identify the information 
­contained in each column for every transaction and, at the right edge of a register 
page, you see a running balance for the account. All the transactions in a Bank 
account register affect a Bank account  — along with some other account, as 
­dictated by the rules of accounting (double-entry bookkeeping, a founding principle 
of accounting, means that every transaction affects at least two accounts). The 
amount shown in the Balance column is a running balance for the account as long 
as the register is sorted by date.

148      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
At the end of this chapter, in the section “Other Things You Can Do in a Register,” 
you learn how to sort a register so that it appears in some order other than the 
default transaction date order. Be aware that if you sort by any column other than 
the Date column, the Balance column won’t display any information because the 
information wouldn’t make any sense.
By default, the latest transactions appear at the top of the register, but, if you 
prefer, you can change the appearance of the register to use Paper Ledger Mode, 
as shown in Figure 7-3. In Paper Ledger Mode, QBO lists transactions from earli-
est to latest — similar to the way transactions appear when you use a paper bank 
account register. In a paper register, you enter your transactions as they occur, so 
the earliest transactions appear at the top of the register and the latest transac-
tions appear at the bottom of the register.
When you switch to Paper Ledger Mode, QBO assumes you want to enter a  
new transaction, as described later in this chapter in the section “Entering a 
transaction,” and automatically displays a new transaction window at the bottom 
of the register page.
To switch to Paper Ledger Mode, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Table Settings gear above the Balance column.
Refer to Figure 7-3.
FIGURE 7-3: 
A bank account 
register in Paper 
Ledger Mode.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      149
2.	 From the drop-down menu that appears, click Paper Ledger Mode to 
select it.
QBO reorders the transactions in the register so that they appear in date order 
from oldest to newest.
In addition, QBO displays a new transaction window at the bottom of the 
register.
To switch back to the register’s regular appearance, repeat the steps above; when 
you remove the check beside Paper Ledger Mode, QBO reorders the transactions in 
the register in date order with the latest transaction at the top of the register page.
QBO remembers the setting you select for the register’s appearance; if you choose 
to display the register in Paper Ledger Mode, the next time you display any regis-
ter, QBO displays it in Paper Ledger Mode.
In addition to using Paper Ledger Mode, you can control the appearance of a reg-
ister in a few other ways; you can
»
» Change the size of columns
»
» Control the number of rows on a page in your QBO company
»
» Reduce each register entry to a single line
QBO remembers adjustments you make in registers, even after you navigate away 
from the register. Further, if you open a different register, QBO applies your adjust-
ments to that register.
To change the size of any column, slide the mouse pointer into the column head-
ing area on the right boundary of the column. In Figure 7-4, I’m resizing the Ref 
No. Type column. When the mouse pointer changes to a pair of left- and right-
pointing arrows connected to a pair of vertical bars, drag the pointer. Dragging to 
the left makes the column narrower, and dragging to the right to makes the col-
umn wider. As you drag, a solid vertical line helps you determine the size of the 
column. Release the mouse button when the column reaches the size you want.
If resizing columns doesn’t satisfy your viewing needs, you can save space 
­horizontally by removing columns from the register. To do so, you use the options 
on the Table Settings gear. Click the Gear button above the Balance column (see 
Figure 7-5). In the Columns section, remove the checks beside any options you 
don’t need to view; by default, QBO displays the Memo, Reconcile and Banking 
Status, and Running Balance columns. Remove the checks beside these options 
and QBO removes their columns from the register.

150      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
To save space vertically, place a check mark in the Show in One Line box and 
change the number of rows that appear on a page. You can display 50 rows, 150 
rows, or 300 rows. Figure 7-6 shows a register displaying a single line for each 
transaction.
By default, if you opt to show transactions on a single line in the register, QBO 
hides the Memo and the Reconcile and Banking Status columns.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      151
Entering and Editing Transactions
Many people are comfortable using a Bank account register to enter a check or a 
bill payment; some people are also comfortable entering a bill in the Accounts 
Payable register or an invoice in the Accounts Receivable register. But, even if 
you’re not comfortable entering transactions in a register, many people find 
viewing a transaction in a register very easy and helpful.
You open a register from the Chart of Accounts page. To open the Chart of Accounts 
page, click the Gear button beside your company’s name and, from the menu that 
appears, click Chart of Accounts in the Settings column. From the Chart of 
Accounts page (shown earlier in Figure 7-1), you click the View Register link in the 
Action column beside any account that displays the link to display that account’s 
register; all accounts displaying the link are balance sheet accounts.
Entering a transaction
Because checks are the transaction most often entered using a register, I’m focus-
ing the discussion in this section on Bank account registers. After you click the 
View Register link of a Bank or Credit Card account, you can enter a transaction 
into the register.
If you need to add attachments to transactions you enter, display the Attachment 
column in the register; click Table Gear Settings ➪   Attachments. You can see  
the open Table Gear Settings menu in Figure  7-5. Displaying the Attachments 
column automatically gives you the option to add an attachment as you enter a 
transaction.
FIGURE 7-6: 
A register 
displaying one 
line for each 
transaction.

152      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
By default, when you first open a register, QBO assumes you want to add a trans-
action and opens the window you use to enter the most common transaction type 
for that register — in the case of a Bank account, QBO opens the Add Check win-
dow. But let’s suppose that you’ve already entered a transaction and now you 
want to enter another transaction. To start a new transaction and enter it, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click the down arrow beside the Add button.
The Add button, which appears just below the Date column heading, is named 
Add Check in Bank accounts and Add CC Expense in Credit Card accounts.
After you open the list box, QBO displays the list of available transaction types 
(see Figure 7-7).
For you keyboard fans, you can press Ctrl+Alt+N to open the Add list box.
QBO displays only those types of transactions available in the account register 
you opened. For example, you can record a customer payment in a Bank 
account register, but you cannot enter a customer invoice. Similarly, you can 
record a check or a bill payment in a Bank account register, but you cannot 
enter a vendor bill.
2.	 From the list that appears, select the type of transaction you want to 
enter.
QBO fills in today’s date and displays lines so that you can complete the 
transaction (see Figure 7-8).
FIGURE 7-7: 
Select the type of 
transaction you 
want to enter.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      153
3.	 If necessary, change the transaction date.
4.	 Press Tab and, if appropriate, change the check number for the 
transaction.
5.	 Press Tab and supply a Payee name.
For example, if you’re recording a payment you received from a customer, 
select the customer’s name. If you’re writing a check, select the check recipi-
ent’s name.
6.	 Press Tab and, in the Memo column, supply any memo information you 
want to record for the transaction.
7.	 Press Tab and, in the appropriate column, provide the amount of the 
transaction.
In a Bank account register, record a payment you’re making in the Payment 
amount box and an amount you’re depositing in the Deposit amount box.
8.	 Press Tab.
QBO places the mouse pointer in the Reconcile and Banking Status column. 
This column displays a character representing the status of the transaction: 
C for Cleared or R for Reconciled. When the column is blank, the transaction is 
neither cleared nor reconciled. Typically this column is updated when you 
download or reconcile transactions.
If the account is also connected electronically to your financial institution, this 
column also indicates whether a transaction was added or matched when 
transactions were downloaded via the account’s bank feed.
FIGURE 7-8: 
Entering a check 
in a Bank account 
register.

154      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Don’t be tempted to adjust the reconciliation status of a transaction from this 
screen because doing so adjusts the account’s reconciled balance but the 
adjustment doesn’t show up on reconciliation reports. You’ll have a mess on your 
hands if you modify the reconciliation status outside the reconciliation process.
9.	Press Tab.
QBO’s placement of the insertion pointer depends on the type of transaction 
you’re entering. For example, if you’re entering a Sales Receipt, a Receive 
Payment, a Bill Payment, or a Refund transaction, QBO places the insertion 
point in the area where you can save the transaction.
If, however, you’re entering a Check, a Deposit, an Expense, a Transfer, or a 
Journal Entry transaction, QBO places the insertion point in the Account 
column. Select the other account affected by the transaction (in addition to the 
account whose register you have opened). For example, if you’re entering a 
check, select an Expense account. If you enter an account and press Tab, you 
can enter a memo for the transaction.
To add an attachment to the transaction, click the Add Attachment button in the 
lower left corner of the window. QBO opens a standard “Open” dialog box, where 
you navigate to the electronic document you want to attach to the transaction. 
Once you find it, click it and click Open to attach it to the transaction.
10.	Click the Save button that appears in the transaction.
Keyboard fans, press Ctrl+Alt+S.
QBO saves the transaction and starts another of the same type. You can click 
Cancel to stop entering transactions.
Editing a transaction
You can edit the transaction in the register by clicking the transaction and then 
making changes. Or, if you prefer to use the transaction window for the type of 
transaction you selected, click the Edit button. For example, if you opt to edit an 
Expense transaction in an account register, QBO displays the transaction in the 
Expense window. If you opt to enter a Check transaction, QBO displays the trans-
action in the Check window. See Chapter 5 for examples of transaction windows.
Other Things You Can Do in a Register
Registers wouldn’t be all that useful if you could only add and edit transactions. 
You need to be able to find transactions easily. And, it’s always helpful to be able 
to print a register.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      155
Sorting transactions
After a while, the number of transactions in a register can make the Register page 
very long, especially in a Bank account register. Looking for a transaction by 
skimming through the register — or eyeballing — can be a nonproductive way of 
finding a transaction. Instead, sort to help you find a particular transaction.
You can sort by any column in the register simply by clicking that column head-
ing. In Figure 7-9, the transactions are sorted by date, in descending order from 
latest to earliest; note the downward-pointing arrow in the Date column.
To sort the transactions by date from earliest to latest, click the Date column; the 
arrow changes direction and points upward. Or suppose you want to search for 
transactions for a particular payee. You can click the Payee column heading to 
sorting transactions in alphabetical order by payee, and you can click the column 
heading a second time to sort in reverse alphabetical order.
You can sort by any column heading except the Account, Balance, Memo, and 
Attachment columns. And, if you sort by any column other than Date, the Balance 
column won’t display any information because the information wouldn’t make 
any sense.
FIGURE 7-9: 
Sorting 
­transactions by 
date, from latest 
to earliest, is the 
default order 
QBO uses  
to display 
transactions.

156      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Filtering transactions
When sorting seems like the long way to find a transaction, try working with 
­filters. Click the Filter button that appears just above the Date column, and QBO 
displays a variety of ways you can filter register transactions (see Figure 7-10).
The current filter appears just beside the Filter button. When you haven’t selected 
any filters, you see All beside the Filter button.
If you’re looking for a transaction of a certain dollar amount, enter the amount, 
making sure that you don’t forget the currency symbol. When you filter by 
amounts, use these examples as a guideline:
»
» 1234 will find all checks or reference numbers with 1234.
»
» $500 will find all transactions that equal $500.
»
» >$25 will find all transactions with amounts over $25.
To display transactions for a specific transaction date, use the All Dates box to 
select one of the predefined date ranges (such as Last Week) or use the Date From 
and To dates to view transactions only within that timeframe.
FIGURE 7-10: 
Displaying 
available filters.

CHAPTER 7  Working in Registers      157
You also can filter by a transaction’s reconciliation status, transaction type, or 
payee.
Any transactions that meet the criteria you specify in the Filter window appear in 
the register after you click Apply. In addition, the selected filter appears beside the 
Filter button (see Figure 7-11). You can click the Clear Filter/View All link to clear 
the filter and redisplay all transactions in the register.
Printing a register
When doing research, many people find it easiest to print the information that 
appears in the register. To do so, click the Print button beside the register’s  
Table Gear button (at the right edge of the register, just above the Balance ­column). 
QBO displays the Print tab, with your register formatted for printing (see 
Figure 7-12).
Select the printer you want to use and make any other necessary selections, such 
as the pages to print, the number of copies, and the layout orientation. When you 
finish selecting settings, click Print. When the report finishes printing, you can 
close the Print tab to redisplay your register in your QBO company.

Handling Bank and 
Credit Card Transactions
T
he real title of this chapter should be “Handling Bank and Credit Card 
Transactions and Other Banking Tasks,” but my editors said that title, 
although accurately descriptive, was too long.
So, in a nutshell, this chapter covers the ways you can connect Bank and Credit 
Card accounts in QBO to their counterparts at financial institutions. You also find 
out how to make bank deposits and reconcile your bank statement.
Controlling the Appearance  
of Bank Accounts
Before diving in to using Bank accounts, let’s take a look at a few things you can 
do to make your life easier while working with Bank accounts.
Bank accounts (and Credit Card accounts) appear on the QBO Home page and also 
on the Bank and Credit Cards page. You can control the order in which your 
accounts appear on these pages. For example, perhaps you’d like your accounts to 
Chapter 8

160      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
appear in alphabetical order. Or maybe you’d like them to appear in most used 
order. Whatever works for you.
On the QBO Home page, click the pencil that appears to the right of Bank Accounts 
(see Figure 8-1). The pencil changes to the Save button. Then using the icon that 
appears to the left of an account, drag up or down to move the account. Once the 
accounts appear in the order you want, click the Save button. Changes you make 
will appear on both the Home page and on the Bank and Credit Cards page.
In addition to changing the order of accounts, you can, to some extent, control the 
information that appears in the table on the Bank and Credit Cards page. For 
example, you can opt to
»
» Display check numbers
»
» Display Payee names
»
» Make the date field editable so that you can change it if necessary
»
» Display more detailed information about a transaction by displaying informa-
tion provided by the bank
»
» Copy bank detail information into the Memo field
You can display the Memo field in an individual bank register; see Chapter 7 for 
details.
FIGURE 8-1: 
Drag accounts to 
place them in the 
order you want.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      161
To display the Bank and Credit Cards page, choose Transactions ➪   Banking. To 
make changes to the page’s appearance, click the Gear button that appears just 
above the Action column (see Figure 8-2).
You also can make adjustments to the column widths in the table on the Bank and 
Credit Cards page, and QBO will remember any column width adjustments you 
make, even after you sign out of QBO and then sign back in.
Connecting QBO Accounts 
to Financial Institutions
QBO offers three ways to connect QBO Bank and Credit Card accounts to corre-
sponding accounts at financial institutions:
»
» Connect directly if your bank supports a direct connection.
»
» Use QuickBooks Web Connect.
»
» Import transactions stored in an Excel file.
FIGURE 8-2: 
Use the table 
Gear button  
to make changes 
to the Bank and 
Credit Card  
page table.

162      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You have a fourth option: You don’t have to connect at all. If you choose this 
fourth option, skip to the end of this chapter, where I discuss making bank depos-
its and reconciling bank statements. If you aren’t sure whether to connect, read 
through this section until you make up your mind.
Connecting . . . or not connecting
I don’t think Shakespeare would mind if I paraphrased Hamlet: “To connect or not 
to connect, that is the question.”
In QBO, you might be able to directly connect QBO Bank and Credit Card accounts 
to their counterparts at financial institutions. I say “might” because not all finan-
cial institutions support directly connecting to QBO. If you bank at an institution 
that doesn’t support a direct connection, you can use the QuickBooks Web Connect 
method to export transactions from the financial institution’s website into QBO.
Before I dive into connecting, it’s important to understand that you don’t have to 
connect. You can work along quite happily in QBO without ever connecting an 
account at a financial institution to one in QBO. You simply enter transactions that 
affect the appropriate account and, monthly, you reconcile the accounts.
So, why connect? Most people connect to accounts at financial institutions so that 
they can electronically verify (by matching) the transactions recorded in QBO with 
the ones recorded at the financial institution. Connecting is, therefore, primarily 
a matter of convenience.
CONNECTING AS A FORM OF DATA 
ENTRY . . . NOT!
Don’t be tempted to use connecting as a method for entering information into 
QBO. You might think you’ll save time because you won’t have to fill out transaction 
­windows in QBO, but, in reality, you won’t save time. As you see later in this chapter, you 
need to review every downloaded transaction and confirm that it is properly assigned in 
QBO. And, even if you review transactions daily, you won’t have an up-to-date version of 
your accounting information, because you will know about transactions that have not 
yet cleared your financial institution. That means that the account balances in QBO 
won’t really be up-to-date unless you enter transactions in QBO and use connecting as a 
method of confirming that your QBO balances match financial institution balances. 
Long story short: It’s safer to enter transactions and use connected account information 
to confirm QBO balances.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      163
Connecting Bank or Credit Card accounts
When you add a new Bank or Credit Card account, you can opt to connect it to a 
financial institution — or you can choose not to connect to a financial institution, 
as you read in the preceding section. The method you choose to add a new account 
depends on whether you want to connect it to a financial institution.
Just a reminder: See Chapters 5 and 6 for details on entering transactions that 
affect a Bank account. You typically use an Expense transaction to record credit 
card purchases and sales receipts to record refunds to a credit card.
Adding but not connecting
In Chapter 3, I show you how to create a new Bank account in QBO. The technique 
I use in Chapter 3 assumes that you do not want to connect the QBO Bank account 
to its corresponding account at a financial institution. If you want to set up and 
not connect a Credit Card account, you use the same technique. For example, fol-
low these steps to set up a Credit Card account that you don’t intend to connect to 
a financial institution:
1.	 Click the Gear button beside your company’s name and, from the left side 
of the menu that appears, choose Chart of Accounts.
QBO displays the Chart of Accounts page.
2.	 Click the New button on the Chart of Accounts page to open the Account 
dialog box (see Figure 8-3).
FIGURE 8-3: 
The dialog box 
you use to create 
an account.

164      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
3.	 Open the Category Type list and choose Credit Card.
4.	 If you’re using account numbers, supply a number for the new account.
5.	 Optionally, you can enter your account’s balance as it appears on the last 
statement.
If you enter a balance, QuickBooks updates both the account balance and the 
Opening Balance Equity account, and your accountant probably won’t be 
happy with you. I suggest that you not enter a balance.
6.	 Click Save and Close.
QBO redisplays the Chart of Accounts page and your new account appears in 
the list.
You’ll need to enter expense transactions that have occurred since you received 
the last statement for this credit card account.
Adding and directly connecting
If, on the other hand, you want to create an account that is connected to a ­financial 
institution, you can do so if your financial institution offers the option to connect 
directly to QBO accounts. Gather up the user ID and password you use to log in to 
the financial institution online and follow these steps:
1.	 In the Navigation bar, choose Transactions ➪   Banking.
QBO displays the Bank and Credit Cards page.
2.	 In the upper right corner, click Add Account (see Figure 8-4).
QBO starts a wizard that helps you connect to a financial institution.
3.	 On the first wizard page, shown in Figure 8-5, you either provide your 
financial institution’s website address, or you click your financial 
institution’s name if it appears on the page.
To expand the search for banks, click the Search Global Banks option at the 
right edge of the website address box.
The screen that appears next depends on whether you typed a web address or 
clicked one of the popular banks onscreen. I clicked Chase.

Downloading activity
Once you’ve connected a Bank or Credit Card account to QBO, you download 
­activity from the bank so that you can compare transactions you’ve entered in 
QBO with those the bank has cleared. The method you use to download activity 
depends on the method you use to connect to your financial institution.
Downloading information for a directly 
connected account
This is kind of a silly heading for the book, but I need a way to get your atten-
tion.  You see, if you connect your account directly to a financial institution as 
DIRECTLY CONNECTING AFTER THE FACT
Suppose that you originally decided that you didn’t want to connect a Bank or Credit 
Card account to a financial institution, but now you’ve decided that you do want to con-
nect, and your bank supports direct connection. You’re not out of luck.
If you follow the steps outlined for setting up an account that is connected to a financial 
institution, you’ll end up with two accounts on your QBO Chart of Accounts for the same 
account. And that’s okay because you can then merge the accounts so that the con-
nected account ends up containing all the transactions from the unconnected account.
But I think you’ll find it easier to connect after the fact by following these steps, which 
don’t involve merging accounts; instead, you get the opportunity to identify accounts at 
your bank that should correspond to accounts in QBO:
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪   Banking.
2.	 Click the Add Account button.
QBO displays the page shown previously in Figure 8-5, where you select the bank 
with which you want to connect.
3.	 Select your bank, supply the user ID and password you use to sign in to your 
bank’s website, and click Log In.
A page appears, listing the accounts you can connect.
4.	 Select the accounts you want to connect to QBO and choose Connect.
You’ll then be given the option to select accounts in QBO to tie to the selected online 
accounts.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      167
described in the preceding section, transactions download automatically 
whenever
»
» You sign in to QBO,
»
» You manually update connected accounts to check for new transactions,
»
» The bank automatically downloads transactions, which can happen periodi-
cally while you’re working in QBO,
»
» You upload transactions to QBO that you obtained via QuickBooks Web 
Connect (see the next section for details on QuickBooks Web Connect), and
»
» You create or change an auto-add rule (you can read more about auto-add 
rules later in this chapter, in the section “Establishing rules to accept 
transactions.”
So, if you connect your account directly to a financial institution, you don’t need 
to take any action to download transactions.
You can view downloaded transactions by choosing Transactions ➪   Banking to 
display the Bank and Credit Cards page, from which you can compare transactions 
and resolve any issues. Later sections in this chapter cover more about using the 
Bank and Credit Cards page to review and, if necessary, resolve any questions.
Downloading information using  
QuickBooks Web Connect
If you can’t connect your account directly to QBO, perhaps because your financial 
institution doesn’t yet support QBO, you’re not out of luck. Instead, you can use 
QuickBooks Web Connect, which has been around for years. If you were previously 
a QuickBooks desktop user, you might have used QuickBooks Web Connect. When 
you use QuickBooks Web Connect, you download transactions from your financial 
institution’s website to your computer, and then you upload the downloaded 
transactions from your computer to QBO.
Because QuickBooks Web Connect files are not encrypted, you should not use a 
public computer to download information using QuickBooks Web Connect.
To use QuickBooks Web Connect, follow these steps:
1.	 Log in to your financial institution’s website and look for a link that 
enables you to download to QuickBooks.
Some banks have a “Download to QuickBooks” link. If you can’t find the link, 
contact your financial institution and let them direct you to the link. After you 

168      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
find it, make note of where it appears on your financial institution’s website for 
future use.
2.	 Using the link you found in Step 1, select any of the following file formats:
•	 .qbo: QuickBooks
•	 .qfx: Quicken
•	 .ofx: Microsoft Money
If you save your file to some other format, QBO won’t be able to upload it.
3.	 Select the dates for the transactions you want to download.
If you download transactions with dates that precede the opening balance you 
entered for the account in QBO, the account’s opening balance will change.
4.	 Save the file to a location on your computer where you’ll be able to find  
it later.
Many people download to the Downloads folder or to their Windows desktop.
5.	 To upload the file to QBO, log in to QBO and, in the Navigation bar, 
choose Transactions ➪   Banking.
QBO displays the Bank and Credit Cards page.
6.	 At the right side of the page, click the arrow beside the Update button 
and choose File Upload (see Figure 8-6).
QBO starts the Upload Bank File wizard and displays the screen shown in Figure 8-7.
FIGURE 8-6: 
Click the File 
Upload button or 
click the arrow 
beside the 
Update button 
and select File 
Upload.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      169
7.	Click the Browse button, navigate to the location where you saved the 
transactions you downloaded in Step 2, and select the downloaded file.
8.	Click Next.
QBO displays a screen where you select the QBO account into which you want 
to upload the transactions.
9.	Select the QBO account where the transactions should appear and 
click Next.
QBO uploads the transactions to the selected QBO account (The process can 
take a few minutes.)
10.	When you see the confirmation screen, click Finish.
After you successfully upload a QuickBooks Web Connect file, you should delete it 
because it is not encrypted and it contains your account information.
Importing transactions via Excel
If your bank supports downloading transactions to a CSV format (a comma- 
separated values format that can be read by Excel), you can download your banking 
activity to a CSV format and then import it into your QBO Bank account. First, log 
in to your bank’s website and save your banking transactions. QBO can import CSV 
files formatted in either three or four columns, as shown in Tables 8-1 and 8-2.
FIGURE 8-7: 
Use this screen to 
navigate to the 
transactions you 
download from 
your financial 
institution.

170      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Open your CSV file using Excel and make sure it matches one of these formats; if 
necessary, edit it. Then, follow these steps to import the transactions:
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪   Banking in the Navigation bar.
2.	 Click the arrow beside the Update button and, from the menu that 
appears, click File Upload.
The Upload File page, shown earlier in Figure 8-7, appears.
3.	 Click the Browse button, select the CSV file you downloaded from your 
bank’s website, and click Next.
4.	 Select the account into which you want to import transactions and  
click Next.
5.	 On the Map CSV Columns screen that appears, match the fields in QBO to 
the fields in your CSV file and then click Next (see Figure 8-8).
The transactions you can import from your CSV file appear, with a check box to 
the left of each transaction. To avoid importing a particular transaction, select 
its check box.
6.	 Click Next.
QBO displays the number of transactions that will be imported and asks if you 
want to import the transactions.
7.	 Click Yes to import the transactions.
When QBO finishes importing the transactions, a confirmation screen appears.
8.	 Click Finish.
The Bank and Credit Cards page appears, and the transactions you imported 
appear on the New Transactions tab.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      171
Handling downloaded activity
After you download transactions using either download method, you evaluate 
each transaction and, as appropriate, use them to update QuickBooks. From the 
Bank and Credit Cards page, you match, exclude, or add transactions downloaded 
from a financial institution to your QBO company.
Don’t worry; if you make a mistake, you can fix it, as described later in this chap-
ter in the section titled (what else?) “Fixing mistakes.”
Choose Transactions ➪   Banking to display the Bank and Credit Cards page (see 
Figure 8-9) and, if necessary, select an account by clicking it at the top of the page.
You match transactions the same way for bank accounts and for credit card 
accounts.
Just below the accounts, QBO displays three transaction status tabs:
»
» If you click For Review, transactions appear that you have downloaded but 
have not yet specified how you want to handle.
»
» If you click In QuickBooks, transactions appear that you have downloaded and 
added to QBO.
»
» If you click Excluded, transactions appear that you have downloaded and 
decided not to include in QBO.
FIGURE 8-8: 
Match QBO fields 
to the fields in 
your CSV file.

172      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
To view the transactions you need to consider, click For Review. QBO displays a 
button you can use to take batch actions — I’ll discuss that button in a moment — 
and two additional tabs:
»
» The All tab lets you view all downloaded transactions for the selected account.
»
» The Recognized tab displays downloaded transactions that QBO thinks it 
knows how to handle.
Both the All tab and the Recognized tab display the same information; think of the 
Recognized tab as a filtered version of the All tab.
In the Category or Match column, QBO suggests a way to assign each transaction. 
Using both information from other businesses like yours and your past behavior, 
QBO tries to identify downloaded transactions that potentially match transactions 
you entered in QBO. If you have previously accepted a transaction from a vendor, 
QBO assumes that you want to assign the same category to subsequent transac-
tions for that vendor. And, if you change the payee on a transaction, QBO will 
suggest that change the next time a transaction appears for that payee.
Although the suggestions are helpful, after a while, you might find yourself wish-
ing that QBO would stop suggesting and just record the transaction — and you can 
use auto-add rules to accomplish that behavior. See the section “Establishing rules 
to accept transactions” later in this chapter for details.
FIGURE 8-9: 
Use this page to 
specify how QBO 
should handle 
each downloaded 
transaction.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      173
When QBO finds no matches, the words “Uncategorized Expense” or “Uncatego-
rized Income” appear in the Category or Match column. When QBO finds only one 
possible match, QBO assumes the match is accurate and assigns the transaction 
accordingly; transactions like these appear in green in the Category or Match col-
umn; you can still make changes to the transaction before you accept it. If QBO 
finds multiple possibilities, QBO doesn’t actually assign information to the trans-
action but notifies you of possible matches by displaying the match information in 
the Category or Match column in gray.
Read on to learn how to handle these situations.
Excluding transactions
Let’s examine that Batch Actions button now. As you evaluate new transactions, 
you need to decide first whether they belong in QBO. I suggest that you identify 
transactions to exclude and then exclude them before you deal with transactions 
you intend to include in QBO. That way, you eliminate transactions that need no 
further consideration. When might you exclude a transaction from QBO? Suppose 
that you accidentally used a business credit card to pay for groceries. This trans-
action is not a business expense and shouldn’t be part of your QBO transactions. 
So, you can exclude the transaction from QBO.
When you reconcile your statement, remember that the statement balance will 
include all transactions, not just those you included in QBO.
To exclude a transaction, follow these steps:
1.	 On the For Review tab, select the check box beside each transaction you 
intend to exclude.
2.	 Click the Batch Actions button above the list of transactions.
3.	 From the menu that appears, click Exclude Selected.
QBO moves the selected transactions to the Excluded tab.
Including transactions
The remaining transactions fall into two categories: those that don’t have an 
obvious matching transaction in QBO and those that do. And, you can identify the 
category into which a transaction falls using the Action column. If you see Add in 
the Action column, QBO couldn’t find an obvious matching transaction; if you see 
Match in the Action column, QBO did find a potentially matching transaction 
(refer to Figure 8-9). QBO makes its best guess for adding or matching transac-
tions, but it isn’t perfect.

174      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When QBO guesses correctly . . .
You need to confirm or change each transaction before you include it in QBO. If the 
listed transaction information is correct, you don’t need to individually add or 
match transactions as described in the rest of this section. Instead, you can follow 
the steps in the preceding section except, in Step 3, click Accept Selected.
If you need to make the same change to a number of transactions, select those 
transactions and choose the Modify Selected option in the Batch Actions list.
When QBO doesn’t know . . .
QBO might not know how to handle a transaction (for these transactions, QBO 
displays the words “Uncategorized Expense” or “Uncategorized Income” in the 
Category or Match column), or QBO might simply guess wrong. In these cases, you 
need to change the transaction before you accept it.
When you click any transaction that you intend to add to QBO, QBO expands the 
transaction information so that you can change the details of the transaction (see 
Figure 8-10). For example, you can use the option buttons above the transaction 
information to specify whether you want to add the transaction, search for a 
matching QBO transaction, or transfer the transaction information to another 
account. You also can change the category QBO suggests to one you deem more 
appropriate, and you can click the Split button to distribute the transaction among 
multiple categories. After you make your changes, you can click the Add button to 
add the transaction to QBO.
If you’re working with a bank account transaction, be aware that you can change 
the check number if needed.
If you change the transaction’s category, QBO will assume, in the future, that all 
transactions for the selected vendor should be assigned to the category you choose. 
You can change this behavior by clicking the Edit This Setting link just below the 
vendor’s name. When you click the link, you can choose to leave future transac-
tions uncategorized or to create a custom rule; I talk about rules in the next sec-
tion, “Establishing rules to accept transactions.”
You also can add attachments to any transaction using the Add Attachment link at 
the bottom of the expanded transaction information window.
When you click a downloaded transaction that QBO suggests you match to an 
existing QBO transaction, QBO displays a different set of details (see Figure 8-11). 
You can select the correct matching transaction, search for other matching trans-
actions, add the transaction (and supply account information for it), or transfer 

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      175
the transaction to a different account. After you make your choices in this window, 
you can click the Match button at the right edge of the window.
Repeat the process of adding and matching until you’ve handled all downloaded 
transactions.
Establishing rules to accept transactions
We’ve already established that QBO tries to learn your habits as you review down-
loaded transactions; you can help the process along by establishing rules for QBO 
to follow. When you set up rules, you speed up the review process because, effec-
tively, you tell QBO in advance how to treat certain types of transactions.
FIGURE 8-10: 
When you click 
a transaction, 
QBO displays 
transaction 
details.
FIGURE 8-11:

details QBO

176      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
How rules work
Suppose, for example, that you purchase gas for business-use cars from Shell gas 
stations and you always pay using a credit card you’ve connected to a financial 
institution in QBO. Effectively, you want to categorize all transactions at Shell sta-
tions to your Fuel expense account.
THE ORDER OF RULES
The order of the rules you establish matters. QBO uses your rules in the order they 
appear on the Rules page and applies only one rule to any particular transaction. To 
ensure that QBO applies the correct rule to a transaction, you can reorder the rules. 
Drag the waffle icon that appears to the left of the rule on the Rules page.
Suppose that you set up two rules in the following order.
•	 Rule 1: Categorize all transactions under $10 as Miscellaneous Expenses.
•	 Rule 2: Categorize all McDonald’s transactions as Meals & Entertainment.
If a $12 dollar transaction from McDonald’s appears, QBO applies Rule 2. But if a $7.50 
transaction from McDonald’s appears, QBO applies Rule 1.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      177
You can manually assign the category to one of these transactions and wait for 
QBO to “learn” your preference, or you can set up a rule for QBO to follow. When 
you establish a rule, you specify information such as the accounts and the types of 
transactions (money in or money out) to which the rule should apply.
You can create a rule that affects all accounts or a rule that affects specific accounts.
You then identify criteria that individual transactions should meet before QBO acts 
on the transactions. Last, you stipulate the information QBO should assign to 
transactions that meet the criteria. For example, you can specify a transaction 
type and a category.
The rules you establish can work in one of two ways:
»
» QBO can use your rule to suggest changes to downloaded transactions that 
you then review and approve. Or
»
» You can opt to have QBO automatically apply the rule to all transactions that it 
determines match the rule’s conditions and add those transactions to QBO.
When you use the first approach, QBO identifies, on the For Review tab of the Bank 
and Credit Cards page, transactions for which it finds and expects to apply a rule. 
You can identify these transactions because, in the Category or Match column, 
they display a Rule icon, as shown in Figure 8-12.
FIGURE 8-12: 
QBO displays  
a Rule icon for 
transactions  
for which it  
finds a rule.

178      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
QBO uses different icons to identify transactions matched by rules but not yet 
added to your company and transactions added automatically by rules; you can 
read more about these icons in the section “Fixing mistakes.”
The second approach might seem risky, but it really isn’t. Even though QBO auto-
matically applies the rule, you can still make changes to transactions that QBO 
automatically accepts.
Creating a rule
You set up either type of rule — the one that suggests changes and you must 
review them, and the one that automatically adds transactions based on a rule — 
using the same steps. There’s only one step where you do things differently; I’ll 
point out that step when I get there.
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪   Banking.
The Bank and Credit Cards page appears.
2.	 On the right side of the page, click the down arrow beside the Update 
button and choose Manage Rules.
QBO displays the Rules page, which appears in the figure in the sidebar “The 
order of rules.”
3.	 Click the New Rule button in the upper right corner of the Rules page.
QBO displays the Rule dialog box shown in Figure 8-13.
FIGURE 8-13: 
The Rule 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      179
4.	 Assign the rule a name — one that will be meaningful to you.
5.	 Identify whether the rule applies to money coming into QBO or money 
flowing out of QuickBooks, and select the accounts to which you want 
the rule to apply.
6.	 Use the “When a Transaction Meets” section to set criteria QBO should 
use when examining downloaded transactions to determine whether to 
apply the rule to them.
You can set multiple criteria using the Add Line button, and you can specify 
that a transaction should meet all or any of the criteria. Specifying “all” is more 
stringent and QBO is more selective about applying the rule.
The first list box in the section enables you to specify whether QBO should 
compare the transaction description, the bank text, or the transaction amount 
to a condition you set. For those inquiring minds out there, Description (the 
transaction description) refers to the text that appears in the Description 
column of the Bank and Credit Cards page. The Bank Text option refers to the 
Bank Detail description the bank downloads; you can view the Bank Detail 
description if you click any downloaded transaction. The Bank Detail descrip-
tion appears at the bottom left of the transactions being edited back in 
Figures 8-10 and 8-11.
7.	 At the bottom of the Rule dialog box, shown in Figure 8-14, set the 
information you want QBO to apply to transactions that meet the rule’s 
criteria. You can select one or more of the following:
FIGURE 8-14: 
Set the 
­information you 
want QBO to 
apply to 
transactions 
when it uses  
the rule.

180      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
a.	 Select the Transaction Type QBO should assign to the transaction.
b.	 Select the Payee and one or more categories to apply to transactions 
that meet the rule’s conditions.
c.	 Optionally, add a Memo to each transaction that meets the rule’s 
conditions.
See the sidebar, “The Memo field and transactions rules” for a way you 
might want to use the Memo field.
d.	 Select the Automatically Add to My Books check box if you want QBO 
to automatically add transactions that meet the rule’s conditions to 
your company.
This is the “different” step I refer to in the introduction to these steps. If you 
select this box, you don’t need to approve transactions to which QBO 
applies this rule. But you can always make changes to automatically added 
transactions.
8.	 Click Save.
Once you create a rule, you can use the Actions column of the Rules page to copy 
it (so that you don’t have to create similar rules from scratch) and to delete rules 
you no longer want. And, if you need to edit a rule, click the Edit button in the 
Actions column to reopen the Rule dialog box and make changes.
Accountants, you can help your clients and save some time if you export and 
import rules between QBO companies. See Chapter 13 for details.
THE MEMO FIELD AND TRANSACTION 
RULES
QBO uses different special icons to identify transactions added using rules and transac-
tions automatically added using rules. These icons follow the transactions into QBO 
­registers. But, at the present time, you can’t filter a register to show you only those 
transactions added by a rule (automatically or not).
You can, however, filter registers using the Memo field. So, if you anticipate needing to 
filter a register for transactions added by rules and transactions added automatically by 
rules, use the Memo field in the Rule dialog box to distinguish them. You might include 
text such as, “Added by Rule” and “Added Automatically by Rule” to appropriate rules.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      181
Fixing mistakes
You can easily identify transactions to which QBO has applied rules. In Figure 8-12, 
you see that the Rule icon appears in the Category or Match column when QBO 
finds a transaction to which QBO wants to apply a rule. And you can see how QBO 
handles each downloaded transaction in your company when you click the In 
QuickBooks tab on the Bank and Credit Cards page (see Figure 8-15).
QBO uses different icons to identify transactions added by rules and transactions 
added automatically by rules.
Suppose that you accidentally include a transaction in QBO that you meant to 
exclude. Or suppose that QBO assigned the wrong category to a transaction. You 
can easily correct these mistakes using the In QuickBooks tab on the Bank and 
Credit Cards page.
The method used to match and add a transaction — manually, through a rule, or 
automatically through a rule  — doesn’t matter. You can make changes to any 
downloaded transaction. Be aware, though, that QBO treats downloaded transac-
tions as having cleared your bank; so, if you edit a downloaded transaction in the 
register, QBO will ask you if you’re sure.
If you include a transaction in QBO that contains mistakes — for example, the 
transaction was automatically added by a rule to the wrong category — you can 
FIGURE 8-15: 
Use the In 
QuickBooks  
tab to find 
transactions 
you’ve accepted 
into QBO.

182      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
undo the action. Undoing an accepted transaction places it back on the For Review 
tab, where you can make changes and accept it again as described earlier in this 
chapter in the sections “Excluding transactions” and “Including transactions.”
To undo an accepted transaction, click the In QuickBooks tab on the Bank and 
Credit Cards page. Find the transaction and click the Undo link in the Action col-
umn. QBO displays a message explaining that it will place the transaction on the 
For Review tab, where you can click it, edit it, and accept it again — or, you can 
exclude it from QBO, if appropriate.
Making a Bank Deposit
In Chapter 6, I show you how to record payments from customers, and I ­suggest 
that you use the Undeposited Funds account as you record a Receive Payment trans-
action. So, after receiving a customer payment and placing it in the Undeposited 
Funds account, your Bank account — where the money will eventually show up — 
hasn’t yet been updated. That updating happens when you ­prepare a bank deposit.
You can think of the Undeposited Funds account as a temporary holding place 
until you prepare a bank deposit. “So, why use the Undeposited Funds account?” 
you ask. “Why not just place the customer payments into the Bank account where 
they belong?”
Excellent questions. And the answers revolve around making sure that the bank 
deposits in QBO match the ones at your bank, because if the deposits match, bank 
statement reconciliation — everybody’s least favorite task — becomes quite easy. 
But if they don’t match . . . well, you don’t want to go there.
For example, if you receive more than one customer payment on any given day, 
you’ll take several checks to your bank that day. And you’ll probably deposit all of 
them as a single deposit. Most banks typically don’t record the individual checks 
that make up a deposit as individual deposits. Instead, the bank records the sum 
of the checks as your deposit — pretty much the same way you sum the checks on 
the deposit ticket you give to the bank teller.
“And why is this important?” you ask. This fact is important because, when you 
receive your statement from your bank, you need to match the bank’s deposits 
and withdrawals with your own version of deposits and withdrawals. If you track 
each customer payment you receive as a deposit in the bank, then your QBO 
deposits won’t match the bank’s deposits. But if you record customer payments 
into the Undeposited Funds account, your deposits will match the bank’s version 
of your deposits because you’ll move multiple checks from the Undeposited Funds 
account to create a single deposit to your bank account.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      183
So, assuming that you’re following my advice and using the Undeposited Funds 
account before you prepare a bank deposit slip, you then use the Bank Deposit 
feature in QBO to sum up the payments you receive and intend to deposit simul-
taneously at your bank. QBO records, as the deposit amount in your QBO Bank 
account, the amount calculated in the Bank Deposit window, which will match the 
amount you actually deposit at your bank. Then your bank reconciliation process 
becomes quick and easy — okay, maybe not quick and easy, but certainly quicker 
and easier than if you were trying to figure out which customer payments make 
up various bank deposits.
To set up a bank deposit, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Create button — the plus (+) sign — and, from the Create menu, 
select Bank Deposit.
QBO displays the Deposit transaction window shown in Figure 8-16. Existing 
payment transactions appear at the top of the window in the Select Existing 
Payments section of the window. You can use the lines in the Add New 
Deposits section to add a new payment transaction that is not associated with 
an outstanding invoice.
Don’t try to record a payment from a customer for an outstanding invoice in 
the Add New Deposits section. QBO is unlikely to match the line on the Deposit 
transaction to the outstanding invoice. Instead, record the Receive Payment 
transaction; the transaction will then appear in the Select Existing Payments 
section of the Deposit transaction window.
FIGURE 8-16:

2.	 At the top of the window, select the account into which you plan to 
deposit the payments.
3.	 In the Select Existing Payments section, click the check box beside each 
transaction you want to include on the deposit.
4.	 For each transaction you intend to deposit, select the Payment method.
Credit card companies often deposit credit card transaction receipts into your 
Bank account, and most of them make a daily deposit. To keep bank statement 
reconciliation as simple as possible, I suggest that you record separate QBO 
deposits for each credit card you accept. You can group the checks and cash 
payment methods on the same deposit.
5.	 Optionally, you can supply a memo and a reference number.
The total of the selected payments — and the amount you intend to deposit 
unless you add entries in the Add New Deposits section — appears below the 
Select Existing Payments list.
6.	 Scroll down the Deposit transaction window.
Optionally, supply a memo for the deposit.
Optionally, supply a cash back amount — money from the deposit total that 
you don’t intend to deposit — along with an account in which to place the cash 
back amount and a memo to describe the purpose of the cash back amount.
Optionally, you can attach an electronic document to the deposit, such as a 
scanned copy of the deposit ticket you take to the bank.
To attach an electronic document to the deposit, click in the Attachments box 
and navigate to the document or drag and drop the electronic copy into the 
Attachments box.
7.	 Click Save and Close.
QBO moves the deposited amount from the Undeposited Funds account to 
the account you selected in Step 2.
All that’s left to do is take a trip to the bank. Or if you’re mobile-savvy, you might 
be able to remotely deposit checks via your cellphone; talk to your banker.
Reconciling a Bank Account
Most people’s least favorite task is reconciling the bank statement. But, if you’re 
diligent about entering transactions in QBO and recording bank deposits as 
described in the preceding section, reconciling your bank statement should be a 
fairly easy process.

CHAPTER 8  Handling Bank and Credit Card Transactions      185
To reconcile an account, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Gear button beside your company name and, from the Tools 
portion of the menu that appears, select Reconcile.
2.	 From the Reconcile page that appears, select the account you want to 
reconcile and click the Reconcile Now button.
QBO displays the Start Reconciling dialog box shown in Figure 8-17.
3.	 Enter the ending date and balance found on your bank statement, and 
then click OK.
QBO displays the Reconcile page shown in Figure 8-18.
4.	 Select each transaction that appears on your bank statement and in the 
Reconcile page.

By selecting a transaction, you’re marking it as having cleared the bank. Your goal 
is to have the Difference amount at the bottom of the Reconcile window equal $0.
If you have lots of transactions, make sure that a check appears in the Hide 
Transactions After the Statement’s End Date check box (upper right corner of 
the window). Hiding those transactions can help you find transactions to clear. 
If the Difference amount isn’t $0, then deselect the box to look for additional 
transactions to mark as cleared.
5.	 When the Difference amount equals $0, click the Finish Now button.
QBO redisplays the Reconcile page that appeared in Step 2 but wasn’t shown. 
The reconciliation you just performed now appears in the Reconciliation 
History part of the screen (see Figure 8-19).
You can click any reconciliation on this page to see its Reconciliation report, which 
resembles the one shown in Figure 8-20.
You can drill down to view any transaction in the window where you created it; 
just click the transaction. And to produce a paper copy, click the Print button in 
the upper left corner of the report window.

Paying Employees
I
t’s important to understand that QBO users can prepare payroll in one of two 
ways: using QuickBooks Online with Enhanced Payroll (which I’ll call QBOP) or 
using QuickBooks Online with Full Service Payroll. Although both of these 
options work in QBO, this chapter explores using QBOP, where you use QBO to do 
the work yourself. There isn’t much point for me to describe QuickBooks Online 
with Full Service Payroll because Intuit does the work for you.
A third alternative is to use Intuit Online Payroll; using this option, Intuit prepares 
payroll, manages all payroll tax payments, and prepares and files all payroll tax 
returns (including W-2s at the end of each year) for you — for a fee, of course. You 
can explore this option at http://payroll.intuit.com/payroll-services/
fullservice-payroll/. Be aware that Intuit Online Payroll doesn’t integrate 
with QBO.
“So, what’s the difference between this and QuickBooks Online with Full Service 
Payroll?” you ask. If you or your accountant opt to use Intuit Online Payroll, you 
prepare payroll outside of QBO, and you can import the data you enter using Intuit 
Online Payroll into QBO.  Generally speaking, Intuit Online Payroll is a pretty 
straightforward online payroll processing tool; you can take a tour at http://
payroll.intuit.com/online-payroll/, and you can watch videos that show you 
the basics of using it. You also can sign up for a 30-day free trial.
Chapter 9

188      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Getting Started with QBO Payroll
When you prepare payroll, the process involves setup work so that you can accu-
rately calculate payroll checks. You must also account for payroll taxes withheld 
from each employee’s paycheck. You will remit federal and state payroll taxes to 
the appropriate tax authorities. You will also remit any required deductions and 
contributions that affect each employee’s paycheck to appropriate agencies.
This section examines the payroll setup process in QBOP.
UNDERSTANDING THE PAYROLL PROCESS
Just so you understand the job you’re undertaking, be aware that running payroll is 
more than just issuing paychecks to your employees (although your employees will tell 
you that’s the most important part of payroll). Yes, you first need to prepare accurate 
paychecks that account for withheld payroll taxes, deductions for benefits such as 
health insurance, and company contributions to, for example, retirement plans. But 
then, after you’ve prepared paychecks, you also need to electronically deposit withheld 
payroll taxes, remit amounts withheld for deductions and benefits to the appropriate 
parties, and file payroll tax returns with the appropriate taxing authorities. And all this 
work needs to be done according to a timetable that the IRS has established based on 
the size of your business’s payroll tax liability.
ENTERING PAYROLL HISTORY
If you’ve been using QuickBooks for Windows desktop and preparing payroll in it, you 
can import your company as described in Chapter 12. In that case, your employees will 
appear in QBO; but, assuming you’re using QBOP, you’ll have some setup work to com-
plete, such as the work described in this section. When entering payroll history, you’ll 
find two payroll reports useful:
•	 The Payroll Summary report for each employee for the current year, which you 
use to add year-to-date wages and taxes withheld for every W-2 employee.
•	 The Payroll Summary report for every payroll run for the current tax period, 
which you use to add payroll totals for past pay dates during the current tax period.

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      189
Turning on QBOP
QBOP uses a wizard to walk you through the setup process. You start by first turn-
ing on payroll in QBO. Then, the wizard walks you through setting up your com-
pany so that you can pay your employees.
Click the Employees link in the Navigation bar, and then click the Get Started with 
Payroll button (see Figure 9-1).
The Get Ready for Payroll wizard starts. On the first page, QBO fills in information 
you provided when you initially set up your company. Double-check the informa-
tion and click the Continue button in the lower right corner of the screen.
On the next screen of the wizard, you indicate whether you’ve been paying 
employees during the current year or whether you are about to start paying 
employees for the first time.
If you indicate that you have previously done payroll and are now switching to 
QBOP, the wizard displays two additional questions for you to answer, as shown 
in Figure 9-2. Answer the questions and click the Continue button in the lower 
right corner of the screen. If you indicate that you’ve not previously paid employ-
ees, no additional questions appear, so you can just click Continue.
For this example, I’m going to assume that you’ve not previously paid any 
employees. If you have, I suggest that you use the payrolls you have completed as 
your learning tools and enter them into QBOP as described in the section “Prepar-
ing Payroll.” That way, you’ll learn how to prepare payroll and simultaneously 
get your payroll accounts up to date.
FIGURE 9-1: 
Turning on QBOP.

190      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
The next page of the wizard asks if you have collected completed W-4 forms from 
your employees. W-4 forms are the Internal Revenue Service’s form that employees 
complete to specify their withholding allowance. If you need to complete Form W-4 
for any employee, you can click the Need W-4 Forms link in the Payroll Setup wiz-
ard to display and print or save a PDF version after printing the form; the form QBO 
displays is not an editable form. For an editable form that you can complete using 
your computer, visit www.irs.gov and click the W-4 link in the Forms & Pubs sec-
tion to display editable PDF forms.
After you indicate that you have received completed W-4 forms from your employ-
ees, click Continue. The wizard prompts you to enter one of your employees. 
­Provide the information for one of your employees and click Continue. QBO 
­displays a screen like the one shown in Figure 9-3.
Provide the information for which the wizard prompts you:
»
» Name
»
» Form W-4 information
This information includes the employee’s address, social security number, 
marital status, withholding amount, and state payroll tax — which varies from 
state to state, but QBOP prompts you to supply information for the state in 
which your business operates. The prompts for all this information appear 
when you click the Enter W-4 Form button.
To identify your state’s payroll tax requirements, visit your state’s website and 
search for payroll taxes.
FIGURE 9-2: 
Indicate whether 
you’ve previously 
paid employees 
during the 
current year.

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      191
»
» The frequency with which you pay the employee and the next expected pay 
date. When you supply pay frequency information, QBO creates a pay 
schedule that you can apply to subsequent employees you create.
»
» The amount you pay the employee.
»
» Whether the employee has any deductions.
»
» The method you want to use to pay the employee (such as paper check or 
direct deposit).
After you answer questions 2–5, if you need to make changes, click the pencil icon 
beside the answer. As you supply information, QBOP updates the preview of the 
sample check on the right side of the window.
When you finish supplying the employee’s information, click Done, and QBO dis-
plays the Employees page shown in Figure 9-4; the employee you set up appears in 
the list, and you can click the employee to edit the information, or you can click the 
Add employee button to add additional employees. You can display the Employees 
page at any time and click the Add employee button to set up additional employees.
If QBO displays a page with a Preview Payroll button in the bottom right corner, 
you can click the down arrow beside the button and opt to do so later.
Setting payroll preferences
In addition to adding employees, you should review payroll preferences and set up 
payroll taxes.
FIGURE 9-3: 
Provide 
­information 
for the first 
employee.

192      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
To review payroll preferences, click the Gear button beside your company’s name 
and, from the menu that appears, click Payroll Settings (in the Settings column) 
to display the Preferences page shown in Figure 9-5. The page contains a series of 
links that you can click to review or establish various settings related to payroll. 
Understanding this page might make you feel less overwhelmed by what you see.
FIGURE 9-4: 
Add or edit

FIGURE 9-5: 
The Payroll 
Preferences page.

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      193
The Setup Overview page is divided into three columns: Payroll and Services, 
Company and Account, and Employees. Within each column, you find additional 
headings — I’ll refer to these additional headings as section headings — that sum-
marize the types of settings you find as you click each link in that section. For 
example, under the Company and Account column, you find section headings for 
Business Information and Preferences. In the following bullets, I describe the kind 
of information you find as you click the links under each section heading on the 
Setup Overview page.
In addition, links appear above the Setup Overview heading; good news here — these 
aren’t additional settings that you need to review. Instead, these links lead to the 
same pages as some of the links listed in the columns and section headings on 
the Setup Overview page. For example, the Electronic Services link at the top of the 
page displays the same page as the Update Electronic Services link in the ­Electronic 
Services section under the Payroll and Services column heading. And clicking the Pay 
Policies link displays the same page as clicking the Pay Schedules and Vacation/Sick/
PTO links in the Payroll section under the Payroll and Services column heading.
In the bullets that follow, you find a description of the pages that appear as you 
click the links beneath each section heading:
»
» In the Payroll section (under Payroll and Services), you can set up additional 
pay schedules; establish vacation, sick, and paid time off policies; define 
deductions and contributions used by your company during payroll; and set 
up direct deposit.
»
» In the Taxes section, you establish general company tax information (such as 
your company’s legal organization); set up your federal tax ID number and 
your filing and tax deposit schedule requirements; set up your state’s payroll 
requirements, which vary from state to state; and designate whether you have 
a third-party or paid form preparer. To identify your state’s payroll tax 
requirements, visit your state’s website and search for payroll taxes.
»
» Use the Electronic Services section to enroll in electronic services for filing and 
paying payroll taxes.
»
» Use the Business Information section to ensure that your contact information 
is accurate.
»
» Use the Preferences section to establish the following:
•	 Wage and tax accounts for payroll
•	 Paycheck and W-2 form printing settings
•	 Payroll-related email preferences such as receiving reminders about 
preparing payroll, making tax payments, and filing tax forms
•	 Report settings to identify reports you want available after you prepare payroll

194      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
»
» In the Overview section, the Employees link takes you to the Employees page; 
clicking Employees on the Preferences page has the same effect as clicking 
Employees in the Navigation bar.
»
» Use the Time Sheets link in the Overview section to establish the way you 
want to enter employee hours.
Setting up payroll taxes
Before you start using payroll, you should use the wizard QBOP provides to set up 
payroll tax form and filing information. The wizard asks you for federal and state 
tax details such as your federal Employer ID number (EIN) and your correspond-
ing state account number, how often you’re required to remit payroll taxes, and 
whether you want to file and pay taxes electronically or manually using paper 
coupons. Choose Taxes ➪   Payroll Tax in the Navigation bar to display the Payroll 
Tax Center before you set things up (see Figure 9-6).
Click Continue, and the wizard displays the Employee Details page, which lists each 
of your employees. Fill in a birth date and hire date (in mm/dd/yyyy format) and 
click the W-4 Info link to confirm that the employee’s W-4 details are correct.
After you check each employee, click Continue. On the next screen, the wizard 
displays the Business Details page. Confirm or change information the wizard 
supplies about your business, including the address you use when filing tax forms, 
the first time you’ll be running payroll using QBOP, the timeframe during which 
you hired your first employee, and your workers’ compensation insurance status.
FIGURE 9-6:

Center before 
you establish 
settings for 
payroll tax forms 
and payments.

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      195
See the “Getting up-and-running” sidebar for information about the date you 
intend to run your first QBOP payroll. Then, click Continue.
The Payroll Tax setup wizard next displays the Federal Tax Details page shown in 
Figure 9-7. Supply your federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), and con-
firm the payroll tax form you use and how often you must remit payroll taxes. You 
should also specify whether your company is a federally recognized non-profit 
organization that is not required to pay federal unemployment taxes (FUTA).
Click Continue, and the Payroll Tax setup wizard displays the State Tax Details 
page. This page is the state counterpart of the Federal Tax Details page. On the 
State Tax Details page, you supply details about your state payroll account, includ-
ing the number, the State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) rate assigned to your 
business, and your state payroll tax deposit schedule. You also supply details for 
other taxes, if any, in your state.
Click Save, and QBO displays the E-pay and E-file Setup page, where you specify 
whether you want to file and pay payroll taxes electronically or manually, using 
paper coupons. If you opt to file and pay electronically, you then supply informa-
tion about the bank account from which you want to pay, including your routing 
and account number.
When you finish supplying information about how you want to file and pay your 
taxes, click Next. QBO confirms that you’ve finished setting up your payroll taxes. 
Click Done, and QBO redisplays the Payroll Tax Center screen (see Figure 9-8).
GETTING UP-AND-RUNNING
The date you start using QBOP determines the “as of ” date of historical information you 
need to collect. Try to start using QBOP on January 1 of any year — that way, you don’t 
need to enter any historical information. If you can’t start using QBOP on January 1, try 
to start using it on the first day of an accounting period — either on the first day of your 
company’s fiscal year or on the first day of a month.
If you are starting on a date other than January 1 and have issued payroll checks during 
the current year and prior to using QBOP, I suggest that you use these prior payrolls as 
a learning tool. You can enter the paychecks and then record the tax payments and pre-
pare the tax forms without e-filing anything you’ve already filed; that way, this year’s 
payroll history will be recorded in QBOP.
Chapter 3 includes the sidebar, “Proper account balances.” If you opted to set an opening 
balance on the bank account from which paychecks are paid, you can’t use prior payrolls 
as your learning tool because you’ll mess up your bank account balance. Instead, I suggest 
that you contact Intuit QuickBooks Support for help entering historical payroll information.

196      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
You can use the links on the Payroll Tax Center screen to make changes to any of 
the settings you provided as you worked through the wizard.
Preparing Payroll
After you get past the setup work, you’re ready to process payroll — essentially a 
three-step process:

Mobile users: Consider trying out the Intuit Online Payroll Mobile app, which 
works with both QBOP and with QuickBooks Online with Full Service Payroll (as 
well as other Intuit payroll products). You can use it to pay your employees and 
your payroll taxes, file payroll tax forms electronically, and review employee 
information and paycheck history. Data syncs automatically between the mobile 
app and your Intuit payroll account. Download the mobile app from the Apple App 
Store or from the Google Play Store; it’s free with a payroll subscription.
Recording payroll information
To start preparing paychecks, click the Employees link in the Navigation bar. On 
the Employees page, click the Run Payroll button on the top-right side of the page.
QBOP starts the Run Payroll wizard by displaying the window shown in Figure 9-9, 
which lists all your employees (I have only two employees in this company, so my 
list is short).
At the top of the window, select the bank account from which you’ll pay employ-
ees and double-check pay period and pay date information. Then, place a check to 
the left of each employee you intend to pay and, for each employee paid on an 
hourly basis, supply the hours worked during the pay period.

198      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
If you have lots of employees and want to see more of them onscreen, click the 
gear on the right side of the screen above the table and choose Compact. QBO 
reduces the amount of screen real estate it allots to each employee.
Reviewing and generating payroll checks
Once you finish entering hours and, if appropriate, memos for each employee you 
plan to pay, click the Preview Payroll button in the lower right corner of the Run 
LETTING EMPLOYEES USE TIMESHEETS
If you use QBO Plus, you can set up time tracking users who can log in with limited 
­privileges that enable them to complete timesheets (and do nothing else).
To add a time tracking user, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Gear button beside your company name and, from the menu that 
appears, click Manager Users.
2.	 Click the New button and, from the window that appears, click Time 
Tracking Only.
3.	 Click Next and select the employee (or vendor) you want to fill out 
timesheets.
4.	 Supply the employee’s (or the vendor’s) email address.
5.	 Click Next and then click Finish.
QBO sends to the user an email containing a link that he clicks to complete the Time 
Tracking Only setup process. If the user already has a QBO sign-in name and password, 
he can use it. Otherwise, he needs to create a sign-in name and password.
Once the user has signed in, the Single Activity Time Sheet screen appears; if the 
employee prefers to use the Weekly Timesheet screen, she can click the tab at the top 
of the screen. Because most employers don’t pay their employees based on hours 
reported on timesheets — employers instead use timesheets to bill clients for time 
spent on client projects — see Chapter 6 for details on entering time.
You can view hours entered on timesheets by time-tracking employees. Before you start 
payroll, click the Create (+) button at the top of QBO, select Weekly Timesheet, and then 
select the employee. If you prefer, you can print information: Run a Time Activity by 
Employee report (click the Reports link in the Navigation bar and then search for “Time 
Activities by Employee Detail.” Then, customize the report to display the payroll time-
frame. For information on reports, see Chapter 10.

Payroll window (shown previously in Figure 9-8). The Run Payroll wizard ­displays 
the Review and Submit page, similar to the one shown in Figure 9-10.
When you’re satisfied with the information on this page, click the Submit Payroll 
button in the lower right corner of the screen. If you’re unsure about the payroll 
or you don’t have time to complete it now, click the down arrow beside the Submit 
Payroll button and choose Save for Later to save the work you’ve done so far.
You can click the pencil at the right edge of the line for any employee to see the 
details associated with the employee’s paycheck. If necessary, you can make changes 
to some paycheck details; for example, for hourly employees, you can change the 
hours an employee worked and the Federal and State income tax amounts.
QBO displays the last screen of the Run Payroll wizard, which confirms that you’ve 
completed payroll. If you don’t directly deposit paychecks for your employees, QBO 
gives you the option to print paychecks and stubs. You can supply a starting check 
number and click Print Pay Stubs to preview paychecks and stubs and print them.
On the last screen of the Run Payroll wizard, click Finish Payroll to record the 
payroll information in QBO.
Printing payroll reports
After you complete payroll, you might want to print payroll-related reports. Click 
the Reports link in the Navigation bar to display the Reports page (see Figure 9-11).

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      201
Managing Payroll Taxes
As I mention at the beginning of this chapter, the payroll process doesn’t end 
with preparing and producing paychecks. On a schedule determined by the IRS, 
you need to remit payroll taxes and file payroll tax returns.
Paying payroll taxes
Using rules established by the IRS, you pay payroll taxes weekly, monthly, or 
quarterly, depending on the amount you owe (called your payroll tax liability).
You must make Federal tax deposits by electronic funds transfer. Most people 
make Federal tax deposits using the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System 
(EFTPS), a free service provided by the United States Department of Treasury, and 
QBOP makes use of the EFTPS.
To pay your payroll taxes, choose Taxes ➪   Payroll Tax to display the Payroll Tax 
Center (shown earlier in Figure 9-8). Once you’ve paid employees, the Payroll Tax 
Center displays taxes that are due, along with their due dates and e-payment cut-
off dates. You can preview how much you owe by printing the Payroll Tax Liability 
report; click the View Your Tax Liability Report link on the Payroll Tax Center page.
PAYROLL-RELATED DUE DATES
Payroll and unemployment tax payments are due on a different schedule than the cor-
responding tax forms. To summarize, payroll tax payments are due weekly, monthly, or 
quarterly, depending on the size of your payroll tax liability. The payroll tax form 
(Federal Form 941) is due quarterly.
Federal unemployment tax payments are typically due quarterly, but the federal unem-
ployment tax return (Federal Form 940) is typically due annually.
If you do business in a state that imposes a personal income tax, then you also have 
state payroll tax obligations. In addition, most states impose an unemployment tax.
Last, but not least, localities within any given state might also impose payroll tax 
­obligations.
The due dates for these state and local payments and their corresponding returns vary 
from state to state; to determine the due dates for your state and locality, check at the 
state’s website.

202      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When you click the Pay Taxes button, QBO displays the Pay Taxes page (see  
Figure 9-13), which shows payroll tax amounts that you owe to various taxing 
authorities and when the payments are due.
If you “look ahead” — that is, opt to view payroll tax liabilities before their due 
date — the amounts you see are estimates of your liabilities.
When you click the Create Payment link beside a line, QBO shows you the amount 
you owe, allocated by tax item (see Figure 9-14). At the top of the screen, you can 
opt to pay the liability electronically using EFTPS or make the payment yourself. 
If you’re entering historical payrolls to set up accurate payroll information for the 
current year, choose to make the payment yourself (because you’ve probably 
already made the payment and you simply want to record it in QBOP).
I’m working in the sample company, and I’m showing you this potential payment 
a few days after it was due. So, QBO displays a note at the top of the screen indi-
cating that late payments might be subject to interest and penalties and providing 
information on what action I should take.
When you finish reviewing the details for the payment, including the payment 
method (electronic or manual), the bank account from which you’ll make the pay-
ment, and the payment date, click the E-pay button or the Record Payment button 
(depending on whether you’re paying electronically or making the payment your-
self) in the lower right corner of the screen. QBO displays a payment confirmation 
window that describes the payment method, type, liability, due date, payment 
date, and payment amount.
Repeat this process for each payroll tax liability.
FIGURE 9-13:

liabilities,

authority.

CHAPTER 9  Paying Employees      203
Preparing payroll tax forms
Quarterly, you must complete and submit a federal payroll tax return using ­Federal 
Form 941, which identifies the total wages you paid, when you paid them, and the 
total taxes you withheld and deposited with appropriate taxing authorities 
throughout the quarter. The IRS permits you to file the form electronically or to 
mail the form.
If you live in a state that imposes a personal income tax, then you typically must 
also file a similar form for your state; check your state’s website for the rules you 
need to follow for payroll tax reporting. Your state probably has a state unemploy-
ment form you need to prepare and submit as well.
When you click Quarterly Forms on the Payroll Tax Center page (refer to Figure 9-8),  
QBOP displays the reports you need to prepare and submit (see Figure 9-15).
Click the link to the right of each form, and QBOP displays a page where you can 
opt to file the form electronically and preview the form. Click the View button to 
preview the form, and it appears onscreen, prefilled with information (see 
­Figure 9-16). The form preview also includes a set of tools that you can use to 
review, save, and print the form. And, as you scroll to the bottom of the form, 
­filing instructions appear.
Repeat the process of reviewing and printing each form as appropriate.

How’s the Business 
Doing?
N
o big surprise here: To help you measure and evaluate your business’s 
health, you use reports. The reports reflect the information in QBO, so, 
keeping QBO up to date with your daily activities helps ensure that accu-
rate information appears on the reports you run.
Quickly Review Income and Expenses
When you click Reports on the Navigation bar, you see a page like the one shown 
in Figure 10-1.
The graphic at the top of the page shows profit and loss information and is inter-
active; for example, if you click anywhere in the graphic — on the Net Income 
number, on either the Income or the Expenses number, or on any of the bars in 
the chart — QBO displays the Profit and Loss report shown in Figure 10-2. This 
version of the Profit and Loss report breaks down income and expenses by week 
for the period of the graphic.

You can click Reports in the Navigation bar to redisplay the Reports page shown in 
Figure 10-1, or you can click your browser’s Back button.
Don’t want the income and expense numbers displayed onscreen? Click the 
upward-pointing carat at the bottom right edge of the graphic on the Reports 
page, and QBO hides the graphic.

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      207
Finding the Report You Want
Reports in QBO are organized into five categories:
»
» Recommended Reports
»
» Frequently Run Reports
»
» My Custom Reports
»
» Management Reports
»
» All Reports
These categories appear on the Reports page below the graphic and function as 
tabs; that is, you click a tab to see the reports in that category.
Examining recommended reports
QBO lists reports on the Recommended Reports tab of the Reports page based on 
features you use in QBO, preferences, and add-ons.
In Figure 10-3, I’ve hidden the graphic at the top of the Reports page to give the 
reports on the Recommended Reports tab a bit more screen real estate. 
Remember, the reports I display in the figure might differ from the ones you see 
when you review recommended reports.
FIGURE 10-3: 
Typical 
­recommended 
reports.

208      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
If you have not turned on Redesigned Reports, each listed report also displays a 
graphic to the left of the report title. If you pass your mouse pointer over one of 
these graphics, QBO displays a sample of the report’s appearance; in Figure 10-4, 
I’ve placed the mouse pointer over the graphic for the Profit and Loss report.
What are redesigned reports?
Intuit is in the process of redesigning reports to make them more professional 
looking and easier to customize. At the time I wrote this, Redesigned Reports was 
a QuickBooks Labs feature that you need to turn on. (See Chapter 3 for details on 
enabling a QuickBooks Labs feature.)
When you turn on Redesigned Reports, QBO automatically converts all reports 
that have been redesigned to their new appearance; in addition, the graphic dis-
appears for the redesigned reports.
To get a feel for the difference in appearance between the original version of a 
report and a redesigned version, Figure 10-5 shows the original version of the 
Profit and Loss report and Figure 10-6 shows the redesigned version.
If you click the Customize button in the upper right corner of the redesigned 
report, you see additional customization options that let you control the column 
and row data on the report, set period comparisons, and more.
FIGURE 10-4: 
Hover the mouse 
pointer over a 
report’s graphic 
to view a sample 
of the report 
layout.

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      209
Looking at frequently run reports
No surprise here: On the Frequently Run tab, QBO lists the reports you run most 
often. When you first start using QBO and haven’t run reports yet, the Frequently 
Run tab doesn’t contain any reports. Instead, it contains a message that describes 
what you’ll see after you start running reports.

report.

version of the

report.

210      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Finding reports you customize
The My Custom Reports tab lists reports you have printed — whether to your dis-
play or to a printer — customized, and saved, either as single reports or in a report 
group. Like its cousin, Frequently Run reports, the My Custom Reports tab remains 
empty until you print, customize, and save a report as described later in this 
chapter in the section “Saving a customized report.” In that section, I also show 
you how to place a customized report into a group, and you get a look at the My 
Custom Reports page after it contains a report saved to a group.
If you’re a former QuickBooks desktop user, be aware that saving a report in QBO 
is the equivalent of memorizing a report in QuickBooks desktop, and saving a 
report to a group in QBO is conceptually the same as creating a memorized report 
group in QuickBooks desktop.
Taking a look at management reports
The Management Reports tab, shown in Figure 10-7, lists three predefined man-
agement report packages you can prepare and print by clicking the View link in 
the Action column. Each package contains a professional looking cover page, a 
table of contents, and several reports that relate to the report package’s name:
»
» The Sales Performance management report contains the Profit and Loss 
report, the A/R Aging Detail report, and the Sales by Customer 
Summary report.
»
» The Expenses Performance management report contains the Profit and Loss 
report, the A/P Aging Detail report, and the Expenses by Vendor Summary 
report.
»
» The Company Overview management report contains the Profit and Loss 
report and the Balance Sheet report.
The management report appears in its own window, where you can scroll through 
and print it. You can also customize these reports; click the downward-pointing 
arrow beside a report to see your choices.
If you opt to edit a report package, you can add more reports to the package and 
you can include an executive summary and end notes to the package.

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      211
Exploring all QBO reports
The All Reports tab gives you a way to find any QBO report. The page lists a series 
of categories for reports, such as Business Overview and Manage Accounts Receiv-
able. When you click a particular category, you see a page similar to the one shown 
previously in Figure 10-3, which lists all the reports for the selected category. If 
you haven’t turned on the redesigned reports feature, a graphic appears beside 
each report, and you can hover your mouse pointer over the graphic to identify the 
report’s layout and content.
Once you select a category, you can redisplay the All Reports page by clicking the 
All Reports link that appears above the report category name.
Searching for a report
You don’t need to use the tabs to find a report. Instead, you can click in the Go to 
Report box; when you do, QBO displays all reports, listed alphabetically, in a drop-
down list (see Figure 10-8).
If you see the report you want, you can click it, and QBO displays it onscreen. If 
you don’t see the report you want, you can type some keywords into the Go to 
Report box, and QBO narrows the reports displayed in the drop-down list to those 
whose name contains the keywords you typed.
FIGURE 10-7: 
The Management 
Reports page.

212      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Printing a Report
To produce any report, simply click the report’s title. QBO automatically displays 
the report with a standard set of settings. To redisplay reports, click Reports in the 
Navigation bar.
On most reports, you can drill down to view the details behind the report’s num-
bers. For example, from the Profit and Loss report, you can click any Income or 
Expense account value, and QBO displays the transactions that make up the num-
ber on the Profit and Loss report. I clicked the dollar amount for Design income, 
and QBO displayed the Transaction report shown in Figure 10-9.
To redisplay the original report, you can click the Back to Summary Report link on 
the left side of the report page.
If you want to keep the original summary version of the report open and also view 
the details from drilling down, duplicate the tab containing the summary version 
of the report before you drill down to view details. When you finish working with 
the details, you can close the tab containing the details. To duplicate a tab in 
Chrome, right-click the tab and select Duplicate. To duplicate a tab in Firefox, 
press and hold down the Ctrl key as you click the browser refresh button, which 
appears at the right edge of the address bar.
FIGURE 10-8: 
Searching for a 
report.

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      213
Customizing a report
You can customize most reports in a variety of ways. For all reports, you can 
change the date range covered by the report by opening the Transaction Date list 
box and making a selection or by setting specific dates in the From and To boxes. 
After you make your selection, click the Run Report button to refresh the report 
and display information only in the date range you selected.
To set more detailed custom settings, click the Customize button at the top of the 
report. QBO displays the Customize dialog box shown in Figure  10-10; from 
this dialog box, you can make changes that affect the information QBO displays on 
the report.
The Redesigned Reports interface varies from the regular interface. For example, 
if you’ve turned on Redesigned Reports, the dialog box you see looks like the one 
shown in Figure 10-11. The settings available in both versions of the Customize 
dialog box are the same; they simply appear in different places. Because Rede-
signed Reports is still a QuickBooks Labs feature, I’ll use the standard interface for 
discussion throughout this chapter.
First, although you see tabs down the side of the dialog box, the Customize dialog 
box contains one long list of settings you can control. The tabs help you scroll 
down quickly to a particular type of setting.
Second, it’s important to understand that the settings (and the tabs) that appear 
in the Customize dialog box vary, depending on the report you are customizing. 
Figure 10-10 shows the settings in the General section of the Customize Profit and 
FIGURE 10-9: 
The Transaction 
Report that 
appears after 
clicking an 
income account 
on the Profit and 
Loss report.

214      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
Loss dialog box. From this section, you can, for example, opt to display the report 
using the accrual basis of accounting rather than the cash basis of account.
From the Rows/Columns section of the Customize Profit and Loss dialog box (see 
Figure 10-12), you can control the columns and rows that appear on the report as 
well as the order in which they appear. You also can add a variety of comparison 
columns.

you use to

a report in

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      215
From the Lists section, shown in Figure 10-13, you can control the entries from 
the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Product/Service list that QBO includes on 
the Profit and Loss report.
Figure 10-13 also shows the settings you can control for numbers on the report 
and the beginning of the report header and footer settings. If you click Header/
Footer on the left side of the dialog box (or you scroll down in the dialog box), you 
see the rest of the report header and footer settings you can control, along with a 
preview of the header and footer settings you select.
FIGURE 10-12: 
Use this tab of 
the dialog box

rows and 
columns that 
appear on

on the Profit and

216      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
When you’re finished customizing the report, click Run Report, and QBO displays the 
report onscreen using your customized settings. With the report onscreen, you can 
click the Print button to print the report to paper or to a PDF file. Or, you can click the 
Email button to email the report or the Excel button to export the report to Excel.
You can email the report or export it to Excel from the Customize dialog box, but 
I suggest that you use the Run Report button to display the report onscreen first 
and make sure that what you see is what you want to send.
When you use Chrome to export a report to Excel, a button with the title “report1.
xls” appears in the bottom left corner of the screen; click that button to open the 
report in Excel. Be aware, too, that QBO automatically saves a copy of the report to 
the local hard drive; mine appeared in the Downloads folder. If you don’t delete the 
reports, QBO increments the report name for subsequent reports you export to Excel.
To find the folder where QBO stores the report, click the down arrow on the right 
side of the report’s button in the lower left corner of the QBO screen and choose 
Show in Folder.
Saving a customized report
Once the report looks the way you want, you might want to save it so that you 
don’t need to apply the same customizations each time you run the report. Click 
the Save Customizations button at the top of the report page to display the Save 
Report Customizations dialog box shown in Figure 10-14.
If you’ve turned on Redesigned Reports, the dialog box you use to save a report 
has a slightly different appearance but contains the same fields.
Supply a name for the customized report; you can use the QBO name for the report, 
but you’d be better off including some information in the name that helps you 
remember the customizations — unlike the one I use in the figure, which really 
doesn’t tell us much other than the report isn’t the standard Profit and Loss 
report.
FIGURE 10-14: 
Use this dialog 
box to save a 
customized 
report.

CHAPTER 10  How’s the Business Doing?      217
You can add the report to a group you create; creating a group is useful if you want 
to email several reports simultaneously. To add a group, type the group name and 
click the green Add button.
Once you save your settings in the Save Customizations dialog box, the saved report 
appears on the My Custom Reports tab of the Reports page. And, if you created a 
group, the report appears in that group. In Figure 10-15, my customized version of 
the Profit and Loss report appears in a group called (uninspiringly) Elaine’s Group.
To print the report, I click its title, and the report appears onscreen. I also can take 
any of the following actions if I click the down arrow in the Action column beside 
the report:
»
» Create a PDF version of the report by clicking Export as PDF.
»
» Move the report to a different group by clicking Group, assuming other 
groups exist.
»
» Export the report to Excel by clicking Export as Excel.
»
» Delete the customized report by clicking Delete.
To change a report’s name or group, click the Edit link beside the report.
If you select the Edit link in the Action column beside a report group, you can set 
an email schedule for the report group; QBO displays the Report Group Settings 
page shown in Figure  10-16. Select the Set the Email Schedule for This Group 
check box to display and edit scheduling information.

Reports page

218      PART 2  Managing the Books for the End User
If you select the Attach the Reports as Excel Files, QBO sends the reports in Excel 
format; if you don’t select this option, QBO sends the reports in HTML format.
Fill in the Email information; QBO will use the same subject each time it emails 
the report group. By default, QBO chooses monthly as the email interval, but if you 
click the Edit Schedule button, QBO lets you customize the email schedule (see 
Figure 10-17).
If you click Delete at the bottom of the Report Group Settings page, you delete the 
report group and all custom reports the group contains.

P
 
art 1 of this book covers the details of QBO, and QBO is the product you use 
to enter transactions into a company.
Because accountants need to work in multiple QBO companies, they use Quick-
Books Online for Accountants (QBOA). QBOA provides a front-end interface that 
acts as a portal you use to open client QBO companies. When you open any par-
ticular client’s company, you have available to you the features for the client’s 
subscription level: Simple Start, Essentials, or Plus.
As you see in this chapter, the interface for a client QBO company opened in QBOA 
varies slightly from the interface your client sees when opening the company.
Signing Up for and into QBOA
Setting up a QBOA subscription account is free, and your QBOA subscription 
remains free for the first 180 days starting from the day you enroll. You can sign 
up for the Intuit Wholesale Pricing program and receive discounted rates for each 
client subscription you manage; contact Intuit for details.
Chapter 11

222      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
When you sign up for a QBOA subscription account, you get, as one of the perks, a 
free QBO company that you can use for your own QuickBooks company.
To create a QBOA account, open your browser and navigate to http://quick 
books.intuit.com/accountants/quickbooks-accountant. On the web page that 
appears, click the Overview link in the QuickBooks Online Accountant bar (see 
Figure 11-1).
Once you click Overview, a Sign Up Free link appears at the right edge of the 
QuickBooks Online Accountant bar; click it to display the web page shown in 
­Figure 11-2. Select the region where you do business and provide the rest of the 
requested information, including your company name, and then click the Sign Up 
button.
Just as you’d expect, by clicking the Sign Up button, you’re agreeing to Intuit’s 
Terms of Service, the End-User License Agreement, and the Privacy Policy for 
QBOA.
QBOA uses the company name to create the free company you can use to manage 
the books for your own business. You can read more about this company later in 
this chapter, in the section “Understanding and Using the Free QBOA Company.”
Your new company is created and the Home page in QBOA appears. In addition, 
the “Take a Tour” video, lasting less than two minutes, provides some tips to get 
FIGURE 11-1: 
Navigating to the 
QBOA sign-in 
page.

you started. When the video finishes, you’ll see that your Client List page is empty 
except for links to two other “getting started” videos and to a PDF version of the 
16-page QuickBooks Accountant Welcome Guide, which you can use to help you 
work in QBOA.
Once you’ve created a QBOA account, you use the same page to log in to your QBOA 
account that your client uses to log in to QBO. Navigate to https://qbo.intuit.
com to view the web page shown in Figure 11-3 and supply your login credentials.

224      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Examining the QBOA Interface
The QBOA interface focuses on giving accountants access to tools they need to 
manage multiple clients. Although the view in the QBOA interface changes, 
depending on where you’re working, two common elements appear in the QBOA 
interface:
»
» The Navigation bar (navy blue) runs down the left side of the page.
»
» The QBOA toolbar (green) runs across the top of the page.
You use the Navigation bar to display the various pages in QBOA. The Navigation 
bar contains two choices that display different views and affect the choices in the 
QBOA toolbar: the Your Practice and Your Books views. The following two sections 
explore the Navigation bar and the QBOA toolbar in each of these views.
Working with the Your Practice view
By default, the QBOA Home page displays, in the Navigation bar, the links for the 
Your Practice view and the Clients page, as you see in Figure 11-4. Since I’m work-
ing in a dummy QBOA account, you don’t see much data.
FIGURE 11-4: 
The Your Practice 
view of the 
Navigation bar  
in QBOA.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      225
On the Client List page, you can search for a client, see overview information about 
each client, and open a client’s QBO company. You can also control the appearance 
of the Client List page. See the section “Controlling the Appearance of the Client 
List,” later in this chapter, for details on working with the Client List page.
When you click Team in the Navigation bar, you can set up the users in your firm 
that will have access to various client companies. For more information, see the 
section “Setting Up Your Team.”
When you click ProAdvisor, you see information about the Intuit ProAdvisor 
program.
Across the top of the interface, you find a toolbar with the following buttons, from 
left to right:
»
» The Accountant button: This button contains the QuickBooks logo and 
offers you another way to display the Client List shown in Figure 11-4.
»
» The Go to Client’s QuickBooks button: You can use this list box to display a 
list of your clients; clicking a client name opens the client’s company.
»
» The plus sign (+) icon: This button displays the Create menu, which you use 
to create a client, a user, or a request (typically for information).
»
» The Search box: When you click in this box, a list of recent transactions or 
reports appears; you can type in the box to search for the transaction or 
report of your choice or you can click an item in the list.
»
» The Gear button: Click this button to display the Gear menu (see Figure 11-5). 
The Gear menu shows the settings you can establish for your own company, 
your client’s company, and your QBOA account.
You also can open the QBO sample company from the Gear menu; read more 
about opening and working in the sample company later in this chapter, in the 
section “Working with the Sample Company.”
»
» The Help button: Click this button to open the Help menu so that you can 
search for help on any topic. Help in QBOA is context sensitive and available 
from all screens. When you open the Help menu from a transaction screen, 
the suggested choices that appear are based on the type of transaction you 
were viewing when you clicked Help.
Working with the Your Books view
When you click Your Books in the Navigation bar, you open your own QBO com-
pany, and, with the exception of the Your Practice link and the Your Books link in 
the Navigation bar, you and your client see the same links (see Figure 11-6).

226      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
The view when you open your own company’s books in QBOA matches the view 
you see when you open any client’s QBO company; the only difference onscreen is 
the name of the company that appears on the QBOA toolbar.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      227
The Home screen of a company displays overview income, expense, and profit and 
loss information in interactive filters; you can click part of any graphic on this 
page to display the details that make up that part of the graphic. In the figure, I 
haven’t entered any data into my company, so there’s no reason to click 
anything.
The QBOA toolbar in a QBO company changes somewhat when you display the 
Your Books view. In particular, beside the Accountant button, you see a suitcase 
button that I’ll call the Accountant Tools button; you can click this button to dis-
play, well, tools accountants need frequently when working in a client’s company 
(see Figure 11-7). See Chapter 15 for details on these tools.
The List Box button beside the Accountant Tools button displays the name of the 
currently open QBO company; when you click Your Books, your company’s name 
appears.
The Create button (the plus sign), the Search box, the Gear button, and the Help 
button all work the same way in the Your Books view as they do in the Your 
­Practice view.
While any company is open, you can use the QBOA toolbar to open the list box 
displaying the company’s name to switch to a different client company. Also, you 
can redisplay the Client List page at any time by clicking the Accountant button on 
the QBOA toolbar.

228      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Setting Up Your Team
If your accounting firm has more than one person who need access to client QBO 
companies, the person who creates the QBOA account — called, in QBOA parlance, 
the master administrator — can set up the other users. The other users get their 
own login credentials and access to those clients that the master administrator 
specifies; for those clients, the user can access the Accountant tools described in 
Chapter 15. The master administrator also specifies the user’s level of access to the 
firm’s information; a user can have basic, full, or custom access.
Using separate QBOA login information helps maintain security in QBOA, because 
a lot of financial information (product subscriptions and billing information, for 
example) is tied to login information.
So, what’s the difference, status-wise, between basic, full, and custom access?
»
» Those users with full access can open and work in the firm’s books as well as 
in client QBO companies and can access the Team page and make changes to 
any user’s privileges.
»
» Those users with basic access can access only client QBO companies.
»
» Those users with custom access have nothing more than basic or full access 
with at least one privilege set differently from QBOA’s defaults for basic or full 
access.
To set up multiple users in a QBOA account, the master administrator or any firm 
member with full access privileges to QBOA sets up other members of the firm; 
during the process, QBOA sends an email to the other firm members whom, for 
this discussion, I’ll call invitees. Once an invitee accepts the invitation, QBOA 
prompts the invitee to set up his own QBOA login credentials. Follow these steps 
to set up a new user in a QBOA account:
1.	 Log in to QBOA.
2.	 Click Team in the Navigation bar.
The Team page appears (see Figure 11-8).
3.	 Click the Add User button.
The Add User wizard begins.
4.	 On the first page of the Add User wizard, fill in the name, email address, 
and title of the team member you want to add.
The team member’s title is optional.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      229
5.	 Click Next.
The second page of the Add User wizard appears (see Figure 11-9). On this 
page, you identify the privileges related to your firm that you want to provide 
to the team member.

You can assign Basic, Full, or Custom access; a description of each type of

members who should have access to your own company’s books. Assign Basic 
access to give a team member access to QBO client companies only.
You can make changes to individual settings; if you do, QBOA sets the team 
member’s access to Custom by default.
7.	 Click Next.
The last screen of the Add User wizard appears (see Figure 11-10). On this 
page, you identify the clients for whom the team member should be able to 
perform work.
8.	 Deselect clients as needed.
9.	 Click Save.
QBOA adds the new user to your team and assigns a status of Invited to the 
user. In addition, the Status column on the Team screen indicates that QBOA 
sent an email invitation to the user, inviting the user to join your team. After 
the user responds to the QBOA invitation, the user’s status changes to Active 
on the Team page in QBOA.
The email invitation that QBOA sends looks like the one shown in Figure 11-11.
The recipient clicks the Accept Invitation button, and, assuming the invitee 
doesn’t already have login information for QBOA, the page shown in Figure 11-12 
appears. On this page, the invitee sets up QBOA login information by providing a 
user ID (which does not need to be an email address) and a password. Once the 
invitee clicks Create User, QBOA confirms that the user ID is available, sets up the

Controlling the Appearance  
of the Client List
You can use the Client List page to open any client’s QBO company, and you can 
control the appearance of the Client List page, shown in Figure 11-13.
To open any client’s QBO company, click the QuickBooks logo in the Status col-
umn of the Client List page. Or, if you prefer, open the Go to Client’s QuickBooks 
list box on the QBOA toolbar to select the QBO company you want to open.
If you click a client’s name — rather than the QuickBooks logo — you don’t open 
the client’s company. Instead, you see overview details about the client. And the 
QuickBooks logo that appears in the Payroll Status column opens the client’s 
company and displays payroll information for the client company.
You can control the appearance of the Client List page. For example, you can 
­control the number of clients listed on the page by limiting the number of rows 
that appear. You also can specify the columns of information that appear on the 
Client list page. And, you can opt to hide or display inactive clients; for more 
information on making a client inactive, see the section “Removing clients from 
FIGURE 11-13:

your Wholesale Billing subscription” later in this chapter. Click the Gear button 
that appears just above the list of clients and make choices from the list that 
appears (see Figure 11-14).
QBOA actually contains multiple Gear menus. One of them appears on the QBOA 
toolbar and is visible from most QBOA pages, even while you work in a client’s 
QBO company; you use that Gear menu to provide information about your QBOA 
account, establish settings, view lists, and access tools to, for example, import 
data. On the QBOA Clients page, the other Gear menu appears on the right side just 
above the list of clients, and you use it to control the information that appears on 
the page.
Understanding and Using the Free 
QBOA Company
As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, QBOA users get one free company 
to use for their own books. To open the company reserved for you, click the — yep, 
you guessed it — Your Books link in the Navigation bar, and QBOA opens your 
FIGURE 11-14: 
Control the 
number of rows 
and the 
­information 
appearing on the 
Client List page.

234      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
company. The interface you see when you open your company looks just like the 
interface you see when you open any client’s QBO company; remember, this inter-
face varies slightly from what a client using QBO sees.
You can use the free QBOA company to enter your own company’s information 
using transactions, or if you’ve been tracking your business in desktop Quick-
Books, you can, with some limitations, import information from your desktop 
QuickBooks company. To enter information using transactions, you can read the 
chapters in Part 1 of this book, because you as a QBOA user and your clients as QBO 
users enter transactions in the same way.
You can import desktop QuickBooks information, and you can import only list 
information. For details on importing lists, see Chapter  4. If you want to try 
importing a desktop QuickBooks company, see Chapter 12 for details as well as 
Appendix B, which describe the limitations associated with importing informa-
tion. Please note that importing into a regular QBO company has time limits, but 
importing into the QBOA free company doesn’t.
Be aware that the Your Books company is not intended to house a client’s data. 
The Your Books company ties into QBOA and updates as clients are added to 
QBOA. So, if you use it to store a client’s data, that data will be messed up as you 
add other clients.
Working with the Sample Company
If you’ve been a desktop QuickBooks user, you know that desktop QuickBooks 
comes with a variety of sample companies that you can use to test company 
behavior. Like its desktop cousin, QBOA also comes with a sample company.
To open the sample company, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Gear button on the QBOA toolbar.
QBOA opens the Gear menu.
2.	 In the Your Company section, click Sample Company.
QBOA displays a warning message that you will be logged out of QBOA if you 
continue.
3.	 Click Continue.
QBOA signs you out of your company and opens the sample company. The 
interface looks like the QBOA interface you see when you open a client’s 

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      235
company. For example, you see the Accountant button in the upper left corner 
and the QBOA toolbar to the right of the Accountant button. The QBOA toolbar 
contains the same tools you see when you open a client QBO company. Note, 
though, that the sample company name appears on the Client Home page 
(click Home on the Navigation bar) as Craig’s Design and Landscaping Services, 
but the name of the company beside the Gear button on the QBOA toolbar is 
Sample Company (see Figure 11-15).
End users (your clients) also have access to this sample company, but opening it 
isn’t quite as easy as it is for you. Direct your clients to www.quickbooks.intuit.
com/online and tell them to scroll down and click the Take a Test Drive button.
Closing Companies and QBOA
You don’t close companies in QBOA the way you might using desktop QuickBooks. 
When you switch from one client QBO company to another, you automatically 
close the first client’s company.
To work in two client QBO companies simultaneously, you can use two different 
browsers, two instances of a single browser, or Chrome’s User feature (if you’re 
using Chrome). (For details on using Chrome, see Chapter 17.)
To close QBOA, click the Gear button on the QBOA toolbar and choose Sign Out (see 
Figure 11-16).

236      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Working with Wholesale Billing
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, if you are an accounting professional, you can sign 
up for the free Wholesale Pricing program and also use QBOA for free. If you both 
create a client’s company and manage the client’s subscription as part of the 
Wholesale Pricing program, Intuit sends you the bill for the client’s subscription. 
It is your responsibility to bill the client for the QBO subscription. The bill you 
receive from Intuit is a single consolidated bill for all the QBO subscriptions you 
manage. I’m going to provide some details on the Wholesale Pricing program 
here; for more information, contact Intuit.
You don’t have to enroll clients as part of the Wholesale Pricing program, but if 
you do, you might be able to get QBO for your clients at a reduced price. The 
Wholesale Pricing program is often referred to as the Wholesale Billing program; 
for this discussion, the two terms are interchangeable.
Signing up for Wholesale Billing
Accounting professionals are automatically signed up for the free Wholesale Bill-
ing program when they log in to QBOA for the first time. But, the Wholesale Billing 
program doesn’t become active until the accounting professional enters billing 
information into the Billing Profile in QBOA.
FIGURE 11-16: 
Exit from QBOA 
by signing out.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      237
To enter information in the QBOA Billing Profile, follow these steps:
1.	 From the QBOA Client list, click the Gear button located in the top right 
corner of the page.
2.	 From the drop-down Gear menu that appears, select Your Account under 
Your Company.
The Your Account page appears. In Figure 11-17, I’m working in a dummy 
QBOA company, so you don’t really see any data, but you do see what the page 
looks like.
3.	 Click the Edit Billing Information button.
4.	 Fill in all Payment Information fields.
5.	 Click Subscribe.
The Your Account page reappears, and the Wholesale billing Status will be 
active.
Each month, you receive a bill from Intuit that covers the subscription costs of the 
clients you add to your Wholesale Billing subscription.
You cannot add annually paid QBO subscriptions to the Wholesale Billing pro-
gram; the QBO subscriptions must be paid monthly.
FIGURE 11-17:

238      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Adding clients to your Wholesale  
Billing subscription
A client QBO Wholesale Billing subscription stays active for as long as you main-
tain a valid form of payment in the QuickBooks Billing Profile. Wholesale QBO 
companies do not expire.
So, just how do you go about adding a client to your Wholesale Billing subscrip-
tion? Make sure that the client appears in your Client List in QBOA; for details on 
adding a client to your client list, see Chapter 12. To add a client to your Wholesale 
Billing subscription, follow these steps:
LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
WHOLESALE BILLING PROGRAM
You don’t have to add a client to your Wholesale Billing subscription; you can still work 
with clients who pay their own QBO subscription costs. Enrolling a client into Wholesale 
Billing can save the client money on the cost of the QBO subscription but also makes 
you responsible for collecting subscription costs. And, the Wholesale Billing program 
might not be right for all QBO clients. In particular,
•	 If your client uses QuickBooks Online with Intuit Full Service Payroll (IFSP), no 
bundle for this combination of products is presently available through the 
Wholesale Billing program. QBOA is compatible with Intuit Online Payroll (IOP) and 
QuickBooks Online Payroll (QBOP), so if your QBO clients can use either of those 
products, those clients can take advantage of any price breaks you might offer for 
their QBO subscriptions.
•	 Companies created through the wholesale model have the ability to transfer 
Master Administrator rights. However, no accountant can be removed from the 
company as long as it is part of the wholesale billing program, including an accoun-
tant who is not associated with the firm housing the company in the wholesale 
­billing program.
•	 If an accounting professional creates a QBO company through QBOA, the company 
does not come with a 30-day free trial. Instead, at the time the accounting profes-
sional creates the company, he must provide a payment method to ensure uninter-
rupted service.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      239
1.	 Click Clients in the Navigation bar.
2.	 Click the gear in the top right corner of the QBOA toolbar.
3.	 From the drop-down menu, under Your Company, select Your Account.
The Your Account window appears.
4.	 In the Wholesale Clients section, click the Move Clients to Wholesale 
button in the Actions column.
The Move Clients to Wholesale Billing page appears, displaying only those 
clients not currently part of your Wholesale Billing subscription. If you find you 
cannot select a particular client to add to your Wholesale Billing subscription, 
see the sidebar “Why can’t I migrate a client?”
5.	 Click the check box beside each client you want to move and click Next.
6.	 Review your selections and, when you’re satisfied they are correct, click 
Move Clients.
A page appears that identifies clients that migrated correctly and clients whose 
migration failed.
WHY CAN’T I MIGRATE A CLIENT?
You might not be able to move a particular client to your Wholesale Billing subscription 
for a variety of reasons. For example, your client must have an active monthly billing 
subscription and must appear on your QBOA Client List.
In addition,
•	 The client QBO company’s Next Payment Date must be within 33 days of the day 
you attempt to add the company to your Wholesale Billing subscription.
•	 Clients must have an active monthly billing subscription and be listed within the 
QBOA Client List.
You can change a yearly billing subscription to a monthly billing subscription, but 
only 30 days before the next annual billing date.
•	 The QBO client’s region (US, UK, AU, or Canada) must match your QBOA region.
•	 The QBO client must be using QBO Essentials or QBO Plus. You cannot add QBO 
Simple Start companies to a Wholesale Billing subscription.

240      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Removing clients from your Wholesale  
Billing subscription
Sometimes, things just don’t work out between you and a client. If you have pre-
viously added that client’s QBO company to your Wholesale Billing subscription 
and you need to part ways, you’ll want to remove the client from your subscrip-
tion. Follow these steps:
1.	 Display the QBOA Clients page.
2.	 Click the gear in the top right corner of the QBOA toolbar.
3.	 From the drop-down menu, under Your Company, select Your Account.
The Your Account window appears.
4.	 Scroll down to the Wholesale Clients section and find the company you 
want remove from your Wholesale Billing subscription.
5.	 In the Actions column, click Remove from Wholesale.
Be aware that your Wholesale Billing subscription needs to be active to enable you 
to manage client QBO subscriptions.
Once you remove a QBO company from your Wholesale Billing subscription, that 
QBO company will no longer be eligible for the wholesale discount, and all previ-
ous discounts will be removed as well. The client QBO subscriber will be billed the 
standard rate for his subscription unless the client establishes a relationship with 
another QBOA user. In this case, the client regains the discounts starting from the 
wholesale billing activation date.
Be aware that removing a client from your Wholesale Billing subscription doesn’t 
remove the client from your Client List. And, you can’t delete QBO clients. But you 
can make them inactive, using these steps:
1.	 Click Clients in QBOA to display your Client List.
2.	 Click the name of the client you want to make inactive.
It’s very important to click the client’s name in the Name column; clicking 
anywhere else on the client’s line won’t work.
A page like the one shown in Figure 11-18 appears.
3.	 Click the down arrow beside the Edit Client button.
4.	 Click Make Inactive.
QBO asks if you’re sure you want to make the client inactive.

CHAPTER 11  Setting Up Shop in QBOA      241
5.	 Click Yes.
QBO redisplays the page shown previously in Figure 11-18, but the “(deleted)” 
appears beside the client’s name and Edit Client button becomes the Make 
Active button.
6.	 Click Clients in the Navigation bar.
The client no longer appears on the Clients page.
You can change the client’s status back to Active if you opt to display inactive cli-
ents on the Clients page. Click the gear button above the table on the Clients page 
and select the Include Inactive option (refer to Figure 11-14 to see the list). QBO 
displays all your clients, both active and inactive. To make an inactive client active 
again, repeat the steps in this section, clicking the Make Active button in Step 3.
Working with your Wholesale Billing history
You can view and, if you want, download your Wholesale Billing subscription his-
tory. Follow these steps:
1.	 Display the QBOA Clients page.
2.	 Click the gear in the top right corner of the QBOA toolbar.
3.	 From the drop-down menu, under Your Company, select Your Account.
The Your Account window appears.
4.	 Scroll down to the Wholesale Clients section.
5.	 Click View QuickBooks Billing History.
FIGURE 11-18: 
The page you use 
to make a client 
inactive.

242      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
You’ll also find the option to download your billing history to a comma-separated 
file that you can view in Excel on this page.
Stop using Wholesale Billing
So, you’ve decided that you really don’t want to participate in the Wholesale Billing 
program and manage QBO subscriptions for your clients. Although you can’t cancel 
your Wholesale Billing subscription, you can stop using it. There’s nothing stop-
ping you from working with clients who manage their own QBO subscriptions.
You can’t cancel your Wholesale Billing subscription because that action would 
also cancel the QBO subscriptions of the clients assigned to your Wholesale Billing 
subscription.
First, you need to remove all the clients currently in your subscription using the 
steps in the section “Removing clients from your Wholesale Billing subscription.”
After you have removed all companies from your Billing Profile, Intuit will no 
longer bill you because you won’t have any QBO clients in your Wholesale Billing 
subscription.

Adding Companies to 
the QBOA Client List
A
fter signing up for QBOA and logging in, the next step for the accountant 
is to populate the Client List with QBO clients, which can happen in a cou-
ple of ways. In addition, you might be helping a client set up a QBO com-
pany either by creating a new company or by importing information into the QBO 
company.
This chapter shows you how to add client companies to the Client List and how to 
import company information from the desktop QuickBooks product.

Chapter 12

244      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Adding a Client’s Company  
to the Client List
You can add a client company to the Client List in two ways:
»
» By letting your client create the company and then inviting you to access 
the company
»
» By creating a client’s company for the client
If you create a client’s company for the client and you participate in the Intuit 
Wholesale Pricing program (also called the Wholesale Billing program), you can 
opt to manage the client’s subscription for him. In this case, Intuit bills you for 
the client’s subscription and you then bill your client (see Chapter 11 for more 
information on the Wholesale Pricing program. Alternatively, the client can opt to 
manage his QBO subscription. At the time this book was written, Intuit was run-
ning specials on QBO through its main website. In addition, Intuit was offering 
discounts for QBO companies created by accountants using QBOA regardless of 
whether the accountant or the client ultimately managed the client’s QBO 
subscription.
The method you choose for creating a client company doesn’t permanently affect 
the method chosen to manage the subscription; if you belong to the Intuit Whole-
sale Pricing program, you can always change subscription management later.
If you plan to manage your client’s subscription as part of the Intuit Wholesale 
Pricing program, consider creating your client’s company for her. For details on 
signing up for the Intuit Wholesale Pricing program, contact Intuit.
Adding a company created by a client
If a client creates his own company, he retains billing responsibility for the com-
pany. Even so, your client can invite you to access the company using the Invite 
Accountant process in QBO. Your client should follow these steps:
1.	 Have the client open her company in QBO and click the Gear button 
beside the company name.
QBO displays the client’s Gear menu in QBO (see Figure 12-1).

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      245
2.	 In the Your Company column, have your client click Manage Users.
The Manage Users page appears. This page identifies the company’s Master 
Administrator, enables the client to add users to the QBO subscription 
(assuming it is not a Simple Start subscription), and also displays accounting 
firms the client has invited to access the QBO file (see Figure 12-2).

3.	 Have your client click the Invite Accountant button.
If your client hasn’t allowed pop-ups in the browser, he might see a message 
indicating that a pop-up was blocked. Have your client enable pop-ups for qbo.
intuit.com.
The window shown in Figure 12-3 appears.
4.	 Have your client provide your email address and click next.
The Finish Inviting Account page appears, explaining that, when the client clicks 
Finish, an email will be sent to the accountant that invites the accountant to 
sign in to the client’s company.
5.	 Click Finish.
The email message is sent and the Manage Users page is updated to indicate 
that the accountant has been sent an invitation.
When you receive your client’s email, it will look something like the one shown in 
Figure 12-4.
Click the Accept Invitation button, and your default browser opens to the QBOA 
login page. Fill in your QBOA email or user ID and password, and QBOA opens; the 
new client appears in your list on the Client List page. QBOA immediately displays

a page like the one shown in Figure 12-5; use the Edit Client page to identify the 
additional people in your firm who should have full access to the client’s QBO 
books. When you finish, click Save in the lower right corner of the screen.
QBO displays the Clients page and the new client appears in the list.

248      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Creating a QBO company for a client
You, the accountant, can create a new QBO company for a client instead of having 
the client create the company. If you have signed up for the Intuit Wholesale Pric-
ing program, billing responsibility for the QBO company you create becomes a 
matter of choice:
»
» You can pay for the client’s subscription and then bill the client back for the 
cost of the subscription.
»
» You can transfer billing responsibility to the client.
At the present time (this could change in the future), if a QBO client wants to 
remove an accountant, the firm managing the client’s Wholesale Billing subscrip-
tion must first remove the client from Wholesale Billing, even if the accountant 
the QBO client wants to remove is not affiliated with the firm managing the cli-
ent’s QBO subscription.
To remove a client from your Wholesale Billing subscription, follow these steps:
1.	 In QBOA, click Gear ➪   Your Account.
Your Account appears in the Your Company column of the Gear menu.
WHEN AN ACCOUNTANT CREATES 
A CLIENT’S COMPANY
If you create a company for a client through QBOA, it’s important to understand that the 
QBO company does not get a 30-day trial period. However, ProAdvisor discounts can be 
applied to companies created through a trial period offer.
Further, things have changed concerning the way the Master Administrator role is 
assigned for clients who will be part of your Wholesale Billing subscription. You used to 
be assigned the Master Administrator role as you created the client’s QBO company. 
Now, however, that restriction no longer exists. Whether the client will be part of your 
Wholesale Billing subscription or the client will be assuming billing responsibility, you 
can opt to be the Master Administrator or to assign that role to the client. For clients 
who want to be part of your Wholesale Billing subscription and assume the role of 
Master Administrator, you must be an invited accountant in the client’s company.
If you retain the Master Administrator role, you can, at some later time, transfer Master 
Admin privileges back to the client. See the section “Transferring Master Administrator 
rights back to your client.”

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      249
2.	 In the Your Accountant window, scroll down to the Wholesale clients 
section and click the company you wish to remove from wholesale 
billing.
3.	 From the Actions column drop-down, click Remove from Wholesale.
To create a company for your client, follow these steps:
1.	 Open QBOA.
2.	 Click Clients in the Navigation bar to make sure you’re displaying the 
Client List page.
3.	 From the Client List page, click the Add Client button in the upper right 
corner above the list.
The Add Client wizard begins, and you see the Client Contact Info page (see 
Figure 12-6).
4.	 Provide a name for the new company.
5.	 Optionally, supply other information on this screen.
6.	 Click Next.
QBOA displays the QuickBooks Products page of the Add Client wizard, shown 
in Figure 12-7.
7.	 Click the QuickBooks Products list box to open the list and display the 
available QBO products.
FIGURE 12-6:

8.	Select a QBO product for the client.
You can choose Essentials, Essentials with Payroll, Essentials with Full Service 
Payroll, Plus, Plus with Payroll, or Plus with Full Service Payroll.
After you select a product, the Billing Choices list box appears.
9.	Click the Billing Choices list box and select who will pay, who will be 
Master Administrator; and provide the Master Administrator’s e-mail 
address.
10.	Click Next.
QBOA displays the last screen of the wizard, where you select the members of 
your team who should have full administrative permissions when accessing 
the books of the client you’re adding.
You can change access privileges later.
11.	Click Save.
QBOA does some work and creates the company, which appears in the list of 
companies on the Client List page (see Figure 12-8).
Transferring Master Administrator  
rights back to your client
As you see in the preceding section, when you create a company for a client, you can 
assign yourself as the Master Administrator; in this case, QBOA also assigns you as 
the Accountant user for the company. But you can transfer the Master Administrator 
role back to your client; this process won’t affect your status as the Accountant user.
FIGURE 12-7:

Products page of 
the Add Client 
screen.

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      251
The process of transferring the Master Administrator role to a client involves first 
inviting the client to become a Company Administrator. After the client accepts 
the invitation to become a Company Administrator, you can transfer the Master 
Administrator role to the client — again, using an invitation process.
Inviting the client to become  
a company ­administrator
As the first part of the process, create a Company Administrator for the new 
­company. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open the client company using the Go to Client’s QuickBooks list on the 
QBOA toolbar.
The first time you open a client QBO company, the Welcome to QuickBooks 
wizard walks you through some basic setup steps, where you fill in the client’s 
contact information, industry, and legal organization as well as some additional 
basic information, and QBO creates a Chart of Accounts for you.
2.	 Click the Gear button on the QBOA toolbar and choose Manage Users.
QBO displays the Manage Users page, which also contains the list of accoun-
tant users in the Accounting Firms section. In Figure 12-9, note that the 
accountant user in the Accounting Firms section at the bottom of the page and 
the Master Administrator in the Manage Users section at the top of the page 
belong to the same QBOA user.
FIGURE 12-8: 
The new 
company appears 
on the Client 
List page.

252      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
3.	 Click New in the Manage Users section to add a new Company 
Administrator user.

5.	 On the Enter User’s Email Address page, shown in Figure 12-11, provide 
the client’s email address (and optionally, name) and click Next.
The Finish Adding User page appears and explains that QBO will send an email 
invitation to the user to sign in to the company. The email explains that he 
must create a QBO user ID unless he already has one. In most cases, if you set 
up a company for a client, the client doesn’t yet have a QBO login.
6.	 Click Finish.
The new user appears on the Manage Users page in Pending status (see 
Figure 12-12).
When the client receives the email invitation to become the Company Administra-
tor, the invitation looks something like the one shown in Figure 12-13.
When the client clicks the Accept Invitation button in the email to accept the invi-
tation, a QBO login screen appears using the qbo.intuit.com web address. Typi-
cally, the client doesn’t have a QBO login yet and so goes through the process of 
creating a new one; when he finishes, he’s logged in to QBO and receives a mes-
sage indicating that he successfully accepted the invitation.

Transferring the Master Administrator  
role to the client
In the meantime, you, the QBOA user, can use QBOA to open the client’s QBO com-
pany. On the Manage Users page, you can see that the status of the client’s Com-
pany Administrator role is no longer Pending, but you are still listed as the Master 
Administrator (see Figure 12-14).
Now that you’ve established a Company Administrator for the client company, 
you can follow these steps to transfer the Master Administrator role to the client:

256      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
QBOA sends an email invitation to your client to become the Master Administra-
tor; the email looks very much like the one shown in Figure 12-16, and the client 
can accept or decline. Assuming the client accepts, he’s prompted to log in to 
QBO. Once he does, he sees a page that explains that the Master Admin role has 
been successfully transferred to him and that an email explaining such has been 
sent to the former Master Administrator — and that’s you.
If you once again use QBOA to open the client’s company and view the Manage 
Users page, you’ll notice that you no longer appear in the Manage Users section 
and your client is the Master Administrator for the company (see Figure 12-17).

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      257
Importing Desktop QuickBooks 
Information
If you’ve been using QuickBooks for Windows Pro or Premier 2008 or later in the 
United States and Canada, and your QBO subscription is less than 60 days old, you 
can import your company’s information into a QBO company. You also can help 
your clients import their desktop QuickBooks companies into QBO companies.
Users in countries other than the U.S. and Canada might be able to import desktop 
QuickBooks information into QBO with the help of an outside service; contact 
Intuit for more information. Users of QuickBooks for Windows 2007 and earlier, 
QuickBooks for the Mac, and QuickBooks Enterprise should contact Intuit for 
details on importing their data into QBO.
Assuming that you meet the criteria previously outlined, read on.
General conversion considerations
Before you dive into converting your data, stack the odds in your favor by doing 
some homework. First, examine your desktop QuickBooks data file to make sure 
that it will convert. In your desktop product, open your company and press F2 to 
display the Product Information dialog box shown in Figure 12-18. In particular, 
take note of the number of targets listed. If your data file’s number of targets falls 
below 350,000, you can proceed.
If your data file’s number of targets exceeds 350,000, condense your data. If your 
company’s targets still exceed 350,000, consider importing lists only, as described 
in Chapter 4.
Next, using the U.S. version of the desktop QuickBooks product, verify your data 
file and then condense it so that it includes approximately one year’s data. Con-
densing reduces the size of your data file and removes inactive list entries, and 
smaller data files tend to convert better. On the File menu, choose Utilities ➪   Con-
dense Data.
If you suspect the desktop company data isn’t in good shape — for example, you 
get errors while verifying or condensing — you can try rebuilding the data and 
then rerunning the Condense Data function. If you still get errors, consider 
importing lists only as described in Chapter 4.

258      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
You should plan to keep your desktop data file around, if for no other reason than 
to refer to it for historical data as needed. Many people opt to run desktop Quick-
Books and QBO simultaneously for a month or two to make sure QBO is perform-
ing as they expect.
Importing a desktop QuickBooks company
When you convert a QuickBooks desktop company to QBO, some data fully con-
verts, some partially converts, and some doesn’t convert at all. In addition, QBO 
contains comparable alternatives for some desktop QuickBooks features and 
doesn’t contain alternatives for others.
You can import any QuickBooks for Windows company using QuickBooks U.S., 
including companies with the multicurrency feature turned on, as long as the 
company meets the target limitation of 350,000. You also can import QuickBooks 
Desktop companies using U.K. and Canadian versions, again including companies 
that have multicurrency turned on.
In general, the following types of files won’t convert and therefore can’t be imported:
»
» You cannot import QuickBooks desktop data into any QBO company that was 
created more than 60 days ago, except for accountant company files. You can 
import QuickBooks desktop companies into a QBOA company within 1,060 
days of creating the QBOA account.
FIGURE 12-18:

number of 
targets in your

company.

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      259
When I say “accountant company files,” I’m talking about importing a 
QuickBooks desktop company file into the Your Books company available 
in QBOA.
»
» You cannot import a QuickBooks desktop company into QBO subscriptions 
using international versions of QBO other than U.K. and Canadian.
»
» You cannot import non-Intuit accounting software company files. If you need 
to import company data from a non-Intuit product, you need to work with 
Intuit’s full-service team.
»
» You cannot directly import accounting data stored in spreadsheet files. You 
can import these via a third-party app called Transaction Pro Importer, 
available at http://appcenter.intuit.com/transactionproimporter.
In addition, Appendix B describes the limitations you’ll encounter if you import a 
desktop QuickBooks company. I suggest you review Appendix B so that you know 
what to expect. After you’ve reviewed the general considerations in the preceding 
section and the limitations for importing found Appendix  B, you’re ready to 
import your desktop QuickBooks company into QBO.
It’s important to understand that, even if your company data meets the criteria 
above, some data still won’t convert when you import:
»
» Reconciliation reports: Save your reconciliation reports in QuickBooks Desktop 
to access them later. In QBO, continue reconciling where you left off. See 
Chapter 8 and take a peek at Intuit’s Reconcile Your Accounts tutorial at 
http://intuitaccountants.com/reconcilereports.
»
» Recurring credit card charges: At your Merchant Center, cancel each existing 
automatic credit card recurring charge and re-create it in QBO as a recurring 
sales receipt.
All other recurring transactions convert and import.
»
» Reports: Find a similar report in QBO and customize it to your preference. See 
Chapter 10 and Intuit’s Customize Reports and Email tutorial at http://
intuitaccountants.com/customreport. In addition, you can check out 
www.Apps.com for a list of reporting apps that can help your business.
»
» Audit trail: Your desktop audit trail won’t come over, but all changes going 
forward will be captured in the Audit Log within QBO.
»
» Non-posting transactions or accounts don’t convert except for estimates and 
purchase orders.

260      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Updating your edition of QuickBooks
The first step you should take in the process of importing data from a desktop 
QuickBooks company is to make sure that your edition of desktop QuickBooks is 
up to date. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open the desktop edition of QuickBooks.
2.	 Choose Help ➪   Update QuickBooks.
The Update QuickBooks window appears.
3.	 Click the Update Now tab (see Figure 12-19) and select all updates.
PAYROLL AND DATA CONVERSION
QBO supports Intuit Online Payroll and QuickBooks Online Payroll (QBOP) to manage 
payroll. In some cases, your QuickBooks desktop payroll data will automatically update 
your year-to-date totals. But, if that data doesn’t migrate, and you intend to use QBOP, 
you will need to enter payroll totals as described in Chapter 9. Don’t set up QuickBooks 
Online Payroll until after you convert your desktop data.
FIGURE 12-19: 
Select all  
update areas.

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      261
4.	 Click Get Updates.
QuickBooks goes through the process of downloading updates.
5.	 Once the updating process finishes, click Close.
Next, exit from QuickBooks and restart it; if QuickBooks downloaded updates, it 
will prompt you to allow the updates to be installed; make sure you install the 
updates.
Now, check the following in the desktop QuickBooks product to help you avoid 
errors during the export/import process:
»
» Make sure you’re working in Single User mode: Click the File menu and make 
sure you see the Switch to Multi-user Mode command. Don’t click it; just make 
sure you see it, because its availability lets you know you’re working in Single 
User mode.
»
» To eliminate errors that might be introduced by working over a network, 
move the company file to your local drive.
Okay. You’re ready to start the process of exporting a desktop QuickBooks com-
pany data and then importing it into a QBO company.
You can import a desktop QuickBooks company only during the first 60 days of a 
subscription with one exception: You can import your own data into the free com-
pany that comes with QBOA for up to 1,060 days.
Transferring data from a desktop  
company into QBO
During the transfer process, you’re given the option to overwrite an existing QBO 
company or create a new one. In the steps that follow, I set up an empty QBO 
company before I started and allowed the process to overwrite it. Follow these 
steps to transfer data from a desktop QuickBooks company into a QBO company:
1.	 In desktop QuickBooks, choose Company ➪   Export Company File to 
QuickBooks Online.
QuickBooks Enterprise users should press Ctrl+1 to open the Product 
Information window and then press Ctrl+B+Q. Then, click OK to close the 
Product Information window.
A wizard starts to walk you through the process of exporting the data.

262      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
2.	 Sign in to your QBO account.
If you don’t have a QBO account yet, you can click Create a New Account and 
walk through the process of supplying a user ID — typically an email 
address — and a password.
Because you’re not signing in from your browser, you might be prompted to 
authenticate yourself; in this case, Intuit sends a code to your email address 
and you must check email to be able to supply the code onscreen.
3.	 Select the appropriate choice for turning on inventory, and then click 
Continue.
If you opt to turn on inventory, select the date you want to use to calculate 
inventory value using the FIFO method. Intuit recommends that you use the 
first day following your company’s last tax filing period.
Only QBO Plus supports inventory. If you opt to import inventory, your 
accounting method will change to FIFO and you will need to file Form 3115 
with the IRS. If QBO identifies any errors with inventory during the importing 
process, the process will fail and you’ll receive an email with instructions on 
how to fix the items causing the problem. Also be aware that, due to recalcula-
tions to FIFO, your Accrual Basis reports and Cash Basis reports will not match. 
QuickBooks will flag any errors with inventory if they appear during import.
4.	 Select the appropriate choice for the location of your QuickBooks 
company data (see Figure 12-20).
I selected an empty company I created using the steps found earlier in this 
chapter in the section “Creating a QBO company for a client.”
FIGURE 12-20: 
Select whether 
you want to 
overwrite an 
existing QBO 
company or 
create a new one 
for your desktop 
QuickBooks 
company data.

CHAPTER 12  Adding Companies to the QBOA Client List      263
5.	 Click Continue.
QBO makes a copy of your desktop QuickBooks company file and imports it 
into your QBO company. A message appears, letting you know that you’ll 
receive an email when the process finishes (see Figure 12-21).
6.	 Click OK, Got It.
7.	 You can close the desktop QuickBooks product.
When the email arrives, the message will resemble the one shown in Figure 12-22. 
You can click the Continue to Account Setup button to log in to the QBO company, 
or you can use the QBO interface.
If you click the Continue to Account Setup button in the email, a new browser tab 
appears displaying the QBO sign in page.
After converting . . .
After conversion finishes, you need to double-check things to make sure your data 
looks the way you expected. Check your email; you’ll find that the acknowledge-
ment you received confirming that the data was imported contains an attached 
Import Summary report — an Excel file that helps you determine what informa-
tion in the QuickBooks desktop company didn’t make it to the QBO company.
FIGURE 12-21: 
This message 
appears after you 
finish your part of 
the export/import 
process.

264      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
If your client does the conversion and you are the accountant user for the QBO 
account, you’ll receive the report and your client won’t unless you send it to him.
In addition to reviewing the Import Summary report, I suggest you run and com-
pare the Profit & Loss report, the Balance Sheet, Accounts Receivable, Accounts 
Payable, sales tax liability, and, if appropriate, payroll liability reports for both the 
desktop QuickBooks company and the QBO company. Be sure you run these reports 
using the Accrual basis with the dates set to All. Use the Accrual basis because 
reports run in both products using the Cash basis might not match.
Need a do-over? During the first 60 days of a subscription, you get a “do-over” on 
importing data into a QBO company, which can be useful if things don’t import as 
you expect. Just go through the process of importing again.
And, here’s a checklist of things you probably need to do to make the imported 
QBO company ready for use:
»
» Set up company users.
»
» Set up sales tax items.
»
» Set up payroll, either through Intuit Online Payroll or QBOP.
»
» Reconcile accounts as needed.
»
» Review lists and make appropriate entries inactive as necessary.
»
» Set up recurring transactions to replace desktop QuickBooks memorized 
transactions.

» Set up a closing date password.
Switching between Client QBO Companies
As you’ve worked through Chapters 11 and 12, you might have noticed that client 
QBO companies don’t, by default, open in a separate tab in your browser. So, what 
do you do when you want to stop working in one client’s books and start working 
in another client’s books?
Well, you can click the Accountant button on the QBOA toolbar at any time to 
redisplay the QBOA interface and your list of clients. From there, you can click the 
QuickBooks logo beside any client’s name to open that client QBO company.
WANT TO “UNDO” AN IMPORT?
Suppose you’re not happy with the results of importing and you decide that you simply 
want to enter data manually into your company. You can clear the data from the QBO 
company by purging it. Open the company and click Home so that you’re viewing the 
QBO company home page.
In the browser address bar, change the address to https://qbo.intuit.com/app/
purgecompany and press Enter or refresh the page. A page appears that describes 
what will be deleted and asks if you’re sure. Type yes in the lower right corner and click 
OK, and QBO purges the data from your company. If you change your mind and don’t 
want to purge, click Cancel in the lower right corner.
You cannot purge data from the Your Books company. But you can clear the data from 
the Your Books company if you import a company from QuickBooks Desktop that con-
tains no data. Intuit even provides an empty company file that you can use; visit 
https://community.intuit.com/articles/1308208-deleting-all-the-data- 
within-a-qbo-company to read the article and download the empty company.

266      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
But you really don’t need to take two steps to switch between client QBO compa-
nies; instead, take advantage of the Go to Client’s QuickBooks list box on the QBOA 
toolbar.
When you’re working in a client QBO company, the name of that company appears 
in the Go to Client’s QuickBooks list box; if you click the company name, a list of 
all your client QBO companies appears. Just click the name of the company you 
want to open. No need to worry about saving work; QBO automatically saves as 
you work.

Exploring a Client’s 
Company from QBOA
A
 client’s QBO company looks a little different when viewed using QBOA. This 
chapter explores the interface you see when you open a client QBO com-
pany from QBOA. It also covers some facets of a client QBO company you 
might want to review for your client to make sure things flow smoothly for both 
of you.
Opening a Client’s Company
You can open a client’s company in QBOA from the Client List page; on the client’s 
line in the list, click the QuickBooks logo (the circle with the letters q and b in it). 
Alternatively, you can use the Go to Client’s QuickBooks list on the QBOA toolbar, 
which remains visible at all times, making it easy for you to switch from one client 
QBO company to another. Simply open the list and select the name of the company 
you want to open (see Figure 13-1).
You don’t need to take any special action to close a client QBO company; you can 
simply open another client QBO company, or you can sign out of QBOA from the 
Gear menu on the QBOA toolbar.
Chapter 13

268      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
To access two different companies simultaneously, you can’t just open another 
browser tab and sign in to QBOA. Instead, you need to use separate browsers. Or, 
if you’re using Chrome, you can sign into Chrome as a different user. See ­Chapter 17 
for details on Chrome users.
Reviewing a Client QBO Company
You’ll probably want to review the company setup information for client QBO 
companies to make sure that things are set up properly for your client. In particu-
lar, you’ll want to review the settings, the Chart of Accounts, and the lists of client 
QBO companies.
The first time you open a client QBO company that you have created, a wizard 
walks you through establishing basic setup information. But you can review and 
change that information at any time.
Examining company setup information
You review company setup information to make sure that the client QBO company 
uses the correct accounting method, employer EIN, and legal business organiza-
tion. To review company settings, follow these steps:
FIGURE 13-1: 
You can click the 
QuickBooks logo 
or use the list on 
the QBOA toolbar 
to open a client’s 
QBO company.

CHAPTER 13  Exploring a Client’s Company from QBOA      269
1.	 Open the client QBO company you want to review.
You can click the QuickBooks logo on the Client List page of QBOA, or you can 
use the list of clients in the QBOA toolbar.
2.	 Click the Gear button on the right side of the QBOA toolbar to display the 
Gear menu (see Figure 13-2).
3.	 From the Your Company group on the left side of the Gear menu, click 
Account and Settings.
The Company tab (selected on the left side of the Account and Settings dialog 
box) appears (see Figure 13-3).
4.	 Review the settings.
In particular, set or correct the Company Name, Legal Name, and Employer ID 
(EIN).
To make changes, click any setting. QBO makes the setting options available; 
make your changes and click Save.
5.	 Click Advanced on the left side of the Account and Settings dialog box.
The settings on the Advanced page of the Account and Settings dialog box 
appear (see Figure 13-4).
FIGURE 13-2: 
The Gear menu.

270      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
6.	 Review the settings.
In particular, set or correct the following:
•	 The settings in the Accounting section, which include fiscal and tax year 
information as well as the QBO company’s accounting method,
•	 In the Company Type section, the tax form setting,
•	 The settings in the Chart of Accounts section,
•	 The settings in the Other Preferences section, which isn’t shown in 
Figure 13-4 but includes displaying warnings when duplicate check 
numbers and bill numbers are used.

CHAPTER 13  Exploring a Client’s Company from QBOA      271
7.	 Click Done to save your changes.
QBO displays a message at the top of the screen indicating that your changes 
were saved.
Taking a look at the Chart of Accounts
In addition to checking company settings, you should review your client’s Chart of 
Accounts to make sure it looks the way you want. In the client QBO company, click 
the Accountant Tools button and choose Chart of Accounts to display the Chart of 
Accounts page shown in Figure 13-5.
You also can open the Chart of Accounts from the Navigation bar (under Transac-
tions) and from Gear menu on the QBOA toolbar. All roads lead to Rome.
If you chose to enable the option to use account numbers while you were review-
ing company settings (refer to Figure 13-4), the Chart of Accounts page displays a 
column for account numbers at the left edge of the Chart of Accounts page and the 
Batch Edit button in the upper right corner. You’ll use the Batch Edit button to add 
account numbers, as described later in this chapter in the section “Adding account 
numbers.”
FIGURE 13-5: 
From the Chart of 
Accounts page, 
you can add and 
edit accounts.

272      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Editing or adding accounts
You might need to edit an account to change an account’s Category Type or its 
name, and you use the Account window to make the change.
If you decide to add account numbers to the Chart of Accounts, you can add an 
account number in the Account window, but there’s a much easier way, which I’ll 
show you in the next section, “Adding account numbers.”
To display the Account window, click the down arrow in the Action column at 
the  right side of the account and, from the menu that appears, click Edit (see 
Figure 13-6).
Or, if you need to create a new account, click the New button above the list. The 
window you see when creating a new account looks just like the one you see when 
you edit an existing account.
If you double-click an Asset, Liability, or Equity account, QBO displays the 
account’s register (except Retained Earnings, which displays a report). If you 
double-click an Income or Expense account, QBO displays a QuickReport for the 
account. You also can click the Register and Report links in the Action column to 
display a register or a report.
FIGURE 13-6: 
To edit an 
account, use the 
down arrow in 
the Action 
column.

CHAPTER 13  Exploring a Client’s Company from QBOA      273
Adding account numbers
I promised I’d show you an easy way to add account numbers to a QBO company 
Chart of Accounts. First, make sure you enable the setting on the Advanced tab of 
the Settings dialog box (in the Chart of Accounts section) shown previously in 
Figure 13-4.
Then, on the Chart of Accounts page, click the Batch Edit button (the one that 
looks like a pencil on the right side of the table above the table headings) to dis-
play the page shown in Figure 13-7.
Type account numbers in the Number column. Save buttons appear at the top- 
and bottom-right corners of the page; click either button after you finish entering 
the account numbers.
Because a QBOA session times out by default after 60 minutes of non-use, you 
might want to save periodically as you enter account numbers.
After you enter account numbers, you can sort the Chart of Accounts in account 
number order by clicking Number in the column headings on the Chart of Accounts 
page.
Reviewing list information
You also can review list information. Using the links in the Navigation bar, you  
can view overview information about customers, vendors, and employees. In 
­Figure 13-8, you see the Customers page.
FIGURE 13-7: 
Use this page to 
set up account 
numbers for the 
Chart of 
Accounts.

274      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
On any of these pages, you can use the bar at the top of the page to filter the list 
to view a particular subset of the list. For example, you can filter the list of 
­customers on the Customers page to view only those customers with overdue 
invoices. And you can use the Batch Actions button (just below the filter bar) to 
perform, well, batch actions, such as emailing a batch of customers. If your list is 
long, use the text box beside the Batch Actions button to search for a particular list 
entry. You also can sort the list by name or by open balance; just click the appro-
priate heading below the Batch Actions button.
You can import names into a people list. For more information, see Chapter 4.
To review other lists, click the Gear button in the QBOA toolbar. In the Lists ­section 
of the Gear menu that appears, you can opt to view any of three common lists (the 
Products and Services list, the Recurring Transactions list, or the Attachments 
list). Or, you can click All Lists at the top of the Lists section to display the Lists 
page shown in Figure 13-9, which you can use to navigate to any list other than a 
people-oriented list.
For more extensive details on working with lists, see Chapter 4.
Exporting and importing bank feed rules
When your client takes advantage of bank feeds and downloads transactions from 
the bank to his QBO company, you can help ensure that the transactions post 
properly. In many cases, the rules used by one client can apply to another, so, 
rather than re-creating rules, export them from one client and import them to 
another.
FIGURE 13-8: 
The Customers 
page.

CHAPTER 13  Exploring a Client’s Company from QBOA      275
When you export rules, QBO exports all the rules in the client’s company. You can 
selectively import rules.
To export rules from a client company, open that company and follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Transactions ➪ Banking.
2.	 On the Bank and Credit Cards page, click the down arrow beside the 
Update button in the upper right corner of the page.
3.	 Click Manage Rules.
QBO displays the Rules page (see Figure 13-10).
4.	 Click the down arrow beside the New Rule button and choose Export 
Rules.
QBO creates an Excel file containing the rules and stores it in your Downloads 
folder. The name of the file includes the name of the client whose rules you 
exported and the words, “Bank_Feed_Rules.”
QBO displays the directions for what you do next — which I outline in the 
following steps. Click Close in the QBO message.
5.	 Switch to the company to which you want to import these rules.
6.	 Repeat Steps 1 to 4 above; in Step 4, choose Import Rules.
QBO starts a wizard that helps you import the rules.

open any list 
other than the

276      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
7.	On the first Import Rules wizard screen, select the file you created in 
Step 4 and click Next.
8.	On the second wizard screen, select the rules you want to import and 
click Next.
9.	On the third wizard screen, you have the option to select categories for 
the rules that match the Chart of Accounts of the client to which you are 
importing the rules. Make any changes and, when you finish, click 
Import.
QBO tells you how many rules imported successfully.
10.	Click Finish.
QBO redisplays the Rules page for the client you opened in Step 5, where you 
can verify that the rules you wanted to import appear.
For more detail on working with rules, see Chapter 8.

Working in a Client’s 
Company
Y
ou work in a client’s QBO company in much the same way your client does; 
see Chapters 4 to 10 for detailed information. In this chapter, I focus on 
ways you can navigate easily, search for and review transactions, and com-
municate with clients.
Making Navigation Easy
Much of mouse navigation is obvious; click here and click there. But you can use a 
few not-so-obvious tricks to navigate easily, including some keyboard shortcuts. 
Some common navigation techniques are specific to Chrome; see Chapters 17 and 
18 for more information.
Using keyboard shortcuts
Hidden away in QBO companies are keyboard shortcuts that you might want to 
use. I show them here in Figure 14-1, and you also can find them on this book’s 
cheat sheet.
Chapter 14

278      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
To get this cheat sheet, simply go to www.dummies.com and search for “Quick-
Books Online For Dummies Cheat Sheet” in the Search box.
To view these shortcuts (and the current client QBO Company ID), press and hold 
Ctrl+Alt and then press the forward slash (/) key. Mac users, substitute Option for 
Alt here and in the next paragraph. If you press Ctrl+Alt+/ without opening a client 
QBO company, the Company ID you see is your own.
To use any of these shortcuts, press and hold Ctrl+Alt and then press the appro-
priate key to perform its associated action. For example, to open the Invoice 
­window, press Ctrl+Alt+I.
Opening multiple windows
Many times, accountants want to work with multiple windows, and you can do 
that in QBO. Within the same QBO company, you can duplicate a browser tab using 
the New Window command on the Accountant Tools menu on the QBOA toolbar 
(see Figure 14-2). You can read more about the other commands on the Accoun-
tant Tools menu in Chapter 15.
If you’re using Chrome, you also can duplicate a browser tab by right-clicking the 
tab and choosing Duplicate. In Firefox, you can duplicate a browser tab by clicking 
in the address bar and pressing Alt+Enter.
When you click the New Window command, QBO opens a new browser tab and 
displays the same information that appears in the original browser tab. But, from 
that point, you can display different information for the same company in each 
browser tab. And, if you’re working in Chrome on multiple monitors, you can split 
FIGURE 14-1: 
Keyboard 
shortcuts you can 
use while working 
in a client QBO 
company.

CHAPTER 14  Working in a Client’s Company      279
the tabs onto different monitors. Drag the tab you want to place on a different 
monitor in a downward direction, and it splits away from the browser. You can 
immediately drag it to another monitor, or you can release the mouse button, in 
which case a second instance of Chrome appears. You can then drag either instance 
to a different monitor.
The same technique works in Firefox; drag a Firefox tab downward and release the 
mouse button. The tab splits away and appears in a second instance of Firefox. You 
can then drag either instance to a different monitor.
Working in two companies simultaneously
Suppose that you’re done working with one client and want to open a different 
client. As described in Chapter 12, you can click the Go to Client’s QuickBooks but-
ton on the QBOA toolbar and select a new client. Or, you can click the Accountant 
button in the upper left corner of the QBOA interface to redisplay the Client List 
page and then click the QuickBooks icon for the client QBO company you now want 
to open. Either way, QBOA displays the information for the newly selected client.
That brings up the question, “How do I work in two different companies simulta-
neously?” Well, you can open a different browser, sign in to QBOA, and open a 
second client QBO company. For example, if you’re working in Chrome, you could 
open Firefox using the same QBOA login information. You can then open two dif-
ferent companies, as I did in Figure 14-3.
FIGURE 14-2: 
Use the New 
Window 
command while 
working in a QBO 
company to 
duplicate the 
window you’re 
viewing.

280      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
If you’re working in Chrome, you also can take advantage of Chrome users and 
open Chrome as a different user. You’d have, effectively, two instances of Chrome 
running simultaneously. See Chapter 17 for more information on Chrome users.
Examining Available Transaction Types
In Chapters 5 to 9, I covered transactions in some detail, so I’m not going to repeat 
that information here. But you can see the available transactions by opening a cli-
ent QBO company and then clicking the Create menu (the plus sign) shown in 
Figure 14-4. Available transactions are organized on the menu by the type of peo-
ple to which they pertain. And the Create menu contains an “Other” category for 
transactions that don’t pertain to particular types of people  — like bank 
deposits.
Before you open the Create menu, its button appears as a plus sign (+), but after 
you open it, as I did in Figure 14-4, the button changes to an X.
If you want to view only the more commonly used transactions, click the Show 
Less link in the lower right corner of the Create menu. The link changes to the 
Show More link so that you can redisplay all types of transactions.
FIGURE 14-3: 
To work in two 
companies at the 
same time, you 
can use two 
browsers.

CHAPTER 14  Working in a Client’s Company      281
Searching for Transactions
More often than not, you’ll be searching for transactions in a client QBO company 
rather than creating them. You can search for transactions using the Search  
box on the QBOA toolbar at the top of the client QBO company window (see  
Figure 14-5). When you click in the Search box, QBO displays a list of recent trans-
actions and reports.
FIGURE 14-4: 
The transactions 
you can create 
while working in a 
QBO company.
FIGURE 14-5: 
Type any phrase 
you want to use 
as a search filter 
or click Advanced 
Search at the 
bottom of the 
Search list.

282      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
If you see the result you want, you can click it to open it in the appropriate win-
dow. If you don’t see the result you want, you have a couple of options.
First, you can type in the Search box, and QBO responds with sample results. If 
you still don’t see the result you want, try your second option: Click Advanced 
Search in the lower right corner of the menu, and QBO displays the Search page 
(see Figure 14-6).
You can limit the search to a particular transaction type, choose to search for any 
of several types of data, and specify whether the search should contain, not con-
tain, be equal to, or not be equal to the search criteria.
From any transaction window, you can view recent transactions of that type by 
clicking the button that appears in the transaction’s title bar, immediately to the 
left of the name of the transaction type. The button image looks a bit like a clock.
Communicating with a Client
Using QBO and QBOA tools, you can communicate with clients via email concern-
ing a particular transaction.
You also can send an email from QBOA without opening your email client. In the 
Client List, click the client’s name. On the page that appears, click the client’s 
email address. Your email program opens and displays the window where you type 
a new email message; the message is already addressed to your client.
FIGURE 14-6: 
Set criteria for a 
more specifically 
defined search.

CHAPTER 14  Working in a Client’s Company      283
Using the Client Collaborator tool
QBO and QBOA contain a tool called the Client Collaborator that you can use to 
communicate with your client about existing transactions. The Client Collaborator 
is a two-way tool; you or your client can send a message, and the message recipi-
ent can answer. Think of the Client Collaborator as a way to send a text message 
using QBOA or QBO.
You can communicate about certain types of transactions but not others. In gen-
eral, you can communicate about posting transactions such as invoices, bills, pay-
ments to customers, checks to vendors, and credit card transactions. But you 
won’t find the Conversation button referred to in this section in windows for cash 
and non-posting transactions such as sales receipts, expense transactions, bill-
able expenses, delayed charges, credit memos, and paycheck and payroll-related 
windows.
Although either you or your client can initiate messaging, I’ll start from the QBOA 
interface and post a message to a client. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open the client company.
2.	 Open the transaction you question.
For this example, I opened a bill.
3.	 In the upper right corner of the transaction window, click the 
Conversation button (see Figure 14-7).
QBOA displays the bottom of the transaction window, which contains an 
Activities section.
FIGURE 14-7: 
Creating a 
message to a 
client.

284      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
The Activities section doesn’t appear while you’re creating a new transaction; it 
appears only on previously created transactions.
4.	 In the Activities section, click the drop-down list to select a message 
recipient.
5.	 Type your message.
6.	 Click Post.
QBOA sends an email message to the recipient, and the posted message 
appears at the bottom of the Activities section, along with the date and time 
the message was posted (see Figure 14-8).
When the message recipient opens the email, a message like the one shown in 
Figure 14-9 appears, explaining that a message concerning a particular transac-
tion has been posted in the recipient’s QBO company.
To view the message and respond, the recipient can click the link in the message; 
the link initially displays the QBO sign-in page so that the client can sign in to his 
company. If your client initiates the conversation, the QBOA sign-in page appears.
Once the client signs in, the Conversation button appears in the upper right corner 
of the QBO company Home page, beside the Gear button (see Figure 14-10). The 
Conversation button contains the number 1, indicating that the client has one 
message, and the client can click the Conversation button to view the message.
FIGURE 14-8: 
Posted messages 
appear below the 
Activities section.

CHAPTER 14  Working in a Client’s Company      285
If the client then clicks the message, the transaction from which the message 
originated opens. The client can then scroll to the bottom of the message, and, in 
the Activities area shown earlier in Figure 14-7, respond to the message by select-
ing a recipient, typing a message, and posting it. The Client Collaborator contin-
ues the process, sending an email notification of a message to the recipient, who 
clicks the link in the message to open the company and read and respond. The 
message conversation continues to appear at the bottom of the transaction.

Using Accountant Tools
A
 
ccountant tools are available to anybody who opens a client QBO company 
from QBOA.
You can become a user in a QBO company in one of two ways:
»
» As described in Chapter 12, your client can invite you to be the Accountant 
user on his account. But each QBO company can have only two 
Accountant users.
»
» As described in Chapter 11, the Master Administrator of the QBOA account 
can set up users. Any user established by the Master Administrator can log in 
to QBOA, open any client QBO company for which the user has privileges, and 
use the tools found on the Accountant Tools menu that I describe in this 
chapter.
In addition to the tools found on the Accountant Tools menu, this chapter covers 
reporting and paying sales tax — an activity that accountants often perform for 
their clients, so I’ll start off with that information.
Chapter 15

288      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Reporting and Paying Sales Taxes
You or your client can manage and pay sales tax. Open any client QBO company 
and, in the Navigation bar on the left, click Sales Taxes to display the Sales Tax 
Center shown in Figure 15-1.
If the client QBO company uses QBO payroll (QBOP), you might need to click Taxes 
before you can click Sales Tax in the Navigation bar.
You can click the View Report button to display the Sales Tax Liability Report, and 
on the right side of the Sales Tax Center page, in the Related Tasks box, you’ll find 
a link to view a list of taxable customers. Also in the Related Tasks box, you’ll find 
links you can use to edit sales tax settings and add or edit tax rates and agencies.
You can click Record Tax Payment to pay sales tax; when you do, QBO displays the 
Record Sales Tax Payment dialog box shown in Figure 15-2.
QBO calculates the amount due to a sales tax agency, and you can confirm the 
amount or adjust it. Notice that the payment is made to the sales tax agency. Be 
aware that QBO doesn’t treat the agency as a vendor. You won’t see the sales tax 
agency on the Vendor List page, and you can’t use the Check window or the Pay 
Bills window to pay a sales tax agency. In this way, QBO helps avoid applying sales 
tax payments incorrectly.
FIGURE 15-1: 
Use the Sales Tax 
Center to manage 
and pay sales tax.

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      289
Facilitating Accountant Activities
Accountants often need to reclassify transactions, examine voided and deleted 
transactions, write off invoices, and perform other activities. QBOA contains tools 
to make performing these activities easy.
To view and use the tools QBOA makes available to accountants, open any client 
QBO company. Then, on the QBOA toolbar, click the Accountant Tools button (the 
one that contains the icon that looks like a suitcase). QBOA displays the Accoun-
tant Tools menu, shown in Figure 15-3.
Understanding the Trial Balance page
You use the Trial Balance tool to display the Trial Balance page. The page you see ini-
tially presents a working trial balance like the ones shown in Figures 15-4 and 15-5.
»
» At the top of the page, you see the Activity Timeline, which shows client 
and accountant activities that impact the balances shown on the page.
»
» The values in the Unadjusted Balance column are locked on the Trial 
Balance page to protect the integrity of the data in the Trial Balance 
workspace. If you scroll to the right on the page (refer to Figure 15-5), you’ll find 
columns that enable to you create adjusting entries as journal entries. As you 
move your mouse over the boxes in the Debit or Credit columns under the 
Adjusting Entries column, a plus sign (+) appears; click it and QBOA opens a journal 
entry window, where you can record the adjusting entry. Once you save the entry, 
QBOA redisplays the Trial Balance page and your adjustment appears; in addition, 
QBOA changes the Adjusted Balance column to reflect your adjustment.
FIGURE 15-2: 
Use this dialog 
box to record a 
sales tax 
payment.

»
» You can click the dollar value in the Adjusted Balance column to view a 
report of all transactions that make up that balance. From the report, you 
can drill down to a particular transaction and, if necessary, change it. The 
changes you make appear in the Other Transactions column on the Trial 
Balance page. When you redisplay the Trial Balance page, you can click the 
Update Unadjusted Balance button to have QBOA move data from the Other 
Transactions column to the Unadjusted Balance column.
FIGURE 15-4:

the Working Trial

the Trial Balance 
page.

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      291
»
» You can use the Workpapers column to add notes and attach documents to 
a particular line to help you remember why you made a particular 
adjustment.
»
» As you finish reviewing lines, you can click the leftmost column (refer to 
Figure 15-4) to place a check in it and mark the line as complete. You don’t 
have to finish reviewing a Trial Balance page in one sitting; you can, instead, 
click the Finish Review button to either freeze the workspace and return later 
and unfreeze it to continue reviewing, or archive your work to a Zip file that 
QBOA downloads to your computer.
If you use ProConnect Tax Online, Intuit’s cloud-based tax preparation software, 
to prepare a client’s tax return, then you’ll want to make sure that your client’s 
accounts are mapped properly to lines on tax forms. The Trial Balance feature 
automatically maps most account balances to lines on tax forms you’ll file for 
corporations using IRS Form 1120 (for corporations) or 1120s, partnerships that 
use IRS Form 1065, and sole proprietorships using IRS Form 1040. For other busi-
ness organization types, you can manually assign accounts to tax form lines. You 
also can manually assign lines on tax forms for accounts the tool doesn’t recog-
nize, and you can change tax line assignments as needed.
The View Tax Return button appears unavailable if you have not yet selected a tax 
form for the QBO client company. Clicking the button makes QBOA prompt you to 
select the appropriate tax form from a list.
FIGURE 15-5: 
The right side of 
the Working Trial 
Balance tab of 
the Trial Balance 
page.

292      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Click the Tax Mappings tab on the Trial Balance page to see the page you use to 
map last year’s client QBO company information directly into tax forms (see 
Figure 15-6).
To assign an account to a tax form line or edit the line to which an account is 
assigned, click the appropriate link in the Action column. QBOA displays a list box 
from which you select the appropriate tax form line, and then click Save.
When you finish reviewing the Trial Balance page and making adjusting entries, 
you can click View Tax Return to transfer the information to ProConnect Tax 
Online and generate a tax return. You don’t pay anything to use the Trial Balance 
feature; you pay only when you print or e-file a return from ProConnect Tax 
Online.
If you don’t use ProConnect Tax Online or you are not the tax preparer, you have 
the option to export the adjusted Trial Balance so that it can be imported into a 
separate application.
Reclassifying transactions
When you choose Reclassify Transactions from the Accountant Tools menu, the 
Reclassify Transactions page appears (see Figure 15-7). You can use this page to 
reclassify transactions without worrying about the company’s closing date.
FIGURE 15-6: 
The Tax 
Mappings tab of 
the Trial Balance 
page.

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      293
You use the information in the gray areas of the Accounts section on the left side 
of the page and the Transactions section on the right side of the page to filter for 
the date range and type of accounts (Profit and Loss or Balance Sheet) you want to 
consider. You then select an account on the left side of the page, and QBOA dis-
plays transactions that meet the criteria on the right side of the page. You can 
reclassify, individually or as a group, transactions that display a green circle.
Follow these steps to reclassify transactions:
1.	 On the left side of the page, set the date range you want to consider, 
along with the accounting basis.
2.	 From the View list box, select the type of accounts you want to 
­consider — Profit & Loss accounts or Balance Sheet accounts.
3.	 Click an account in the list below the View list box to examine that 
account’s transactions.
The transactions in the account appear on the right side of the page.
4.	 Above the list of transactions on the right side of the page, set filters to 
display the types of transactions that you might consider reclassifying.
You can make changes to transactions that display green circles.
You can click a transaction to open it in its transaction window and then make 
changes to it.
5.	 To change several transactions simultaneously, select them by clicking 
the check box beside them.
FIGURE 15-7: 
Use this page to 
reclassify 
transactions.

294      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
6.	 Below the list of transactions, select the For Select Transactions, Change 
check box.
7.	 From the Account to list, specify a different account.
If Class Tracking is turned on, you’ll also see a field to change the assigned 
class, the same way you can change an Account.
8.	 Click the Reclassify button.
Examining voided and deleted transactions
You can click Voided/Deleted Transactions on the Accountant Tools menu to dis-
play the Audit Log. The default view of the Audit Log (see Figure 15-8), shows 
information about those transactions that have been voided or deleted. But you 
can click the Filter button to set a variety of different filters to view other types of 
transactions and events.
Writing off invoices
Choosing Write Off Invoices from the Accountant Tools menu displays the Write 
Off Invoices page, which enables you to view invoices you might want to write off, 
and then write them off to an account of your choice. At the top of the page, you 
FIGURE 15-8: 
Use the Audit Log 
to view all kinds 
of activity in the 
QBO company.

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      295
set filters to display the invoices you want to review. Select the age of the invoices 
to view those
»
» Greater than 180 days
»
» Greater than 120 days
»
» In the current accounting period
»
» In a custom date range you set
You also can set a balance limit.
As you can see in Figure 15-9, QBOA displays the date, age, invoice number, cus-
tomer name, original invoice amount, and the amount still due on the invoice. To 
write off any invoices, click the check box beside them. Then, at the bottom of the 
page, select the account you want to use to write off the invoices and click the 
Preview and Write Off button.
QBOA displays the Confirm Write Off dialog box shown in Figure  15-10. If the 
information in the dialog box is correct, click Write Off. Otherwise, click Cancel.
FIGURE 15-9: 
Writing off 
invoices.

296      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Closing the books
You use the Close Books command on the Accountant Tools menu to display the 
Advanced page of the QBO company’s Account and Settings dialog box, shown in 
Figure 15-11. You can click anywhere in the Accounting section to edit the fields in 
that section, which include the closing date for the books.
FIGURE 15-10: 
Confirm that you 
want to write off 
the selected 
invoices.
FIGURE 15-11: 
Setting a 
closing date.

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      297
You can set a closing date and then allow changes prior to the closing date after 
QBO issues a warning, or you can require a password to enter changes prior to the 
closing date. Click Done to save your changes.
Reviewing reports
Reports in QBOA work the same way as reports in QBO; see Chapter 10 for details.
But, QBOA contains some reports of particular interest to accountants. If you open 
a client QBO company and then, from the Accountant Tools menu, click Accoun-
tant Reports, the Reports page appears. Below the Profit and Loss graphic, the 
Accountant Reports tab spotlights the reports available to QBOA users. In  
Figure 15-12, I hid the Profit and Loss graphic (click the arrow in the lower right 
corner of the graphic to hide and display it) so that you can see more of the reports 
on the Accountant Reports tab. But I still couldn’t show all of them; when you’re 
checking out these reports, be sure to scroll down the page.
Intuit is in the process of redesigning reports; at present, the redesigned reports 
are a QuickBooks Labs feature. To view the redesigned version of reports, choose 
Gear ➪ QuickBooks Labs and, in the QuickBooks Labs window that appears, turn 
on Redesigned Reports. Note that, for this discussion, I haven’t turned on Rede-
signed Reports.
If you choose Management Reports from the Accountant Tools menu (or if you 
click the Management Reports link that appears on the Reports page shown in 
FIGURE 15-12: 
Accountant-
oriented reports 
available in 
QBOA.

298      PART 3  Managing the Books for the Accountant
Figure  15-12), QBOA displays two customized management-style reports: 
Expanded Company Financials and Basic Company Financials. Both reports dis-
play a collection of reports, complete with an elegant cover page and a table of 
contents.
The Expanded Company Financials report contains the P&L, Balance Sheet, State-
ment of Cash Flows, and the A/R Aging Detail and A/P Aging Detail reports. The 
Basic Company Financials report contains all reports except the Aging Detail 
reports. Using the Edit link in the Action column, you can edit either report pack-
age to add or delete reports and modify the appearance of pages in the report, 
including determining whether pages such as the table of contents appear in the 
report. Using the down arrow that appears in the Action column, you can print 
these reports, send them via email, export the information to .PDF files or .DOCX 
files, and make copies of them so that you can make your own set of management 
reports.
Copying one of these reports before you change it is a great idea; that way, you 
keep the original report intact but create your own version of it as well.
If you choose My Custom Reports from the Accountant Tools menu or from the 
Reports page, reports you have customized and saved appear. And you can click 
Reports Tools on the Accountant Tools menu to set default report dates and 
accounting basis. You also can see account reconciliation status for cash and credit 
card accounts and view and set company closing date information.
A brief look at other accountant tools
The Accountant Tools menu contains a few other tools that make an accountant’s 
life easier, such as the Reconcile page; from this page, you can opt to reconcile an 
account you select, or you can review existing reconciliation reports. For more 
detail on reconciling accounts, see Chapter 8.
Also from the Accountant Tools menu, you can choose Journal Entries to display 
the Journal Entry window, or Chart of Accounts to display the Chart of Accounts 
window; I describe working in the Chart of Accounts window in Chapter 13. You 
also can use the New Window command described in Chapter 14 to quickly open a 
new window in QBOA.
Last, from the Accountant Tools menu, you can choose Intuit Tax Online, which 
opens a new browser window and takes you to the Tax Hub of ProConnect Tax 
Online, where you can see the status of your client’s tax returns (see Figure 15-13).

CHAPTER 15  Using Accountant Tools      299
As you can see, ProConnect Tax Online connects to your QBOA account but is actu-
ally a separate product with its own menus in the Navigation bar.

Almost Ten Things about 
the Chrome Browser 
Interface
C
hrome — officially Google Chrome — is the free web browser created by 
Google, Inc., the American-based multinational corporation that focuses on 
Internet-related products and services, such as Gmail for email, Google 
maps, and Google Docs, just to name a few. Most of Google’s profits come from 
online advertising technologies.
You can use QuickBooks Online (QBO) and QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA) 
in the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers (at the time I wrote 
this, you could use Microsoft Edge, but not to export to the QuickBooks desktop 
product). In my experience, I find that QBO and QBOA work best in Chrome. If 
you’re not familiar with Chrome or haven’t worked much in it, this chapter and 
Chapter 17 are designed to help you become adept at using Chrome with QBO and 
QBOA.  This chapter focuses on helping you become familiar with the Chrome

interface and make use of it. Figure 16-1 shows you how Chrome looks shortly 
after you install and open it; don’t forget to refer back to this figure as you read 
the chapter.
If you don’t already have Chrome installed on your computer, you can visit www.
google.com/chrome/browser/. From this web page, you can download and install 
Chrome.
Understanding Users
The Current User button in the top right corner of the screen represents a Chrome 
user. The icon may appear generically, as you see it in Figure 16-1, or it may display 
your name or email address. In Chrome, you can set up multiple users, each of 
whom can have different Chrome settings. In this way, each person using Chrome 
on a single computer can customize the program, saving his or her own book-
marks, passwords, and more. See Chapter 17 to learn how to create a Chrome user.

Windows and Tabs
You can open Chrome more than once to view multiple web pages — a process 
called opening a new window.
To open a new window, first open Chrome. Then, press Ctrl+N, and a second 
instance of the Chrome browser appears. In Figure 16-2, I’ve resized Chrome’s 
second window so that you can see both instances of Chrome. Also notice that two 
buttons for Chrome appear in the Windows taskbar.
But, in most cases, you don’t need to open multiple instances of Chrome; you can 
use Chrome’s tabs to display multiple web pages while you work.
Tabs appear at the top of the Chrome window and initially display the same short-
cuts you see when you open a new window. You can add a tab by clicking the New 
Tab button, which appears just beside the last open tab (refer back to Figure 16-1). 
And, you can close any tab by clicking the X that appears in the tab. You also can 
reposition tabs in the Chrome window by dragging a tab’s title.
In either a new window or a new tab, you navigate to a new website using the 
Omnibox (read on).
FIGURE 16-2: 
When you open a 
new Chrome 
window, two 
instances of 
Chrome run 
simultaneously.

Using the Omnibox to Visit a Web Page
You’ve probably heard of the address bar in other browsers; Chrome refers to the 
text box at the top of the browser as the Omnibox because it’s a multi-purpose box.
To visit a web page, type the address of the web page into the Omnibox and either 
press Enter or click the Refresh button. After you’ve visited a few websites, you 
can click the Back and Forward buttons to revisit pages you have recently visited 
in the order you visited them.
If you right-click or click and hold either the Back button or the Forward button, 
you can view a historical list of the websites you have visited. You can left-click 
one to return to it.
Using the Omnibox to Search the Web
Chrome uses the Omnibox to combine the functions of navigating to websites and 
searching the Internet; as you might expect, Chrome uses Google’s search engine 
by default. You can type a search term into the Omnibox, and as you type, sugges-
tions driven by Google’s search technology appear. You can then click a sugges-
tion to navigate to the associated Google search page or web page.
A gray icon appears to the left of each suggestion in the Omnibox; the icon indi-
cates the type of suggestion:
»
» A piece of paper represents a page you’ve viewed previously or a website 
related to what you’re typing.
»
» A magnifying glass indicates that the suggestion is a potential search term.
»
» A star identifies a suggestion as one of your existing bookmarks (see the next 
section, “What’s the Star?” for more on bookmarks.
What’s the Star?
You can easily save the web address of a site you visit frequently so that you don’t 
have to type the address each time you want to visit the site. In Chrome, saving a 
web address is called bookmarking, and you click the star icon to create a bookmark 
for the web page you are currently viewing. You can read more about working with 
bookmarks, including managing bookmarks, in Chapter 17.

Examining the Chrome Menu
You can click the Chrome Menu button (see Figure 16-3) to view a series of com-
mands that help you work in Chrome.
Using options on the Chrome Menu, you can

308      PART 4  The Part of Tens
The options available to you on the Chrome Menu aren’t limited to the ones I’ve 
listed — there are too many for me to list them all. But, for example, if you want 
to see how your web browsing affects your computer’s use of memory, you can 
choose Chrome Menu ➪ More Tools ➪ Task Manager.
About Signing in to (and out of) Chrome
I’m going to repeat myself in this section because it’s important for you to under-
stand the ramifications of signing in and signing out of Chrome. Let me start by 
saying — emphasizing, in fact — that you don’t have to sign in to use Chrome. In 
particular, you don’t need to sign in to Chrome to use QBO or QBOA.
That said, why sign in? If you sign in, bookmarks and passwords you save, brows-
ing history, and settings are saved to the cloud. You can then sign in to Chrome on 
a different computer and use all your settings from that computer or any 
computer.
The act of signing in can result in some negative side effects. Even though you 
sign out of Chrome, Chrome can still remember some of your information, making 
it visible to anyone who uses Chrome on the same computer. And, on a public 
computer, leaving traces of your activity could result in others gaining access to 
your personal information, email, and saved passwords.
I strongly urge you to avoid signing in to Chrome if you are using a public 
­computer. Remember, you don’t need to sign in to Chrome to use QBO or QBOA. 
And, I’ll be repeating this warning again in this section (editors, take note that I 
know I’m going to repeat myself) because it’s important to the security of your 
financial data.
If you want to sign in to Chrome, you need a Google account. If you have a Gmail 
email address, you already have an account, and you can skip the section “Creat-
ing a Google account.”
Creating a Google account
If you don’t have a Google account, you can easily create one; creating a Google 
account automatically creates a Gmail email address and a Google+ profile. Once 
you have a Google account, you can use Google services such as Gmail, Google 
Docs, and Google Calendar. Follow these steps to create a Google account:

CHAPTER 16  Almost Ten Things about the Chrome Browser Interface      309
If you already have a Gmail email address, you already have a Google account. Skip 
these steps and continue in the next section, “Signing in to Chrome.”
1.	 Navigate to www.google.com.
2.	 Click the Sign In button in the top right corner of the page.
3.	 On the page that appears, click the Create Account link.
The link appears below the box where you would ordinarily provide your email 
address.
4.	 Provide the requested information.
The requested information includes your name, a username, which is a 
proposed Gmail email address and associated password, birth date, gender, 
mobile phone number, current email address, and the country in which you 
live. Note that your mobile phone number is actually optional.
5.	 Click the Prove You’re Not a Robot check box and provide the verification 
information.
6.	 Check the I agree to the Google Terms of Service and Privacy Policy box.
You can click the links for Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to review the 
statements.
7.	 Click Next Step.
At this point, you will probably be prompted to verify your account using either 
a text message or a voice call; select a method and, when you receive the 
verification information, provide it onscreen.
8.	 On the Create Your Profile page, you can add a photo to your Google+ 
profile. If you don’t want to set a profile photo at this time, click Continue.
Google creates your account.
Signing in to Chrome
If you sign in to the Chrome browser, bookmarks and passwords you save, brows-
ing history, and settings are available to you from any computer.
Avoid signing in to Chrome if you are using a public computer, because signing 
out might not remove all your information, leaving it visible to anyone who uses 
Chrome on the computer.

310      PART 4  The Part of Tens
To sign in to Chrome, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the User icon in the top right corner of the browser.
2.	 Click Sign in to Chrome.
The sign-in form appears, requesting your Google Account email.
3.	 Type your email address and click Next.
4.	 Type your password and click Next.
A message appears, letting you know you are signed in to Chrome (see 
Figure 16-4).
5.	 Click OK, GOT IT.
The Current User button changes to reflect either your name or your email 
address — an indication that you are signed in to Chrome.
Signing out of Chrome
You should sign out of your Google account when you finish using Chrome, or 
when you no longer want changes you make on your computer saved to your 
Google account and synced to Google Chrome on your other devices. Signing out 
also can help if you think an error with Chrome’s synchronization has occurred, 
and you want to try to fix the error by signing out and then signing in again.
FIGURE 16-4: 
Once you’ve 
signed in to 
Chrome, this 
message appears.

CHAPTER 16  Almost Ten Things about the Chrome Browser Interface      311
By default, when you sign out of your Google account in the browser window, you 
leave behind traces of yourself. On a public computer, it’s possible that other peo-
ple might gain access to your personal information, email, and saved passwords.
But, an option appears during the sign-out process that you can select to elimi-
nate all traces of you on the computer. The option deletes saved information on 
the local computer about the Chrome user who signed in.
On your own private computer, deleting all traces of the user who signed in, 
including the user profile, might be a bit more drastic than you want. You can opt 
to clear history separately and less drastically; see Chapter 17 for details on clear-
ing history. But, if you’re working on a public computer, you should delete the 
user as well as the user’s settings.
Follow these steps to sign out of Chrome:
1.	 Click the Chrome Menu button to open the Chrome Menu.
2.	 Click Settings.
The Chrome Settings page appears (see Figure 16-5).
3.	 In the Sign In section at the top of the page, click Disconnect your Google 
Account.
A confirmation dialog box appears (see Figure 16-6).

4.	 Select the Also clear your history, bookmarks, settings, and other Chrome 
data stored on this device check box if you want to eliminate all trace on 
the computer of the user who signed in to Chrome.
Checking this box deletes everything on the computer associated with the 
user — your account history, bookmarks, settings, and other Chrome data 
saved on the computer. I can’t repeat this mantra often enough: If you are 
working on a public computer, you should safeguard your privacy and check 
this box. However, if you’re working on a private computer, you can safely keep 
the user and optionally clear history. To keep the user, do not check this box; 
see Chapter 17 for details on clearing history.
5.	 Click Disconnect Account.
Google signs you out of your Google account and Chrome. The appearance of 
the Current User button returns to a generic form.
Using the Chrome Web Store
You can enhance the capabilities of Chrome using web apps, plug-ins, and exten-
sions such as calculators, ad blockers, or password managers. These browser-
capable enhancers work like software you install on your computer, phone, or 
tablet, but they typically function within Chrome.
You can obtain web apps, plug-ins, and extensions from the Chrome Web Store 
found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore. The Chrome Web Store pro-
vides tools you can use to search for web apps, plug-ins, and extensions.
Web apps you install should appear on the New Tab page, from which you can 
launch them. You also can remove a web app by right-clicking it on the New Tab 
page and then clicking Remove from Chrome.
Extensions run by default when you open Chrome. You can view a list of installed 
extensions from the Settings page. Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Settings. Then, on the 
left side of the Settings page, click Extensions (see Figure 16-7).
You might want to disable an extension if you suspect it is causing a conflict as 
you work; uncheck the Enabled check box beside the extension. If the extension 
proves to be the source of your problem, you can delete it by clicking the trash can 
icon beside it.

CHAPTER 16  Almost Ten Things about the Chrome Browser Interface      313
WEB APPS AND PLUG-INS AND 
EXTENSIONS, OH MY!
So what exactly is a web app and how does it differ from a plug-in or extension? 
Honestly, for the purposes of this book, you probably don’t care. But, for better or for 
worse, here are some simple definitions:
•	 Web apps run inside your browser with their own dedicated user interface.
•	 Extensions, unlike web apps, do not typically have a user interface. Instead, they 
extend the functionality of Chrome and the websites you view using Chrome.
•	 Plug-ins are similar to extensions in that they extend functionality by helping 
Chrome process special types of web content, but a plug-in affects only the specific 
web page that contains it.
So, as you can see, each has a technical definition that distinguishes it from the others, 
but, for most of us, the bottom line is this: All of them enhance the capabilities of a 
browser by providing some functionality that the browser does not, inherently, provide.
FIGURE 16-7: 
You can view and 
enable or disable 
extensions from 
the Settings page.

314      PART 4  The Part of Tens
If you click the Get More Extensions link at the bottom of the Settings page where 
you view an extension, Chrome opens a new tab and takes you to the Chrome Web 
Store, where it displays, by default, available extensions.
Plug-ins enable certain types of web content that browsers can’t process. When 
Chrome encounters a plug-in on a web page, Chrome allows the plug-in to per-
form its function. Learn more about managing plug-ins in Chapter 17.
Selecting a Theme
You can use themes to change the appearance of Chrome. Themes can change 
the  color of the Chrome window, or they can add background pictures to the 
entire  browser. The idea here is to provide some interest to the browser page 
background.
You can find available themes in the Chrome Web Store; in the navigation pane 
that runs down the left side of the Chrome Web Store page, click Themes to pre-
view available themes.
If you install a theme and then later change your mind about using it, choose 
Chrome Menu ➪ Settings. On the Settings page, in the Appearance section, click 
Reset to default theme.

Ten Ways to Use Chrome 
Effectively
C
hapter  16 helps you understand and work with the Chrome interface. 
This chapter introduces some browser tips and tricks that can make using 
Chrome easier and more effective both in general and specifically with 
QBO and QBOA.
Setting a Home Page
Many browsers sport a button that you can click to return to your Home page —  
the page that appears when you open the browser. When you open Chrome, by 
default, the New Tab page appears. Although Chrome doesn’t show the Home 
page button by default, you can display it and also set a page that will appear when 
Chapter 17

316      PART 4  The Part of Tens
you click the Home page button. Note that Chrome doesn’t display the page you 
set as the Home page when you open the browser; instead, the Home page appears 
when you click the Home page button.
Before you begin the following steps, make sure you know the web address of the 
page you want to set as your Home page:
1.	 Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Settings.
The Settings tab appears.
2.	 In the Appearance section, click the Show Home button check box.
The Home button appears between the Refresh button and the Omnibox (see 
Figure 17-1). At this point, Chrome opens the New Tab page whenever you click 
the Home button.
3.	 Click Change.
The Home page dialog box appears (see Figure 17-2).
4.	 Select the Open This Page option and type a web address.
5.	 Click OK.
When you click the Home button, Chrome displays the page you set as your 
Home page.
FIGURE 17-1:

Home button  
and setting a 
Home page.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      317
If you open certain sites every time you start Chrome, you can pin each page as a 
tab. See the section “Duplicating and Pinning Tabs.”
Chrome and Security
Chrome includes several tools that help to keep you safe online. As you are no 
doubt aware, bad things can happen as you browse the Internet. You can run into 
phishing schemes, where someone tries to trick you into sharing personal or sen-
sitive information, usually through a fake website, some of which look extremely 
genuine. You also can run into websites that have been hacked and contain mal-
ware that tries to install itself on your computer, often without your knowledge; 
malware usually tries to harm you and your computer in some way, from simply 
messing up your computer’s behavior to trying to steal information.
Chrome includes technology, enabled by default, that helps protect you from 
phishing schemes and malware, displaying a warning whenever you visit a poten-
tially dangerous page.
Chrome also uses a technique called sandboxing to open websites. Sandboxing iso-
lates computer processes from anything else happening on the machine. If a 
sandboxed process crashes or becomes infected with malware, the rest of your 
computer remains unaffected. Each tab in Chrome opens as a separate process, 
completely independent of other tabs. If a website contains malware, the sand-
boxing technique isolates the malware to that browser tab; the malware can’t 
jump to another Chrome tab or to your computer. You eliminate the malware 
threat when you close the infected website’s browser tab.
A third method hackers can use to gain access to your computer is by the use of 
plug-ins. Plug-ins are small add-on programs for browsers. Because they are add-
on programs, plug-ins can become out-of-date and hackers can use them to try 
to introduce malware onto your computer. Adobe Flash Player is one of the most 
popular browser plug-ins; it is used most often to view video content. Out-of- 
date versions of Adobe Flash Player are also notorious for introducing malware 
into computers. Chrome reduces the threat that Adobe Flash Player poses by 
directly integrating it into Chrome. Because of this integration, updates for Adobe 
Flash Player are included in Chrome updates.
FIGURE 17-2: 
Use this dialog 
box to type the 
web address of 
your Home page.

318      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Chrome also regularly checks for the latest security update without any action on 
your part. By integrating Adobe Flash Player and regularly checking for security 
updates, Chrome greatly reduces the danger of malware infection.
To view the default security measures, you can follow the next steps:
1.	 Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Settings.
Don’t change security settings unless you really know what you’re doing.
2.	 Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Show Advanced Settings.
•	 In the Privacy section, the Protect You and Your Device from Dangerous 
Sites option warns you if Chrome detects that the site you’re trying to visit 
might contain phishing or other malware.
•	 From the HTTPS/SSL section, you can manage your SSL certificates and 
settings.
Chrome and Privacy
Chrome enables you to control the information you share online. For example, you 
can change your privacy settings, delete your browsing history, and browse in 
Incognito mode. To adjust privacy settings, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Settings.
2.	 Scroll to the bottom of the Settings page and click Show Advanced 
Settings.
3.	 In the Privacy section, click Content Settings.
From the Content Settings dialog box, you can make a variety of changes.
Below, I’m going to list the settings you might be most likely to change. If I don’t 
cover a setting you want to change, you can search for help on that setting at 
https://support.google.com/chrome/.
Handling cookies
You can control how Chrome handles cookies. In most cases, websites you visit 
place cookies on your computer for the purpose of recognizing your specific 
browser/computer combination if you return to the site. Chrome allows cookies by 
default, because they are typically harmless, but cookies can allow sites to track 
your navigation during your visit to those sites.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      319
Third-party cookies are cookies placed on your computer by one website for some 
other website. To increase privacy, most people block third-party cookies to 
­prevent sharing information with parties not directly associated with the sites 
they visit.
Chrome and JavaScript
You can control whether Chrome runs JavaScript, which web developers often use 
to make their sites more interactive. If you disable JavaScript, you might find that 
some sites don’t work properly.
Allowing plug-ins
Plug-ins appear on specific websites and are used by website developers to pro-
cess web content that browsers can’t inherently handle. For example, Adobe Flash 
Player processes content that web browsers don’t inherently process. Chrome 
allows plug-ins to run by default, and if you disable this feature, various websites 
might not function as expected.
Working in Incognito mode
If you work in Incognito mode, you can browse the web without recording a history 
of the websites you have visited and without storing cookies. Using Incognito 
mode doesn’t make Chrome more secure; it simply enhances your privacy by pre-
venting Chrome from keeping a record of the sites you have visited during that 
particular browsing session. Even in Incognito mode, you shouldn’t visit websites 
that you wouldn’t feel safe viewing in a regular Chrome window.
To use Incognito mode, choose Chrome Menu ➪ New Incognito Window. A new 
instance of Chrome opens; notice that two buttons for Chrome appear on the Win-
dows taskbar. The new Chrome instance displays an incognito window like the 
one shown in Figure 17-3, and the Incognito icon appears in the upper left corner 
of the browser window, immediately to the left of the New Tab tab. You use an 
Incognito window the same way that you use the regular Chrome window; while 
you work, Chrome doesn’t record a history of the sites you visit nor does Chrome 
allow sites to store cookies on your computer.
To stop browsing incognito, you must close the instance of Chrome that’s running 
incognito.

320      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Deleting browsing history
Like all browsers, if you work in a regular Chrome window (rather than an Incog-
nito window), Chrome keeps track of the websites you have visited during each 
browsing session. Browsers save your browsing history, among other reasons, to 
decrease the time you wait to see a web page that you have previously visited. And 
browser history can help you return to a website you visited previously even 
though you can’t remember the website’s address.
To view your browsing history, choose Chrome Menu ➪ History ➪ History. A page 
similar to the one shown in Figure 17-4 appears; your browsing history is orga-
nized by date and time, with the most recent sites you visited appearing first. You 
can click any entry to redisplay that web page.
You also can delete all or only part of your browsing history, typically to maintain 
your privacy. From the History page, click Clear Browsing Data. The dialog box 
shown in Figure 17-5 appears; you can choose the type of data you want to delete 
and the timeframe over which to delete that data.
If you delete all of your cookies, you might need to re-identify yourself at websites 
where you were previously “known,” such as your bank’s website. The process 
involves getting a code from the website and entering it, typically along with your 
password at that site, so that you can verify that you are, indeed, the user the 
website thinks you are.
FIGURE 17-3: 
An Incognito 
window.

To delete a single browsing history entry, display the History page (shown previ-
ously in Figure 17-4) and hover the mouse pointer over the entry you want to 
delete. Select the check box to the left of the entry, and, if appropriate, select 
additional entries to delete. Then click the Remove Selected Items button that 
becomes clickable at the top of the History page.

Reviewing miscellaneous privacy settings
In addition to the settings previously described in this section, you can control the 
way Chrome handles the following situations; the following descriptions describe 
Chrome’s default behavior:
»
» Chrome asks for permission whenever a website wants to use your location 
information.
»
» Chrome asks for permission whenever a site wants to automatically show 
notifications on your computer desktop.
»
» Chrome asks for permission whenever sites or apps such as games want to 
disable your mouse pointer.
»
» Chrome asks for permission whenever websites request access to your 
computer’s camera and microphone.
»
» Chrome asks for permission if a website wants to bypass Chrome’s sandbox 
technology and directly access your computer.
»
» Chrome blocks pop-ups from appearing and cluttering your screen.
To use Chrome effectively with QBO and QBOA, you cannot block all pop-ups. 
By  default, Chrome blocks all pop-ups. If you try to use QBO or QBOA while 
­pop-ups are blocked, you’ll see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 17-6.
FIGURE 17-6: 
When all pop-ups 
are blocked, you 
can’t access QBO 
or QBOA.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      323
Note the pop-up blocker icon at the right edge of the Omnibox. Click it to display 
the message shown in Figure 17-6, and then select the first option to allow QBO 
and QBOA pop-ups.
You can turn on pop-ups selectively for any website. Follow these steps:
1.	 Click Chrome Menu ➪ Settings.
2.	 Click Show Advanced Settings.
3.	 In the Privacy section, click the Content Settings button.
4.	 In the Content Settings dialog box, scroll down to the Pop-ups section and 
click Manage Exceptions (see Figure 17-7).
5.	 In the Pop-up Exceptions dialog box that appears, type the name of the 
website for which you want to manage pop-ups.
6.	 From the Behavior list box beside the web address, choose Allow or Block.
Using Google tools to manage privacy
Although Google can collect a lot of information about you, you can control just 
how much information Google collects using Google’s privacy management tools. 
Visit https://myaccount.google.com/intro; from this website, you can, for 
example, use the Ads Settings to log in to your Google account and adjust the ads 
Chrome shows you.
Using Bookmarks in Chrome
Bookmarks enable you to save a web page address so that you can easily return to 
it. In this section, you learn to
»
» Create a bookmark.
»
» Use a bookmark to display its associated web page.
FIGURE 17-7:

Exceptions 
button in the 
Pop-ups section

»
» Display the Bookmarks bar in Chrome to make bookmarks more accessible.
»
» Organize bookmarks by renaming them, placing them into folders, changing 
the order in which they appear when you view bookmarks, and deleting 
bookmarks you no longer need.
Creating a bookmark
Creating a bookmark is easy. First, navigate to the web page you want to  
bookmark. For example, you might want to bookmark the QBO or QBOA sign-in 
page. Then click the Bookmark This Page button (the one that looks like a star) at 
the right edge of the Omnibox, press Ctrl+D or choose Chrome Menu ➪  
Bookmarks ➪ Bookmark This Page. The Bookmark Added! dialog box appears  
(see Figure 17-8).
You can change the bookmark’s name (I shortened mine) and the folder in which 
Chrome stores it. By default, Chrome offers two folders:
»
» The Bookmarks bar folder and
»
» The Other Bookmarks folder.
Choose one of these folders, click Done, and Chrome saves your bookmark. All 
bookmarks you create appear at the bottom of the Bookmarks menu; choose 
Chrome Menu ➪ Bookmarks to see them.
If you place the bookmarks you use most often on the Bookmarks bar, they can be 
easily visible and available for use, as you’ll see in the next section.
So, logically, because you’re an organized human being, you want to know if you 
can create your own folders and organize your bookmarks using your organiza-
tional style. Yes, you can, using the Bookmark Manager, and you can read more 
about the Bookmark Manager later in this chapter in the section “Managing 
bookmarks.”
FIGURE 17-8: 
This dialog box 
appears when 
you create a 
bookmark.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      325
Bookmarks can “break” and display “page not found” messages (error code 404). 
If this happens, manually navigate to the page and save the bookmark again, 
overwriting the original bookmark.
Displaying the Bookmarks bar
By default, Chrome saves your bookmarks to the Bookmarks bar, which appears 
just below the Omnibox every time you open the New Tab page. The Bookmarks 
bar makes using bookmarks faster and easier because bookmarks are always. You 
can simply click the appropriate bookmark on the Bookmarks bar to display its 
associated web page.
To take full advantage of the Bookmarks bar, you should display it on all Chrome 
tabs (instead of just the New Tab tab). Press Ctrl+Shift+B or choose Chrome 
Menu ➪ Bookmarks ➪ Show Bookmarks bar. Chrome displays as many bookmarks 
as possible on the Bookmarks bar, based on the names you give to your book-
marks: the shorter the name, the more bookmarks Chrome can display. But, you 
can easily get to the bookmarks you can’t see by clicking the small button con-
taining two right-pointing arrows at the right edge of the Bookmarks bar (see 
Figure 17-9).
Importing bookmarks
If you’ve been working in a different browser and want to copy your bookmarks  
from that browser to Chrome, no problem. Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Bookmarks ➪  
Import Bookmarks And Settings. The Import Bookmarks and Settings dialog box 
appears (see Figure 17-10).
Select the browser from which to import them and select or deselect the check 
boxes beside the items you want to import; different browsers offer different 
importing options. Then, click Import, and Chrome imports the information. The 
imported bookmarks appear in a folder on the Bookmarks bar, and you can use the 
Bookmark Manager, described in the next section, to reorganize these 
bookmarks.

326      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Managing bookmarks
If you’re like me, you’ll learn to love bookmarks — perhaps to your detriment. As 
you accumulate bookmarks, finding them to be able to use them becomes a proj-
ect. You have a few avenues available to you:
»
» You can organize your bookmarks by repositioning them on the Bookmarks 
bar and on the list of bookmarks on the Bookmarks menu (choose Chrome 
Menu ➪ Bookmarks).
»
» You can create folders for your bookmarks and place bookmarks in the 
appropriate folder.
»
» You can search for a bookmark.
To reposition bookmarks, you can drag them on the Bookmarks bar or on the list 
of bookmarks (either the list that appears when you click the button at the right 
edge of the Bookmarks bar, or the list of bookmarks that appears at the bottom of 
the Bookmarks menu). A black line (vertical if you’re dragging on the Bookmarks 
bar or horizontal if you’re dragging on either list of bookmarks) helps you locate 
the new position for the bookmark; simply release the mouse button when the 
bookmark appears where you want it to appear.
You also can use the Bookmark Manager to reorder bookmarks; in addition, using 
the Bookmark Manager, you can create folders and organize bookmarks into those 
folders, delete bookmarks and folders you no longer need, rename bookmarks, 
and search for bookmarks.
To open the Bookmark Manager, choose Chrome Menu ➪ Bookmarks ➪ Bookmark 
Manager. A tab like the one shown in Figure 17-11 appears.
The Bookmark Manager window works the same way that Windows Explorer and 
File Explorer work; if you’re familiar with Windows Explorer or File Explorer, you 
already know many of the techniques you use to organize bookmarks.
FIGURE 17-10: 
Use this dialog 
box to identify 
what you want  
to import.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      327
The left pane displays existing folders, and the right pane shows the bookmarks 
in each folder you select in the left pane. You use the Organize button just above 
the left pane to make organization changes.
To delete any bookmark or folder except the Bookmarks bar folder and the Other 
Bookmarks folder, click the bookmark or folder and the press the Delete key on 
your keyboard. Nope, you can’t delete the Bookmarks bar folder or the Other 
Bookmarks folder.
You can use folders to organize bookmarks; I like to organize my bookmarks by 
subject. Although you can add new folders to the Other Bookmarks folder at the 
bottom of the list on the left, I suggest that you confine your organization to the 
Bookmarks bar folder. You can compare keeping all your bookmarks on the Book-
marks bar to owning only one file cabinet. The cabinet has multiple drawers (fold-
ers, in this analogy), but you need to search only one cabinet to find what you 
need. Finding a particular bookmark will be easier if you use only the Bookmarks 
bar folder.
To create a new folder on the Bookmarks bar, choose Organize ➪ Add Folder. Type 
a name for the new folder, and press Enter.
When you create a new bookmark that you want to place in this folder, select this 
folder in the Folder list box of the Bookmark Added dialog box (refer back to 
Figure 17-8).
To add an existing bookmark to a folder, click the bookmark on the right side of 
the Bookmark Manager window and drag it to the appropriate folder on the left 
side of the Bookmark Manager window.
To reorder bookmarks or folders, drag the bookmark or folder up or down in the 
list on either side of the Bookmark Manager window. That is, you can drag folders 
in the left side of the window and bookmarks or folders in the right side of the 
window. A horizontal black line appears as you drag and helps you locate the new 
position for the bookmark or folder; release the mouse button when the bookmark 
or folder’s black line appears at the correct location in the list.
FIGURE 17-11: 
The Bookmark 
Manager.

328      PART 4  The Part of Tens
To rename any folder or bookmark, right-click it and choose Edit from the menu 
that appears. Then, type a new name and press Enter.
Suppose that, after this wonderful organizing you’ve done, you can’t remember 
where you put a particular bookmark. No problem. Use the Bookmarks search box 
(refer to Figure 17-11). Type an address or search term into the search box and 
press Enter. Chrome displays any bookmarks that match the address or search 
term. To cancel the search and redisplay all your bookmarks, click the X that 
appears in the search box.
When you finish working in the Bookmark Manager window, click the X that 
appears in the tab’s name.
Duplicating and Pinning Tabs
Chapter 16 describes how to open multiple tabs as you browse in Chrome and how 
to reposition tabs within the Chrome window.
At times, you might find it useful to duplicate a QuickBooks company tab you’ve 
already opened so that you have that tab open twice — or, so that you can open 
two different tabs for the same company simultaneously. To duplicate any tab, 
right-click the tab and choose Duplicate from the shortcut menu that appears (see 
Figure 17-12). Chrome automatically opens another tab using the web address of 
the duplicated tab. You can then work on the tabs independently of each other, 
switching to different tabs in the same company.
FIGURE 17-12: 
Duplicate a 
browser tab in 
Chrome.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      329
You might also find it useful to pin a particular Chrome tab; pinned tabs open 
automatically whenever you start Chrome. To pin a tab, right-click the tab and 
choose Pin Tab from the shortcut menu that appears (refer to Figure 17-12).
If you decide you no longer want a pinned tab to appear each time you open 
Chrome, right-click the pinned tab and click Unpin Tab from the menu that 
appears. Be aware that the Unpin tab command appears only if you previously 
pinned the tab.
Using Chrome on Multiple Monitors
Here’s another tab-related trick: If you have more than one monitor, you can pull 
one tab out of the Chrome window and drag it to your other monitor so that you 
can work in QBO/QBOA on multiple screens. Again, because tabs in Chrome func-
tion independently, the work you do in each window is independent of the other.
To pull a tab, click and drag the tab; a preview of the new window appears. Release 
the mouse button and the tab appears in a new window onscreen. If you didn’t 
drag the tab to a different monitor, no problem. Just drag the new window by its 
title bar to your second monitor. (Yes, if you have three monitors, you can repeat 
this process.)
Setting Up Chrome Users
In Chapter 16, I explain that you can set up multiple users, each of whom can have 
different Chrome settings. At that time, I promised that I’d show you how to set 
up multiple Chrome users — and, here we are.
If you want to log in to two different QBO companies from a single QBO account, 
you can use different Chrome users. To create a user, choose Chrome Menu ➪  
Settings to display the Settings tab. In the People section, click Add Person to 
­display the Add Person dialog box (see Figure 17-13).
Select an icon for the new user and enter a name for the user; the name will appear 
in the Current User button, and the icon will appear when you click the Current 
User button in the upper right corner of the Chrome window. Optionally, you can 
create a desktop shortcut for the user so that the user can quickly and easily open 
his or her own version of Chrome. Then click Add.

330      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Another instance of Chrome opens, and you’ll see two buttons on the Windows 
taskbar. You can identify the current user by looking at the Current User button in 
the upper right corner of the browser, and you can easily switch from one user to 
another. Let’s assume that you have opened only one instance of Chrome, so only 
one button appears on the Windows taskbar. To switch users, click Current 
User ➪ Switch Person, as shown in Figure 17-14.
Chrome displays a window listing the currently defined users (see Figure 17-15); 
click one or click the Add Person button to go through the process of creating a 
new user.
FIGURE 17-13:

dialog box.
FIGURE 17-14: 
To initiate 
switching users,

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      331
Assuming you select an existing user, Chrome opens a new browser window. If 
you don’t maximize Chrome, you can easily see the open windows.
To shortcut the process of switching users, you can right-click the Current User 
button; a list of available users appears and you can click the one you want.
You can use the menu that appears when you click the Current User button to eas-
ily change a user’s name or icon. To change a user’s icon, click the Current User 
button and then click the picture currently displayed (see Figure 17-16). Chrome 
opens the Edit version of the dialog box you saw earlier in Figure 17-13. Just select 
a different icon. And you can change the user’s name here, too.
To change only the user’s name, click the Current User button and slide the mouse 
cursor over the user’s name; a pencil appears (see Figure 17-16). Click the pencil, 
and the text for the user’s name becomes editable. Just type a new name and press 
Enter.
You can delete a user from the Chrome Settings tab.
FIGURE 17-15: 
Select a different

332      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Zooming In and Out
There are times when tired eyes need help; fortunately, you can zoom in and out 
of Chrome’s windows easily. Press Ctrl++ (plus sign) to make the information in 
the window larger (known as zooming in) and Ctrl+- (minus sign) to reduce the 
size of the information in the window (you guessed it: zooming out).
Be aware that, while zooming is great for enlarging text, zooming can also alter 
how web pages appear, even to the point of hiding content that would otherwise 
be visible. So, if something seems to be missing, try resetting the zoom factor 
to 100%.
Downloading Files
Chrome can display many different types of documents, media, and other files, 
such as PDF and MP3 files. But, you might need to save a file to your computer.
Instead of clicking the file’s link — which is always tempting — right-click the 
link and, from the menu that appears, click Save Link As. Then, in the dialog box 
that appears, navigate to the folder on your computer where you want to save the 
file, give the file a name you’ll recognize, and click Save. The file downloads, and 
FIGURE 17-16: 
Edit a user’s icon, 
name, or both.

CHAPTER 17  Ten Ways to Use Chrome Effectively      333
you can monitor the download progress in the lower left corner of the Chrome 
browser window.
If you click a link to a file, it might download automatically or it might open 
within the Chrome browser. To prevent a file from opening in Chrome, make sure 
that you right-click the link.
To view and open any downloaded file, use the Downloads tab (see Figure 17-17). 
Choose Chrome Menu ➪ Downloads. From this tab, you can
»
» Open downloaded files by clicking them
»
» Open the Downloads folder by clicking the Show in Folder link below any 
downloaded file, or by clicking the Open Downloads Folder link above the list 
of downloads and below the Bookmarks bar.
»
» Search for downloads using the search box by clicking the magnifying glass in 
the upper right corner of the screen, just below the Bookmarks bar.
»
» Clear the Downloads list using the Clear All link above the list of downloads 
and below the Bookmarks bar.
Chrome on Mobile Devices
You can use the Chrome browser on mobile devices as well as on desktop comput-
ers (of course you can!). Chrome works on both iOS and Android, and the Chrome 
app is typically preinstalled on Android devices because Android and Chrome 
are  both Google products. Chrome on a mobile device functions pretty much 
the same way that Chrome on a desktop computer functions. One important note: 
The Chrome menu button looks like three vertically aligned dots instead of the 
bars you see in the desktop version of Chrome.

How to Prepare a 
Budget in QBO 
Q
uickBooks Online (QBO) supports preparing budgets, which help you moni-
tor, track, and compare expected income and expenses with actual income 
and expenses. When you prepare a budget, you typically prepare it for a fis-
cal year, and you can opt to supply budget amounts or use historical amounts from 
QBO. You also can opt to subdivide your budget based on customer, location, or class.
QBO uses pop-up windows to help you prepare budgets. If you have your browser 
set to block pop-ups, you should make an exception for QBO.
How to Check Fiscal Year Settings 
in QuickBooks Online
Before you start to prepare your budget, you can double-check your fiscal year 
settings by following these steps:
1.	 Click the Gear button beside your company name.
2.	 From the drop-down menu that appears, click Account and Settings in 
the Your Company column. See Figure A-1.

336      PART 4  The Part of Tens
3.	 Click Advanced on the left side of the dialog box, as shown in Figure A-2.
4.	 In the Accounting section, double-check that the first month of your 
fiscal year is correct.
If necessary, you can change the first month of the fiscal year by clicking it.
5.	 Click Done.
How to Use the Budget Wizard 
in QuickBooks Online
At the time I wrote this, changes to the process below for using the Budget Wizard 
were in the works. So, be aware that, by the time you read this, the process below 
might change slightly.

APPENDIX A  How to Prepare a Budget in QBO       337
To prepare a budget in QuickBooks Online, you use a four-page wizard that helps 
you set up the Budgets page, where you then provide budget values. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Click the Gear button beside your company name.
2.	 From the drop-down menu that appears, click Budgeting in the Tools 
column.
If you have not enabled pop-ups, at least for QBO, a prompt appears asking 
you to disable your pop-up blocker. Click OK and disable your pop-up blocker 
or list the QBO web address as an exception to blocked pop-ups.
The Creating a Budget wizard — a four-page wizard — starts. The first page of 
the wizard explains what you’ll do as you create a budget.
3.	 Click Next.
The second page of the interview appears as shown in Figure A-3:

6.	Specify how you want to subdivide your budget.
You can opt not to subdivide your budget, subdivide by customer, or, if you 
have locations and classes enabled, subdivide by location or class.
7.	Click Next.
The last page of the interview appears.
8.	Select a fiscal year and provide a name for the budget.
9.	Click Finish. See Figure A-5.
QBO displays the Budgets page; the actual appearance of the page depends 
on the choices you made as you walked through the interview. Here’s what the 
Budgets page looks like when you don’t subdivide:
10.	Click a line in the top part of the window.
QBO displays monthly boxes at the bottom of the window for the selected line.
You click the Enter By list box and choose Quarterly or Year to enter quarterly 
or annual amounts.
11.	Type budget amounts for each month in the boxes.
You can type an amount and click Copy Across to copy the amount from one 
box to all the rest of the boxes.
12.	Click the Save button beside the boxes to place the amounts in the 
budget boxes at the top of the page.

Conversion
A
lthough you can import most data from a QuickBooks desktop company 
into QBO, not everything converts. In some cases, some things convert 
completely or have counterparts in QBO. And, some things convert par-
tially or have simply been replaced by QBO features. But in some cases, things 
don’t convert and there’s no QBO substitute feature.
This appendix explores data conversion and gives you a sense of what you can 
expect if you convert a QuickBooks desktop company to QBO.

342      PART 4  The Part of Tens
General Limitations of Importing Desktop 
QuickBooks Data into QuickBooks Online
When you convert a desktop QuickBooks company to QuickBooks Online (QBO), 
some data fully converts, some partially converts, and some doesn’t convert at all. 
In addition, QBO contains comparable features for some desktop QuickBooks fea-
tures and doesn’t contain comparable features for others.
As you’d expect, you might bump up against limitations while trying to import 
your desktop QuickBooks data into QBO. Detailed information about those limita-
tions can be found in this appendix.
For more information, visit the QuickBooks FAQ, “Why some data doesn’t come 
over from QuickBooks desktop.”
The tables provide detailed information; generally, here’s a list of what doesn’t 
convert:
»
» Subtotal items, sales tax group items, and other group items
»
» Memorized transactions and reports
»
» Some payroll items
»
» Customer and vendor accounts, types, contact information, credit card and 
limit information, and sales reps
»
» Customer, vendor, employee and item custom field information
»
» Attached documents
»
» Price levels
»
» Sales form templates
»
» Pending transactions
»
» Reconciliation reports
Note that budgets are available only in QuickBooks Online Plus.
Also, inventory items do convert. However, if you have hundreds of items, you 
might opt not to convert inventory and then do some clean-up and setup work to 
balance things in your QBO company, as described in the online video at www.
screencast.com/t/0hgpGl2MJJwf.

APPENDIX B  QBO, QuickBooks Desktop, and Data Conversion      343
How QuickBooks Desktop Lists Convert  
to QuickBooks Online
When you work with some desktop QuickBooks company lists, some fields convert 
into QuickBooks Online (QBO) but others don’t. This section is organized by desk-
top QuickBooks list. Also included is some information about how inventory works 
in QBO.
Customer and Job List
When it comes to conversion, the fields in the Customer:Job list of the desktop 
QuickBooks product fall into three categories:
»
» Fields that convert include Customer, Company Name, Mr./Ms./?, First Name, 
Middle Initial, Last Name, Phone, FAX, Alternate Phone, Email, Resale No., 
Terms, and Is Taxable check box.
»
» Fields that convert with exceptions include Bill to Address (except Note), Ship 
To Address (except Note), Preferred Payment Method (except from 
QuickBooks 2003 or later), Credit Card Information (except from QuickBooks 
2003 or later), and Note (up to 4000 characters).
»
» Fields that don’t convert include Contact, Alt. Contact, Customer Type, Rep, 
Price Level, Tax Item, Custom Fields, Account, and Credit Limit. Also note that 
inactive status customers convert as active.
After conversion, you can edit customers to make them inactive.
In addition, these Pro Only fields don’t convert: Job Status, Start Date, Projected 
End, End Date, Job Description, and Job Type.
Item List
In transactions, subtotal items appear on separate lines with text in the Memo 
field indicating they are a subtotal.
Group items don’t convert; instead, each item in the group appears on a detail 
line, and zero-amount lines appear at the start and end of the group to identify 
the items that were part of the group. The top line shows the group name, and the 
bottom line shows the group description.

344      PART 4  The Part of Tens
Sales tax group items don’t convert, but you can set up combined sales tax items 
in QBO. QBO doesn’t support three-character tax codes associated with items.
Employee List
The information in the desktop QuickBooks edition Employee List converts to 
QuickBooks Online, but QBO retains only the following information:
»
» Mr./Ms.
»
» First name
»
» Middle initial
»
» Last name
»
» Address
»
» Print As
»
» Phone
»
» Social Security Number
»
» Email address
»
» Hire date
»
» Release date
Vendor List
The following Vendor List fields don’t convert:
»
» Contact
»
» Alternate contact
»
» Note
»
» Inactive
»
» Vendor Type
»
» Credit Limit
»
» Tax ID
»
» 1099 status

» Custom fields

APPENDIX B  QBO, QuickBooks Desktop, and Data Conversion      345
A Look at inventory . . .
QBO supports basic inventory needs; if you run a service business or sell finished 
goods, QBO should be able to support your inventory needs. Inventory items con-
vert as two-sided items in QBO with prices and costs but no quantities. Here’s 
how QuickBooks Online converts inventory parts and transactions:
»
» QBO creates new sub-items called Inventory Asset and COGS for each 
inventory item used on a transaction. Although the names of these sub-items 
imply that they are accounts, they aren’t. These items contain the same 
description as their parent item, but have, respectively, the inventory asset 
account and COGS account associated with them. Conversion uses them to 
ensure that reports are correct after conversion.
»
» After each inventory line on converted invoices, sales receipts, credit memos, 
and on some bills, checks, and credit card transactions that contained 
inventory items, QBO creates two new detail lines using the new sub-items 
that represent the inventory asset and COGS amounts.
For unpaid or partially paid transactions that contain inventory items, cash basis 
reports with a COGS amount in QBO will be different from cash basis reports with 
a COGS amount in desktop QuickBooks. Cash basis reports for fully paid inventory 
transactions or non-inventory transactions will be the same in QBO and desktop 
QuickBooks.
After you convert inventory from a QuickBooks desktop company to QBO, you 
can’t just start using inventory in QBO. You need to go through a clean-up process. 
You can find excellent details on the clean-up process in the “How to Resolve Post 
Conversion Inventory Issues in QBO” video. Following is a general description of 
the clean-up process.
Generally, conversion creates the new sub-items as a temporary measure for the 
sole purpose of making sure that your reports are correct. After conversion, you 
find, in the Chart of Accounts, an Inventory account converted from your Quick-
Books desktop company. Then, when you turn on inventory and quantity-on- 
hand tracking in QBO, QBO creates another Inventory account — the one that you 
use going forward as you work in QBO. To establish the correct inventory dollar 
valuation in the Inventory account created by QBO and to make your inventory 
items update the correct Inventory account going forward — the one created by 
QBO — you need to edit each inventory item (not the sub-items created during 
conversion) and fill in the correct quantity on hand. This process results in dou-
bling your inventory value by displaying it in both the Inventory account created 
from your QuickBooks desktop company during conversion and in the Inventory 
account QBO creates. To correct the overstatement, you use a journal entry that 
removes the dollars from the QuickBooks desktop Inventory account.

346      PART 4  The Part of Tens
But before you correct the inventory value and after you’ve edited every item, you 
can and should delete the sub-items created during conversion.
Because you need to do the clean-up process on an item-by-item basis, if you 
have hundreds of inventory items, you might find all of this overwhelming. As an 
alternative, you can opt not to convert inventory and, instead, follow the instruc-
tions found in the video. The video suggests that you import the Item List but not 
the details for each item. Instead, set up the details of each item in QBO. For hun-
dreds of items, importing only the list information will probably be faster and 
cleaner.
There’s one downside to importing list information only: You lose the historical 
data associated with your inventory items. But nothing is stopping you from 
keeping your QBO desktop company around for the times when you might need 
that history.

Estimates convert but work differently in QBO. In QuickBooks 
desktop, you turn an estimate into an invoice. In QBO, you add 
data from an estimate onto an invoice and you assign each esti-
mate a status: Pending, Accepted, Closed, or Rejected. There is no 
progress invoicing at this time in QBO, but a workaround can be 
found at the Fundera blog entry, “Job Costing QuickBooks Online 
with Sub-Customers.”
Registers
None.
Customers & Jobs
Some fields convert completely, some convert with exceptions, 
and some don’t convert. See the section “How QuickBooks 
Desktop Lists Convert to QuickBooks Online” for details.
Items
QBO refers to items as products and services and uses three 
types. All item types convert (two-sided QuickBooks desktop 
items convert to two-sided QBO items) except for subtotal, 
group, and sales tax group items. Subtotals from QuickBooks 
desktop transactions appear on separate lines on invoices, with 
text in the Description field indicating that they are subtotals, 
but subtotal items do not convert. QBO contains a feature that 
enables you to add subtotals to sales transactions. See the 
­section “How QuickBooks Desktop Lists Convert to QuickBooks 
Online” for details.

Type of Data 
or Feature
Notes
Employees
Essentially, employee information found on the Personal and 
Address & Contact tabs of the Edit Employee dialog box in desk-
top QuickBooks converts and is retained. Payroll information 
does not convert.
Other Names
QBO contains no Other Names list and converts all names on 
this list in your desktop QuickBooks company data file to ven-
dors. Checks with payees from the Other Names list might con-
vert with the payee field deleted.
Vendors
All vendors convert, but some fields don’t convert. See the section 
“How QuickBooks Desktop Lists Convert to QuickBooks Online” 
for details.
Features That Might Not Convert  
but Have Comparable Features 
in QuickBooks Online
In some cases, some data might not convert in QuickBooks Online (QBO). But QBO 
contains comparable transactions and features that you can use. The following 
table lists that information. For more information, visit https://community.
intuit.com/questions/1145236-why-some-data-doesn-t-come-over- 
from-quickbooks-desktop.
Type of Data 
or Feature
Notes
Inventory
QBO tracks inventory, but you can opt not to convert inventory 
and, instead, use the information found in the “How to Resolve 
Post Conversion Inventory Issues in QBO” video to set up 
inventory.
Purchase orders
QBO converts open purchases from desktop QuickBooks to 
open purchase orders in QBO. Received in Full or Closed desk-
top purchase orders convert to closed QBO purchase orders 
and are not linked to their corresponding bill.
Payroll items
Some but not all Payroll items convert.
Payroll data
Transactions and payroll accounts are converted so your 
books will balance, but details behind the transactions are not 
converted. Liability refunds, adjustment transactions, and 
opening balance transactions that affect accounts are con-
verted to journal entries. See Chapter 9 for details on handling 
payroll in QBO.

APPENDIX B  QBO, QuickBooks Desktop, and Data Conversion      349
Type of Data 
or Feature
Notes
Customization
No desktop QuickBooks templates convert to QBO.
Memorized 
transactions
Memorized transactions do not convert, but you can set them 
up in QBO as recurring transactions.
Audit trail
Audit trail information does not convert, but QBO uses the 
Activity Log to provide an audit trail.
Closing date 
and password
QBO converts closing date and associated password informa-
tion and tracks new exceptions, but the Exceptions to Closing 
Date report in QBO doesn’t show previously accumulated 
exceptions.
Reminders
QBO doesn’t convert desktop QuickBooks reminders but does 
contain its own comparable feature.
Users and 
permissions
QBO does not convert usernames, but you can re-create them. 
In QBO, you can set access permissions similar to those in 
desktop QuickBooks, but you can’t set permissions to control 
activity at the level of transactions.
Import/Export
QBO exports to desktop QuickBooks 2004 or later and to 
Microsoft Excel. QBO doesn’t import from or export to other 
applications that use .IIF files. Transaction Pro Importer is the 
third party to use with QBO for importing transactions and 
unsupported lists from Excel or CSV.
Budgets
QBO doesn’t convert desktop QuickBooks budgets but QBO 
Plus does contain its own budget feature.
Memorized reports
QBO doesn’t convert desktop QuickBooks memorized reports 
but does enable you to memorize QBO reports.
Customer messages
QBO Plus retains customer messages stored on converted 
desktop QuickBooks sales forms. Although you can include 
customer messages on sales forms in QBO, you need to enter 
them manually each time because QBO does not support a 
predefined list of customer messages.
Online banking
QBO converts desktop QuickBooks online banking accounts 
and their transactions, but in QBO you must set them up again 
for online banking.
Sales Tax 
group items
Sales tax group items don’t convert, but you can recreate them in 
QBO as combined rates.

Features That Don’t Convert and 
Don’t Exist in QuickBooks Online
The following table lists transactions and features that don’t convert from desk-
top QuickBooks to QuickBooks Online (QBO) and also have no comparable feature 
in QBO.  Although one or more of these transactions or features might be deal 
breakers, remember that, for many of these features, you can use workarounds.
Type of Data 
or Feature
Notes
Finance charges
QBO converts existing finance charge invoices with no data  
loss but contains no feature to automatically assess finance 
charges. If you used finance charges in QuickBooks desktop, 
the conversion process creates a QBO product or service item 
called Finance Charge. You can use this item to manually assess 
finance charges.
Receive Items
QBO doesn’t support tracking items on purchases and has 
no comparable feature for any of the ways you receive items 
in desktop QuickBooks. All of these transactions convert to 
QBO as bills.
Item price levels
QBO doesn’t convert item price levels from desktop 
QuickBooks and contains no feature to automatically adjust 
product and service prices.
Shortcut list and icon 
bar settings
These features don’t convert from desktop QuickBooks to 
QBO and no comparable features exist in QBO. Keyboard 
shortcuts do exist; anywhere in QBO, press Ctrl+Alt+/ to see 
the list. For a list of handy shortcuts, see the cheat sheet arti-
cle “16 Keyboard Shortcuts for QuickBooks Online and 
QuickBooks Online Accountant.”
Synchronize contacts
QBO does not contain any way to synchronize your contacts 
with other data sources.
Write letters
QBO contains no comparable feature to the desktop 
QuickBooks Write Letters feature.
Discounts
QBO doesn’t automatically calculate terms discounts. QBO 
converts discounts already given to customers in desktop 
QuickBooks as credit memos and discounts taken from ven-
dors as vendor credits.
Pending sales
No pending sales transactions convert from desktop 
QuickBooks to QBO, and QBO contains no feature compara-
ble to the pending sale.

APPENDIX B  QBO, QuickBooks Desktop, and Data Conversion      351
Type of Data 
or Feature
Notes
Progress invoices
Currently, QBO doesn’t support turning an estimate into a 
series of invoices as a project progresses. QBO converts 
progress invoices from a desktop QuickBooks company to 
invoices in QBO, but the following fields don’t convert: 
Estimate Qty, Estimate Rate, Estimate Amount, Prior 
Quantity, Prior Average Quantity, Prior Average Rate, Prior 
Amount, Prior %, Curr %, and Total %.
Preprinted forms and 
mailing labels
QBO doesn’t print on Intuit preprinted sales forms and 
doesn’t print mailing labels, but it does print checks to Intuit 
vouchers and 1099s to preprinted 1099 forms.
To do notes
QBO doesn’t convert QuickBooks desktop to do notes and 
doesn’t contain a comparable feature.
Customer, vendor, 
and job types
QBO doesn’t convert customer, vendor, or job types and has 
no corresponding feature to categorize customers, ven-
dors, or jobs.
Online bill payment
QBO converts accounts you use for online bill payment, but 
no online bill payment service is available in QBO. QBO con-
verts checks marked “To be Sent” in desktop QuickBooks, 
but not their payment status.
Tax support
QBO doesn’t convert or support tax line assignments and 
doesn’t export information to Turbo Tax or other tax prepa-
ration programs.
Fax invoices
QBO contains no feature to fax invoices, but you can 
email invoices.

About the Author
Elaine Marmel is President of Marmel Enterprises, LLC., an organization that 
specializes in technical writing and software training. Elaine has an MBA from 
Cornell University and has worked on projects to build financial management sys-
tems for New York City and Washington, D.C., training more than 600 employees 
to use these systems. This prior experience provided the foundation for Marmel 
Enterprises, LLC., to help small businesses implement computerized accounting 
systems.
Elaine spends most of her time writing: She has authored and co-authored more 
than 90 books about software products, including Windows, QuickBooks, Quicken 
for Windows, Quicken for DOS, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word 
for Windows, Word for the Mac, 1-2-3 for Windows, and Lotus Notes. From 1994 
to 2006, she was also the contributing editor for the monthly publications Inside 
Peachtree for Windows, Inside QuickBooks, and Inside Timeslips.
Elaine left her native Chicago for the warmer climes of Arizona (by way of Cincin-
nati, OH; Jerusalem, Israel; Ithaca, NY; Washington, D.C., and Tampa, FL) where 
she basks in the sun with her PC and her dog, Jack, and cross-stitches.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Because a book is not just the work of the author, I’d like to acknowledge and 
thank all the folks who made this book possible. Thanks to Katie Mohr for the 
opportunity to write this book. Thank you, Le’Darien Diaz, for once again being a 
technical editor extraordinaire, for easing my way as I worked with QBO and 
QBOA, for ensuring that I “told no lies,” and for offering valuable suggestions 
along the way. Last, but certainly not least, thank you, Scott and Maureen Tullis, 
for the outstanding job you did to guarantee that my manuscript was understand-
able and to manage everything involved in producing this book; you did a great job 
and really made my life easy. You make a fabulous team together, T-Squared.
