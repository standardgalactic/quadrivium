A Frequency Dictionary of 
Arabic 
A Frequency Dictionary of Arabic is an invaluable tool for all learners of Arabic, providing 
a list of the 5,000 most frequently used words in Modern Standard Arabjc (MSA) as well 
as several of the most widely spoken Arabic dialects. 
- • 
Based on a 30-million-word corpus of Arabic which includes written and spoken 
material from the entire Arab world, this dictionary provides the user with detailed 
information for each of the 5,000 entries, including English equivalents, a sample sentence, 
its English translation, usage statistics, an indication of genre variation, and usage 
distribution over several major Arabic dialects. 
Users can access the top 5,000 words either through the main frequency listing or 
through an alphabetical index arranged by Arabic roots. Throughout the frequency listing 
there are thematically-organized lists of the top words from a variety of key topics such as 
sports, weather, clothing, and family terms. 
An engaging and highly useful resource, A Frequency Dictionary of Arabic will enable 
students of all levels to get the most out of their study of modern Arabic vocabulary.

Series preface 
Frequency information has a central role to play in learning a language. Nation (1990) 
showed that the 4,000-5,000 most frequent words account for up to 95 percent of 
a written text and the 1,000 most frequent words account for 85 percent of speech. 
Although Nation's results were only for English, they do provide clear evidence that, 
when employing frequency as a general guide for vocabulary learning, it is. possible to 
acquire a lexicon which will serve a learner well most of the time. There are two caveats 
to bear in mind here. First, counting words is not as straightforwarg as it might seem. 
Gardner (2007) highlights the problems that multiple word meanings, the presence of 
multiword items, and grouping words into families or lemmas, have on counting and 
analyzing words. Second, frequency data contained in frequency dictionaries should never 
act as the only information source to guide a learner. Frequency information is nonetheless 
a very good starting point, and one which may produce rapid benefits. It therefore seems 
rational to prioritize learning the words that you are likely to hear and read most often. 
That is the philosophy behind this series of dictionaries. 
Lists of words and their frequencies have long been available for teachers and learners 
of language. For example, Thorndike (1921, 1932) and Thorndike and Lorge (1944) 
produced word frequency books with counts of word occurrences in texts used in the 
education of American children. Michael West's General Service List of English Words (1953) 
was primarily aimed at foreign learners of English. More recently, with the aid of efficient 
computer software and very large bodies of language data (called corpora), researchers 
have been able to provide more sophisticated frequency counts from both written text and 
transcribed speech. One important feature of the resulting frequencies presented in this 
series is that they are derived from recently collected language data. The earlier lists for 
English included samples from, for example, Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Defoe's 
Robinson Crusoe, thus they could no longer represent present-day language in any sense. 
Frequency data derived from a large representative corpus of a language brings students 
closer to language as it is used in real life as opposed to textbook language (which often 
distorts the frequencies of features in a language, see Ljung, 1990). The information in 
these dictionaries is presented in a number of formats to allow users to access the data in 
different ways. So, if you would prefer not to simply drill down through the word frequency 
list, but would rather focus on verbs for example, the part of speech index will allow you to 
focus on just the most frequent verbs. Given that verbs typically account for 20 percent 
of all words in a language, this may be a good strategy. Also, a focus on function words 
may be equally rewarding - 60 percent of speech in English is composed of a mere 50 
function words. The series also provides information of use to the language teacher. The 
idea that frequency information may have a role to play in syllabus design is not new 
(see, for example, Sinclair and Renouf, 1988). However, to date it has been difficult for 
those teaching languages other than English to use frequency information in syllabus 
design because of a lack of data. 

viii 
Series preface 
Frequency information should not be studied to the exclusion of other contextual 
and situational knowledge about language use and we may even doubt the validity of 
frequency information derived from large corpora. It is interesting to note that Alderson 
(2007) found that corpus frequencies may not match a native speaker's intuition about 
estimates of word frequency and that a set of estimates of word frequencies collected from 
language experts varied widely. Thus corpus-derived frequencies are still the best current 
estimate of a word's importance that a learner will come across. Around the time of the 
construction of the first machine-readable corpora, Halliday (1971 : 344) stated that "a 
rough indication of frequencies is often just what is needed'~ Our aim in this series is to 
provide as accurate as possible estimates of word frequencies.

Introduction 
A frequency dictionary of Arabic 
Enrollments in university-level Arabic language 
programs in the United States have more than 
doubled in the past decade and in many cases rival 
enrollments in what used to be considered more 
commonly taught languages like German. High 
school Arabic programs are starting in almost every 
state. There is no question that the study of Arabic 
has become increasingly popular and widespread. 
Because this change has happened so quickly, the 
field of Arabic language teaching has been working 
hard to provide high quality materials and resources. 
This book is a contribution to that effort. 
What is the value of a frequency dictionary for 
Arabic language teachers and learners? Isn't it 
enough to rely on the vocabulary lists in course text 
books and on regular dictionaries? The short answer 
is that although text books provide vocabulary in 
each chapter, there is almost never any indication 
of which of these words the student is most likely 
to encounter in actual conversations or texts. For 
independent learners the situation is even more 
frustrating. They may pick up a work of fiction or 
a newspaper and begin to work through the text 
looking up unfamiliar words in a dictionary. But they 
often have an uncomfortable suspicion that their 
time could be maximized if they could begin with 
the most common words in Arabic, using them as a 
core vocabulary on which more extensive reading 
could be based. Finally, frequency dictionaries can be 
a valuable tool for language teachers and materials 
developers. It is often the case that students enter 
into an intermediate language course with deficiencies 
in terms of their vocabulary. In these cases the 
teacher often feels frustrated because there doesn't 
seem to be any systematic way to bri ng less advanced 
students up to speed. With a frequency dictionary, 
however, the teacher could assign students to work 
through the list to fill in the gaps in their vocabulary 
in a way that makes most effective use of their time. 
And when they develop materials for their students, 
the frequency dictionary can be a guide to the 
difficulty and usefulness of any proposed text or 
exercise that involves vocabulary. 
Arabic is reputed to have a remarkably rich 
vocabulary. Various statistical techniques have been 
devised to test this, all of which bave major problems, 
but most scholars of Arabic still agree that Arabic 
seems to value the maintenance in the system of 
large numbers of synonyms, and that the overall 
vocabulary of the language is relatively large. This, in 
addition to the fact that Arabic has far fewer cognate 
forms for English speaking learners than most 
European languages do, makes the above-mentioned 
arguments for the value of a frequency dictionary 
even more salient in the Arabic case. The vocabulary 
acquisition task for students is both more extensive 
and more difficult, making techniques to maximize 
time spent learning vocabulary all the more important. 
As stated, the purpose of this book is to prepare 
students of Arabic for the words they are most likely 
to encounter in the real world. In the case of Arabic, 
this brings up the issue not only of how frequently 
words are used, but what variety of Arabic those 
words come from. Students often complain that 
Arabs do not speak the way they do "in the textbook:' 
Today one could add that when Arabs communicate 
by email or post messages on forums, blogs, and 
other social media, they do so in a language that is 
not entirely Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or entirely 
dialect, but contains a mixture of both, often 
corresponding to the register, formal or informal, 
that the writer wishes to convey. It is often noted 
that even in highly formal social situations few 
educated native speakers of Arabic are able to make 
exclusively and sustained use of MSA, without 
resorting to the vocabulary, especially the function 
words, of their native dialect. Furthermore, due to 
the popularity of satellite television in the Arab 
world, many Arabs are now exposed daily to speakers 
of dialects other than their own, thereby increasing 
their comprehension of the more frequently occurring 
vocabulary items of these dialects. Therefore, one 
of the purposes of this book is to identify those

Currently available frequency dictionaries of 
literature is undisputed, and it is certain that MSA 
Arabic are seriously outdated and are based on 
wi ll continue to occupy the center of most Arabic 
corpora that are considered very small by today's 
language curricula. In response to this sociolinguistic 
standards. The following is a brief summary and 
reality, this dictionary takes into account the current 
description of previous frequency dictionaries of 
usage status of both MSA and the dialects, and 
Arabic, in order of publication: 
attempts to provide an accurate record of the 
frequency of vocabulary used in both varieties. 
What is in this dictionary? 
The principal part of this book is the frequency 
dictionary proper, that is, the list of 5,000 most 
frequently used Arabic lemmas, as determined by 
the process described below. This information is 
arranged in four different formats: (i) a main frequency 
listing, which lists the lemmas (with their associated 
information) in order of descending frequency; (ii) 
an alphabetical index of these words; (iii) a frequency 
listing of the words organized by part of speech; and 
(iv) thematic lists, or "call-out" boxes, listing groupings 
of these words into related semantic classes. 
For pedagogical reasons we have chosen to use 
the traditional system of arranging entries by root, 
which highlights important aspects of Arabic 
derivational morphology that play an important role 
in vocabulary development. 
Each of the entries in the )Tlain listing contains 
the word itself (its headword or citation form), its 
part(s) of speech (verb: noun~adjective, etc.), a 
sample sentence or context -reflecting actual usage, 
an English translation of that context, and summary 
statistical information about the usage of that word. 
The dictionary is focused on Single words, so the 
treatment of collocations and multiword expressions 
falls outside its scope. 
Previous frequency dictionaries of Arabic 
Previously published frequency counts of Arabic have 
focused exclusively on the formal written language, 
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and have ignored 
spoken and dialectal Arabic. To be fair, these 
Brill's (1940) The Basic Ward List afthe Arabic 
Daily Press, was based on a corpus of 136,000 
words from the newspapers of Egypt and 
Palestine in the late 1930s; 
Aqil's (1953) al-Mufradat al-Asasiyyyah lil-Qira'ah 
al-Ibtida'iyyah (Basic vocabulary for elementary 
reading) was based on a corpus of 180,000 words 
taken from 18 elementary-level school readers 
used in six Arab countries; 
Landau's (1959) A Word Count of Modern Arabic 
Prose, incorporated Brill's frequency count of 
newspaper prose, and added a frequency count 
obtained from a comparable corpus of 136,000 
words consisting of essays and learned prose; 
Abduh's (1979) al-Mufradat al-Sha'i'ah fi al-
Lughah al-Arabiyyah (Frequently used Arabic 
vocabulary) included the surveys of Brill, Aqil, 
and Landau, to which he added the results of a 
survey he made earlier (1955 -1957) of 255,000 
words from Jordanian newspapers and 
elementary school readers; 
Fromm's (1982) Hiiufigkeitsworterbuch der 
modern en arabischen Zeitungspache (Frequency 
dictionary of modern newspaper Arabic), was 
based on a corpus of 79,561 words derived 
mainly from the editorial content of the leading 
government newspaper of Egypt, Syria, 
and Iraq; 
Kouloughli's (1991) Lexique fondamental de 
/'arabe standard moderne was based on a corpus 
of 200,000 words taken from newspapers and 
magazines from all parts of the Arab world, and 
includes extracts from plays and short stories of 
modern writers. 

In addition the above publications, there are two 
surveys that focused exclusively on Arabic verb 
frequencies: 
Bobzin's (1980) "Zur Haufigkeit von Verben in 
Neuhocharabischen;' Zeitschrift fUr arabische 
Linguistik (5:35-69) computed the frequencies 
of 43,543 verbs occuring in literature, cultural 
magazines, and scholarly publications in seven 
Arab countries; 
Bobzin's (1983) "On the Frequency of Verbs 
in Modern Newspaper Arabic," al-Abhath 
(31:45 -63) surveyed 21,055 verb tokens from 
twelve different newspapers published from 
Baghdad to Algiers. 
Of the above frequency dictionaries only Kouloughli 
(1991) is currently in print. 5ince the 1990s 
considerable progress has been made in corpus-based 
computational linguistics, making it possible to survey 
much larger amounts of data. In fact, computational 
corpus-based lexicography of MSA was introduced 
some years ago by lexicographers van Mol (2001) 
and Hoogland, Versteegh, and Woidich (2003), but 
corpus-based lexical statistics has not received adequate 
attention. In the meantime, the amount of Arabic 
data published on the Web has increased dramatically. 
Because this new electronic medium provides great 
freedom for self-expression, published material today 
covers not only MSA but also various forms of written 
Arabic dialect that are undergoing a process of 
orthographic standardization though widespread use. 
In order to identify the most frequent 5,000 lexical 
items of Arabic one must develop a balanced corpus 
that includes not only the familiar MSA of newswire 
reports, newspaper editorials, academic and scientific 
publications, short stories, novels and other works of 
literature, but also the informal written Arabic and 
dialectal Arabic that abounds today on Internet 
discussion forums and the personal websites of social 
media. A frequency dictionary of Arabic would not 
be complete without a statistical survey of the daily 
spoken language as well, most of which is also in 
dialect. We addressed all these issues in selecting the 
corpus we would use for this frequency dictionary. 
The corpus 
Our dictionary was compiled from a corpus of 
30 million words of which 10 percent was made up 
Introduction 3 
of spontaneous (unscripted) speech data, consisting 
mostly of informal conversations between individuals 
from the same country or region in the Arab world. 
These conversations were conducted primarily in a 
single dialect, although in some cases there was some 
use of simplified MSA when the register or tone of 
the conversations was more formal. The dialects and 
dialect groups represented in this collection were 
Egyptian, Levantine, Iraqi, Gulf and Algerian. 
The remaining 90 percent of the corpus came from 
written sources, divided into five different text or 
genre types of equal size, i.e. about 5.4 million words 
each: (i) daily newswire,. (ii) newspaper editorials, 
opinion essays, regular columns; (iii) learned prose, 
consisting mostly of articles in academic and 
scientific journals, including "Islamic guidance" 
essays, and popular but formal magazines and 
publications; (iv) postings on Internet discussion 
forums; and (v) literature and fiction, made up of 
short stories, novels, and plays. Several aspects of 
the written corpus are worth pointing out: 
With the exception of the literature section, each 
of the five text types contained material originating 
from all regions of the Arabic-speaking world, from 
Morocco to Oman, and from Syria to Yemen, from 
a total of 90 different sources. Practically all of the 
texts were published in 2006-2007, with the 
exception of some academic, scientific and popular 
publications from the late 1990s, and some well-
known works of fiction from the 1950s. 
The daily newswire section of the corpus was 
obtained from the official news agency of each 
country, and was supplemented by front page 
(headline) news items from one of the leading 
newspapers in the same country. In order to avoid 
duplicate news items we limited selections to 
different years: e.g. 2006 for the country's official 
news agency, and 2007 for headline news from the 
leading newspaper of that country. The corpus 
section of newspaper editorials, opinion essays, and 
regular columns came primarily from long-standing 
and well-known newspapers of major Arab capital 
cities, as well as the leading pan-Arab newspapers in 
London and Paris. Samples of academic, scientific, 
religious, and popular formal writing was obtained 
primarily from weekly magazines and monthly journals, 
although in-depth articles from newspaper publications, 
especially from the "Friday supplement," were also 
found to fit in well with this genre or text type. 

4 Introduction 
The corpus section containing postings on Internet 
discussion forums was our primary source for samples 
of informal written Arabic as well as written dialect. 
The discussion forums are dominated by the interests 
of youth culture (e.g. sports, technology, videos, 
music, and pop stars) and the concerns of women 
(e.g. child rearing, marital relations, soap operas, and 
cooking), and have become an important venue for 
obtaining religious guidance and medical advice, and 
for discussing personal and family issues. Although 
many of these topics have received coverage over 
the years in newspapers and magazines, in the forums 
they are covered more informally, directly, and 
personally. The language of the forums is unedited, 
unevenly censored, and often quickly produced. It 
abounds in first and second person discourse, and 
imperative verb forms, and proved to be an excellent 
source for the written forms of vocabulary associated 
primarily with spoken colloquial Arabic. In fact, many 
of the most frequent words in the spoken corpus 
also appeared in the forums section of the corpus, 
often with considerable orthographic variation. 
Recording this orthographic variation is an important 
part of the lexicographic description of these words. 
The literature section of the corpus contained a 
solid core of works by recognized authors such as 
Naguib Mahfouz, Tawfiq ai-Hakim, Ali Salim, Edwar 
al-Kharrat, Tayeb Salih, Ghassan Kanafani, Elias 
Khoury, Khalil Gibran, Ahlam Mosteghanemi, Tahar 
Ouettar, Najwa Barakat, as well as authors of more 
recent fame such as Rajaa Alsanea and Alaa AI 
Aswany. Supplementary works of fiction, especially 
short stories and poems, were obtained from the 
literary section of magazines and newspapers. 
The first four sections of the written corpus (i.e. 
newswire, editorials, learned prose, and forums) were 
subdivided into document units of 200,000 words 
each, so that we had a tota1 of 27 documents of 
equal size in each of these four sections (200,000 x 
27 = 5.4 million words). The literature section of the 
corpus consisted of 72 documents of varying sizes, 
and the spoken corpus consisted of eleven 
subsections, also of varying sizes. 
Annotating the data from the corpus 
The first step in annotating the data was to generate 
a frequency count of all surface forms (i.e. Arabic 
words as they are actually written, with prefixes and 
suffixes) taking into account not only the raw 
frequency of these surface forms but also their 
distribution over the corpus. This was done in two 
separate processes, one for the written corpus and 
one for the spoken corpus. The purpose of this was 
to determine the optimum number of unique 
surface forms or types to analyze, disambiguate in 
context, and tag for lemmatization. We determined 
that we would begin by processing the top 20,000 
word forms of the written corpus, after which we 
would examine the yield of disambiguated and 
tagged lemmas to determine if a larger selection of 
word forms was necessary. We used a similar approach 
with the spoken corpus, in which we tagged the 
most frequent 10,000 word forms, and then assessed 
the results in terms of lemmas covered. As it turned 
out, the combination of both processes yielded some 
9,900 unique lemmas, with sufficient statistical 
evidence to identify with confidence the top 5,000 
lemmas for this frequency dictionary. Lemmas at the 
very end of the frequency ranking display absolute 
frequency figures of around 200 occurrences, with a 
distribution over 50 percent of the corpus. 
The top 20,000 word forms of the written 
corpus were processed using the Buckwalter (2004) 
morphological analyzer in order to assign one or 
more possible lemma tags to each word form, as 
well as to identify all prefixes and suffixes that would 
be listed in the frequency dictionary. The 
disambiguation and final tagging of each word form 
was done in an online interactive concordance and 
annotation tool developed at BYU and customized 
for this task. The core idea of the tool was that by 
allowing the annotator to sort all the concordance 
lines related to a single word form, either by the 
word before or the word after the word form, large 
numbers of similar items could quickly be coded at 
the same time, saving hundreds of hours of coding 
time. In this tool, the annotator selected from a 
menu of possible morphological analyses, applied 
the selection to the appropriate lines in the 
concordance, then clicked on a button to store that 
selection in a database. In other words, the process 
of disambiguation and tagging of the written corpus 
involved the examination of 20,000 individual 
concordance lines. The same process was followed 
for tagging the 10,000 most frequent word forms in 
the spoken corpus. Items for which no acceptable 
morphological analysis was available were tagged for 
separate processing. Much of the dialectal data, both 

spoken and written, required manual analysis and 
tagging before storing the results in the database. 
Organizing and categorizing the data 
For determining the lemma status of words and for 
the general organization of lemmas we were guided 
by the content and arrangement of entries in the 
leading comprehensive dictionaries of MsA, namely 
Wehr (1985), Kropfitsch (1996), and Hoogland, 
Versteegh, and Woidich (2003), although some 
differences among these were duly noted. For guidance 
in integrating dialectal lemmas within the larger 
predominantly MsA lexicon we followed Bergman 
(2005) for Algerian, Hinds and Badawi (1986) for 
Egyptian, Woodhead and Beene (1967) for Iraqi, and 
Qafisheh (1997) and Holes (2001) for Gulf Arabic. 
In addition to making use of standard part of 
speech labels such as "noun" and "adjective," we also 
used the sub-categories "verbal noun" as well as 
"active participle" and "passive participle" when it 
was felt that the lexicographic description warranted 
such distinctions. Active and passive participles were 
lemmatized with their adjectival counterparts, rather 
than counted as instances of the corresponding verb 
lemma. (A few exceptions were made for dialectal 
active participles that had no adjectival counterpart). 
However, these lexical items were labeled as active or 
passive participles in order to differentiate them 
from adjectival uses of the same lemma, in cases 
where this usage was attested. It was also observed 
that in many cases, items that carry the primary 
label "adjective" could also function syntactically as 
nouns. When such behavior was noted in the corpus 
data, it was also noted in the description, including 
any attested inflectional properties. It is important to 
note that the plural forms listed in this frequency 
dictionary, both regular and irregular ("broken"), are 
only those that were attested in the analyzed and 
tagged corpus. Similarly, dialectal labels within MsA 
lexical entries were applied only when such usage 
was attested in the data. 
The morphology analysis and tagging process 
provided detailed statistics on bound morphemes. 
We have included in this dictionary only those 
bound morphemes that are traditionally listed in 
Arabic lexicons, such as the definite article 01-, the 
conjunctions wo- and (0-, the prepositions bi-, li-, and 
ko-, etc. These bound morphemes as listed along 
with all the other entries in the alphabetical index. 
Introduction S 
Although suffixes are normally not listed in Arabic 
dictionaries, we decided that the dialectal negative 
marker -sh was sufficiently important for inclusion. 
Frequency, range, and adjusted frequency 
("Selecting the top 5,000 words") 
Obtaining the raw or absolute frequency of each 
lemma was a fairly straightforward computational 
process. However, for selecting the most frequent 
5,000 lemmas we needed to compute an adjusted 
frequency figure that took into consideration the 
dispersion characteri~tis:s.of ea,cQ lemma, that is, 
how each lemma was dl;tributed over the different 
sections and document units of the entire corpus. A 
dispersion figure of 1.00 meant a perfect distribution 
over all sections of the corpus. We identified 191 
corpus sections, of which 108 were of regular and 
equal size (200,000 words each from the first four 
sections of the written corpus: i.e. newswire, editorials, 
learned prose, and forums) and 83 sections of uneven 
size (from the literature and spoken corpus data), 
and adjustments were made to account for the 
relative size differences. The final adjusted frequency 
was obtained by multiplying the raw frequency by 
the dispersion figure. For example, the dialectal word 
<>1c5 had a raw frequency of 8,928, but because its 
usage was restricted to 54.28 percent of the corpus, 
its adjusted frequency was 4,846 (8,928 x 0.5428), 
which placed it in rank position 768. Notice the raw 
frequency and range count (distribution) of the 
lemmas ranked directly before and after <>1c5 (Table 1). 
Because the spoken corpus accounted for only 
10 percent of the data, much of the high-frequency 
vocabulary of spoken colloquial Arabic did not make 
it into the top 5,000 list. Those words that did make 
it, however, were dialect vocabulary items that are 
now also widely used in written media, and were 
observed to have relatively high frequencies and 
good distribution especially in the "forums" section 
of the corpus. In order to "rescue" some of these 
high-frequency dialect words that are primarily 
spoken, but not written, we experimented briefly 
with adding weights to the spoken corpus. However, 
it quickly became obvious that this process actually 
"promoted" many more MsA words that it did dialect 
words. Also, a comparison of the lists of words "lost" 
and words "gained" showed that there was nothing 
intrinsically "spoken" about the MsA words in 
the words "gained" list.

The main frequency index 
The main frequency index presents a rank-order 
listing of the top 5,000 lemmas in Arabic, from the 
highest-scoring lemma to the lowest-scoring one. 
Each entry contains the following information: 
rank frequency (1, 2, 3, ... ), headword, part(s) 
of speech, English glosses (including any 
additional part of speech tags and relevant 
dialect labels), sample sentence or context, 
English translation of sample sentence or 
context, range count (dispersion), raw frequency 
total, indication of register variation 
For example, here is the entry for the word .i;i~. 
3495 .a:i ~ n. pI. ~')I.:; spoon; (also Egy.Lev.) .iJ:~ 
~I.:.r cY')\....!->~ e '-:"' y5 J -?l!J1 '-:"' .r; 
~ 
0J~J -
She drinks tea from a cup 
with three spoonfuls of sugar and without 
milk 
41 1873 I +for 
This entry shows that the word in rank position 
3495 is .i;i~, which is glossed as "spoon," and that 
its plural form is ~_')I.:; (and by listing the plural we 
also imply that it was attested In the corpus). The 
entry goes on to say that in Egyptian and Levantine 
data the interesting variant form .;1:~ occurred. An 
Arabic sentence from the corpus illustrates usage 
of the word-in this case the plural form-and is 
followed by an English translation. The last line in 
the entry presents the range count figure of 41, 
meaning that usage of this word was distributed 
over 41 percent of the corpus; the raw frequency 
figure of 873, which is the total number of occurrences 
for the singular and plural forms combined; and the 
"genre bias" tag +for, which indicates that a significant 
majority of uses were attested in the "forums" 
section of the corpus. (Although we have computed 
the individual raw frequencies of all inflected forms, 
providing these additional statistical details in the 
current presentation format was not feasible). 
The part of speech 
Verbs were labeled with a part of speech code 
accompanied by the traditional Roman numeral 
designation for the derived form measures, namely 
I through X for triliteral roots, and QI and QII for 
quadrilateral roots. (Quadriliterals of form III and IV 
were not attested in the corpus). The part of speech 
tags of triliteral form I verbs also make note of the 
stem vowel of the Imperfect. All verbal nouns were 
lemmatized and counted separately from their 
respective verbs, and are often listed with thei r 
corresponding nominalized forms. The distinction 
between noun and verbal noun was made explicit 
primarily when the data provided ready evidence of 
the noun's inflection for number, which was also 
noted in the entry. Gender labels were provided for 
unmarked feminine nouns (e.g. '-:"'? fem.n.) as well 
as masculine nouns with feminine suffixes (e.g. 
~ 
masc.n.). Collective nouns were labeled as such 
(e.g. JJJ coll.n.) and their unit nouns were also 
identified (e.g. ;jJJ u.n.), provided that they had 
been attested in the corpus. 
The English gloss 
The English glosses are not comprehensive, but 
attempt to capture the most important or frequent 
meanings of the lemma. (In the alphabetical index, 
the glosses were further reduced to what could fit 
on one line of text). When concordance data showed 
a specific high-frequency collocation or idiomatic 
use whose meaning might not be deduced from the 
meaning of the lemma in isolation, an attempt was 
made to include the collocation and its gloss within 
the entry. Dialectal use was also noted in the English 

gloss field, as well as any relevant pronunciation 
information. 
Dialect information 
Dialect labels were applied to lemmas that were 
exclusively dialectal, as well as lemmas that were 
primarily MSA but also manifested certain dialect-
influenced uses that showed up in the data. 
Sometimes it was simply a frequent dialectal or 
regional spelling, like .)~ (and .)~) for the verb .)\5, 
multiple pronunciations and spelling variations of 
what can essentially be considered the same word 
(e.g.r-'" Ihuml "they," which in the various dialects 
can be pronounced Ihumma/,/hummel and Iham/, 
and written V, V>, and ..f), or specific dialectal 
meanings, such as J-:&-, ("life") which is "bread" 
in Egyptian, and "rice" in Gulf dialects. We applied 
dialectal labels only to describe what was observed 
and attested in the corpus. 
Phrase in context and translation 
The sample sentences and usage contexts came from 
the corpus itself It should also be noted that for the 
sake of authenticity some common inconsistencies 
in Arabic spelling regarding the use of hamza, 
particularly, and yaa' without the two dots at the 
end of words, were left unchanged in the examples. 
These sample sentences also reflect real-world usage 
and certain ideological biases, and may not always 
be factual or politically correct. Their use in this

specific to informal on-line written discourse (e.g. 
,;~, !l1.?-, !I.J~' ~.?-, and 4L!..;1) as well as 
the computer-oriented vocabulary of Arab Internet 
citizens (e.g. bl.;, ~ , .j1>-, jj, and ~!) 
Thematic vocabulary ("call-out boxes") 
Some 30 tables of thematically-related words have 
been placed throughout the frequency index. Some 
of these tables include lists of words related to 
specific semantic classes, such as food, clothing, 
sports, colors, nationalities, and professions. Other 
tables focus more on gl4mmati~-a1 aspects of Arabic, 
such as the derivational morphology system of base 
and augmented verbs, or the vocabulary of the 
regional varieties or different dialects of Arabic. In 
order to be more complete, some of these tables list 
vocabulary beyond the set of 5,000 described in the 
frequency index. Finally, although proper names are 
often excluded from frequency dictionaries, names 
in Arabic are especially challenging for the learner 
because of the absence of capitalization in Arabic, 
and because many names are also used as common 
nouns and adjectives. Our tables show, for example, 
that the most frequent female given name is • J'" j 
("flower"). Although names were not included in 
the list of top 5,000 lemmas, we obtained their 
individual frequencies and separate ranking in the 
process of disambiguating and tagging the data used 
for selecting the top 5,000 lemmas. 
dictionary does not imply any editorial endorsement 
Alphabetical and part of speech indexes 
of the ideas conveyed in these examples. 
The alphabetical index lists all 5,000 lemmas 
Statistical and register information 
The last line of each entry contains two numbers 
separated by a vertical bar. The number on the left 
is the range count or dispersion figure discussed 
above. The number on the right is the raw frequency 
total of all the variant and inflected forms of the 
lemma represented by this entry. Some entries will 
contain additional register variation codes which 
record the observed "genre bias" of the lemma. 
These codes indicate whether the lemma occurred 
primarily in spoken data (+spo), in newspaper 
material (+news), in literature (+Iit), or in informal 
written Arabic, i.e. the postings on Internet forums 
(+for). Note that by definition, data marked as +spo 
is almost all dialectal. Data marked as +for, however, 
contains a good balance of written dialect (e.g. 
.)\..!s., ,-15, ...,.aJl>-, ~.;\:, and J~) and MSA that is 
alphabetically according to the root system that is 
followed in most dictionaries and which facilitates 
internalizing the root and pattern morphology 
system of Arabic. The entries in the index are 
considerably abbreviated in order to fit on one line 
of text. Each entry provides the headword citation 
form, the part of speech, a basic English gloss, and 
the lemma's score (rank frequency) in the dictionary. 
The full description of the lemma can be found by 
looking up the rank frequency number in the main 
frequency listing. 
The part of speech index provides two sections: 
one listing Function words (conjunctions, 
interjections, interrogatives, numbers, particles, 
prepositions, and pronouns) and the other listing 
Lexical words (adjectives, adverbs, elatives, nouns, 
and verbs). Each part of speech category is listed in 
descending rank frequency order.
